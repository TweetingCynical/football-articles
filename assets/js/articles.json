      "Rio Ferdinand has called on Ruben Amorim to place his trust in Kobbie Mainoo despite his respect for Adam Wharton. Manchester United could strengthen their midfield before the transfer deadline and have been linked with Crystal Palace's Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Belaba this summer.",
      "It's understood that Wharton would cost at least £60m while Brighton are demanding more than £100m for Belaba. Nevertheless, according to Ferdinand, United also possess the solution in the form of Mainoo, who remained on the bench during Sunday's home loss to Arsenal.",
      "The ex-United defender is a massive admirer of Wharton but reckons the club can save cash by maximising the potential of Mainoo, who was utilised in various roles last season. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ferdinand said: \"He [Wharton] would have been one of the midfielders on my hitlist. Yes, we've been talking about Belaba; he's been the hot topic for the last month or so.",
      "\"Before that, Adam Wharton was one of the guys. Listen, he's the nearest to a Michael Carrick type. He's a controller who plays forward from that deeper line position.",
      "\"I watched him against a couple of the bigger teams like Liverpool and Man City, and he was unfazed. He's ready for a big occasion and enjoys pressure. I love him, I think he's a fantastic footballer.",
      "\"But we've got Kobbie Mainoo. He can do that role, he can control a game and play deep. Playing two central midfielders, Kobbie Mainoo can play that role, given the opportunity. You can play through someone like him, you can get out of tight situations and open the game up.",
      "\"He might just have to be a patient young man at the moment, for the team to find its way, for the manager to then put the trust in him to go and play. If it was me, if I was playing two in the midfield, Kobbie Mainoo would be one of my two.",
      "\"I think he's a super talent who can handle the ball as well as anyone at Man United at present. I would give him that responsibility.\"",
      "After a stunning breakthrough 2023/24 season, when he shone for both United and England, Mainoo suffered an injury-hit campaign. Speaking earlier this year, Amorim revealed he would seek to establish a consistent role for Mainoo.",
      "The United boss explained: \"We are really happy to have more options and an option like Kobbie Mainoo, with the quality that he has - he has played as a 6, as an 8 and as a 10 - we are really pleased to have Kobbie Mainoo but we have to be careful, we need Kobbie Mainoo fit and fresh.",
      "\"In England, sometimes they play with three defenders also, was more or less the same position. So he can play, we need to help him and find a little bit like Casemiro, [who] is playing better because we understand better the way Casemiro can play.",
      "\"And I think we can do that with Kobbie because he has a lot of qualities. He is really good on the ball but also near the opponent's box. We will try to manage all that and find the right space for a player like Kobbie.\"",

      "Manchester United are still weighing up the possibility of signing a central midfielder in the remainder of the summer transfer window after moving on from Carlos Baleba.",
      "United have spent £200million on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer and are now trying to offload unwanted players. They are trying to sell Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund to open up the possibility of more additions.",
      "While bolstering their attack was the priority for Ruben Amorim this summer, there are other areas that he would also like to strengthen. One of them is at the base of midfield, where Casemiro started in the opening Premier League game of the season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "United had asked Brighton about the possibility of signing Baleba, but have been put off by their £120m asking price. The 21-year-old Cameroon international is under contract with Brighton until June 2028 and Moises Caicedo’s £115m price tag in a sale to Chelsea two years ago has set a precedent on the south coast.",
      "Amorim hasn’t completely given up on signing a No.6 though, with The Athletic naming Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton as alternatives that are being considered. Having already spent over £200m, United have to think about whether making another major signing is viable with profit and sustainability rules to consider.",
      "Hjulmand is extremely well known to Amorim, who worked with the Sporting Lisbon captain during his time with the club. The 26-year-old is reportedly available for around £50m, two years after signing from Lecce for just £15m. He played 65 times under Amorim’s management at Sporting, winning two Primeira Liga titles and the Taca de Portugal.",
      "Wharton has caught the eye for Crystal Palace, but the club will be reluctant to sell, given Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze are already in talks to join Liverpool and Tottenham respectively. The 21-year-old has four years left on his contract with Palace and has admirers at other Premier League clubs.",
      "United have Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo as options in holding midfield and, speaking ahead of the Arsenal game, Amorim insisted he didn’t need new players. “I'm really happy with our players,” he said when asked if they would sign a midfielder.",
      "\"They are working really well, we have different players for that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players. Maybe Mason Mount is a player that I think can play in that position if we want something different. But then we are going to find out [during] the season. We have players to cope to win games in the Premier League.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler is very confident Baleba is staying, He said: \"He seems to be in a really good place, he's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player. I didn't see any big changes and he's an option to start tomorrow. Very very very confident [he will stay], that's just my belief.\"",

      "The Premier League returned at the weekend – and with it so did the VAR controversy. Six teams picked up maximum points on the opening day, including Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, who narrowly overcame Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "But it was the video assistant referee that has dominated the headlines once again, with a number of contentious decisions sparking debate online. Arguably the biggest talking point came during Chelsea's opener against Crystal Palace, which saw Eberechi Eze's free-kick ruled out for contravening one of the little-known rules of the game.",
      "Elsewhere, Everton's James Tarkowski was adjudged to have handled the ball in the box during their Monday Night Football clash against Leeds, much to the anger of manager David Moyes. VAR backed up referee Chris Kavanagh's decision before Lukas Nmecha converted from the spot on debut to hand his side a 1-0 win.",
      "Everton defender Tarkowski was penalised on Monday evening after a goal-bound shot from Leeds' Anton Stach appeared to hit his elbow in the box before thumping away for a corner. The referee pointed to the spot while the Toffees' skipper pleaded his innocence, and the on-field decision was confirmed by VAR.",
      "This error ended up costing Everton the match as they would lose 1-0, and manager Moyes fumed after the full-time whistle, stating: \"I think it's a really poor decision. VAR had a chance to undo it. They tried to say he was leaning to the ball. Surely you're allowed to lean with your hands by your sides!\"",
      "Neville's colleague, Jamie Carragher, agreed, adding: \"I think it is. I think he [Tarkowski] knows what he is doing. It is something I would do. Has he lost his bearings? It is a split-second decision. I think it is definitely a penalty.\"",
      "One of the most talked-about decisions saw Eze's stunning free-kick ruled out by VAR. Eze struck a venomous effort from outside the box that was too powerful for Robert Sanchez and appeared to have given Palace a shock lead at Stamford Bridge early in the first-half.",
      "However, the celebrations were quickly halted as the goal was checked. The goal was subsequently ruled out to the incredulity of the Palace fans, with one of their players deemed to have stood too close to the Chelsea wall.",
      "Referee Darren England announced to the crowd: \"After review, away number six [Marc Guehi] is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.\"",
      "Guehi was deemed to have been encroaching on Chelsea's free-kick wall - Moises Caicedo in particular - as per law 13 of the International Football Association Board. This law states: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1m (1 yard) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\"",
      "The match between finished 0-0, and viewers were quick to jump on social media to share their disdain at the early decision. One wrote: \"Just to be clear, that Eze freekick shouldn't have been ruled out. I would have lost my mind if we had a goal chopped off for that.\"",
      "Another said: \"If we had scored a freekick like Eze’s today and it was ruled out for the same reason my head would be on mars,\" and a third added: \"Palace were well and truly robbed earlier that Eze freekick should've stood.\"",
      "However, despite the uproar, according to the laws of the game the correct decision was made by VAR.",
      "In the first game of the new campaign on Friday night, reigning champions Liverpool took on Bournemouth at Anfield. Early in the first half, Cherries defender Marcos Senesi appeared to have handled the ball near the halfway line, after initially attempting to control it with his thigh.",
      "Without this intervention, Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike looked to be away through on goal unchallenged, leading to a barrage of comments online criticising what seemed to be a huge miss from VAR.",
      "One wrote: \"PGMOL an absolute laughing stock just 13 minutes into the new Premier League season as a blatant handball and red card ignored by VAR, despite the whole world watching Bournemouth’s Senesi deliberately deny Ekitike and Liverpool a chance to score.\"",
      "Another said: \"That was a clear handball by Senesi,\" while a third noted: \"How did senesi not get booked for that handball tho?\"",
      "However, the decision was checked by VAR at the time, and the Premier League Match Centre X account cleared up the confusion for social media users via a tweet posted minutes after the incident. It read: \"The referee’s call of no red card to Senesi was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed not to be a clear handball offence nor denial of a goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO), due to the distance from goal.\"",
      "In the same game, the Cherries were denied a chance to equalise on the stroke of half-time with the scoreline still a 1-0. When a ball was floated into the box towards Senesi, he headed it back across the area into the path of an onrushing Alex Scott.",
      "However, Alexis Mac Allister challenged for the ball and the pair ended up in a heap on the ground, with Bournemouth fans screaming for a spot kick. It is unclear whether the alleged foul was checked by VAR, but supporters were up in arms about the moment on social media immediately.",
      "Alongside a clip of the incident, one wrote: \"Penalty against Liverpool in the first half? Didn’t get a replay or even a mention of it at half time…\" Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett also believed Bournemouth should have been awarded a penalty.",
      "He said: \"Bournemouth had a real strong shout for a penalty kick when Alexis Mac Allister came in and clattered Alex Scott. It was a careless challenge, and as such, it is a foul. This should have resulted in a penalty kick to Bournemouth.\"",
      "However, nothing was given and Liverpool went on to win the game 4-2, despite a spirited Bournemouth fightback.",
      "In Aston Villa's goalless draw with Newcastle, Ezri Konsa left his team with 10 men for a good majority of the second half due to his foul denying an \"obvious goal scoring opportunity\". In the 66th minute of the game, a ball was clipped into makeshift striker Anthony Gordon, who was through on goal.",
      "However, Konsa pulled the England international back just beyond the halfway line, and received a red card for his troubles by referee Craig Pawson - which was then checked by VAR and confirmed.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre updated viewers on the decision, as they wrote: \"The referee’s call of red card to Konsa for the denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO) was checked and confirmed by VAR.\"",
      "Fans were less irritated by this decision, with many agreeing that the referee and his video assistant on the sidelines had made the correct decision. One wrote: \"Hard to argue against the earlier Aston Villa red card.\"",
      "But despite having a man advantage for the best part of half an hour at Villa Park, the Magpies failed to capitalise and the two sides played out a 0-0 draw.",
      "Some Manchester United fans felt hard done by after their 1-0 defeat by Arsenal following an incident involving William Salbia and Matheus Cunha right at the death. In the final minute of normal time, the ball was crossed into the Portuguese midfielder when Saliba appeared to go through the back of Matheus, with footage showing the Frenchman's left foot connecting with his opponent's.",
      "Cunha went down but United's appeals for a penalty were waved away by Simon Hooper who allowed play to continue, before VAR concluded that it did not warrant a penalty.",
      "Regardless, the decision wasn't given on the field or by VAR and Arsenal held on to secure all three points on the opening day of the season at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand believes Manchester United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir did not take his opportunity at Arsenal. The Turkish goalkeeper started against the north Londoners at Old Trafford, after Andre Onana only recently recovering from a hamstring injury.",
      "United have been linked with a move for Italian shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma in recent weeks, but Bayindir had the perfect opportunity to prove he deserves to be Ruben Amorim's first choice goalkeeper. But was at fault for Arsenal's goal, as he allowed himself to be out-muscled by William Saliba, resulting in him getting a weak punch on Declan Rice's in-swinging corner, which Riccardo Calafiori headed in from close range.",
      "Amorim stuck up for the 27-year-old goalkeeper, stating the goal should have been disallowed as he felt Saliba had unfairly impeded him. After the result ended with the Gunners beating United 1-0, Ferdinand admitted he is unconvinced by the ex-Fenerbahce goalkeeper.",
      "Speaking on his show Rio Ferdinand Presents, the United legend said: \"What I would say is that it was a cheap goal. We gave you a goal. The keeper has got to be better. He’ll be hugely disappointed, because this was his chance.",
      "\"The manager has gone with him and backed him and he’s had, really, one thing to do in his penalty area and he didn’t pass the test. We say in the second half Raya had to come out under pressure from [Matthijs] De Ligt and he dealt with it.",
      "\"That’s the difference at the top level, one little mistake can cost you a game and the three points. He’s actually a nice guy, I’ve met him a good few times and spoke to him.",
      "\"He’s actually a hard-working guy, but in these situations it is so unforgiving. He’ll be judged hugely on this. That’s the way it is with goalkeepers. You make a mistake and it can be something that really is a little bit of your undoing at times.\"",
      "The goal was United's only mistake of the game, but it proved to be pivotal. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya was vital, making huge saves from Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while also commanding his penalty area.",
      "It proved to be the difference as the Gunners held onto their lead. However, after United's poor campaign last year, Ferdinand believes there is a lot to be optimistic about from their performance.",
      "He added: \"Outside of that mistake and that goal, I have everything to be positive about. There were so many positives compared to what I saw last season.",
      "\"You know United had 20 shots at goal against Arsenal? The last time United had 20 shots at goal against Arsenal was the 8-2 game (in 2011) at Old Trafford. That shows you.",
      "\"We didn’t score obviously, but I want chances. I prefer you to be creating chances and not scoring than actually not creating anything and looking a little bit limp up front.\"",

      "Manchester United have been given new hope of finding the funds for Gianluigi Donnarumma through returning Andre Onana to Inter Milan. The Italian side are interested in bringing the keeper back to the San Siro just two years after selling him to United, it has been claimed.",
      "Onana has had an up-and-down United career since reaching the Champions League final with Inter in 2023. He made a number of high-profile mistakes last season, though, prompting suggestions the Red Devils might look for an upgrade.",
      "The keeper has been absent from pre-season matches while working his way back to full fitness, but head coach Ruben Amorim insisted injury was not behind his decision to leave Onana out against Arsenal on Sunday. \"No (he is not injured), he’s recovered but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that,\" Amorim said after picking Altay Bayindir and naming Tom Heaton on the bench.",
      "United have been linked with a number of keepers as his replacement. The bulk of the noise concerns Gianluigi Donnarumma, who two former stars believe would be the right man for the job, while there has also been renewed interest in Aston Villa's Emi Martinez.",
      "Senne Lammens is also a target, with United and Inter both after the Belgian. However, according to The Sun, Inter are turning their attentions to Onana amid a feeling he would welcome a return to the club,",
      "If Inter do come in with a bid for Onana, it could well allow United to land Donnarumma despite interest from neighbours Manchester City. The Italian won the Champions League with Paris Saint-Germain last season but is thought to be available for as little at £26million after the French club's summer move for Lucas Chevalier.",
      "Such a move would please former United star Wayne Rooney. \"Donnarumma, I think he's 26, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it would be crazy if Man United don't go for him,\" the former striker said on his podcast. \"I don't think he's a risk. I saw a stat the other day - the errors leading direct to goals. His was zero,\"",
      "Rooney isn't the only former United player insistent on an upgrade in goal. “It’s a glaring issue at United that cannot be ignored and that is that they do need to find a goalkeeper. They have to, I’m absolutely unequivocal on that,\" former skipper Gary Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"In my 20 years at Man United we had two periods of seven or eight years with [Peter] Schmeichel and [Edwin] Van der Sar and in between we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it’s really unsettling when you don’t have a dominant No.1 who is 6ft 2in, dominant in the air and owns his six-yard box and comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves one-on-one and saves you points when your defenders make mistakes.\"",

      "Napoli have been forced to reconsider a move for Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund in the summer transfer window after Romelu Lukaku suffered an injury.",
      "Lukaku is Antonio Conte’s main option at centre-forward, but he will be unavailable for around three months after picking up a thigh injury. The Belgian striker went off injured in a pre-season friendly against Olympiakos last week and Napoli have now confirmed the extent of the problem.",
      "The defending Serie A champions could be without Lukaku until November and have therefore turned to the transfer market. Hojlund was considered earlier in the summer before Conte opted instead to sign Lorenzo Lucca from Udinese on a loan deal with an obligation to buy.",
      "The Dane is poised to leave Old Trafford this summer after Ruben Amorim left him out of the squad for their opening game of the season against Arsenal on Sunday. The arrival of Benjamin Sesko in a £74m deal from RB Leipzig has relegated Hojlund down the pecking order and United are ready to sanction his exit.",
      "Having signed him for £72m from Atalanta two years ago, they are now ready to sell for under half of that price. Hojlund has a good reputation in Italy thanks to his spell with Atalanta and AC Milan are also considering a move.",
      "However, Milan are understood to prefer Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic, who is also on the shortlist at Napoli, along with Lecce's Nikola Krstovic, Monaco's Breel Embolo and Sassuolo's Andrea Pinamonti.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund could also be in competition with his United team-mate, with Corriere dello Sport saying that Joshua Zirkzee is another option for Napoli with Crystal Palace ’s Jean-Philippe Mateta and Roma’s Artem Dovbyk.",
      "Hojlund is under contract with United until June 2028, while the club also holds the option to extend his stay by a further year. He struggled to make an impact last season, scoring just 10 goals in 52 matches and Amorim is ready to move on, with his record of 26 strikes in 95 games altogether not convincing.",
      "There are less than two weeks remaining in the transfer window, but Milan sporting director Igli Tare has confirmed their interest. “Hojlund is a good option for us,” he said. “We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.”",
      "United are also trying to offload Jadon Sancho to Roma and Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, but have been frustrated by the difficulty in doing so. They have only succeeded in sending Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona and need more exits before they can move for a midfielder or goalkeeper.",

      "Explaining his thought process, the United icon said: “The reason last year was a similar reason to this. Ten Hag last year because I knew if he started badly, he’d be under massive pressure. Similarly, there’s probably going to be no in between here.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, if he starts off badly and they’re in 13th, 14th in October, November, he’s going to be under massive pressure. He’s the Manchester United manager, he has to deliver in these first few months of the season and I think he will outperform.",
      "“I know you’re not sure about him and you sort of wrote your article the other day saying that you think he’s not that good. Well, what was your article about?”",
      "Carragher then replied: “It was about the two managers, Arteta and Amorim and how Amorim would be delighted if he was in Arteta’s position in three or four years.”",
      "United have already made a difficult start following a summer that has seen them spend over £200m. They slipped to a slender 1-0 reverse to Old Trafford on Sunday - Amorim’s 15th Premier League defeat in 28 games since his arrival at the club from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "United will be aiming to get back on track this weekend as they take on Fulham at Craven Cottage. The Red Devils then kick off their Carabao Cup campaign the following week with a showdown with Grimsby Town.",

      "The Manchester United squad is in broad agreement with Alan Shearer following the positive opening weekend display against Arsenal. One of the best displays in recent memory from United went unrewarded as an Altay Bayindir error allowed Riccardo Calafiori to head the Gunners in front early on, with United unable to convert any of their 22 attempts at goal in 1-0 loss.",
      "Although they suffered defeat, many United fans left Old Trafford feeling upbeat about the impact of new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a revitalised attack that kept Mikel Arteta’s side pegged back for long stretches. Following the game, the feeling within the squad was one of encouragement.",
      "That feeling was shared by Premier League legend Shearer, who hasn’t been afraid to stick the boot in on both United and Ruben Amorim in recent times. But speaking on the Rest is Football with Gary Lineker and Miach Richards, the Newcastle icon said: “I think for me the two standouts [were Cunha and Mbeumo].",
      "“Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "“I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.”",
      "Amorim also brought up United’s improved intensity levels as he hailed the performance, saying: “It’s more about the intensity our players play at, if they are brave, if they are talented, if they are powerful. We show a little bit more than that.",
      "“We have a lot to do and have to focus on the next one. I think also, they understand better the way we have to do it.",
      "“They are prepared to do it physically and they want to help each other. That is a very good feeling. Sometimes, you can see one guy missing one run or one pass and you feel the team is all together.”",
      "However, Shearer cautioned that United must sign a new keeper if they are to make genuine strides this season, with question marks over error-prone pair Bayindir and Andre Onana. United have been linked with PSG stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Shearer said: “I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",

      "Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher have issued their thoughts on the 2025-26 Premier League season - and have once again failed to see eye-to-eye. The new campaign got underway over the weekend, with title holders Liverpool getting off to a perfect start.",
      "Contenders Arsenal and Manchester City also secured three points on the opening day. But Chelsea stumbled against Crystal Palace despite their huge summer spend.",
      "And those results appear to have changed the minds of both Carragher and Neville, who have issued their predictions over what will happen over the next 10 months. Giving his verdict, the Man United icon has predicted Arsenal to win the league - but only just.",
      "He said: “I couldn't separate Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool. I think they're absolutely all in with an equal chance of winning it. Arsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second. I do feel they'll get there at some point.",
      "“Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.",
      "“City have an unbelievable spine. I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.”",
      "Carragher disagrees, however, and has picked Liverpool to make it back-to-back titles. He replied: “What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit.",
      "“But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower. A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers.",
      "How do you think the 2025/26 season will play out? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "“But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season. I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.”",
      "Away from the title, there is also disparity on the Champions League qualifiers. Carragher sees Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea finishing in the top four, while Neville has predicted the Red Devils to join their cross-city rivals and Liverpool.",
      "Carragher has cheekily plumped for Man United as surprise European contenders, with Neville selecting Nottingham Forest. At the other end of the table, both agree that Wolves and Burnley will slip into the Championship, albeit Carragher believes Sunderland will be relegated, with Neville suggesting Leeds will be condemned to an instant return to the second tier.",
      "Regarding individuals, both pundits selected Erling Haaland as their top scorer for the coming campaign, with Carragher highlighting Florian Wirtz and Neville suggesting Viktor Gyokeres as their impact signings.",
      "They have also backed Estevao and Adrien Truffert of Bournemouth to shine. Finally, Carragher backed Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner to be his manager to watch, while Neville unsurprisingly selected Ruben Amorim.",

      "Wayne Rooney has revealed that Sol Campbell refused to speak to him for over six months - ignoring him on England duty - as the Arsenal star felt the Manchester United icon dived for an infamous penalty.",
      "In October 2004 the Red Devils ended the Gunners' lengthy unbeaten run, which stood at 49 games. A 2-0 win at Old Trafford left a sour taste for those associated with Arsenal, none more so than Campbell, who gave away the penalty for the opening goal.",
      "It was immediately evident that Campbell was stunned by the decision and felt Rooney simulated to get his team the spot kick. When the two were expected to put differences aside on international duty the centre-half refused to do so.",
      "The Arsenal defender didn't want to engage with Rooney as the bad blood went on for months, leading to some moments of silence when the pair were with the Three Lions. The former United man though insists there was contact and he didn't dive.",
      "He said on The Wayne Rooney Show: \"It was a big game for Arsenal. If they had won it, it was 50 games unbeaten for them. We beat them 2-0 and Campbell did not speak to me for over six months. We met up [during international duty] and Sol won't speak to me. Sometimes, I was with Sol and I'd say to him: 'Come on man, we are playing for England here'. But he wouldn't speak to me because he felt I dived. He left his leg out and I think there was a small contact.\"",
      "Campbell certainly held onto the incident and when he acknowledged Rooney's brilliance in 2017 - some 13 years after the incident - he still accused him of diving. \"What a career Wayne Rooney. A fantastic servant for England. Only one dive that annoyed me against Man Utd 49th game.\"",
      "Theirry Henry is another Arsenal icon to come out over the years and call out Rooney for his dive, which ended his side's historic run. He refused to entertain any theory other than the United legend conning the ref.",
      "He said: \"I think they were superior on the day, but it was still 0-0 and we would take a 0-0. But Rooney dived. I don't care however people say whatever, he did dive and that's how they got the penalty. When you see the replay you clearly see Sol Campbell doesn't extend his leg, he pulls it back, and Rooney was clever to get that penalty.\"",
      "Campbell would play for England for another three years after his incident with Rooney before eventually retiring in 2007. Neither Arsenal nor United would claim the title the year the Invincible's had their run ended with Chelsea claiming the title and the Gunners winning the battle for second.",

      "Gary Neville has told Marcus Rashford to concentrate on Barcelona rather than comment on Ruben Amorim’s work at Manchester United. Rashford has left behind his boyhood club to join Barca on loan for the 2025-26 season, but couldn’t help giving his take on the rebuilding job Amorim has on his hands at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford had some damning criticism for United, claiming they can’t hide behind the excuse of being a club in transition. “To start a transition you have to make a plan and stick to it,” he said last week on The Rest is Football Podcast.",
      "“This is where I speak about being realistic about what your situation is. We’ve had that many different managers, ideas and strategies in order to win that you end up in no man’s land.”",
      "“All eyes are on him. Can he do it? He had a horrible start to his United career. He didn’t want the job part way through last season.”",
      "Presenter David Jones interjected: “Do you not think because of that he gets this season, whatever happens?”",
      "“Oh no I don’t think it’ll be that easy,” responded Neville. “I think if he’s down in the bottom half of the table he’ll be under massive pressure.”",
      "Again Jones interjected, this time asking: “What about what Marcus Rashford said the other day, that Manchester United have got to come up with a plan and stick with it somewhere, haven’t they?”",
      "Neville held up his hand, waved it, and, somewhat damningly remarked: “Let’s ignore that, because I don’t want to go into Marcus Rashford comments tonight. He was there at the club for 10 years and had his opportunity to impact the club. Ruben Amorim, this year, I think will do a good job. Marcus should concentrate on Barcelona.”",
      "Continuing more broadly on Amorim’s United, and what he’d seen from their opening game of the season – the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal on Sunday – Neville offered: “Yesterday was the first time I watched that formation out on Old Trafford, where I thought ‘right, we’ve got a chance here, that worked'.",
      "“He’d got a few different players in, he’d got [Mason] Mount back, got Luke Shaw in at left centre-back, that helped and I think it was the first time, it’s a difficult, rare system, it needs specialists, but when you saw [Matheus] Cunha play, saw Mount play, saw Shaw at left centre-back - there was a balance! Casemiro looked a better player all of a sudden! Just straight away he looked a better player.”",
      "Laughing, Jamie Carragher interrupted: “It was one game!” United continue their Premier League campaign against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday.",

      "Manchester United began their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on Sunday – and while there were many new faces, the same old issues reared their head once more.",
      "Despite spending £200million on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, United failed to find the back of David Raya ’s net. Meanwhile, their issues in between the posts continued, with Altay Bayindir at the centre of a debate on Monday after his error for Riccardo Calafiori’s goal.",
      "Thankfully, there are still two weeks left of the summer transfer window for Ruben Amorim and his staff to address some of those issues. The problem for United is that they need to sell some of their unwanted players first before they can bring in more reinforcements.",
      "Unfortunately, there are many moving parts as they try to find new homes for the bomb squad players who have been exiled by Amorim. Here is the latest on those exits – and who could come in.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was conspicuous through his absence on Sunday as we got a look at United’s new-look forward line. Hojlund was left out of the squad entirely by Amorim and the club are now hoping to sell him before the window closes.",
      "They are willing to take a significant hit on the £72million they paid Atalanta a few years ago for his services. And yet things are not that simple, with AC Milan keen but not that keen. United want around £35m for the young Danish striker, but would also consider a loan at this late stage of the window.",
      "Milan, however, have Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic as their top target, although those negotiations have reached a stalemate. Everything is up in the air, as Milan sporting director Igli Tare said: “Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.”",
      "Jadon Sancho is another player United are desperate to get rid of, but his £250,000-a-week wages are proving problematic. After moves to Juventus and Fenerbahce fell through, it is now the turn of Roma to get frustrated.",
      "The Italian club are threatening to pull out of a deal for the winger, despite agreeing a loan with an obligation to buy. Fabrizio Romano has reported that Sancho has informed Roma he is exploring other options. He has reportedly said no to Besiktas, where there would be a reunion with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and the situation looks set to run until the end of the window.",
      "Meanwhile, Alejandro Garnacho also remains a United player. Chelsea are keen on the winger, but need to first sell Christopher Nkunku to Bayern Munich. The German side have failed with a loan bid for Nkunku because the Blues want a permanent deal so they can sign either Garnacho or Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has reportedly agreed terms with Manchester City and is now waiting for Ederson to move to Galatasaray. However, Bayindir’s shocker on Sunday, and Andre Onana’s general struggles at United, have raised the prospect of Donnarumma moving to a different part of Manchester.",
      "United enquired earlier in the summer about Donnarumma and Wayne Rooney believes they should try to hijack City’s move. He said on his podcast : \"Donnarumma, I think he's 26, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it would be crazy if Man United don't go for him.\"",

      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher believes Manchester United were correctly denied a penalty in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal on Sunday afternoon. Matheus Cunha tumbled inside the box following contact with William Saliba during the closing moments of the Premier League clash.",
      "Having latched onto Matthijs de Ligt's delivery in the area, the summer recruit failed to make proper contact with the ball. Saliba appeared to catch Cunha's left foot, but referee Simon Hooper chose not to punish the defender.",
      "Bothroyd then questioned why, highlighting the prospect of such a challenge being penalised elsewhere on the pitch, asking: \"How's that not a penalty? That's a guaranteed penalty. If that happens on the half-way line, that's a free-kick. Is it a free-kick on the halfway line?\"",
      "Gallagher responded: \"It wasn't on the halfway line. I don't play that game,\" prompting Bothroyd to instantly reply: \"Why not? A free-kick on the halfway line should be the same as in the box.\"",
      "After Gallagher responded: \"I agree on that. No, not a foul,\" Bothroyd snapped back: \"That's definitely a foul. He's come through the back of him. The ball was there, he came through the back of him and hit the foot that he planted. It's a penalty.\"",
      "Despite Bothroyd's insistence, Gallagher ended the discussion by stating: \"You judge what happens and at that point, I don't think it's a foul. I wouldn't give a foul [anywhere else on the pitch].\"",
      "Ex-Premier League official Keith Hackett also agreed with Hooper's original decision. Hackett told Football Insider: \"There is no doubt that the defender made contact with Cunha.",
      "\"The problem here is that the player is already falling down backwards and was searching for a penalty kick. The referee is spot on. VAR isn’t going to get involved because it’s not a clear and obvious error.",
      "\"Players often exaggerate their fall when a foul has taken place, and that exaggeration often makes the referee not give it. Saliba has made a genuine attempt for the ball, and Cunha is already on his way down. He’s not even facing the goal – why? There are lots of questions to be asked here.\"",
      "United travel to Fulham in their next Premier League game on August 31st. The Cottagers drew 1-1 away to Brighton on the weekend, with Rodrigo Muniz cancelling out Matt O'Riley's penalty in the 96th minute for the west Londoners.",

The Blues are pushing hard to take the young winger to Stamford Bridge, with United ready to cash in if the money is right. It's understood Garnacho has already agreed terms with Chelsea.",

      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",

      "The drama ignited at Old Trafford on Sunday as United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir flapped at a corner, allowing Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori a simple tap-in to put Mikel Arteta's team a goal to the good. The incident led to former professionals struggling to defend the Turkish goalkeeper, while former referee Mark Clattenburg also claimed the winner shouldn't have stood.",
      "Bayindir called for a foul following the incident due to pressure on him from Arsenal defender William Saliba. However, VAR did not feel the incident needed to be brought to the attention of referee Simon Hooper.",
      "Keys believes Arsenal got away with the goal and claimed Arteta's side often \"push boundaries\" when it comes to set-pieces. He wrote: \"Weak? Maybe a little bit. Soft? Perhaps. Could’ve done better? Of course. That’s always the case. Few leave a field of play satisfied with what they’ve done. But - Bayindir was fouled.",
      "\"We all know what Arsenal do at set-pieces. They push boundaries all the time. Sometimes they get away with it - on other occasions they don’t. They did yesterday (Sunday).",
      "\"Now I’ll explain why Saliba should’ve been penalised. I have no problem with him standing where he did. He’s entitled to do that, but the moment he blocks the keeper by turning his back to him and then backing into him - that’s a foul. Take another look at where Bayindir ends up. He’s in the back of the net with the ball. Saliba sent him there.\"",
      "While the common consensus seems to suggest that Bayindir was fouled, ex-United captain Gary Neville slammed the United goalkeeper. “It’s going to keep hurting United,\" said Neville from the commentary box.",
      "\"The goalkeeper has got to be stronger. I think he will complain that he was fouled. He’s got a player in front of him, there’s a lot of pushing and shoving going on. I just think your goalkeeper has to be stronger.",
      "\"Get that player out of the way. It’s Saliba. He’s not got his arms up, I don’t think he’s done anything wrong at all. Bayındır if anything has his arm on him. He just parries it, it goes through his hands. It’s definitely a goal. He’s just not strong enough.”",
      "Bayindir was given the nod in goal as Andre Onana missed out on Amorim's squad at Old Trafford. Defending his goalkeeper, United boss Ruben Amorim insisted Arsenal’s winner should have been disallowed.",
      "“I understand we want goals, but when you touch the goalkeeper that way, I think it’s hard. Especially to lose with a goal like this, I think it’s hard. It was a strange goal,\" he said.",
      "“When you touch the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass. But again, it's the rules. If it's allowed, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes added: “Altay was saying in the moment he goes to push the ball, he gets a touch. But we know in the Premier League they don’t give much in these type of situations, even if they had a meeting with us saying that if the players are blocking and not looking at the ball, they will whistle more.”",

      "Mikel Arteta still wants to strengthen his left wing options - but must sell before he can do more transfer business. That leaves Arsenal facing the prospect of not making any more big money moves in this window unless they start to ship players out.",
      "The Gunners have already been linked with Real Madrid superstar Rodrygo while Arteta is a huge fan of Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze but both will not move to the Emirates unless there is a big last minute shift. Tottenham are now in pole position to land Eze with negotiations ongoing as they look to seal a £60m deal - £55m plus £5m in add-ons - but Palace are determined to stand firm and drive a good deal.",
      "That is currently out of Arsenal’s reach because they have a bloated squad with all their new £200m-plus worth of arrivals but they have so far struggled to get players out of the door with the spotlight on sporting director Andrea Berta to balance the books. Leandro Trossard is most likely to go at this stage as Brentford, Aston Villa and several foreign clubs have shown interest in the versatile forward who is now further down the pecking order. First team squad members Jakub Kiwior, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Reiss Nelson did not even make the bench at Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "Teenager Max Dowman, 15, was at the game but was left out of the match day squad while Christian Norgaard had a small knock and Gabriel Jesus is recovering from a long term knee injury.",
      "Fenerbahce have shown an interest in Zinchenko who only has a year left on his contract while Porto and Stuttgart are interested in Vieira with the Gunners keen to do a permanent deal. Lokonga has also attracted interest while Kiwior is considering his options after falling down the pecking order despite an impressive finish to last season.",
      "Arsenal signed Noni Madueke from Chelsea for £52m but Gabriel Martinelli started the season at Old Trafford and there is a feeling that they would still like to bring in extra quality. But the interest in Eze did not progress because that would also block off the pathway for Ethan Nwaneri and Dowman getting first team opportunities.",
      "They must offload to do more deals in this window but if another move is to be done then a left winger would be the most likely.",

      "Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho remains among the players expected to leave Old Trafford this summer. However, offloading the winger is proving tougher than expected, though, with Sancho understood to have rejected a pair of potential exits.",
      "Sancho remains among United's highest earners, and is reluctant to take a big hit on his wages. Frustratingly for United, the clubs most interested in a move are not high on the winger's own list of preferences. Roma and Besiktas are the clubs to express an interest. The latter are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who brought Sancho to Old Trafford back in 2021 but got the sack a few short months after that.",
      "According to reports on the continent, Sancho doesn't want to move to the Turkish Super Lig at this stage of his career. He is also believed to ave told Roma he doesn't want to join them in this window. Part of the issue with Roma, it has been claimed, is the club's reluctance to match Sancho's £250,00 wages. However, he is also said to be unconvinced by the prospect of a move to Italy.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, who had an obligation to sign the winger if they finished high enough in the league. They were able to pay United £5m to escape that obligation, though, and the former Borussia Dortmund star is now back at Old Trafford.",
      "He was left out of the matchday squad for the Premier League opener at Arsenal and has not been assigned a squad number for the 2025-26 season. The number 25 shirt, which he wore for his last United appearance in the 2024 Community Shield, now belongs to Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Sancho isn't the only United fringe player being linked with a move away. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia have also been sidelined by head coach Ruben Amorim, while Rasmus Hojlund was left out on Sunday despite featuring in pre-season.",
      "\"It is our player - we have to make choices,\" Amorim said when asked about Hojlund. \"We have players that have to stay helping the team from the outside.\"",
      "AC Milan looks like the most likely destination for the Dane, who is no longer first choice after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko. \"Hojlund is a good option for us,\" Milan sporting director Igli Tare told SportMediaset over the weekend.",

      "Manchester United and Manchester City look set to do battle in the transfer market for wantaway PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian has confirmed he is sure to leave the French capital this summer, having been frozen out.",
      "Donnarumma played a starring role for Les Parisiens as they won the Champions League last season, but after the arrival of French international Lucas Chevalier, his days in Paris seem numbered. Both the red and sky blue halves of Manchester are now supposedly interested.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are in need of a quality shot-stopper, with Altay Bayindir's flaws exposed in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal and Andre Onana making multiple mistakes last term. City, on the other hand, seemed to have found their No.1 for the future this summer in the form of James Trafford.",
      "But with Ederson set to leave, having been linked with Turkish side Galatasaray, Pep Guardiola remains interested in bringing in the 26-year-old Italian. Where Donnarumma will end up is unknown, but he has been involved in controversial transfer negotiations before, namely in 2017 when he re-signed with boyhood AC Milan, and rumours of a clause involving his brother arose.",
      "In 2017, a still-teenage Donnarumma had become AC Milan's starting goalkeeper and was considered one of the most promising shot-stoppers in Europe. With his contract up, he seemed destined to go elsewhere, with the likes of Juventus and Real Madrid waiting in the wings, but a drastic U-turn occurred.",
      "Although the player's agent, the late Mino Raiola, declared he would not re-sign at the San Siro, Donnarumma put pen to paper on a new deal until 2021, with some alleged interesting clauses insisted upon.",
      "It was reported at the time that as part of this new deal, Donnarumma's brother, Antonio, 27, who was also a goalkeeper playing for Asteras Tripolis, would have to be signed by I Rossoneri. This £1m transfer was completed just one day after the younger brother had penned his new contract.",
      "Antonio was paid roughly £850,000 annually, six times less than his younger sibling. However, AC Milan's sporting director, Massimiliano Mirabelli, made headlines for rubbishing the existence of any clause in Donnarumma's new contract.",
      "\"The first thing we had to do was to renew Gigio's contract, but I immediately had the idea of bringing in his brother Antonio too,\" he admitted in 2017.",
      "\"The technical evaluation comes first and I think Antonio can be a 12th man for Milan. He is not a postage parcel like someone said. I'm sorry for him if certain things have been written.",
      "\"Vincenzo Montella [former AC Milan manager] also endorsed this signing. I know him well and I wanted to bring the family back together. I'm proud to present the Donnarumma pair.\"",
      "Antonio, who had played for AC Milan in his youth before moving on to Genoa, outraged some fans with his arrival. However, he released a kind-hearted message eight years ago after he made a move that was subject to contrasting reports and remains somewhat of a mystery.",
      "\"I will be in the dressing room with my brother, which makes me very happy. It is a beautiful thing to be back at Milan,\" admitted Antonio, who currently plays for Serie C side Salernitana.",
      "After his deal expired, Donnarumma left for PSG in 2021 and now looks set for a new chapter. His brother, Antonio, also departed Milan four years ago, moving to Padova shortly after his sibling's exit, and ended up with his current outfit by way of Torino.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres provided something to “build on” despite drawing a blank on his full Arsenal debut. Arsenal star Bukayo Saka insists that £64m striker Gyokores has got all the hallmarks of a top quality centre forward and is already settling into his new surroundings.",
      "Gyokores, 27, did not get a single shot on target and was substituted after making his first Arsenal start in the Premier League at Manchester United.",
      "It left many fans wondering about his match sharpness and fitness and the Sweden international has only managed two weeks of full training after his protracted switch from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Gyokores represents a big gamble for the Gunners as he was prolific at Sporting but has yet to prove himself in a top league and he is now in the spotlight at Arsenal.",
      "But Saka is convinced about his new team mate’s qualities and says Gyokores will be ready for the physical challenges of the Premier League. England winger Saka said: “I was impressed with him and he battled for us. It was tough. There was a big battle up there. I thought he did well.",
      "“His performance gives us something to build on and I am sure it will help him next week. He has slotted in well and so have the other guys.”",
      "Arsenal went on a big summer spending spree as they splashed out huge money on Gyokores, bought Martin Zubimendi for £51m and Noni Madueke for £52m.",
      "They also brought in Cristhian Mosquera, Christian Norgaard - who missed the United trip with a small knock - and reserve keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga to strengthen their squad and suddenly their bench looks very strong.",

      "Saka was searingly honest about Arsenal’s failings and knows they will have to improve against Leeds on Saturday and their next away trip is to Liverpool.",
      "Saka added: “It was not a great performance. We are happy with the three points, to come away from Old Trafford with a win. We were not up to our usual standards, the basics, sloppy giveaways. Our decision making was not great and that cost us and gave United a lot of momentum. We did not get punished for it but we cannot do it every game.”",

      "The first Premier League weekend of the season has been ticked off - almost. The 2025-26 season got underway over the weekend, and there have been thrills and spills already.",
      "Defending champions Liverpool kicked off the season in style with a 4-2 win against Bournemouth at Anfield thanks to two late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah. Aston Villa and Newcastle battled to the first 0-0 of the season, while Brighton were held by Fulham.",
      "Tottenham and Manchester City opened the season with comprehensive victories against Burnley and Wolves respectively. Newly-promoted Sunderland also got off to the perfect start with a dominant win against West Ham.",
      "Controversy reigned at Stamford Bridge as Crystal Palace earned a point against Chelsea. Meanwhile, Manchester United's woes have continued with defeat against Arsenal.",
      "When Manchester City signed former AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders for £46.5m, it looked like a good deal for a player who had scored 15 goals last season and was entering his peak years.",
      "That fee however now looks to be a real bargain following one of the best Premier League debuts of recent years. The Dutchman put in a real virtuoso performance in City’s 4-0 trouncing of Wolves at Molineux. He covered basically every blade of grass, showed excellent creativity and composure. And he even had the finish to open his goalscoring account for his new club with a well-taken strike.",
      "It’s not often you see a new signing take to a brand new league with such little effort but to come away with a goal and an assist represents an excellent return for Reijnders.",
      "So often last season City lacked a real midfield presence due to Rodri’s knee injury but Reijnders appears to be just the man to replace him at the Etihad. If he can keep up those levels, then there is no reason why he can’t be a key cog in another relentless trophy-winning machine under Pep Guardiola.",
      "It is hardly the biggest headline from the weekend, but it could mark a significant improvement. On Saturday, Martin Dubravka became the first victim of a new Premier League rule. Burnley were just three minutes and 13 seconds into their top-flight campaign when Dubravka got his hands on the ball against Tottenham, before quickly losing it again.",
      "Burnley's new goalkeeper held onto the ball for longer than eight seconds and therefore conceded a corner. The rule is designed to limit time wasting, which has become a scourge of elite football. Unlike many other changes to the game, this appears like a simple and easily applied one, which hopefully will have a positive impact.",
      "Unfortunately, it can't stop the more conventional method of time wasting, which serial perpetrator David Raya demonstrated against Manchester United the following day. The Arsenal goalkeeper took an age over every goal kick or free-kick and was finally booked late on at Old Trafford. Time wasting will no doubt continue in those situations and from throw-ins, but one avenue has at least been shut down.",
      "Going into the new season, some worried whether Pep Guardiola’s motivation was waning and a few even speculated he might not have long left as Manchester City manager. Now, though, it looks as though all he heeded was some shiny new toys to play with.",
      "Some ruthless finishing sent City top with a 4-0 win at Wolves, with two of those summer signings on target. Tijjani Reijnders stole the show, but Rayan Cherki’s cameo showcased a level of creativity that could really come in handy against tougher-to-break-down opponents.",
      "Not only that, but Oscar Bobb has made an early case for the ‘like a new signing’ badge after missing the bulk of last season through injury - with Rodri still to return.",
      "Yes, it’s worth recognising that City won their first four games last season before Rodri’s injury. But winning in this manner while still waiting for the Spaniard to take his place in the side will surely worry their rivals for the title.",
      "We can be guilty of not always realising just how good a foreign player is until they play in the Premier League and it looks as if Tijjani Reijnders might be the latest example.With Kevin De Bruyne no longer part of the furniture at Man City they've bought in the Dutchman, who was an instant hit on his debut during the win at Wolves. He was on the scoresheet, as was Rayan Cherki, who could be another massive hit.",
      "City's recruitment may not have seen them land the household names, but Reijnders could yet prove to be an absolute steal having joined from AC Milan for £42.5m.There's no doubt that those on the blue side of Manchester have gone under the radar, regardless of what the pundits say. Few have tipped them to regain their Premier League crown, but that may suit them as they embark on a new era under Pep Guardiola.",
      "My biggest takeaway from the opening weekend was Granit Xhaka might just be one of the signings of the season. While falling hopelessly headfirst into the trap of making judgements after one game, Sunderland’s incredible summer spending spree - in excess of £150m - gave them the energy to beat West Ham and the belief they can stay up.",
      "At the heart of that is former Arsenal captain Xhaka who now wears the armband at the Stadium of Light and, at 32, is the experienced leader a newly-promoted club needs.",
      "When the deal was first mooted, most fans were a bit surprised. He is swapping Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap but it actually shows ambition and determination.",
      "Sunderland’s was the best win of the weekend in my eyes. We desperately need one - hopefully two - of the newly-promoted clubs to stay up. It’s ridiculous that we keep seeing three up and three straight back down. It’s bad for the league.",
      "But a rocking, loud and raucous Stadium of Light is good for the Premier League. I did tip Sunderland to go down before the season started - but I so hope they prove me wrong.",
      "Plenty of players have come and gone this summer, and big hitters like Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah remain, but if you could guarantee Liverpool supporters that one star would stay fit throughout the season then plenty are going to say Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "Redeployed at the base of midfield, the Dutchman started every game last season up until the point that the title was secured, but his red card on the final day against Crystal Palace meant that he was suspended for the opener against Bournemouth on Friday, and it showed.",
      "The Cherries were able to cut through the Liverpool midfield far too easily, and while more alterations and additions are expected in defence and attack in the remainder of the transfer window, getting Gravenberch back into his position as the midfield anchor is imperative for a Liverpool side who shipped 11 goals in six pre-season matches, including two in the Community Shield which Gravenberch missed as his partner gave birth.",
      "Liverpool will face a fiery welcome at Newcastle next Monday, and they're going to need their midfield lynchpin available.",
      "Are Arsenal going to play like this every week? If so then they will struggle to beat the big boys and finally land the title. They were hard to watch at Old Trafford. Yes they were defensively resolute but Roy Keane was right - why didn’t they look to kill off United?",
      "Martin Odegaard still looks off his best and that has to be a worry. So many counter attacks he ruined by making the wrong decision or misplacing a pass. Liverpool certainly looked defensively vulnerable but they were ruthless in attack on Friday night while Manchester City were clinical and calm in walloping Wolves.",
      "Arsenal looked sluggish and sloppy against an improved United but certainly not a title-challenging team from Old Trafford. It’s great to be good at set pieces but, my word, how long do they take over each one?",
      "Arsenal have the attacking talent to be explosive and exciting to watch but last season they were too often boring and drew too many games. If they repeat their Old Trafford performance against better teams than United then they will be doing the same again this season.",
      "So if you're an attacking player you can't be within one metre (or a yard) of a wall which has three or more defending players in it. Who knew? Well it seemed as though Marc Guehi didn't, judging by his reaction to referee Darren England when Eberechi Eze's goal was ruled out for Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.",
      "So learning a new law of the game might well be my biggest takeaway from the opening weekend. The challenge for the referees now will be to ensure that the rule is consistently applied, because surely this type of thing has happened before and not been punished?",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Incomings have taken precedence at United and they have invested more than £200m in a new front three. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, signed in time for the pre-season tour, impressed on debut against Arsenal. Cunha was voted the club's man of the match.",
      "United now have a bloated ten forwards on their books and want to jettison four of them before the September 1 transfer deadline. Rasmus Hojlund, omitted from the squad against Arsenal, may as well join the bomb squad of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia to make up a five-a-side team.",
      "United have sold poorly for several years, stretching back to Sir Alex Ferguson's time. Last year's sales topped hit £109.18m and appeared to signal a corner turned. Instead, United are being backed into a corner by clubs prepared to chance their arm.",
      "The salary structure that United are intent on reining in is one issue. Casemiro will see out an excessive four-year contract primarily due to the high wages of £350,000-a-week that United offered him in 2022. United have instructed four different intermediaries to try and sell Casemiro, to no avail.",
      "It is the same issue with Jadon Sancho, who joined the club a year before Casemiro. Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold each signed off those deals at curious times in their tenures. Woodward had already tendered his resignation after his role in the aborted Super League breakaway and had form for appeasement buys dating back to the club-record addition of Juan Mata in January 2014.",
      "Arnold was into his first summer as chief executive and had travelled to Barcelona to try and force through a deal for Frenkie de Jong. United lost their first two games of the season, the second at Brentford a generational nadir, and the panic-buy button was hit. Casemiro and Antony came in.",
      "Sancho is a particularly unique case. Chelsea paid £5m not to buy him after a subdued season-long loan. He has not played in the Premier League for United in nearly two years and he was effectively banished from the squad for a year.",
      "He took periods of leave in each of his first two seasons at United, too. The second for a lengthy three months, albeit one that coincided with the 2022 World Cup.",
      "There has been so much written and said about Sancho that some clubs flagged to United pieces where they felt the club had briefed against the player, effectively accusing United of penning hatchet jobs about Sancho.",
      "If that is deniable, what is undeniable is that the United co-owner effectively lamented the Sancho deal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe named Sancho, Casemiro, Antony, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana as players United had \"inherited\" or \"overpaid\" for in March. In an ideal world, United would have sold the quintet this summer.",
      "Industry sources believe Amorim's bullish approach has cost United money. Hojlund is the latest player to be cut loose after publicly addressing his position in the team and there was no route back for Rashford after he arranged an interview to state he was \"ready for a new challenge\". Garnacho burned his bridges by questioning his demotion for the Europa League final.",
      "Hojlund has been cast aside since he outlined his intention to stay minutes after Amorim refused to say if he would in the wake of the Dane's two-goal performance against Bournemouth in Chicago. Hojlund's resale value is harmed more by his form than his vocalizing but Chelsea are waiting it out with Garnacho to drive down the price.",
      "Some of it is beyond United's control. Tyrell Malacia, a frugal buy on the strength of how he performed against Ajax for Feyenoord, did not play a club game for 550 days due to knee problems and was substituted in four of his five starts under Amorim.",
      "The 26-year-old started five times on loan at PSV Eindhoven and is out of contract next year. There is little incentive to part with cash for a left back who has started ten games in two years and was overestimated by Erik ten Hag.",
      "Antony would have been sold had United not paid nearly double the amount Ajax were initially seeking for him in 2022. The winger excelled in La Liga and is back in the Brazil squad but United require £32.58m to avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. Realistically, no suitable and interested club will be coughing that up so a compromise is required.",
      "Chelsea are the only bidders at the stall for Garnacho after three clubs passed on him, having conducted due diligence. Garnacho is Premier League-proven and Chelsea had no pre-season schedule following their Club World Cup commitments, so there was never an urgent need to push through a move.",
      "They are not going to have their feet suddenly trampled on at the stall.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Manchester United have spent more than £200million for the third summer out of the last four but are unlikely to be done there.",
      "There are clearly two areas of the squad that could, or should, be reinforced before the 7pm deadline on September 1 but, as is often the case with United in August, the priority has to be outgoings.",
      "United have at least five players they want to jettison yet they have still not outright sold a member of their first team squad this summer. Marcus Rashford, the most high-profile departure, joined Barcelona on a season-long loan.",
      "There are at least seven deals for United to negotiate over the next 13 days:",
      "Sign a midfielder",
      "As good as Carlos Baleba might be, United making a beeline for him a few years after they rued passing on Moises Caicedo seemed rather narrow-minded. Brighton polish gems better than most clubs yet value them much more than diamonds. United do not have the headroom for a record midfield signing.",
      "But they do need a midfielder and need to get creative. Manuel Ugarte, a dubious choice to bolster the midfield last year, is still playing second fiddle to the ageing Casemiro and it feels like United have all but given up on a player Ruben Amorim coached at Sporting.",
      "Joao Palhinha would have been a smart move by United but the word is they want permanent additions and he joined Tottenham Hotspur on loan from Bayern Munich. With deadline day less than a fortnight away, United may have to compromise on that stance.",
      "Sign a goalkeeper",
      "United have been on the lookout for a 'keeper for the entire calendar year, though sources stressed a new No.1 was not a priority. There are figures at the club prepared to give Andre Onana the benefit of the doubt and Amorim likes the Cameroonian.",
      "A bigger problem than Onana is what is behind him. Altay Bayindir is not Premier League quality and demonstrated that again against Arsenal, having got away with one on the final day of last season when he spilt the ball into Morgan Rogers' path. Bayindir was bailed out by a worse error by the referee.",
      "Amorim's reaction to the mention of Tom Heaton was akin to Hogwarts pupils' horror at the mention of Lord Voldemort. That would suggest Heaton may not get a kick for the third season running at United.",
      "Amorim claimed on Sunday he is \"happy\" with the goalkeeping options. It was delivered with all the diplomacy of a scheming politician.",
      "Sell Garnacho",
      "With the exception of Rashford, the bomb squad members have predictably remained in situ into the last fortnight of the window. Clubs are prepared to wait it out and force their value down, none more so brazenly than Chelsea with Garnacho.",
      "United sources feel that Chelsea's interest in January was part of the long game. A long game that Garnacho's representatives, Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, participated in when they visited Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea are the only bidders at the table after Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Atletico Madrid passed on Garnacho. The 21-year-old's publicly puerile behaviour mounts more pressure on United to sell him.",
      "United are determined not to undervalue a player whose valuation was listed at €97.4m by the CIES Football Observatory 12 months ago. But the closer we get to the deadline the more Garnacho's value diminishes.",
      "Sell Sancho",
      "Jadon Sancho is out of contract at United in ten months and is such a tough sell Chelsea paid £5m not to sign him. He has sought refuge in Italy, a sanctuary for Premier League rejects. Yet Sancho is refusing to take a salary cut, as if he is worth the £250,000-a-week United remunerated him with four years ago.",
      "If United cannot get a fee for Sancho then they would have to consider paying him off just to get him out of the building. Amusingly, a player who was banished from the first team dressing room at Carrington and has not played a competitive match for United in two years has his own space in the new changing area at the training complex. It is in United's interests to have Sancho's name taken down.",
      "Sell Malacia",
      "Talking of tough sells: Malacia did not play a club game for 550 days, was substituted at half-time in four of his five starts last term, was loaned to the Eredivisie and PSV Eindhoven did not want to make his loan a permanent deal.",
      "Malacia, billed as a \"youngster\" by club media last year, is now 26 and his deal expires next year. United only require a few million quid to avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules yet even the cheapest addition of the Erik ten Hag era is tough to shift. You could count the number of good games Malacia had for United on one hand.",
      "Sell Antony",
      "Antony excelled in La Liga and regained his place in the Brazil squad. In different circumstances, there would be a market for him.",
      "There is not one because United yielded to Ten Hag's demands and agreed a €100m deal with Ajax for Antony three years ago. United require around £32.5m not to make a loss on Antony, under contract until 2027. Few clubs could afford that and part with it.",
      "Antony has season-long loan with obligation to buy (minus a Sancho-style loophole) written all over him.",
      "Sell Hojlund",
      "For such a candid coach, it was mystifying that Amorim skirted the issue of Rasmus Hojlund's squad omission against Arsenal. It was established months ago that United had planned to sell Hojlund and he is not the first to be bombed out by Amorim after speaking publicly about his position in the team.",
      "Italy always seemed a likely exit route after Inter Milan touched base in the summer. Hojlund could return to northern Italy but to AC. United are so prepared to cut their losses they would accept £30m.",

      "\"Andre recovered.\" The words of Ruben Amorim on Friday. Onana stayed in his purple Manchester United hoodie and tracksuit bottoms at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Onana had three team training sessions before the Arsenal fixture, an insufficient number in Amorim's eyes. So Altay Bayindir kept goal, Tom Heaton was on the bench and Dermot Mee assisted with the warm-up.",
      "Bayindir blundered, United lost and Amorim seethed at the suggestion that Heaton, 40 in April and without any playing time since February 2023, should have started ahead of him.",
      "The post-match questioning centred so heavily on the goalkeeper that it was the quickest an Amorim press conference had been wrapped up. United had performed admirably but lost because of his choice of goalkeeper. Questions on that topic were inevitable.",
      "Whenever Onana does not play, United cannot have him back between the sticks quickly enough. Bayindir did not cover himself in glory at Newcastle United in April when Onana was taken out of the firing line in the wake of his lapses in Lyon.",
      "After persistent questioning from a colleague, Amorim assured journalists he was \"happy\" with the United goalkeeper department. He can't be. Onana has had two error-strewn seasons and Bayindir is inadequate back-up.",
      "This correspondent reported in May that a goalkeeper was not considered a priority by United and they have not wavered. They have been on the lookout for one, serious enough to chance their arm with a loan offer for Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa.",
      "Midway through last season, United considered goalies to come in but not as outright number ones. A competitive understudy to Onana would be the smart move.",
      "Goalkeepers are protective of each other and Onana rates Bayindir. He is in the minority. Bayindir has conceded 21 goals in 12 United appearances. The three matches that they conceded four goals in last season - away at Tottenham, Newcastle and Brentford - came with Bayindir in goal.",
      "The standard of United's first and second-choice goalies is so low there is not an argument to rotate them. It is not even akin to Roy Carroll and Tim Howard in 2004-05, never mind David de Gea and Anders Lindegaard for the first half of the 2011-12 campaign or De Gea and Dean Henderson in 2020-21. If Onana is remotely fit, he should always start.",
      "Erik ten Hag knew it and he was the manager when Bayindir signed. He did just about anything he could to not play him, delaying Onana's release for the Africa Cup of Nations in January 2024. Bayindir's only outings under Ten Hag were against League Two Newport County and League One Barnsley in domestic cup ties.",
      "Bayindir's international situation has partly caused United to preserve the status quo. He is always picked for Turkey squads to play second fiddle, so there is not the incentive for Bayindir to get on the move and guarantee a call-up for the World Cup next year.",
      "Arguably the best 'keeper in the world is on the market now. Paris Saint-Germain want to cash in on Gianluigi Donnarumma but United are not expected to come calling for a goalie reputedly demanding £400,000-a-week. If Donnarumma ends up in Manchester, it is likely to be at City.",
      "Onana expects to stay with United more intent on recruiting a midfielder than a goalkeeper before the September 1 deadline. His hamstring injury has had an undeniable influence on the dormant state of the club's goalkeeping department.",
      "United have promising goalies on loan in the Championship and League Two. Radek Vitek, a teammate of Kobbie Mainoo's and Alejandro Garnacho's in the FA Youth Cup-winning squad in 2022, has kept two clean sheets in two games for Bristol City in the second tier.",
      "The unspoken rule at United is academy players loaned to the Championship have a decent chance of returning to the first team squad. With Heaton in his 40th year and Bayindir and Onana highly unlikely to start a fourth successive season as No.1 and No.2, Vitek is auspiciously placed for a promotion if he continues his solid start at Ashton Gate.",
      "Elyh Harrison is lower down the pyramid at Shrewsbury Town and could be lower come the campaign's conclusion. They have lost their first two matches and are one of the favourites to drop into the National League. Dean Henderson enhanced his reputation on loan at Shrewsbury in 2017-18, back when they were attempting to break into the Championship.",
      "It has been three-and-a-half years since Henderson last played for United and no good can come from dwelling on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's mismanagement of him. United are improving their development of club-trained 'keepers, so much so that Matej Kovar fetched a respectable fee of £7.7million from Bayer Leverkusen in 2023. The Czech Republic number one absconded to PSV Eindhoven last month after Ten Hag, who sanctioned his sale by United, arrived at the BayArena.",
      "Ten Hag resisted a reunion with Onana. His new goalkeeper, Mark Flekken, is Dutch and shares the same agent.",

      "Manchester United lost their opening Premier League game against Arsenal, but there were positives to take from the performance, including Matthijs de Ligt's solid display.",
      "De Ligt, Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw limited Arsenal's chances throughout and were only denied a clean sheet due to an awful goalkeeping error from Altay Bayindir at a corner.",
      "The back three's performance bodes well for the season and De Ligt, in particular, impressed as Arsenal attempted to create, winning eight duels, making six clearances, and winning five aerial duels.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli hardly had a sniff throughout the afternoon. De Ligt probably found Gyokeres on his kitchen table when he emptied his pockets when he returned home.",
      "Former England manager Glenn Hoddle worked as a pundit for Premier League Productions on Sunday and said: “There is excitement over the players he’s brought in, and they looked good, but I thought De Ligt was excellent. It was probably his best game in a United shirt, with the ball and defending.\"",
      "De Ligt was also outstanding when he played Arsenal at the Emirates in January, making important blocks and recovering from an improbable position to deny Leandro Trossard a tap-in.",
      "And when the 26-year-old spoke in pre-season, it was interesting to hear him promise there was more to come in the new campaign",
      "\"Sometimes me and other football fans forget my age,\" he said. \"And as a centre-back you’re normally in your prime at 28 or 29, so in that way, I’m still quite young. Personally, I’d love to carry on from how I was in March, April – I feel that is the level I could show and should show on a consistent basis.",
      "\"That’s my personal goal, and also to stay fit, that is really important. And then the goal with the team is to really show everybody what it is to play for United, and to get a positive vibe again around the team and the club.\"",
      "This season is important for De Ligt's future at Old Trafford. Jason Wilcox (director of football) will reportedly only make a solid assessment of a player after they have been afforded two seasons at United.",
      "That would be a logical approach because new signings should be given a season to settle into their new surroundings.",
      "De Ligt has spent 12 months in Manchester and his arrival coincided with the worst season at United for 51 years, so it was difficult for him to give the best account of himself.",
      "The good news is De Ligt made an impressive start to the new campaign against Arsenal on Sunday. Long may his that continue because United must qualify for European competition this season.",
      "Building a robust defensive foundation will be key to achieving that target, and centre-back is a strong area at United when Amorim's options are injury-free and available for selection.",
      "De Ligt, Yoro, Shaw, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are good options for the three starting positions. Shaw started on the left of the defence against Arsenal, but Martinez (currently recovering from a knee injury) and Heaven are also both best on that side.",
      "Yoro has the right side nailed down and it feels like the central role is between De Ligt and Maguire.",
      "Maguire might struggle to get back into the team if De Ligt consistently performs like he did against Arsenal.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Tuesday, August 19.",
      "United kicked off their Premier League campaign with a narrow 1–0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were named in the starting XI, while Benjamin Sesko made his debut off the bench. However, it was Riccardo Calafiori who scored the decisive goal, handing Arsenal all three points.",
      "Attention now turns back to the transfer market, with United continuing their search for reinforcements to bolster Ruben Amorim’s squad. Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is a player the head coach is understood to admire, and he’s now firmly on the club’s radar.",
      "Interest in Wharton follows reports that a move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the transfer deadline. United are said to be relaxed about the situation and open to revisiting the deal next year.",
      "Meanwhile, outgoings remain a key focus. Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Højlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia are all expected to leave the club before the window closes.",
      "Time is running out for Man United to sanction a permanent transfer for Garnacho.",
      "The Athletic report that Chelsea have shown interest, with the Argentine remaining a priority target to provide competition for Jamie Gittens on the left wing. Meanwhile, Garnacho has ruled out all options other than a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "The two clubs are reportedly in active talks to try to find a solution.",
      "Manchester United consider Zirkzee not for sale this summer, as Rasmus Hojlund is expected to leave.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says the decision was made by both the board and Amorim 'months ago.'",
      "The 24-year-old was an unused substitute in the 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in their opening game of the season.",
      "While Manchester United would prefer a permanent move for the left-back, The Athletic reports that a loan cannot be 'ruled out.'",
      "They also note that the 26-year-old has attracted interest from FC Porto, while AS Roma have 'registered an interest' in Malacia.",
      "Italian outlet Sport Italia understand that negotiations between Milan and Man United for Hojlund are 'already underway' and could 'accelerate' in the coming days.",
      "Sporting director Igli Tare confirmed their interest this week. He said: \"Hojlund is a good option for us. We are evaluating it these days, but the transfer market is unpredictable.",
      "\"We know that we have to intervene in that position and we also know that they have to be players who can give something more to this group.\"",
      "Ferdinand has called on Man United to look at Wharton.",
      "\"We’ve been talking about Baleba, he’s been the hot topic for the last month or so, but before that, Adam Wharton was one of the guys I was saying,\" he said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"He’s the nearest to a Michael Carrick type, who’s a controller, who can play, who plays forward from that deeper line position at times. He can be an eight if you need him to be and can run on at times if need be, but he’s more of a conductor and can control things.",
      "\"I watched him in a couple of games last season against big teams like Man City and Liverpool, and he looks unfazed. He looks ready for a big occasion. He enjoys pressure, can play under pressure, and the game kind of slows down when the ball is around him. I love him. I think he’s a fantastic footballer.\"",
      "Man United are reportedly set for internal discussions over whether to move for another No. 6 before the September 1 deadline.",
      "The club have opted to wait at least another year before making a push for Carlos Baleba, though The Athletic note there is strong admiration for Morten Hjulmand, who previously worked under Ruben Amorim at Sporting CP.",
      "Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton is also under consideration, but any move would need to be balanced against United’s priority of raising funds through player sales.",
      "While Baleba was seen as a 'special opportunity,' the pursuit of a new midfielder is described as 'not guaranteed.'",
      "De Gea has sensationally been linked with a return transfer to Man United two years after leaving the club.",
      "United are reportedly making 'checks' into the Spaniard of whom it is said can leave Fiorentina for a small amount. That has supposedly alerted Old Trafford chiefs, who could seek to spring a reunion amid troubles in the goalkeeping department.",
      "It has not been a priority position to strengthen for United, but now they are being linked with this stunning change of goalkeepers if De Gea were to return.",
      "\"Let’s see, hopefully they can win something and be there where they deserve.\"",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has been linked with a move but he could prove to be expensive, given Brighton's history of being tough negotiators in the past across many examples of their transfer dealings.",
      "As such, alternatives may be explored and United could do a lot worse than looking in the direction of Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller. The 24-year-old is a Germany international who helped his side win the DFB Pokal last season. His energy and calmness on the ball has been praised in the German media.",
      "Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger, who has played with Stiller at international level, said: \"I must say I am a bit of a fan of Angelo Stiller and I played against him in the Champions League. I was impressed by his calmness on the ball. He was rarely nervous and has a big future ahead of him if he stays fit.\"",
      "A £34million price tag has been suggested this summer and if that is to be the case, United could well land themselves a bargain if they choose to re-route their midfield search.",
      "The Telegraph claim Chelsea will finalise the signing of the winger once two other transfers are completed.",
      "Chelsea believe they can secure Garnacho for a bargain if they wait longer before making their move ahead of the deadline. Meanwhile, United are firm on getting a fair price for the academy graduate, valuing him higher than the £30million currently offered by their rivals.",
      "The Blues intend to step up their pursuit of Garnacho and RB Leipzig forward Xavi Simons once they complete the sales of Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson.",
      "It’s reported that the departure of one or both of the unsettled forwards could pave the way for a deal, making it likely a waiting game until that happens.",
      "Onana's former club Inter Milan are reportedly monitoring his situation at Old Trafford.",
      "According to The Sun, Inter are keen on re-signing the goalkeeper, who enjoyed great success during his previous spell in Italy.",
      "Onana, 29, remains a cult hero among Inter fans, having played a key role in their run to the 2023 Champions League final, where they were narrowly beaten by Manchester City.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has claimed that Napoli have contacted Man United over a potential loan deal for Hojlund.",
      "This comes after Romelu Lukaku sustained an injury, with the Serie A giants reportedly inquiring about the conditions of a possible loan move.",
      "TEAMtalk understands that there is renewed belief Man United will step up their interest in Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Lammens during the final two weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Man United made a loan approach for Emi Martinez earlier this summer, but a move did not materialise.",
      "TEAMtalk add that, Bayindir’s mistake may prompt United to revisit the goalkeeper market and consider Lammens as their primary alternative to Martinez. The 23-year-old shot-stopper has also attracted interest from Inter Milan, but he reportedly has signaled a preference for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Jadon Sancho has rejected an offer from AS Roma after failing to reach an agreement on personal terms.",

However, both played well in their first competitive game for the Reds with United overall putting on a much improved showing compared to what was often seen for much of last season under their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Read more here",
      "Alan Shearer believes that Manchester United's \"downfall\" this season will depend on whether Amorim signs a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes.",
      "Shearer said: \"I think for me the two standouts [Cunha and Mbeumo]. I mean Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "\"I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.",
      "\"I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",
      "Right now, United have Andre Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton on their books - but neither Amorim nor the fans seem convinced by any of their choices. Onana was periodically swapped out for Bayindir last season, and the duo conceded 58 goals in the Premier League last year.",

      "United pressed impressively, looked more creative and did not let their heads drop after Altay Bayindir's inexplicable goalkeeping error allowed Riccardo Calafiori to put the Gunners ahead. And yet a costly mistake from their keeper has cost Amorim's team once more in a game where they deserved much more.",

      "Manchester United have investigated how hundreds of supporters struggled to enter the stadium before the clash with Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "United have been criticised by fans who encountered problems at the turnstiles before the opening day fixture. The club has rolled out a new ticketing system for every supporter for 2025/26, meaning fans now enter Old Trafford using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology.",
      "All tickets are digital on a smartphone and downloaded to a device's wallet. The tickets are scanned to gain entry at the turnstiles, but mass confusion occurred before the Arsenal game when hundreds of supporters could not gain entry, and they were sent to the ticketing office by unprepared stewards.",
      "United have investigated the issue and are planning to provide additional fan-friendly assistance around Old Trafford on matchdays this season to prevent a repeat.",
      "The club introduced NFC tickets under instruction from the Premier League. United phased the introduction of the NFC tickets over the past year to help fans adapt to the change, but it appears some stewards on the turnstiles were unprepared to assist some supporters with the technology.",
      "The MEN has been told United recognises from the feedback that they must do more to make entry as smooth as possible, although the club claim the NFC system itself \"worked well\".",
      "United said flow rates were consistent with previous seasons, with 92 per cent of fans inside before kick-off, and 98 per cent of supporters by 16:35, but the supporters who were forced to endure long delays are not happy.",
      "One fan tweeted: \"Man Utd ticketing is a disgrace. Thousands of fans queuing at the ticketing office because the new NFC tickets are not working at the turnstiles! 10 minutes to kick off and massive queues everywhere.\"",

      "\"Ticket wouldn’t scan despite being downloaded exactly as instructed. And despite another fan helping her to download it again. Man on the turnstile was a useless ‘computer says no’ character and refused to let her in.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho may have been sent the clearest indication that he needs to secure a transfer away from Manchester United before the summer window closes.",
      "Garnacho has been heavily linked with a move away from United all summer and seemingly does not feature in Ruben Amorim's plans for the season ahead. The Argentina international informed United of his desire to leave the club earlier in the summer, but a transfer has yet to materialise.",
      "United did not include Garnacho in their pre-season tour of the United States, and he was not involved in the defeat to Arsenal on Sunday in the Reds' Premier League opener. A move away from Old Trafford seems increasingly likely, and there may be another reason to make the transfer happen.",
      "Argentina have named their squad for their World Cup qualifiers taking place in September, where they will take on Venezuela and Ecuador.",

      "With a World Cup looming for Argentina, which will see the country defend their crown, Garnacho will be determined to be part of the squad that travels to the United States for the tournament. For that to happen, a move away from United is almost certainly going to be needed.",
      "United have until September 1 to complete their transfer business, after which point the Reds and Garnacho would then need to wait until January for a move to be possible once again.",
      "It remains to be seen if a deal can be agreed before the deadline, but if one can it would likely boost Garnacho's hopes of starring for his country on the biggest stage next summer.",

      "It was nearly 8pm on Sunday and Ruben Amorim was only at the start of his post-match signing session outside the Stretford End tunnel.",
      "Hundreds of Manchester United supporters had waited patiently. They tend to, whatever the result and whatever the weather. Before full-time on the final day of last season, a couple of narky Mancunians asked some innocent fans why they were waiting for the lot that had just finished 15th. United are still 15th.",
      "Amorim was happier after a press conference that clocked in well at a meagre three-and-a-half minutes. He was incredulous that his choice of goalkeeper was questioned and the debrief centred so heavily on the 'keeping situation it was wrapped up quickly.",
      "Perhaps Amorim bristled at the lack of focus on United's performance. That they were better than Arsenal was undeniable and will have been reflected in any sensible piece filed from the press box in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand.",
      "United were good and easy on the eye, which may have accounted for the large phalanx of fans outside. United were a chore to watch for almost the entirety of last season, particularly in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal, once such a sanctimonious club under Arsene Wenger that performances took precedence over results, have flipped it. They are a throwback to the George Graham era and actually revel in defending leads. This was their third 1-0 win at Old Trafford under Mikel Arteta and they have all been gritty performances.",
      "Winning ugly is an essential trait for title winners. United just need to win. Sunday marked their 19th home defeat since the start of the 2023-24 season.",
      "The players and staff still embarked on their dubious full-time lap of honour. There was appreciative applause from those who remained. It was noticeable that hardly any supporters left before the game had concluded.",
      "But the bottom line is United lost with a team littered with contentious calls: the goalkeeper, the left-sided centre back, the defensive midfielder, the right winger and the number seven.",
      "Amorim seemed to settle on a more becoming balance in pre-season, with Amad on the right. He was one of two players to start all five friendlies, which made Amad's demotion to the bench such a strategic shame.",
      "Suddenly, there were seven defensive players - a goalkeeper, three centre halves, two full backs, a defensive midfielder - picked for a home game. If Arsenal were at the races, they would have won at a canter.",
      "Instead, United did almost all of the running. Aside from the winning goal, Arsenal did not create a genuine chance worthy of the Match of the Day highlights until Bukayo Saka latched onto Martin Odegaard's disguised dink in the 92nd minute.",
      "Yet they did not need to. Including the seven minutes of added time, Arsenal defended their slender advantage for 84 minutes against a team that did not start a striker.",
      "United had £182.12million worth of strikers in the stadium: one in the directors' box, one on the bench and one on the pitch for the final 25 minutes. Warming up for Arsenal with strikerless sides against Everton and Fiorentina was a gear-shift from Amorim. He refused to consider that set-up in the run-in last season, despite Rasmus Hojlund's hopelessness in front of goal.",
      "Amorim dropped Hojlund after he strolled into the mixed zone in Chicago and outlined his intention to stay. Hojlund is small-fry for Amorim after he dispensed with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, but the United head coach has cut off his nose to spite his face. United's strongest performances in pre-season were with the Dane starting up front.",
      "There was still £193.5m worth of attackers in United's front three. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo complemented one another auspiciously and their willingness to get on the ball and put opponents on the back foot is not a sight United fans are accustomed to from attacking debutants.",
      "Antony scored on a victorious debut against Arsenal three years ago. He did little else and looked one-paced and one-dimensional during a self-indulgent hour. Cunha and Mbeumo did not get on the scoresheet but their movement, fluidity and presence in attacks bodes well. Amad offered another dimension when he was summoned early into the second half.",
      "Picking Mason Mount over a more suitable starter backfired in the Europa League final for Amorim and did so again. Mount is intense and competitive but he has not played properly well in the league two years into his United career yet Amorim is still crowbarring him into the team.",
      "It is impressionable of Amorim, too. Mount gained his place against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao on the back of his two-goal cameo in the semi-final second leg. Against Everton in Atlanta, he emerged to score United's final goal of their tour and has since returned to the starting XI.",
      "Another blind spot is Altay Bayindir. United needed a new goalie this summer not to outright replace Andre Onana but to offer credible competition. Bayindir was fortunate to play for the club again after he punched thin air from Son Heung-min's corner at Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals eight months ago.",
      "\"Without VAR,\" an impassioned Amorim reminded us. \"With VAR, it's a foul.\" It wasn't.",
      "Then Amorim reminded us Bayindir was \"unbelievable\" in the FA Cup tie at Arsenal last season. He was after the superb game-changing denial of Odegaard from the penalty spot. Before that, he was constantly kicking the ball into touch.",
      "In the press conference room, Amorim eventually said he was \"happy\" with his three goalkeepers. Deep down, he can't be.",
      "Those United fans would also likely wait around outside the Stretford End for a goalkeeper signing.",

      "\"Course we have,\" Neville replied, causing Carragher and Jones to burst into laughter. \"I can't disappoint you. I've got to come back here in 10 months and try to defend this.",
      "\"So, David, we've worked out before that I've done this now for eight years and I've always had Manchester United in the top four, every year.\"",
      "In addition to United, Neville predicted Liverpool and City to finish in the top four, while Carragher backed Arne Slot's side to lift the trophy for a second successive season. He also predicted City, Arsenal, and Chelsea to finish in the top four.",
      "Meanwhile, Neville predicted Arsenal would win the league, though only by a small margin. \"I couldn't separate Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool,\" he added. \"I think they're absolutely all in with an equal chance of winning it. Arsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second.",
      "\"I do feel they'll get there at some point. Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals. City have an unbelievable spine. I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.\"",

      "Manchester United are set to sell Garnacho in the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old has been training on his own at Carrington for a month and has been frozen out of the squad.",
      "Garnacho was not involved against Arsenal for United's opening game of the season and the youngster has been left out of Argentina's squad for their World Cup qualifying fixtures against Venezuela and Ecuador next month.",
      "The United academy graduate made his Argentina debut in June 2023. Garnacho was consistently included in Argentina's squad throughout 2024, but his country has not called him up this year.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for the Manchester derby in December, but was reintegrated back into the squad, unlike Marcus Rashford, who was loaned to Aston Villa in the January window.",
      "However, there were further discipline issues with Garnacho as the season progressed.",
      "The youngster's relationship with Ruben Amorim deteriorated and he questioned his manager's decision to name him on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham in May.",
      "When speaking to journalists in the USA this summer, Amorim was asked whether it was a shame it hadn't worked out with Garnacho. He responded: \"I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",
      "\"So I think it's not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Napoli and Chelsea have been linked with a move for Garnacho. The player's representatives attended Stamford Bridge last season and Chelsea are regarded as the front runners for his signature.",

      "Manchester United's new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo gave plenty of reasons for United fans to be positive about this season, despite Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal.",
      "That is the verdict of former Liverpool midfielder and BBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy who felt the pair gave United an extra physical edge at Old Trafford compared to last season.",
      "United signed Cunha for £62.5million from Wolves, while Mbeumo arrived in a deal that could reach £71million from Brentford.",
      "The pair scored 37 goals between them last season and while neither found the net against the Gunners, their overall performance has given Murphy reason to be positive about United's prospects this season.",
      "\"They are more dynamic, more direct, more confident,\" Murphy told Match of the Day. \"Physically, they looked really good and I think a lot of that comes from having players high up the pitch, especially the two new boys (Cunha and Mbeumo) who are just high in quality.",
      "\"It is like chalk and cheese (to last season). Man United fans, I think, can actually be quite positive about this.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, when asked about where United still need to strengthen, Murphy was clear a midfielder has to be the club's top priority in the transfer market.",
      "\"Some might think a goalkeeper, but I probably think a central midfielder if you are going to play Bruno Fernandes in there,\" Murphy added.",
      "\"Someone a bit more powerful than Casemiro and Ugarte, someone who can do a bit of running for him.",

      "Manchester United lost 1-0 in their opening Premier League game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim was hoping to start the new campaign with a positive result, but Arsenal opened the scoring at Old Trafford in the 13th minute after a mistake from Altay Bayindir at a corner.",
      "Bayindir failed to properly connect with the corner and Riccardo Calafiori was gifted an easy header at the back post. United responded well and created enough chances to equalise, but a breakthrough proved elusive.",
      "Here are the talking points from the game and some moments you might have missed:",
      "Arsenal analysts were not happy",
      "Two Arsenal analysts sat together in the press box and one became particularly animated as United wrestled back control in the fixture after falling behind from a corner. There was even a moment when the Arsenal analyst reacted to a misplaced pass and lashed out at the desk in front of him.",
      "Gabriel Martinelli overhit a simple pass to Martin Odegaard on the counter-attack, much to the relief of Amorim on the sidelines, but the Arsenal analyst did not hide his frustration at the move breaking down.",
      "The pair also looked unhappy when Arsenal were dispossessed near the end of the first half. United created enough chances to be level by the interval and Arsenal were only leading due to Bayindir's shocking error.",
      "The frustration proves Arsenal were not good enough on Sunday afternoon, and they were fortunate to leave with three points.",
      "Same old story",
      "There was a melee in the box with just a few minutes to play. United were desperately trying to score an equaliser and committed bodies forward, but it just wouldn't go in for them.",
      "Benjamin Sesko turned his effort over the bar, high into the Stretford End, and Amorim responded on the touchline by placing his hands on his head. United have spent close to £200million on their attack this summer, but the same problem existed against Arsenal: they couldn't score.",
      "Having said that, United were the better side. There were signs of progress and positives to take, despite an opening day defeat.",
      "Cunha the crowd favourite",
      "Matheus Cunha made an immediate impact in the dressing room after his arrival from Wolves. The Brazilian is a huge personality and is a stereotypical fiery South American, so it always seemed likely he would become a fan favourite.",
      "And Cunha took the first steps to earning fan favourite status against Arsenal. He looked dangerous and roared at the crowd just before the hour mark after a scrappy physical battle with William Saliba.",
      "The 26-year-old won the ball near the tunnel by the Stetford End corner, fighting aggressively against Saliba. He reacted by vigorously first pumping to the crowd, who lapped it up. Cunha plays on the edge and he helped to whip up the crowd as United pushed for an equaliser.",
      "Cunha has the quality to back up his behaviour. He delivered an impressive performance on his competitive Old Trafford debut and didn't deserve to be on the losing side.",
      "What did Amorim expect?",
      "Amorim decided to play without a recognised striker against Arsenal. Sesko was ready to start the game, but he was named on the bench and Amorim's front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Cunha was fluid.",
      "Those three players took turns to play down the middle and regularly rotated positions, but the downside of that selection was seen in the first half when Diogo Dalot pulled a ball back into the box and nobody was there.",
      "Amorim was spotted shouting at Mount, who was positioned outside the box, but what did United's head coach expect? He shouldn't have been surprised to see Mount fail to think like a striker.",
      "Sesko was eventually introduced to the game in the 65th minute. The Slovenia international struggled to get into the contest, but it might have been a different story if he'd been included in the starting team.",
      "The directors' box",
      "Avram Glazer was spotted in the directors' box. The 64-year-old last made an appearance at Old Trafford for the opening game of last season against Fulham and showed his face again for the visit of Arsenal.",
      "The 1958 had planned to stage a protest against the club's ownership before facing Arsenal, but they decided to postpone the demonstration after surveying fans about whether it should go ahead.",
      "Whether that had something to do with Avram Glazer attending the game is up for debate. The American co-owner has deliberately made limited appearances in Manchester over the last few years.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was among those seated n the directors' box. The striker was dropped from the squad and is being ruthlessly shown the door by Amorim after taking huge backwards steps last season.",
      "JJ Gabriel was also seen in the directors' box against Arsenal. The youngster is just 14 years old, but there is a buzz at United about his potential and the invite to watch the game shows how highly he is regarded.",

      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has agreed with the decision to allow Arsenal's winner against Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "Riccardo Calafiori headed Declan Rice's cross into an empty net in the 13th minute after United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir failed to punch the ball away.",
      "Replays of the goal showed William Saliba in close proximity to the goalkeeper near the goal line but the goal stood. Bayindir flapped at the corner to allow Calafiori a free header, similar to one he conceded at Tottenham last season.",
      "\"It's going to keep hurting United, the goalkeeper has got to be stronger,\" Gary Neville said in his analysis of the goal. \"He'll complain that he's been fouled, there's a player in front of him, there's a lot of pushing and shoving.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper has to be stronger, get that player out the way, Saliba hasn't got his hands up, I don't think he's done anything at all. It goes through his hands, it's definitely a goal, he's just not strong enough. The delivery is sensational and they just don't deal with it.\"",
      "Roy Keane seconded Neville's verdict, insisting that Bayindir should have done much better. \"Of course (needs to be stronger). Fair play to Arsenal, it's a great delivery and they're attacking it but if you're the goalkeeper just take control of the six yard box.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"Goalkeepers and defenders complain all the time about players being in their face, you get in their face, take control of that six yard box. Complain all you want but the goalkeeper, be aggressive, it's your area, come with violence take control of it. Arsenal are very good at it but United [are] weak and soft.\"",
      "There had been calls that Bayindir was the subject of foul play from Saliba with some suggesting the goal should have been disallowed. However, Gallagher has rubbished these claims.",
      "Jay Bothroyd, who joined Gallagher on Ref Watch, said Bayindir should have gone down if he thought it was a foul. Bothroyd added: \"He hasn't been strong enough, he's caught out of position and that mistake has cost Man United the game. If he thinks it's a foul, go down, at least you've got a chance of winning a free kick. It's just poor, you need to be stronger.\"",

      "Manchester United and Manchester City are reportedly set to go head-to-head in the transfer market for PSG's unsettled goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "The Italian has already made it clear he intends to leave the French capital this summer after being frozen out. Donnarumma was a standout performer for Les Parisiens during their Champions League triumph last season, yet the signing of French international Lucas Chevalier has seemingly pushed him towards the exit.",
      "Now, both the red and blue sides of Manchester are believed to be circling. Ruben Amorim's squad urgently need a dependable presence between the posts, with Altay Bayindir's shortcomings highlighted in their narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, and Andre Onana guilty of repeated errors throughout the previous campaign.",
      "City, in contrast, looked to have secured their long-term solution earlier this summer by re-signing James Trafford. However, with Ederson tipped to depart and strongly linked with a switch to Galatasaray, Pep Guardiola is reportedly keen on recruiting the 26-year-old Italy international.",
      "Where Donnarumma will end up isn't known, but the keeper he is no stranger to dramatic transfer sagas - most notably in 2017 when he renewed at AC Milan under controversial circumstances, with speculation over a contract clause involving his brother.",
      "Back in 2017, Donnarumma was still a teenager but had already cemented his place in Milan's first team, widely regarded as one of Europe's brightest young talents. With his deal expiring, he looked set for a high-profile move, with Juventus and Real Madrid monitoring him closely, before he made a surprising U-turn.",
      "Although his agent at the time, the late Mino Raiola, publicly claimed he would not extend his stay at San Siro, Donnarumma ultimately signed fresh terms until 2021 - reportedly with unusual conditions attached.",
      "Reports suggested that as part of the agreement, Milan were required to sign Donnarumma's older brother Antonio, then a 27-year-old goalkeeper with Asteras Tripolis. That £1m deal was finalised just a day after the younger sibling committed to his new contract.",
      "Antonio earned around £850,000 annually, roughly one-sixth of Gigio's salary. Still, Milan's sporting director, Massimiliano Mirabelli, dismissed rumours of any binding clause.",
      "\"The first thing we had to do was to renew Gigio's contract, but I immediately had the idea of bringing in his brother Antonio too,\" he explained in 2017.",
      "\"The technical evaluation comes first and I think Antonio can be a 12th man for Milan. He is not a postage parcel like someone said. I'm sorry for him if certain things have been written. Vincenzo Montella [former AC Milan manager] also endorsed this signing. I know him well and I wanted to bring the family back together. I'm proud to present the Donnarumma pair.\"",
      "Antonio, who had previously been part of Milan's youth system before moving to Genoa, split opinion among supporters with his return. Yet he issued a heartfelt statement following his signing, which drew mixed reactions and still carries an air of intrigue.",
      "\"I will be in the dressing room with my brother, which makes me very happy. It is a beautiful thing to be back at Milan,\" said Antonio, who now represents Serie C outfit Salernitana.",
      "After his Milan contract expired, Donnarumma joined PSG in 2021 and is now on the verge of another move. Antonio also left the Rossoneri in 2019, transferring to Padova before later joining Torino and eventually finding his place at Salernitana.",

      "This summer, Ruben Amorim's quad was strengthened by the signings of Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko. Their Premier League season began with a narrow 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal, with Riccardo Calafiori's first-half header proving decisive.",
      "Sesko played the final 25 minutes, making his Premier League debut after coming on for Mason Mount. As he adapts to his new surroundings, there is hope that he can provide the goals United so desperately need.",
      "Off the pitch, changes can still happen regarding player departures and arrivals.",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest headlines from in and around Old Trafford.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims there is 'nothing imminent' on the goalkeeper front for United despite admiring the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Lammens.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano said: \"The situation involving Emi Martinez has gone completely quiet. But a goalkeeper they still like and are still keeping an eye on is Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp.",
      "\"Very talented goalkeeper, Belgian and United have been monitoring him for a long time. I told you about this interest in July and the beginning of August. This interest remains and if United decide from now until the end of the window to invest on a goalkeeper - Lammens is the goalkeeper they like.",
      "\"So could be a possibility. [Gianluigi] Donnarumma, they are aware of the situation but Man City are in concrete talks to sign him. So this is currently the situation for Man United but still, nothing imminent as of now.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: There is still time for the club to sign a new goalkeeper in this transfer window, especially after Altay Bayindir's performance against Arsenal. While not entirely at fault, he should have done better in clearing the ball away from Arsenal players in the box. Amorim’s decision to leave Andre Onana out could suggest that the Portuguese manager is not fully convinced by his performances in training, leaving the door open for a potential new signing between the posts.",
      "Sky Italia report that AS Roma have held positive talks with the Reds regarding Sancho.",
      "Meanwhile, Corriere dello Sport offer a different perspective, claiming that Sancho is taking 'a few more days' to decide his future. The report adds that Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini spoke to the 25-year-old, outlining how he could become a key part of the squad and replicate the form he showed during his peak years at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "It’s also noted that an agreement between United and Roma has been reached for an initial loan, with an option to buy set at €25m (£22m).",
      "MEN Sport says: Hopefully, this situation will be resolved in the coming days. With the transfer window closing in just two weeks, the clock is ticking for United to finalise any sales before the deadline. For Sancho, a fresh start could offer the chance to reignite his career, but that may require him to take a wage cut. Considering the opportunity to play regularly and rebuild his reputation, such a decision, should be an obvious one.",

      "As this business proves, Man Utd’s top summer priority was to overhaul their attack and the early signs are that Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha will make Ruben Amorim‘s side more dangerous in forward areas as each player made a positive impact against Arsenal on Sunday afternoon.",
      "However, Man Utd were still beaten 1-0 by Arsenal and there are still areas for them to strengthen before this summer window closes.",

      "20) 🔽 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Roma\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days. And Besiktas are keen but Sancho is said to be unwilling to consider Turkey until he absolutely has to, when their window remains open after the others shut. Roma, you would think, would be a very appealing option if the exiled winger is serious about kickstarting his career. But no. Despite Roma agreeing a fee with United, Sancho isn’t happy with the terms on offer. Which makes you wonder what or who the f*** he’s waiting for.",

      "19) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nNapoli have been in touch with United to ask about what they might want to let the Serie A champions borrow Hojlund with Romelu Lukaku crocked for around three months. Which might be tempting for the player but United will be holding out for a permanent move.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Andre Onana – Manchester United to Inter Milan\nThe story goes that Inter are keen to bring Onana back to the San Siro, the memory of some level of goalkeeping competency apparently still fresh enough to look past the last two seasons at Old Trafford. Yann Sommer is 37 before Christmas so it makes sense for Inter to make succession plans. But we cannot imagine them presenting anything but a loan offer. Maybe that will be enough because United simply cannot afford to continue with their present goalkeeping situation.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too. Friday night’s chaos against Bournemouth might spring them into action, mind.",
      "",
      "",
      "16) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will want big money since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs were close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million. Maybe the performance at Leeds will persuade Everton to pay up.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player has not taken it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media. Ooh, you’re hard.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Rico Lewis – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\n“I think he is going to stay. I think. He told me that. But maybe tomorrow it changes.” Lewis seems very keen to stay but if City decide they want to cash in, there’s little the academy graduate can do. The right-back started at Wolves on Saturday, though, so he’s certainly not surplus to requirements.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found.",
      "",
      "11) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National. Given Liverpool face Newcastle next Monday night, it seems most likely that something will happen after that.",

      "",
      "9) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Nkunku in as part of the deal. It is clear Chelsea need to shift some deadwood before they can sign more forwards.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nHojlund was left out of the United squad beaten by Arsenal which suggests something is afoot, most likely involving Milan. “Hojlund is a good option for us,” said their sporting director Igli Tare on Sunday. “We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.” United want around £30million; Milan would obviously prefer to pay less or take the Denmark striker on loan first.",
      "",
      "7) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed. If only there was another club in Manchester who desperately need a competent goalkeeper…",

      "6) 🔼 Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nCity say Ederson stayed in Manchester rather than travel to Wolves on Saturday because he had a dicky tummy. It was just a coincidence that it occurred around the same time an £8.6million offer arrived from Galatasaray. If City have decided they want Donnarumma, then Ederson will be off. They want double the amount offered by the Turkish but the expectation is that a compromise can be reached. Galatasaray appear to be trying to speed City along by making it known they quite fancy Diogo Costa too.",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get rid.",

      "4) 🆕 Douglas Luiz – Juventus to Nottingham Forest\nForest have seemingly only recently realised that the transfer window is open, with the former Aston Villa captain their top midfield target now their attack is sufficiently strengthened. The Brazilian has been pants in Italy but his performances for Villa are still fresh enough in the memory to believe that this could be a fine addition.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nArsenal’s faffing has given Spurs a window and the way Eze lingered in front of the travelling Palace fans on Sunday could be viewed as a possible farewell by those who really want to interpret it that way. The latest update suggests Tottenham and Palace are talking after Eze expressed a willingness to move. Spurs currently offering £55million plus £5million in add-ons.

A disjointed central midfield into which they have to shoehorn Bruno (not his best position) alongside the knackered Casemiro or the frankly really bad Ugarte.",

      "It was a very agreeable point.  What I didn’t expect is for Arsenal to win AND be the team that faced an absolute mountain of criticism.  Man U meanwhile getting plenty of plaudits for showing signs of improvement.",
      "Of course an element of this shows where the expectations stand for each side this season but come on, its been a bit over the top right?  Man U with their reshaped attack will clearly not be as toothless as they were last season and so will give most sides a damn good game at home.  Arsenal had by far the hardest opening day fixture of all the big teams and went and won ugly and got the 3 points.",
      "If you offered Liverpool, City and Chelsea that same result delivered in the same fashion they’d snap your hand off right now.  I can say with some certainty that fans of those 3 clubs (plus others) will have watched that game thinking it was a real chance for early dropped points from a potential title rival.",

Gyokeres is the most scrutinised and under pressure player in the league before a ball was kicked despite plenty of more expensive players and strikers being signed by other teams,  and every Arsenal result will be followed by a ridiculous over reaction swaying to the negative as much as possible.  I understand some sections of Arsenal fans are also prone to this boom or bust emotive responses to each result but you’d hope for more balance in the media.",
      "I find the narrative around Arsenal and Arteta strange.  There is a lot of talk about how Arsenal MUST win the title or champions league this season, despite not winning the former for 24 years and never winning the later.  Why is it only Arsenal who MUST win it – surely the same must apply to Liverpool and City in the context of a failed or successful season?  Some people say Arteta MUST be sacked if he doesn’t win it – its such a weird stance to take without applying any context (or any knowledge of how the Arsenal board traditionally treat their managers – stability overides dreaming and ambition).  What if Arteta did a Klopp and got 97 points but finished 2nd – is that worthy of the sack?",
      "Finally, those who talk about the two things above will often happily talk about the plethora of flaws in this Arsenal team.  Too reliant on set pieces, don’t score enough goals, lack creativity, don’t have a killer goalscorer, poor on transitions, play sideways football, no superstars to win games on their own, etc etc.  So a long list of reasons why Arsenal will fall short and are not as good as Liverpool or City but also they MUST win the title.  Talk about having your cake and eating it.",

      "It all began with the set-pieces\nIt’s hard to believe it is the same manager that was in charge of Arsenal in 2022/23 season. Without the early season expectation of a title challenge, Arteta masterminded some of the best attacking display in the premier league, certainly the best of his own career.",

Arsenal’s set-pieces, initially the clever aside, the unexpected dagger from the shadows, have become the entire arsenal (pun intended). What began as a complement, a glimmer of ingenuity, now stands exposed as the only idea, leaving the rest of the attack muted, meek and mechanical.",
      "And you can feel it in the players. The thrill is unmistakable — the flicker of excitement, and perhaps more worryingly, the sigh of relief, when they’ve won a corner. Watch them: the way they jostle for positions in the various needlessly elaborate routines. The training ground has become a theatre for the mastery of set-pieces, endless hours spent perfecting patterns that mask the withering of invention elsewhere. Why strain to carve an opening against opponents who are not utterly hapless, when the shortcut is so simple — a well-struck delivery to the big lads waiting in the box?",
      "And it’s not confined to the players. The set-piece coach now struts into the limelight, basking in the role of architect, eager to collect his applause for another blueprint executed to the letter.",
      "And it works — wildly so. The numbers speak for themselves, and the goals have flowed from corners and free-kicks in recent years. Yet the truth gnaws at the edges: it isn’t enough. It was never going to be.",
      "Because when the smoke clears, when the scraps are tallied, Arsenal’s reliance on dead-ball ingenuity exposes a deeper, more troubling stagnation. Their chief creator, Ødegaard, once the conductor, now looks dulled, his artistry blunted by the straightjacket of Arteta’s rigid design. What was once improvisation and daring has congealed into repetition and habit.",
      "If Arsenal are to make the final leap — from contenders to champions, from hopefuls to holders — they cannot climb there on corners alone. Arteta, too, must evolve, must rediscover the courage to let his side breathe and create in open play.",
      "If the football does not grow sharper, braver, more alive, the dream of a league title will remain just that — a dream, slipping further away with every set-piece celebrated like salvation. And the only thing truly set in stone will be the manager’s fate.\nAYK",

      "I need to do the job that the FAILING FAKE NEWS MEDIA will not do, and push back against the Trumpian stream of lies and misinformation emanating from the Cult sheep that worship at that altar of Antonio El Pulizon aka “Arteta Fanboys”. Here is a sample of the demented Trumpian lies and bullshit that the unhinged “MAKE ARTETA GREAT AGAIN” loons are flooding you with.",
      "Exhibit A: Outright lies and misinformation from Rob AFC:\n“ Arteta is on 10m not 15m”",
      "Factually incorrect. 365 literally have an article breaking down salaries, which is backed up by various sources. You’ll see clearly that Arteta is on £15.6m a year – Google AI also confirms the exact same figure of £15.6m. So the question is: why are Arsenal fans lying? 🤔",
      "Exhibit B: Demented unhinged nonsense from John Matrix AFC",
      "“ There is a reason why Chelsea, Liverpool, City, United and Spurs fans keep heaping pressure on Arteta to win, and that’s because none of those teams have beaten us in like 800 days”",
      "Yes. Nothing to do with El Pulizon being paid insane wages for failure, nothing to do with the perpetual arrogance and egotism of a delusional fanbase that continues to insert themselves and Arteta into “elite” conversation (despite having less PL pedigree than Championship Leicester over the past 20 years!) Indeed, fans of Liverpool must be incandescent with that paltry PL title, Chelsea with their club World Cup, and Citeh with their 4 PL titles in the past 5 years, whilst Arsenal and Paella Pulis have been a punchline eh! 😂. Not being able to clap back at even Newcastle and Palace in fact is shameful and a humiliation.",
      "In fact… I’m sure even the Spurs fans spend every waking hour wishing they’d beaten Arsenal in a meaningless PL fixture, instead of that European trophy they just lifted. This exposes the difference in mentalities: other clubs focus on actual trophies, Arsenal fans simply invent parallel reality trophies (“the unbeaten v Big Six” Trophy being the latest). Remember what El Fraudo said: “Arsenal have more points than any team over the last three years” their dear Leader told the sheeple. And the MAGA loons swallowed the lie. whole! Not one of them has yet been able to explain this outright lie. Weird eh?",
      "Exhibit C: pure unhinged imbecility, Tom in Leyton",
      "“ What evidence have you ever shown us your opinions on football have merit?”",
      "The most amusing Trumpian display of rank stupidity I’ve read of late. It’s Alan Partridge-esque. All that’s missing is for lil Trash-talkin Tom to sign off with “THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER” 😂",
      "Really simple one this: opinions are subjective debatable points, based on an individual’s personal worldview. Hence why eg newspapers have “opinion” sections. An individual is free to supplement that opinion with facts (eg it is my opinion that Arteta is an overpaid fraud, supplemented by evidence of a €1bn + spend, zero PLs, zero CLs, zero trophies in five years, spanked by first season Slot etc).",
      "The onus to supplement a viewpoint with hard evidence is incumbent when that point of view is presented as Fact – not an opinion 🙄🙄",
      "So, for instance, when your Dear Leader flagrantly lies in a press conference and says “Arsenal have more points than any team over the last three years”, this is a statement of Fact – and it should be backed up with hard evidence. Same as claiming “Luis Enrique told us we were the better team” – another lie, laid bare by Enrique contradicting it immediately. That factual clarification never happened because Arteta is a fraud who is telling lies to cover for his ineptitude. Utterly demented these AFC fans LOL",
      "Exhibit D: rank shameless Trumpian hypocrisy – Damola in Bremen",
      "“ We will never apologise to you for the way we play”",
      "How interesting a take this is, given the years of sanctimonious bollocks we heard from Arsenal fans about Mourinho “anti-football” and “I would never want to win playing such a brand of dour football after all the money spent”. Reminds me of when MSNBC takes a months-old clip of a Trump sycophant making excoriating statements on Biden “It’s a disgrace Biden would ever have discussions with Putin”…and then show you that exact same boot-licker hypocritically making the opposite point, months later “President Trump is a hero for hosting Putin” 😂😂😂",
      "It’s like claiming you “cannot compete with Citeh oil money” as your same fans put Liverpool as preseason title favourites. How does that square? Aaaah cognitive dissonance!",
      "I repeat: what do you call spending over €1bn to bore the living shit out of the football populace and win sod all? Least Mourinho won!",
      "On a final Trumpian note, beautiful to see the Make Arteta Great Again Mail boxers going for the Trumpian “ban whatever opinions don’t chime with my delusional worldview” approach – simply reinforcing what a hilarious, precious, hypocritical bunch of snowflakes they truly are.\nStewie Griffin (Maybe the MAGA should ban any books referencing Arne Slot turning up, spending nada and breezing their Dear Leader.

Obviously gambling ads all over the place too, because of course. I didn’t see any of Redknapp’s Skechers advertised on there, Werthers, or a Jane McDonald album, but I may have missed those.",

      "*For all that Chelsea fans were understandably excited to see their expensive new signings, they were kept relatively quiet by a Crystal Palace team that finished last season so strongly. I think it’s good that Trevoh Chalobah is still getting regularly opportunities to start for Chelsea, plenty of us feared the worst for his progress when he was recalled from his Palace loan spell last season but he’s played well, and played a big part in keeping Jean-Philippe Mateta relatively quiet this weekend.",
      "*Eberechi Eze’s free kick goal was correctly ruled out, but it was still an understandable source of frustration. Palace were correctly punished for Marc Guehi being too close to the defensive wall when the ball was struck, but all that did was highlight how often teams are not punished for the same infringement. Still, the easiest way to not be penalised for something is to not do it in the first place.",
      "*Eze and Guehi’s futures at Palace have been the subject of a lot of speculation recently, as tends to happen with standout players outside of the biggest clubs. It’s to their credit that they didn’t seem to let any of it affect their performances. At least we’ve been largely spared the use of body language experts this time. Oliver Glasner casually mentioning after the match that Eze’s release clause had expired was a fun moment, and should Arsenal miss out on signing Eze, it’ll only serve them right.",
      "*One thing Arsenal can take comfort from is something Glasner said about his signings last summer. Palace made a slow start in part because their signings took a while to get up to speed. He mainly meant this about Ismaila Sarr, but it also applies to Eddie Nketiah, appropriately enough for Arsenal. As soon as it became apparent there was interest from Palace in signing those players, they were ostracised from the first team so as not to taint the atmosphere and as a result missed a lot of preseason. It is entirely possible that Sporting took similar action with Viktor Gyokeres, which perhaps explains why he was so far below expectations against Manchester United.",
      "*Ben Doak to Bournemouth looks set to go ahead for relatively big money. Unlike Jordon Ibe or Dominic Solanke, he won’t be their record signing (never break your transfer record to sign a Liverpool player), so he should do well for them.",

      "“It feels so amazing to be back on the pitch, it feels like a dream,” he said after making a six-minute cameo in the club’s penultimate game of their promotion season.",

      "But they will not be cashing in their Ramsey receipt any time soon, although his long-awaited return might prompt them to keep tabs again.",
      "",
      "Diego Moreira\nIt seems fairly pointless for Chelsea to insert a buy-back clause into any sale they make to Strasbourg, a club with whom they share owners and have loaned or transferred ten players since summer 2023.",
      "But when Diego Moreira was shipped across to France for £1.7m he arrived safe in the knowledge Chelsea at least had an eye on his future progress. Two goals and seven assists en route to Champions League qualification did not sufficiently move them.",
      "",
      "Bobby Clark\nOne of Jurgen Klopp’s 42 children at Liverpool, the son of Lee made waves at Anfield including playing 48 minutes as a substitute in the 2024 League Cup final, before unseating Trent Alexander-Arnold as the club’s youngest European goalscorer and guaranteeing himself a future mural in the process.",
      "Liverpool were loathe to lose Clark but, as ever with transfer negotiations, ensured the situation was weighted ludicrously in their favour when the inevitable happened.",
      "As well as a £10m fee which constituted one of the highest ever paid in Austrian league history, Liverpool got Salzburg to agree to a 17.5% sell-on clause and buy-back option.",

      "Ben Gannon Doak\nLiverpool have always enjoyed chucking buy-back clauses into their player sales without it ever really seeming likely they would be triggered. But this summer feels different – at least they hope so.",
      "Perhaps Doak will follow the same path as Rhian Brewster before him in struggling under the weight of expectation and injuries. He would not even be the first Liverpool forward whose rise stops and irreversible fall starts at Bournemouth; the tale of Jordon Ibe is a warning.",
      "But Liverpool have been remarkably eager to let the world know how highly they rate a player given four starts and six sub appearances in three years at Anfield, with a decent Middlesbrough loan in between.",

      "Kambwala played ten games for Erik ten Hag through an injury crisis in 2023/24 but remained low down the centre-half pecking order and had rejected a new contract offer so the teenager was sold to Villarreal for a deal worth £9.6m, with a healthy sell-on clause and three-year buy-back option.",

      "Manchester United hold a mammoth 45% sell-on clause but also another buy-back option which lasts for three years. The forward scoring four goals in 36 appearances in his debut campaign for the Super League runners-up is unlikely to see it activated.",

      "Hannibal Mejbri\nGary Neville would absolutely like to see Hannibal lecture the Manchester United squad on the importance of kicking Liverpool players but that violent cameo ended up being the highlight of the midfielder’s 13-game Old Trafford career.",
      "It could be revisited down the line as the Red Devils this time negotiated a £9.4m fee and 50% sell-on clause to go with their now standard buy-back option. Manchester United could have a hell of a team one day if all these offloaded talents realise their potential simultaneously.",
      "",
      "Mason Greenwood\nAs the Daily Telegraph reported in July 2024:",
      "‘There is also a buy-back option in the agreement with Marseille. These are fairly routine nowadays where the sale of academy graduates or young talents are concerned but, given Greenwood’s history, the decision to include a buy-back clause could be perceived as somewhat contentious.",
      "‘Nonetheless, Telegraph Sport understands there is no expectation or intention of Greenwood coming back in the future and that, if the clause does signify the door remains ajar for the player down the line, it is very much the slimmest of cracks. The prospect of it being activated is considered very low.’",
      "A huge sell-on clause entitling Manchester United to 50% of any profit Marseille make on £26.7m signing Greenwood is far more relevant, especially if Liverpool act on their reported interest. Which they absolutely shouldn’t and won’t but still.",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid are ‘close’ to signing a Liverpool star, while Fabrizio Romano claims two more Reds stars are set to leave.",
      "Jacob Ramsey is the second-biggest Academy sale in Villa history, but Chelsea remain the kings of such sales despite letting No 1) go for free.",

      "Former Man Utd striker Cristiano Ronaldo could help the Red Devils land a huge windfall this summer if Al-Nassr sign Mason Greenwood.",
      "Man Utd will reportedly land 50 per cent of any fee Marseille bring in for Mason Greenwood this summer amid interest from Saudi Arabian clubs.",

      "Manchester United ‘can afford’ top midfield target Carlos Baleba this summer and ‘could revive a deal’ for the Brighton star despite reports claiming they’ve walked away from his possible transfer.",
      "The Red Devils have held talks over a move for Baleba via intermediaries and then directly with Brighton this month to sound them out over a deal, but with the Seagulls wanting £100m+, The Athletic’s David Ornstein revealed on Friday that United had decided not to push ahead with talks.",
      "‘Manchester United are not planning to proceed with a move for Carlos Baleba before the transfer window closes,’ he wrote.",
      "‘Moving to Old Trafford appeals to Baleba so personal terms would have presented no problem — and the Cameroon international is prepared to keep pushing, even if it means waiting until the future.",
      "‘That does not suggest he is unhappy at Brighton and the dialogue has been cordial, with United respecting their stance.’",
      "But The Standard, while offering no more information besides, claim ‘a deal could be revived’ for the 21-year-old, and football finance expert Dan Plumley insists United “can afford him if they want him”.",
      "Plumley told Football Insider: “Ultimately, and we’ve said this before with other players this summer, Man United can afford him if they want him.",
      "“They have got options to draw upon. There’s a credit facility, a revolving one that we think has been drawn down.",
      "“We’ve seen the way they’ll stagger instalments for other players that they’ve brought in as well.",
      "“In terms of general affordability, the answer is still yes. I think the interesting thing on the fee is if it is going to be £100m or in and around that figure, then it probably won’t happen this summer.",
      "“That would be the other way to look at it, because that then is a significant outlay on top of what they’ve already spent this summer.",
      "“If the fee’s gonna be that high, I think that probably means they wouldn’t look at him this summer, but if they think a deal can be done further down the line, next year seems more likely.",
      "“Can they afford him this summer? Yes, in the bigger picture, but £100m now, given where the window’s at, probably not.”",
      "Manchester United have given up on signing Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba this summer, per David Ornstein.",
      "A Manchester United legend has told the club they “can’t pay” £100million for a “kid’ they don’t know “which way he’s going to go,” but the key to the transfer ...",
      "Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has revealed he is “very confident” that Carlos Baleba will stay amid interest from Manchester United, as he revealed the “only change” the midfielder has made.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd ‘contacts are continuing on a daily basis’ with Brighton and Carlos Baleba’s agent.",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives.",
      "Man Utd have identified Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber as a potential alternative to Brighton star Carlos Baleba, according to reports."

      "And the reigning Serie A champions have held talks with Manchester United on Monday over a move for Rasmus Hojlund, who didn’t make the squad for the Red Devils’ opening day defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Romano also revealed that despite reports linking Joshua Zirkzee with an exit this summer, United want to retain him in a ‘clear plan by Amorim’.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Napoli had direct contact with Man United today following Romelu Lukaku’s injury as he’ll be out more than 3 months. Napoli asked for loan deal conditions for Rasmus Højlund. Man United want to keep Joshua Zirkzee, no talks despite links today. Clear plan by Rúben Amorim.’",
      "Ben Jacobs later confirmed that United may listen to loan moves despite wanting his permanent exit.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Manchester United want Hojlund to depart. £40m asking price, but #MUFC could yet entertain a loan under the right conditions despite the preference to sell.’",
      "Andre Onana was also left out of the squad against Arsenal, with Altay Bayindir starting and costing the Red Devils a point to pile the pressure on the goalkeeping department at Old Trafford.",
      "Pressed on Onana’s absence, Amorim confirmed after the game: “No, no he’s not injured, he’s recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.”",
      "Despite this, Romano claimed Onana’s “feeling” is that he was left out of United’s squad because he is “not at 100% form yet”.",
      "“Ruben Amorim after the game said they didn’t drop Onana. At the same time, I can tell you that the feeling of those close to Onana is that it was because Onana is still recovering from injury and is not at 100% form yet,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“And he accepted the decision. He doesn’t believe it’s to do with transfers. Also because Onana is not in any active talks with another club.",
      "“There was some interest in Saudi at the beginning of the window. He accepted the decision of Amorim but it’s another story next week.”",
      "But the Cameroon may be offered the chance of an exit according to The Sun, who claim former club Inter ‘are interested in re-signing a player who was a massive success in Italy’, whom United signed from them for £46m in the summer of 2023.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Inter chiefs believe Onana – who joined United after that defeat in Istanbul in a £47million deal – would be open-minded to a return to the San Siro.",
      "‘Inter replaced Onana with Yann Sommer who also impressed in the Italians’ run to last year’s Champions League final, in which they were smashed by Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "‘Boss Simone Inzaghe quit to join Saudi side Al Hilal after the mauling, and replacement Christian Chivu is understood to be keen to bring in a new No 1.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Andre Onana’s “feeling” on being left out of Manchester United’s squad to face Arsenal on Sunday afternoon.",
      "According to reports, Rasmus Hojlund is ‘close’ to leaving Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed a significant update on Jadon Sancho.",

      "Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game at Old Trafford, capitalising on Altay Bayindir’s flap from Declan Rice’s corner to earn Arsenal all three points on the opening day of the season.",
      "United had the better of the game in general and could have had a golden chance to equalise had William Saliba been punished for his challenge from behind on Cunha in the box, with the Arsenal defender not appearing to make any contact with the ball as the Red Devils star fell to the ground.",
      "But Hackett, a former FIFA referee and ex-PGMOL chief, insists Hooper was right not to give the spot kick.",
      "The former referee told Football Insider: “There is no doubt that the defender made contact with Cunha. The problem here is that the player is already falling down backwards and was searching for a penalty kick.",
      "“The referee is spot on. VAR isn’t going to get involved because it’s not a clear and obvious error. Players often exaggerate their fall when a foul has taken place, and that exaggeration often makes the referee not give it.",
      "“Saliba has made a genuine attempt for the ball, and Cunha is already on his way down. He’s not even facing the goal – why? There are lots of questions to be asked here.",
      "“As a fan, I can understand why Man United wanted a penalty.”",
      "Hackett was far from impressed with Hooper’s performance in general, claiming he was “inconsistent and lacked authority” in the biggest game of the first Premier League weekend of the season.",
      "He added: “I was less than satisfied with the referee’s performance. When you’ve got fouls taking place, but the referee is completely ignoring them without a signal of advantage, it opens up the question of whether he’s seen it or not.",
      "“Hooper’s approach was, ‘I’ll keep the game going. I’ll stay low-key’, but in doing so, the game at times was bubbling. The discipline of both sets of players was good so that helped him.",
      "“But, he was inconsistent and lacked authority, lacked an understanding of when to put his foot on the ball. It was an indifferent performance, and he was lucky not to have a mass confrontation.",
      "“Loose and inconsistent. I was surprised that he was appointed for this game because I know the history between these teams. As a former boss, you always put on your strongest referee, who would maintain control.",
      "“Howard Webb laid down all these rules, like grappling inside the box, and while they were both well disciplined, the inconsistency came through.",
      "“There were a couple of early reckless challenges, and he felt the need to keep his cards in his pocket. A reckless challenge in the 1st minute or the 90th minute is the same. The law expects a yellow card to be awarded.”",
      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres has been warned his career could fizzle out like Rasmus Hojlund’s by Frank Leboeuf, who feels he could become a “useless” Arsenal signing.",
      "The Swede’s Arsenal debut lasted all of 60 minutes with him making little impact on the match, causing a mass pile-on from some harsher sections of the media.",
      "But while plenty have given him the benefit of the doubt given it was only one game, Leboeuf has told Mikel Arteta to change his tactics to suit Gyokeres or risk having a Hojlund situation in his hands.",
      "“My concern is, why do you recruit a player like Gyokeres when you know that the rest of the team won’t play that way?” Leboeuf asked on ESPN. “And they won’t do what you are expecting them to do – cross the ball a little bit quicker, without turning around, like you are playing handball.”",

      "“You have a player that you need to cross the ball to as quickly as possible, and if you block it, and you make it slow, that guy is useless.",
      "“So why do you use a type of player like that? Why do you sign a player like that when, in fact, the rest of the team doesn’t understand him or his way of thinking about football?",
      "“For me, it’s useless. And I really thought, I hope he’s going to change and score goals and everything. But I thought Hojlund signed for Arsenal and played today against his former teammates. That was the way I saw Gyokeres today.",
      "“So I really hope that he’s not going to have the same path, you know, like Hojlund, and score many, many goals for the Gunners.",
      "“But today, he was nowhere near it, because it wasn’t at the same level of music as the others are playing. The others were playing a kind of sloppy but slow-motion game while he was trying to get more vertical – one ball, one opportunity, one cross. It never happened.”",
      "Trying to take the hat off his new striker, Arteta said in his post-match press conference that zero shots on target from the Swede showed a team problem, not an individual one.",
      "“He did a lot of things very good. You can tell especially in our high press and rhythm that we demand, that especially in the first half we were giving a bit too much time,” Arteta summarised.",
      "“It is something that we have to work on with him, especially there. Then in the final action situation, he did not have that many chances to do that, because in the previous action, we had to play that last ball and the last was standing still with 40 metres to play.",
      "“We did not manage to put the ball through to exploit his quality. But overall, coming away to Man United, winning your first game with Arsenal, is a good start.”",

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "19) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "18) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "12=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "12=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "12=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "12=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "10) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list."

      "Onana‘s long-term future at Man Utd is in doubt after his form fell off a cliff during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The experienced goalkeeper had a decent debut season after replacing David De Gea, but his performances dramatically declined as he was deservedly criticised for his poor form.",
      "This has fuelled speculation linking Man Utd with potential replacements, though they are yet to sign a new goalkeeper in this transfer window.",
      "Onana missed a portion of pre-season due to injury, so Alter Bayindir started in goal for Man Utd’s opening game of the 2025/26 Premier League season on Sunday as the Red Devils were beaten 1-0.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Sunderland shine, Potter sack, Man City and Chiesa click, Brentford ‘naive’",
      "It was initially assumed that Onana’s absence was due to his injury status, though head coach Ruben Amorim insisted before the match that he has “recovered”.",
      "“It’s an option. We try to choose the best players for each game. Next week is a different life and in this week we chose this way,” Amorim said on omitting Onana and Rasmus Hojlund for the Arsenal match.",
      "When pressed further on Onana’s absence, he added: “No, no he’s not injured, he’s recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.”",
      "Despite this, Romano claims Onana’s “feeling” is that he was left out of United’s squad becuase hs is “not at 100% form yet”.",
      "“Ruben Amorim after the game said they didn’t drop Onana. At the same time, I can tell you that the feeling of those close to Onana is that it was because Onana is still recovering from injury and is not at 100% form yet,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“And he accepted the decision. He doesn’t believe it’s to do with transfers. Also because Onana is not in any active talks with another club.",
      "“There was some interest in Saudi at the beginning of the window. He accepted the decision of Amorim but it’s another story next week.”",
      "Romano has also commented on two potential replacements for Onana, with a deal for one “completely quiet”.",
      "“The last bid they made was for Emi Martinez was a loan proposal in July. For the moment, that situation has gone completely quiet,” Romano added.",
      "“The goalkeeper they still like and are keeping an eye on is Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp. They’ve been monitoring him for a long time.",
      "“If Man Utd decide to invest in a goalkeeper between now and the end of the window, Lammens is the goalkeeper they like.",

      "“We’ve been talking about Baleba, he’s been the hot topic for the last month or so, but before that, Adam Wharton was one of the guys I was saying,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“He’s the nearest to a Michael Carrick type, who’s a controller, who can play, who plays forward from that deeper line position at times. He can be an eight if you need him to be and can run on at times if need be, but he’s more of a conductor and can control things.",

      "A pat on the head for Man Utd\nManchester United have sunk to the level of a slightly slow child being congratulated on writing their name properly. Let’s see how “back” Man Utd are when they’re getting turned over by Fulham, Brighton, Brentford etc.\nMatthew",
      "",
      "…So Man United are back are they? Didn’t they get more points from this fixture last season? Didn’t they turn up in games against Liverpool and City too last season?",
      "Let’s see how they go away at Fulham next week and put together an actual run of games before we start hailing them. All I saw yesterday was a lot of huff and puff against a team that seemed almost intent on giving them the ball and allowing them to come at them. Millions spent on attackers that were going to score the goals that turned these sorts of games round…and still bringing Maguire on to save something.",
      "Back indeed.\nStew, London",

      "Three key reasons Man Utd lost\nManchester United lost the match against Arsenal albeit they were arguably the better team on the day. They lost largely due to three key reasons:",
      "Concerns continue to remain unabated over Amorim’s unfathomable team selection. Why was Dalot fielded over Amad? We all saw what Amad did in the short period he played. A related issue or concern is why did Amorim field a team with no natural striker, even though the striker or rather lack of an effective striker has plagued United for some time. There is no excuse for this strategic shortcoming, exacerbated by the fact that we were playing against Arsenal. Did Arsenal bench Gyokeres? No he started. Did Liverpool bench Ekitike? Of course not.",
      "The point must further be made that United’s poor finishing persisted in the match. Numerous chances were created and washed. This now endemic issue must be fixed soonest if United is to improve its position on the EPL table.",
      "The third key issue is poor defending especially in relation to set pieces. This problem persisted throughout last season and Amorim has still not fixed it. Amorim has a serious responsibility to coach the defenders to control set pieces. There is no other way PERIOD.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",
      "",
      "In defence of Gyokeres\nSurely the worst game he could have had as his first match was against his former manager who knows him inside out and exactly how to counter him. Similarities to when Harry Kane stepped up to take that penalty against Hugo Lloris, why on earth was he going up against the goalkeeper that knows him best? That instance was manager error (anyone non-Tottenham to take it) but Viktor deserves a little slack in this instance.\nJdb",

      "…Wow, 60 minutes of PL football and a man is done eh? JFC.",
      "Ok, I want to start actually with a different gripe. Last season, us Arsenal fans were accused on this site, multiple times across different articles of being entitled whiners for having reservations about Gyokeres. Any mea culpa from F365 there? Or is having any responsibility for your opinions or consistency unnecessary?",
      "But on to the man we now have. One game is enough to call him a pub player?",
      "What is the point except to annoy us? Where is the insight or value in those ~700 words? What evidence have you ever shown us your opinions on football have merit?",

      "Ugly never felt so good\nI read this morning’s mailbox with great joy and pleasure because I’m a long time Arsenal fan that spent a lot of my youth watching Arsenal teams completely play Man Utd off the park only to lose the game (and have the excellence of those performances lost to the result and history).",
      "David De Gea once had FOURTEEN (14!) saves at The Emirates. Wayne Rooney once scored TWICE from ONE shot on target. The same player dove over Sol Campbell’s leg to win the penalty that ended Arsenal’s Invincible streak. I could go on and on about “undeserved” Man Utd victories that resulted in insults about Arsenal’s “softness”.",
      "Yesterday wasn’t quite the same sort of smash and grab, despite MAN UNITED fans whinging about the ref (never thought I’d live to see the day) because Simon Hooper gave them most of the 50-50 calls, which in turn contributed to their “dominance” of the game. I won’t speak for every Gooner, but having watched Saliba, Gabriel & Raya for a few years now, I never felt worried that Utd would score. I was only concerned that Cunha would eventually flop his way into a cheap penalty.",
      "That said, Utd fans should definitely feel encouraged by Mbuemo and Cunha (that ‘xDOG’ you love so much will cost Utd someday), as well as the coherence and effort on display. With no Europe, lots of training time, and most importantly, one match per week, I wouldn’t be surprised if they make the top 4 this season. I mean, it’s a 2 billion pound project. It’s the least they can do.",

      "…22 years we went without a result at Old Trafford. Years and years of being the better team only to be beaten by Mourinho miseryball or Ferguson and his referee coven. 22 years of misery, being told we were soft. That we couldn’t grind out results. 22 years of Roy Keane saying we weren’t smart, or hard, or good, that winning was the only thing that mattered. That we didn’t like it up them. If you told me before the match it would be absolute dog sh*t but we’d win, I’d have bitten your hand off.",
      "So cry me a river. Seeing United fans huffing their copium, saying they were the better side. Deserved the win etc. These were the mewling cries of Arsenal fans for decades and we were rightly mocked for it. There is a reason why Chelsea, Liverpool, City, United and Spurs fans keep heaping pressure on Arteta to win, and that’s because none of those teams have beaten us in like 800 days. Its been a long time in the league, and they hate it. Good. I don’t want you to like us. I want you to hate us. It is a far more motivating emotion than being pat on the head by opponent managers who tell us ‘we played well.’",
      "I grew up in the George Graham era, I will lap up every 1-0 I can. So talk about how great your new signings are, how Cunha bossed us, how De Ligt bossed us. Talk about how Arsenal were poor. We were, we stank up the gaff, we were probably at 50% capacity. And you STILL couldn’t beat us at your own ground. I think you need to self reflect. And I say this as someone who doesn’t think we’ll win the league this year either.\nJohn Matrix AFC",
      "",
      "…Well, that was quite the reaction to a game of football wasn’t it? In all honesty the mailbox was less outrageous than I thought it would be, Stewie aside, but he doesn’t count. Still though, I do think we all need a bit of perspective. Far too many of us are still stuck in a nostalgic reverie about Man Utd vs Arsenal. Keane and Vieira retired several years ago now everyone, games between these two sides simply don’t hold the same significance anymore.",
      "Nevertheless, there was plenty to talk about going in to this match and well, it didn’t really deliver. What we got was a game where Arsenal seemed happy to see out a 1 goal win with minimal fuss. Yes, minimal fuss!",
      "I know there has been a certain section of fans that have reacted like this was a backs to the wall grind as if Arsenal were a championship side scraping a win in the 4th round of the league cup, but that’s not the game I watched.",
      "Arsenal weren’t brilliant, I will grant them that, but I really don’t see where this narrative of Utd being great comes from. Sure, they didn’t look as clueless as the majority of last season, but other than Cunha’s shot that was well saved, they didn’t really trouble Arsenal. Sure they had a lot of possession and the stats will tell you they had a lot of shots on goal, but the vast majority were very easily dealt with.",
      "All I really learned from this game was that the players are seemingly still not quite up to speed yet. Some seemed a bit slow, a bit laborious and just undercooked. That is a bit of a concern, but I am remiss to take too much from the first game of the season.",
      "So, all in all, yes it wasn’t a great game of football, neither team was at their best, but it means very little in the grand scheme of things.\nAndrew (I am not convinced Madueke on the left wing will work though)",

It doesn’t matter what you say, how many articles you write, how many mails you publish, how many Tony Pulis comparisons you make, we will never apologise to you for the way we play. My generation more than anyone knows the number of articles you wrote (and the number of snide comments made) about soft Arsenal. Wenger’s Arsenal. I remember very clearly when Arsenal had a huge problem conceding goals from set pieces. “Be stronger” they said.",
      "Correct me if I’m wrong but Arteta now has the best record against Manchester United of any coach today?",
      "We are not your entertainment Steve Chicken. We don’t owe you that. If you want to be entertained you can watch Liverpool’s gung ho football or any of Chelsea’s 427 wingers. There’s plenty of entertainment to go round there. Only Ben white and Raya probably played well for Arsenal yesterday and they still beat this Manu team. Mbuemo 70 million. No goals no assists. Cunha 60 million. No goals no assist. Sesko 80 million. No goals no assists.",
      "But guess who the flop is? Yes. Gyokeres. No pre season, no time to adapt to a new style of play, first game away at one of football’s toughest grounds.",
      "Shame. 3 points and onto the next.\nDamola AFC, Berlin Germany",
      "",
      "…Arteta is on 10m not 15m (seriously where do you even get this from? If you google it or chatgpt you can get actual facts. It takes 2 seconds come on). Can we start fact checking mailboxes or rejecting bulls***? I guess you would lose a weekly Stewie emails and inevitable follow-up so your engagement will drop a bit but you’ll be doing your part to fight fake news world we live in. He’s on 2m more than Slots reported salary so you can have your point just make it properly mate",
      "Based on information i can find, Isak wants 300k (15m) per year and would have cost lets say 130m, Gyokeres is on 200k (10m a year) from what I can gather and cost about 63m. So Isak would cost some 200m over 5 years and Gyokeres 110m. I also find it hilarious to say hes “available” when hes currently on strike not playing for any teams since hes so “available”. Is he 90m less player? Tough to decide that on one weekend when one of the 2 is sat on his sofa",
      "I find it fascinating that anyone can watch that game and come away with any thoughts other than wow United are a much much better team this season and won’t finish anywhere near 15th. Their attack was direct and varied, the players are playing with a sense of freedom, the defense remains solid. This United team are a completely different animal and I am extremely happy with 1-0 at a buoyant old Trafford. I think as the season goes on people will find it harder and harder to get points vs United.",

      "It was kinda funny at first, but please god, the joke is dead now.",
      "On a footballing note, I’ll just be boring and say that there was really nothing of value to extract from the Man Utd – Arsenal game. Everyone was rusty, the Gunners ground it out and were tougher and more resilient overall than Utd. We’ll take the 3 points, forget the game ever happened, move on and hope to get better which no doubt we will. Incredible to see us being able to take White and Calafiori off and replace them with MLS and Timber – this is the kind of quality in depth we fans have been looking for, for years and it’s an exciting time to be an Arsenal fan.\nAP",

      "How do Arsenal’s corners not fall afoul of this regularly? They have a player back into the ‘keeper for every corner. That player is seldom within playing distance of the ball, and they are even less seldomly called for a foul. I recognize that other teams attempt to crowd the ‘keeper from corners as well, but Arsenal have clearly taken it to new levels with their set piece coach and mob rush to the front/back post in recent seasons. Stats back this up as well; they showed a lovely graphic during yesterday’s match where Arsenal have outscored all other Premier League sides from corners by something like 10 goals since 23/24. Good thing too since they create precious little from open play.",

      "In 3 years time, I will bet my grandmother’s house that Gyokeres will leave for nothing as his contract is cancelled (like what will surely happen to Jesus in the near future), and Sesko will be wanted by the likes of Real Madrid for a cool 150m.",

He drove a motorbike, and used to bring you out for thrilling drives, he was cool and had a leather jacket. But he was also a little unreliable. Not always there when you want him, or at least not there in the way you need him. So Ange and Mom parted ways.",

And, as we find out, he can be fun too! We get the impression that he wants to be here for a long time, not just a thrilling good time. He might even be a perfect fit for the family.",
      "Anyway, tenuous Netflix family flick analogies aside, I’m well on board the Thomas the Frank Engine.",
      "Against PSG, despite the gut-punching finish, I had 80-ish of the most enjoyable Spurs watching minutes in a long time: They looked organised, disciplined. They worked hard, they played smart. They even had plans for set pieces! You could see Frank’s fingerprints all over it. They looked like a team build on solid foundations (despite only a few weeks of work!). To follow that up against Burnley, with a no nonsense, very professional, clean cut 3-0 win was just perfect. Many might rightly say “It’s just Burnley” but the reality is, Spurs were one of the most generous teams in the league last year to give points to promoted sides, with our sloppy, inconsistent league form.",
      "There are much sterner tests to come, starting with City next week, but the signs so far show me a charismatic, intelligent manager, with a bought in squad, who are ready to make Tottenham a serious team again.

      "3. Always hard to judge how much was Team X good v Team Y bad, but we (Brentford) were terrible in the first half",
      "4. Perhaps it was to be expected when we were missing 2 out of our 3 regular midfield starters from last season, and all 3 of our attackers (for differing reasons)",
      "5. A midfield 3 of Yarmoliuk, Jensen and Milambo is never going to be good enough in the PL, but especially against a team as good as Forest. We didn’t have much choice on the day, but it shouldn’t be a surprise that we struggled to keep the ball against Forest’s high energy press, especially in the first half.",
      "6. It does make me worry how much we’ll miss Norgaard. We all knew how important he was to us, but it seems like we’re not really replacing him (Hendo is not the natural ball-winner that Norgaard is). Maybe Janelt when he returns from injury could play that role but either way it’s a step down",
      "7. Going forward we lacked any kind of potency until Schade came on. But hopefully Ouatarra will make a difference and maybe Wissa when he’s finished his strop can return to give us some more options up top.",
      "8. I was surprised how all over the place we were defensively as this was the one area I thought we would be pretty solid. Maybe just an early season thing and it was largely individual errors which led to the goals (Collins the biggest culprit)",
      "9. The fact we improved considerably second half is a positive, and at least points to Keith Andrews making a difference in the dressing room.",
      "10. Although not a great start, I don’t feel too pessimistic about the season. We should hopefully be much stronger already next week against Villa, and losing away to Forest is no disaster.",
      "11. I kind of assumed (and hoped!) that Chris Wood just had one of those mad seasons last year when everything clicked and he’d revert to the mean this time around. 2 goals in the first 45 minutes of the season, both high quality finishes (genuine “striker” goals) suggest otherwise!",

      "With eight debutants and a manager new to the Premier League, but also a fanbase still learning that excitement and expectation is to be encouraged rather than immediately extinguished, it was a requirement if they were to hold their own in the top flight.",
      "This is a different club to that which last graced and disgraced the top flight but the memories will have lingered. While no member of this squad can be tarred with the same brush of failure that swept Sunderland into the Championship eight years ago, many associated with the club will have recalled the misery of their last Premier League season.",
      "They were erased in 90 minutes which suggested Sunderland can break the curse of the promoted team.",
      "Across the last two seasons, Ipswich, Leicester, Southampton, Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton took anywhere between six and 11 games to record their first victory en route to heading back down from whence they came. In total, they won just 17 of 192 matches against non-promoted sides. West Ham at home was a gimme of an opening fixture but Sunderland did look far better prepared in comparison against precisely the sort of team they should be aiming to pull in and overtake.",
      "And the points about tactical adaptability and versatility are especially apt when promoted sides have been used as a vehicle for career progression in recent years. “We won’t play like Guardiola or De Zerbi, because we are Sunderland, and I am Regis Le Bris,” the Frenchman said last season. Both seem well-equipped for the challenges ahead together.",

      "Manchester City\nIt could be argued that Manchester City did not have a single unqualified success of a transfer window for at least a couple of years. They were underpinned by brilliant coaching and players for long enough to suffer a few market mistakes in succession, but it was always likely to catch them eventually.",
      "A mid-season scare triggered an extravagant January spend which spilled over into the summer. It turns out investing more than £100m on defenders and almost as much in both midfield and attack in a single calendar year, with £27m and a Marcus Bettinelli reserved between the sticks, can cure any and all ailments.",

      "Four debutants is as many as a reigning champion has ever named in their starting line-up of a Premier League opening weekend game. The accepted wisdom is never to change a winning team but Liverpool did so out of necessity and used that opportunity to build from a position of power.",
      "This is basically a new side, albeit with many familiar composite parts. Trent Alexander-Arnold was uniquely critical to how Liverpool defended and attacked on and off the ball. An element of unpredictability and instability when moving away from that is inevitable even when the most important gear in their midfield machine becomes available and players build fitness and rhythm.",
      "Yet it was the only first-team addition of last season’s £10m spend who stepped up to spare some rather more uncomfortable questions being asked of this summer’s £300m binge.",
      "Only in two of his previous Premier League appearances has Chiesa been given more than the eight minutes afforded to him to make a difference against Bournemouth. Injuries have hampered the Italian but it did always seem a largely pointless, opportunistic signing for such a strong frontline.",
      "This summer has, however, opened up an unlikely space for a wildcard forward beloved by the fanbase and popular within the squad, the sort crucial to any successful team. When the main cast members falter and fade, the ensemble needs to be trusted and Chiesa has that now.",
      "Even Darwin Nunez, who never convinced and was deemed dispensable at the right price, could list a number of game-changing moments he produced when called upon. No-one will ever play the role better than Divock Origi but that final roll of the dice, fifth and final substitution suggested Chiesa can give a passable impression, which is all Liverpool need from him as a £10m forward surrounded by those signed for far more.",
      "Those dissenting voices doubting Liverpool’s title defence can and should still be heard. Many aspects of the overall plan made little sense on the pitch and Slot will know that flexibility in his ideas is necessary. A title-winning campaign should not look the same at the end as it did at the beginning because lessons are learned and acted upon; last season started with Jarell Quansah at centre-half so the coach has earned a certain level of faith in his ability.",

      "With the same amount of the ball against the same opponent at the same venue – and with nine of the same players starting – three months later, Forest converted their territorial advantage into what was at times total dominance.",
      "That is testament to a tactical adaptability many felt was beyond Nuno, who had only previously coached 11 of his 71 Premier League wins with at least as much of the ball.",

      "But in basically bringing those pre-season shooting videos to life, Semenyo proved that his new contract might have been the best possible business Bournemouth could have conducted this summer.",
      "How depressing that it was destined to be framed as a response to one prick rather than being a showcase of an excellence it is easy to imagine the 25-year-old replicating on grander stages.",
      "Yet in retaining control over that situation and basically fool-proofing their attack for at least another season, Bournemouth have guaranteed their eventual reward for helping produce such a phenomenal talent and character. That is what they do and they are damn good at it.",

      "Newcastle without Alexander Isak\nAfter a summer spent self-injuriously and painstakingly proving they are not a particularly big club – or at least not at all well-versed in navigating the sharp end of the sport – how relieved Newcastle must have been to remind the Premier League they remain a big team.",
      "It has been a chastening transfer window but even that is starting to turn around in terms of signings and the petering out of a saga which, for better or worse, need no longer dominate the discourse and cloud the outlook. There can be few better distractions than the return of actual football.",
      "Alexander Isak not being front and centre of every discussion can only benefit Newcastle, even if his absence remained a talking point purely because of what they were missing. But that was more as a concept rather than an individual.",
      "The Magpies did almost everything right up until the final action and a competent, reliable centre-forward can solve that. The position is made for Isak if he is willing to run off all the humble pie headed his way if the deadline passes without a move.",
      "But selling him and reinvesting those funds in a natural goalscorer while improving depth and quality across the rest of an already very good squad really isn’t the worst scenario either.",
      "Newcastle were really good without Isak, can be much better with him, but could be even better than that if they sold up and got the next few recruitment calls right. Against all odds and contrary to popular opinion all summer, it is a decent position to be in.",

      "Spurs\nAnother club who will welcome the opportunity to take their collective mind off transfer nonsense by getting down to the far less important business of kicking a bag of air around. Doing so at home to a Scott Parker team was a blessing.",
      "The Super Cup performance indicated Spurs can hold their own against better sides; this showed they can sweep lesser opponents away through moments of sheer individual brilliance outside a solid structure already installed by Thomas Frank. They have already matched last season’s points haul at home to promoted teams.",
      "The luxury of having forwards signed for £60m, £55m and £47.5m rather than being made to sell them will be among the bigger differences Frank finds in his new role. It certainly helped decide his first game and settle the nerves.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nThere is a lot to be said for winning against the balance of play. Even more so away, considering the only other side to do so on the opening weekend was a Manchester City team given the slightly easier task of trekking down to Wolves.",

      "Perhaps they should.",
      "It also feels disconcertingly premature for said manager to be discussing the need to “bounce back” while repeatedly lamenting the lack of “the basics”. The argument behind keeping Potter despite the struggles endured last campaign revolved around him needing a pre-season to properly get his ideas across, yet no team looked nearly as unready or rudimentary over the opening weekend.",
      "West Ham were in control until the precise moment they weren’t, when a team mostly unversed in the ways of the Premier League bullied and subdued them.",
      "Potter was right when he said: “If we don’t do the basics right, you can bring in player and player and player and player and it’s not going to solve the problems.” But the same can be said of the individual paid handsomely to ensure those basics are actually in place in time for the new season.",

      "",
      "Aston Villa\nHow curious that one of only three teams who didn’t name an outfield summer signing in their starting line-up would put in arguably the most disjointed, confused performance.",
      "There is a sense that not only does Villa’s season hang in the balance of the final couple of weeks of this transfer window, but that it is more true for them than any other side.",
      "That was reinforced by Unai Emery’s impassioned thoughts on financial restrictions before the game, the vocal fan sentiment during it, and the level of frustration at stagnation after, fuelled by having three shots to 16 at home to a fellow prospective glass-ceiling shatterer who have also had a difficult summer.",
      "Even the impact of their only debutant showed the benefits of keeping the pack fresh, the options plentiful and the competition healthy. But 34-year-old Marco Bizot, purchased for a small undisclosed fee and immediately showing up Robin Olsen, cannot remain their best signing this season if they wish to maintain this upward trajectory.",
      "",
      "Chelsea\nIt will be interesting to see what comes of Enzo Maresca rocking the Chelsea boat ever so slightly instead of toeing the company line. The Italian was appointed in part because of his malleability to the club’s stated transfer policy, so going against that to request more signings was a change in tack.",
      "But it did feel like Maresca was rewarding Josh Acheampong rather than using him as a message to the board like Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte would. Jeremie Boga started the opening day of the 2017/18 season, was substituted on 18 minutes after a red card and then got loaned out to the Championship; history will not repeat itself here.",
      "A fine performance from the 19-year-old is unlikely to sate Maresca’s transfer desires. When Chelsea get up to speed after their Club World Cup excursions it seems likely Levi Colwill’s absence will only be more obvious.",

      "City have an unbelievable spine.",
      "I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.",

      "What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.",
      "A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.",
      "I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.",
      "Neville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd",
      "I've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!",
      "It was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.",
      "And I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.",
      "Carragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "I think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.",
      "Neville - Nottingham Forest",
      "For Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.",
      "Neville - Leeds, Burnley, Wolves",
      "Brentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…",
      "Carragher - Wolves, Sunderland, Burnley",
      "It's easy to put the three promoted teams there. I'm desperate for someone to stay up. I don't want to be talking about the three [promoted] teams going down. I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.",
      "Neville - Brentford",
      "It will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.",
      "Carragher - West Ham",
      "It wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.",
      "Carragher - Erling Haaland",
      "Mohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.",
      "Neville - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "I thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.",
      "He's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.",
      "Carragher - Florian Wirtz",
      "It's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.",
      "Carragher - Estevao",
      "He's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake. He's still a young player and isn't the finished article but he was one of them where you think, it won't be too long before he's first choice.",
      "Neville - Adrien Truffert",
      "I was watching Liverpool vs Bournemouth on Friday night - if you were looking at a left-back on the pitch that was the best one, it was the one wearing the Bournemouth shirt. Milos Kerkez looked like he was a little bit rash. His first game at Anfield, so you have to give him time to settle in. Truffert was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off him.",
      "Neville - Ruben Amorim",
      "There's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure. He has to deliver in these first few months of the season. I think he will perform. All eyes are on him. Amorim has the toughest job in English football, that's why he's one to watch.",
      "Carragher - Oliver Glasner",
      "I think he's a top manager. He plays the same system [as Amorim]. It's very difficult for Crystal Palace to get specialists, a club of that stature. Won the FA Cup, going into Europe, watching them against Chelsea and against Liverpool in the Community Shield, they beat Man City in the FA Cup final… he knows that system inside out. That guy Glasner definitely knows that system right now better than Ruben Amorim.",

      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "Monday 18 August 2025 15:56, UK",
      "The stopper replaced formerly regular first choice Andre Onana - who was not in the match squad - but failed to stop a Declan Rice cross that was then nodded home by Riccardo Calafiori.",
      "Despite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.",
      "The game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.",
      "On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.",
      "\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.",
      "\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.",
      "\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.",
      "\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.",
      "\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"",
      "Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.",
      "\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.",
      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",
      "More from Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim on Arsenal's winning goal:\n\n\n“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.\n\n\n“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed so he cannot defend it.\n\n\n“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…",
      "\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"",
      "\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: \"If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.",
      "\"I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…\"",
      "That prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.",
      "\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.",
      "\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"",
      "Keane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",

      "Riccardo Calafiori's header saw Arsenal edge to a 1-0 win against Manchester United in their Premier League opener, despite Ruben Amorim's side looking much-improved going forward.",
      "The Old Trafford side had splashed out on three attacking players this summer - Matheus Cuhna, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - who all made their Manchester United debuts on Super Sunday.",
      "But the game was ultimately decided on a goalkeeping error. Altay Bayindir - deputising for the absent Andre Onana - failed to deal with Declan Rice's corner, allowing Calafiori to nod home inside 13 minutes.",
      "And David Raya needed to be at his best at the other end to keep out the lively Cunha and Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Late in the first half, the Arsenal goalkeeper needed to make a low, one-handed save to fingertip Mbeumo's latest shot away from danger. Cunha too had already fired some efforts his way, but were handled well by Raya.",
      "The spell of pressure began when Patrick Dorgu rattled the bottom of the post with a thunderous shot. Manchester United continued to probe for a deserved equaliser in the second half, as Arsenal - despite their lead - looked a touch behind their opponents as the game continued.",
      "In the pick of the chances, Mbeumo nodded another effort goalwards after a deflected cross from Dorgu, but Raya was out again to make a spectacular save.",
      "The Gunners registered zero shots on target in the second half and just four overall after the break, with only a few efforts of note after the goal. Martin Odegaard shot from range in the first half, while Declan Rice saw a free-kick deflect behind for a corner.",
      "But crucially, they came away with a vital three points, showing their experience to win a game they were not at their best in. While Manchester United were beaten, there will surely be plenty of encouragement that this season will be more successful all around than the last.",
      "Man Utd: Bayindir (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Dorgu (7), Dalot (6), Casemiro (7), Mount (7), Fernandes (7), Cunha (8), Mbeumo (8).\n\n\nSubs: Amad (6), Ugarte (6), Sesko (6), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nArsenal: Raya (8), White (6), Saliba (7), Gabriel (7), Calafiori (7), Zubimendi (6), Rice (6), Odegaard (7), Saka (7), Martinelli (6), Gyokeres (6).\n\n\nSubs: Havertz (6), Madueke (6), Timber (6), Lewis-Skelly (6), Merino (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: David Raya.",

      "Perhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.",

      "When Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.",
      "Cut to their opening game at Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.",
      "Chelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.",
      "Maresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.",
      "Some may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.",
      "Ultimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.",

But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.",
      "Raya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.",
      "Gary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.",
      "It was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.",
      "There are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation.Nick Wright",
      "If anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.",
      "Since the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.",
      "However, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward.Callum Bishop",
      "Based on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.",
      "No team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.",
      "Andrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.",
