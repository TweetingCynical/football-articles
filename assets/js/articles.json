      "Ruben Amorim has revealed that several key Manchester United defenders, including Diogo Dalot, are 'trying really hard' to ensure they are available for next week's huge Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The Red Devils will lock horns with their Premier League rivals in Bilbao for the chance to salvage their sorry season with a trophy and an unexpected golden ticket to the Champions League after falling well below expectations on the domestic front.",
      "Dalot, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt are injury doubts for next week, with Yoro coming off in Sunday's 2-0 home defeat against West Ham. Neither he nor De Ligt were seen in training ahead of United's clash with Chelsea on Friday night.",
      "When Amorim was pressed for an update on the trio, he admitted that he is unable to say for sure whether or not any of them will be available for next week's big game.",
      "\"I don't know if they are going to be available,\" Amorim said in a press conference on Wednesday. \"We are going to try to push because it's the final matches and this is a final, you know that. All the players want to play that really bad.",
      "\"I don't know, I think they will not go to Chelsea [on Friday], but we will have a possibility to have some of them for the final.",
      "\"Dalot is trying really bad. I don't want to risk Dalot because, when you start getting one injury, second injury [follows] and it's a big thing. We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad. So, we will see, but he's working really hard to get in the final.\"",
      "While United are sweating on the fitness of several defenders, Tottenham are facing up to the prospect of trying to beat their rivals without one of their most influential attacking figures after Dejan Kulusevski underwent surgery for a knee injury on Wednesday.",
      "Spurs confirmed the news in a statement, which read: \"We can confirm that Dejan Kulusevski suffered an injury to his right patella in our Premier League fixture against Crystal Palace last weekend.",
      "\"Following further specialist consultation, the midfielder has undergone surgery today and will commence his rehabilitation with our medical staff immediately. We're all with you, Deki.\""

      "Manchester United turned their noses up at a young James Maddison when offered the chance to sign him back in his Coventry days. The Tottenham superstar, 28, has been one of the Premier League's top creative midfielders for a while, after turning heads at Leicester before sealing a £40million move to Spurs in 2023.",
      "But United could have snapped him for a fraction of that price back in 2016. At the time, Coventry were in the mire financially, and were thus forced to sell many of their best players, including 19-year-old prodigy Maddison.",
      "In 2020, transfer expert Ian McGarry, who, at the time, was working as a football consultant for the Sky Blues, claimed he contacted United to see if they'd be interested in bringing Maddison to Manchester, but claimed they \"didn't take any notice\" of his recommendation.",
      "\"When Maddison was in the process of leaving Coventry City because the club's financial crisis meant they had to sell their best players and Maddison even then was considered one of the best players,\" McGarry explained on the Transfer Window podcast.",
      "\"I contacted someone I knew at Manchester United in their recruitment department and said look you’re going to get a bargain here, this guy's going to be a huge player in the future and he's available for around £5m and he's also a Manchester United fan.",
      "\"They didn't take any notice. Manchester United could have had Maddison four years ago. In saying that there's no guarantee he would have developed the way he did at Norwich and then Leicester.\"",
      "Maddison would have almost certainly been lining up against the Red Devils in the Europa League final later this month, but will miss the clash due to injury. The England international was ruled out for the season after limping off in the first leg of Tottenham's semi-final against Bodo/Glimt, meaning he'll have to catch the action from the stands.",
      "\"Gutted. Just absolutely gutted,\" Maddison wrote on social media after learning he'd miss the showpiece. \"We've had our sights on that European final in Bilbao from day one of this campaign. So to accept not being able to take part out on that pitch with the boys is really tough to take.",
      "\"Injuries are just part of this game that can be so cruel at times. But I truly believe that it can be a special night for my football club. Bring on the 21st. All together.\"",
      "Maddison has notched 23 goal contributions in all competitions this season, including 12 goals - the second-best tally of his top-flight career. He's been a bright spark in an otherwise gloomy season for Spurs, who are on course for their worst-ever Premier League finish.",
      "The same can be said of Ruben Amorim's United, who are a place and a point above Ange Postecoglou's men in 16th. For both clubs, the Europa League final represents a shot at redemption, but also an unlikely path to Champions League football next season.",
      "For Maddison, watching from the sidelines will sting all the more knowing how different things could have been - not just in terms of his fitness, but in terms of an Old Trafford career that could have been but never was.",
      "Had United paid attention to McGarry's recommendation all those years ago, the creative spark that's been so often missing in their midfield might have been theirs to harness.",
      "Instead, Maddison stands as a living reminder of United's muddled recruitment strategy - an emblem of the talent they've let slip through their fingers during a decade of drift."

      "Ruben Amorim knows the pressure on him will intensify if he cannot lead Manchester United to Europa League glory next week. Amorim has already admitted lifting the trophy – and with it securing Champions League football next season – may not be the best outcome as he looks to rebuild his squad.",
      "The Portuguese coach knows he needs more time to work with his squad and that the added burden of eight European games is likely to hamper his chances of progress. But with United down in 16th place in the table and about to complete their worst season of the Premier League era, Amorim knows he has no option but to win in Bilbao.",
      "Asked about the pressure on him increasing if United fail to beat Spurs next Wednesday, Amorim said: “Yeah for sure, if we don’t win. But I’m not concerned about that.",
      "“It’s going to be really bad [if United lose]. I don’t want to use that as an excuse, but it’s going to be really tough. That's my feeling. The patience of the fans and you guys, and the patience for next season will have reached its limit and we'll have to be perfect.”",
      "Pressed on why he felt United may be better off without Champions League football next season, Amorim said: “That is my feeling - we need more time with the team. We need to arrange a lot of things at Carrington [United's training ground] and we need more time - not think game by game.",
      "“Then we have the squad. We proved this year we need to be a better squad if we want to win European games and then be really competitive during the Premier League.”",
      "Despite the most shambolic season since United were relegated in 1973-74, Amorim said he can sense the excitement building at the club ahead of the make-or-break European final.",
      "“You can feel that a final is different,” said Amorim. “This season has been really tough on everyone, not just the results but also the changes in the staff. You can feel it in our club.",
      "“We are addressing that during the season, we are changing the way we play during the season. We have had so many bad results in the Premier League, so the environment is tough at the moment.",
      "“But when we're preparing a game in the Europa League, the environment is a little bit different. You can feel the excitement, but at the same time you can understand the environment this year is really tough.”",
      "Even though they have under-performed in the Premier League this season, Amorim knows his players are capable of lifting themselves next week to end a tough campaign on a high.",
      "\"Our players have proved in the past that, in these kinds of games, they can do that,” said Amorim. “So we will be prepared for the game. It would be massive for us to win something, to give something to the fans. My message to the players will be 'we need to win it or else it doesn't matter'.\""

      "Liam Delap looks set to be one of the biggest transfer stories of the summer with Champions League hopefuls looking to sign the Ipswich Town striker. The striker has only played a season at Portman Road and despite the club's relegation confirmed, there are many suitors in the Premier League eager to recruit the young striker's services.",
      "Delap, 22, has been strongly linked to moves to Manchester United and Chelsea so far ahead of the summer transfer window - which opens on June 1 - as both sides will be keen to bolster their attacking options with the prospect of Champions League football next season too.",
      "Having made two appearances before for Manchester City in the past, the striker has enjoyed an impressive full Premier League debut season for Ipswich with 12 goals and two assists in his 35 appearances for the Tractor Boys which is why some a viewing him as a solid long-term addition to there squads.",
      "He has developed well during his time at the Etihad too with loan spells to Stoke City - where his father Rory is well-loved over there - Preston North End and Hull City before securing a permanent transfer to Kieran McKenna's side last summer with a rumoured release clause of £30million.",
      "At the time of writing this, United are the favourites to secure Delap's services next season as Ruben Amorim prepares to make wholesale changes to his squad this summer. The transfer will no doubt be contingent with the Red Devils securing Champions League football next season via next week's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur with so many other clubs with guaranteed European spots also rumoured to be chasing his signature.",

      "Chelsea have been linked with Delap as well and are thought to be confident in sealing his services from under Amorim's nose. The Blues will be looking to provide competition for Nicolas Jackson next summer with Enzo Maresca in a great position to secure one of the five Champions League spots in the Premier League at the moment.",

      "Antony has been told his future will be best served away from Manchester United despite his resurgence on loan at Real Betis. However, Gary Pallister believes the Brazilian has at least one attribute Ruben Amorim would be better off keeping around.",
      "The Manchester misfit's tenacity could be something Sporting CP boss Amorim would appreciate if combined with more output on the field. Yet despite Antony's efforts to reinvent himself during his loan spell in Spain, it appears it might not be sufficient to secure his career in England.",
      "Red Devils legend Pallister has suggested the out-of-favour winger has fallen prey to his own playing style at United. When Antony was loaned out in the January transfer window, his £82million fee made him arguably one of the worst signings in United's history.",
      "Coming from Ajax on the back of Erik ten Hag's recommendation in the summer of 2022, the player shouldered immense expectations. However, he only managed 17 direct goal contributions (12 goals and five assists) in 96 appearances for United before being shipped off to La Liga.",
      "In stark contrast, he’s nearly matched those figures with eight goals and five assists in just 22 games for Betis. Despite his impressive stats abroad, Pallister has said it's not Antony's mental toughness that's in question among United's loanees.",
      "\"I think Antony is probably better suited to the football that he's playing out in Spain. I liked his attitude when he was here and I know he got a bit of stick, but he was always game, he was always up for a fight.",
      "\"It didn't really work from him here. Some people are better attuned to the foreign kind of football rather than the Premier League.\"",
      "Many supporters might share this same view, considering what they saw of the player during his time in England to date. Now under ex-Man City chief Manuel Pellegrini, he's become an integral part of the team and has helped push Los Verdiblancos towards a Europa Conference League final.",
      "Yet the winger often seemed baffled by Premier League defences. Antony's overreliance on his left boot often led to ineffective displays, and his numbers failed to improve once Amorim took over in November.",
      "It's fortunate for United they have Amad Diallo as an established alternative for the right flank. The Ivorian has been hitting his stride at United over the past year or so, having had his own struggles for prominence at Old Trafford.",
      "United now face the conundrum of deciding their terms to let Antony go given his market value has nosedived since moving from Amsterdam. It's believed United have already snubbed one Betis bid to buy him outright, which implies the sum offered doesn't square with their price expectations.",
      "United are reportedly asking for £40m to part ways with the player, almost half of what they originally shelled out nearly three years ago. The star has expressed his fondness for his current club, telling Mundo Deportivo moving to Seville was \"the best decision\" he's ever made.",
      "Betis' financial scope this summer will depend largely on their ability to clinch a spot in next season's Champions League. Pellegrini's team must secure a place in the top five of La Liga to make the cut, currently sitting just shy in sixth place and trailing by three points."

      "De Ligt picked up a knee injury in the 4-3 loss to Brentford, but Amorim had been optimistic about a swift return. \"It is not a big issue,\" he said. \"That is a good thing. He cannot play tomorrow [vs Athletic Bilbao] and he'll not play on Sunday [vs West Ham] but then we'll check day by day.\"",
      "Heaven has not been involved in any squads since being on the bench against Newcastle on April 13 due to a \"small setback\".",
      "Injuries have been a major problem for Amorim during his debut campaign as United boss, with defence a particular issue. Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui all featured against West Ham, but United are short on numbers in defence.",
      "Amorim chose to play a strong side against the Hammers on Sunday, with Bruno Fernandes partnering Manuel Ugarte in midfield. The Portuguese boss admitted that he still had one eye on the Europa League final and had to manage his squad ahead of Friday's trip to play Chelsea in the Premier League.",
      "\"We want to win and to be competitive, also in the Premier League,\" Amorim said. \"Bruno doesn't have the problem of any injury [touches wood] but Harry [Maguire] has. So we have to manage that but they have to play and it is better to play than to stay out.\""

      "If Ruben Amorim gets his way, Manchester United could be transformed over the summer transfer window. Amorim has endured a largely awful reign so far, winning just six of his 26 Premier League games in charge.",
      "While he has led the Red Devils to the final of the Europa League, their dire performance in the top-flight has attracted widespread criticism. Club legend Rio Ferdinand believes that Amorim himself is seeking to move on 50 percent of his squad.",
      "The ex-United defender said on his Rio Presents podcast: \"I think he looks around the dressing room and thinks, 'If I could wave a magic wand, in the next five years at least 50 percent of this team wouldn't be here.'",

      "\"He needs to recruit dynamic athletes. I don't want no mavericks, or players that are frilly and can do pirouettes. No, no, people that can run past and over people as well.”",
      "In a dream world where that change progresses quickly this summer, United would look totally different from this season's under-performers. That change would start in goal, where Andre Onana has been desperately disappointing.",
      "Lille star Lucas Chevalier has emerged as a target, having helped his side to likely European qualification and broken into the France national team squad this season. With two years on his contract, Chevalier is available for around £33.7million.",
      "The defence would be largely unchanged, with a first-choice back three of Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt and Lisandro Martinez emerging once the Argentine returns from his long-term injury.",

      "In a dream scenario, alongside him would be a new face in Adam Wharton. The England international has impressed for Crystal Palace since arriving 18 months ago, earning a ticket to Euro 2024.",
      "He still has four years to run on his contract so a move would be expensive, though Amorim is understood have greenlighted a pursuit of the 21-year-old. In attacking midfield, captain Bruno Fernandes would take one of the two No.10 spots.",

      "A little over a decade ago, a fresh-faced Tyler Blackett stepped onto the Old Trafford pitch for his Manchester United debut. At 31, the central defender now finds himself at a crossroads - clubless and without a competitive game in over a year since Rotherham United released him at the end of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Once hailed as a future Red Devils defensive cornerstone, Blackett forged a solid Championship career after failing to make the grade at United. But his current limbo paints a stark contrast to the promise of his youth.",
      "\"How I've been? Okay,\" Blackett told Flashscore earlier this year. \"It's not been easy by any means, it's something which I've not had to deal with in my career before. Some days better than others.",
      "\"But I'm just getting through - staying fit and training. Just keeping on top of things and doing what I can do to be ready when the right opportunity comes. It's about waiting for the right fit now.\"",
      "Blackett’s journey began at eight when he joined United, his boyhood club, dreaming of emulating defensive titans Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. He rose swiftly through the academy, his blend of physicality and composure catching the eye.",
      "In 2014, with Ferdinand and Vidic both departing, a door cracked open. New manager Louis van Gaal, impressed by Blackett’s pre-season showings, fast-tracked him to the senior squad.",
      "\"Van Gaal was great for me,\" Blackett said. \"He obviously had trust in young players and gave you that confidence by giving those outlines and what he expected from you.",
      "\"That's what you had to focus on, and that helped me at that time. He was a manager who gave me an opportunity, and I have always praised him and thanked him for that.\"",
      "Blackett made 12 senior appearances in Van Gaal’s first season, showing flashes of his potential. In 2015, when he signed a new contract, Van Gaal doubled down on his belief.",
      "“Tyler has great potential and I believe he is at the right club to continue his development and progression to become a great defender,” the Dutchman said. The words carried weight, fuelling optimism that Blackett could be United’s next homegrown star.",
      "A loan move to Celtic was sorted the following season, with hopes Blackett could get some high-level, regular football under his belt, before coming back to fight for a place in United's starting XI. Instead, the move backfired.",
      "Blackett languished on the bench or was used out of position at left-back, sapping his confidence and rhythm. He returned to Manchester a shadow of the player who’d left.",
      "The arrival of Jose Mourinho in 2016 sealed Blackett's fate. Unlike Van Gaal, Mourinho showed little faith in the young defender, allowing him to join Reading without a single sniff of first-team action. Blackett’s United dream was over.",
      "It was in Berkshire, as well as during later stints at Nottingham Forest and in the MLS with FC Cincinnati, that he showed glimpses of his old promise, albeit largely struggling for consistency once again.",
      "In 2023, Blackett signed with Rotherham. He made 23 appearances in the 2023/24 season, offering stability to a side battling relegation. But the Millers' struggles culminated in a drop to League One, and Blackett was released, leaving him without a club for the first time in his professional career.",
      "His time in Yorkshire, while steady, underscored a career that never quite recaptured the heights of his United days. Under Van Gaal, he stood on the cusp of greatness - a homegrown talent with the tools to succeed at the highest level. But football is unforgiving.",
      "Loans that falter, managerial changes, and fleeting confidence can derail even the brightest prospects. Blackett’s 12 appearances for United remain a fleeting highlight in a career that, while respectable, never matched the lofty expectations set in 2014. As he trains alone, awaiting the “right fit,” Blackett’s story serves as a poignant reminder of how fine the margins are in the beautiful game."

      "And already Ronaldo Jr was able to flash his talents to a Manchester United scout after featuring against Japan, per reports. The starlet entered the field after 54 minutes and donned the no.7 shirt his father was at home in.",
      "Tottenham were also said to be in attendance at the youth tournament. Croatian newspaper Sportske Novosti suggested that Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, Hoffenheim, Red Bull Salzburg, Inter Milan, Juventus and Atalanta all had representatives covering the game too.",
      "Ronaldo Jr will be familiar to faces at United having been part of the youth set-up during his father's second spell at the club but currently plays within Al-Nassr's academy. The teenager played alongside Wayne Rooney's son, Kai, while learning his trade at Carrington.",
      "Ronaldo Sr has earned 219 caps in his international career and the 40-year-old was pleased to see his son earn his first minutes of a fledgling career. The Portugal legend was proud of his eldest child.",
      "Ronaldo wrote: \"Congratulations on your debut by @selecaoportugal, son. Very proud of you!\"",
      "Ronaldo Jr is in the fairly unique position of being eligible to play for three different nations. After following his dad as he completed transfers around the world, the young star of course qualIfies for Portugal through his dad, but qualifies for Spain after spending much of his youth there when Ronaldo played for Real Madrid.",
      "The United States could yet come calling for the teen as Ronaldo Jr was born in California and it is reported he could represent the country as a result. Any desire for an England career can quickly be quashed however as he would have needed to spend five years in the country to qualify.",
      "Ronaldo Jr trained two years above his age group upon arriving at the Mahd Academy in 2023, and reportedly could have returned to Real Madrid. Perhaps another academy move could be on the cards however.",
      "Ronaldo Sr's future at Al-Nassr appears unclear after talks of a contract extension were \"put on hold\". The ex-Juventus and United star was tipped to sign a new two-year deal but an underwhelming year from the club appears to have instigated some doubts.",
      "Ronaldo has continued to find success in front of goal but it has not been matched with silverware for Al Nassr. Now talk of move to rival club like Al Hilal, who have qualified for the Club World Cup, has emerged.",
      "Marca claims Ronaldo is questioning his future and after losing 3-2 to table toppers Al-Ittihad last week, the veteran stormed off the pitch. It is said to not be well received by the club's hierarchy."

A top six finish would be good enough for European football, but it would also represent one of the rarest revivals in Premier League history.",
      "United finished eighth last season but have surpassed that this term for all the wrong reasons. Ruben Amorim, whose future beyond this season remains up for debate, claimed that he was presiding over \"maybe the worst Manchester United team in history\" only months ago.",
      "The Red Devils sit a point behind West Ham in 15th, but are in the midst of a run that has seen them draw two and lose five of their last seven games. Tottenham could yet leapfrog the Manchester outfit, painting an even more bleak picture of the season.",
      "Recoveries following a strong summer transfer window and a positive pre-season are not unheard of. But to rise 10 places, which is what the Manchester bosses are eyeing, is something that is achieved once in a blue moon.",
      "In fact, in a 20-team Premier League, only FIVE times has a team jumped up 10 places or more the following season. One of those was the miracle of Leicester City - going from 14th after staving off relegation to become champions in a 5000/1 success. The type of story that truly is once in a lifetime.",
      "Ignoring that only four teams have made the type of leap they are seeking on the red half of Manchester - and none of those have been what you would have called traditional 'top six' sides. When they fall, it takes a lot longer for them to recover.",

      "A year earlier and Aston Villa were celebrating finishing sixth after meandering down in 16th the previous season. That owed to a managerial change with David O'Leary coming in to replace Graham Taylor. That was an example of a new manager bounce really lifting a club as they landed UEFA Cup - now Europa League - qualification.",
      "Fulham were another side to benefit from a proper transfer window and a pre-season under Roy Hodgson in 2008. The veteran manager had narrowly dodged relegation to finish 17th, but in his first full season took the Cottagers all the way to the lofty heights of seventh - which allowed them to embark on their journey to the Europa League final the following campaign.",

Much like the aforementioned Fulham situation, the Hammers had change the manager the year prior, bringing in Moyes. As like Hodgson, Moyes was able to turnaround the club's fortunes after a proper pre-season and the chance to bring in his own players.",
      "It's worth noting that Nottingham Forest, once this season finishes, will have also made a leap of more than 10 places under Nuno Espirito Santo.",

      "Of all the revival stories mentioned above there is a common theme. Nottingham Forest, West Ham and Fulham all changed their manager six months before embarking on impressive campaigns. Amorim arrived at around a similar time to the likes of Nuno, Moyes and Hodgson.",
      "But whilst they showed signs of promise, fending off the threat of relegation, Amorim has only served to take the Manchester outfit in the wrong direction. In the case of Leicester and Aston Villa, they changed managers in the summer and had an instant return.",
      "United's power brokers genuinely believe a top six finish is an acceptable aim for next season, but Premier League history suggests its a tall order and the direction of travel under Amorim would make finishing sixth once of the great recoveries.",
      "Worth noting also that, whilst United have never been this low in the Premier League, their biggest ever jump is from seventh to fourth. When you look at the club's entire history, not since 1964 has the club jumped ten spots in the league, and that needed the brilliance of Sir Matt Busby to be achieved."

      "“So, I think it’s much more about whether they just decide they’re going to keep him or if they’re going to take the fee, whatever that fee is from Saudi. I think it’s very unlikely that the fee will be the sort of numbers that have been speculated. They very rarely pay very big fees of the type that’s been rumoured there. Clearly, they paid it for Neymar, which was a disastrous deal.",
      "“There is some speculation they’re going to pay a very big fee for Kudus from West Ham. We will see about that. They paid a reasonably sized fee for Duran, although that’s a different category of deal given his age and given the striker.",
      "“They have paid very big wages but have tended not to pay very big transfer fees, and we’ll have to see whether that changes this summer. But if they weren’t to, then I think that would be the deal dead as far as Fernandes is concerned. I don’t think United would contemplate selling him unless they could get an extraordinarily large fee anyway.”",

      "On Dalot, he added:",
      "Dalot is trying really bad. I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, a second injury, it is a big thing. We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad. We will see. He is working really hard to get in the final.",
      "He may not be the 'biggest' name on the market but his goalscoring prowess in recent seasons means he cannot be overlooked.",
      "109 goals in 231 appearances is a respectable return and at 25 he holds plenty of resale value.",
      "What's more, on a free, he is ideal for a cash-strapped side.",
      "United may only be looking at Delap and Cunha to strengthen this attack at present, but they potentially will need more than just them to strengthen their team and David is certainly worth a punt.",

In this moment, in our club, sometimes it is hard when to give, when to take. It is complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff. It is a really hard position. That situation was explained and in that moment was to help. It is not going to change my life. To help the staff to be there... to be better staff for the final. All the players had the same reaction. Everyone wants the staff there, their families there. It is hard to manage things in our club, so it is a simple thing.\"",

      "Despite the atrocious results and performances throughout the season, there are some players who have an argument to stay at the club. Alongside the obvious like Bruno Fernandes, Amad, Matthijs de Ligt and maybe Leny Yoro, the majority of United's squad haven't covered themselves in glory.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee's situation is a different one. After arriving from Bologna in the summer for £36.5million, the Netherlands international has done performed decently if nothing more, scoring seven goals and providing another three assists. Whilst he hasn't set the world alight, his presence is missed in United's team currently with a hamstring injury keeping him out.",
      "After paying a significant fee for him last year, United aren't expected to readily sanction an early exit for the 23-year-old, but according to reports in Italy, Inter Milan are targeting a move for him in the summer.",
      "Corriere dello Sport have claimed that the Champions League finalists want to bring Zirkzee back to the San Siro to compete with first choice strikers Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram. It's said a loan deal with an option to buy is their preference with the forward's wages not an obstacle they are concerned about.",
      "United's stance on Zirkzee is likely to sway more towards keeping him after his signs of potential. However, just like there was in January with a reported swap deal proposed for Zirkzee to join Juventus and Dusan Vlahovic move to United, there could be a wildcard option to structure the move in a more palatable way.",
      "Inter have enjoyed a fantastic season, mainly down to Simon Inzaghi's tactics, but individual player performances have played a key part. Yann Sommer has been one of Europe's top goalkeepers, Alessandro Bastoni has been a rock at the back, Nicolo Barella has controlled things in midfield and Martinez has continued to score goals for fun.",
      "There's talent within the Inter squad and United could look at a number of their players in order to sanction Zirkzee's exit. Defender Yann Bisseck has recently been linked with a move to Old Trafford to bolster Amorim's backline whilst Denzel Dumfries has already been primed to join United by Gary Neville recently.",
      "Both Bisseck and Dumfries improve United's team and would strengthen the defence for next season. Whilst United may not be entirely inclined to allow Zirkzee to leave, letting him go as part of a deal to bring one of Inter's colossal defenders to the club would be too hard to turn down.",
      "It remains to be seen whether or not Inter would even consider selling either Bisseck or Dumfries. However, there is scope for some sort of deal with United's past interest and Inter registering interest in Zirkzee."

      "An undefeated run in the Europa League this season has offered a window into what Amorim's system is supposed to be like, but it has been brutally unpicked at times in the Premier League, with the team on relegation form. United must now decide how much to commit to the summer transfer window to improve their fortunes - going all in on Amorim and not seeing enough improvement could leave the following manager with similar issues.",
      "Some say that United should source a new manager for next season, come what may. Reader Gemini0806 says: \"Amorim has yet to convince. Would you spend £200m of your money to buy players for a manager who has taken the Team from 8th to 17th in 6 months? If we are still bottom half by Christmas, do you stick with him or get someone else in, who will want more money to buy his own players? I think the percentage call is to get rid after the Final.\"",
      "Commenter Dambuster007 agrees: \"It is clear. The system will not work. We should not commit a transfer window to Amorim and his tactics. We need a change. We should not wait until we see how bad next season gets. A new manager will be harder to get then.\"",
      "Sirgreenmantle writes: \"The system is irrelevant. What is relevant is Ruben's failure to coach his players to play it effectively enough to get results. If we played 4:3:3 and had similar results, the same criticisms would apply.",
      "\"People say there isn't a plan B. That could be true or, equally, there is one but he has decided not to use it. Either way it is a universal truth that it is results and performances, not choice of systems, that decide a coach's fate.",
      "\"What will give him time now, which the so-called elite clubs probably wouldn't provide, is the fact that the credibility of the new Executive team is hanging by a thread. It cost a fortune to recruit Amorim and his team and would cost another to sack him.\"",
      "New personnel, fresh perspectives, or some flexibility could turn things around for Amorim. 1954brad says: \"It's the mindset that needs changing, the constant need to go backwards even when a player has space or a forward pass is on. Just look how many goals conceded when we do this.",
      "\"The confidence of the strikers is shot, when you look at opportunities created and not taken, and the shocked look on Hojlund's face when he actually scored against Athletic was telling, he couldn't believe he'd really done it. The summer window is massive, striker, keeper and creative midfielder are essential, or relegation beckons.\"",
      "Captainmarvellous writes: \"This system works well for Palace and Wolves because it's based on attacking after the transition in the middle of the park especially with attacking wing backs like Munoz for Palace and Ait-Nouri for Wolves.",
      "\"It's a counter attacking formation, it doesn't suit possession based football. This is why experience is important, Glasner and Pereira don't have rigid ideologies, they play a system which suits their players and needs.\"",
      "Steviweavi says: \"The system isn't the problem, the players are. Look at last season and prior to Amorim taking over. Its ridiculous people thought he'd wave his magic wand and we'd be in the CL. Its obvious there's a huge disconnect from what happens on the training field and on match day. There's no point in Amorim continuously slating the players, he has to work with what he's got for now, although he did get rid of Rashford and Anthony.",
      "\"If you compare our current players to every other team in the PL, we put in zero effort, we frequently get caught sleeping in defence, and we couldn't hit a barn door in front of goal. The only bonus about winning the Europa League is the cash injection from being in the CL, nothing more. We need to concentrate on competing in the PL and cups first.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has led significant cost-cutting measures at United including laying off some 450 staff, and amid fear of further redundancies, Amorim has offered to fund the staff to go to the game next week, claiming it was a “simple thing”.",
      "“The situation is simple,” he said during a press conference on Wednesday. “We know that we have had a lot of things with people leaving and changes in the staff. In this moment, in our club, sometimes it is hard [to know] when to give and when to take.",
      "“It is complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff. It is a really hard position. That situation was explained and in that moment I could help. It is not going to change my life to help the staff to be there, to be better for the final.",

      "United are planning to hold a comically low-rent BBQ in celebration should they beat Spurs and claim the trophy, rather than with an open-top bus parade, but Amorim wouldn’t be drawn on the report.",
      "“Personally for me, I think the Champions League is more important for everything, to prepare the next season,” said the Portuguese. “We are supposed to be in the Champions League; the Europa League here is not enough. This is the best way to get us to the top in a few years.”",
      "Paul Merson labelled the plan not to hold a parade as “arrogance” as they not win another trophy for 15 years.",
      "“For me, it’s a bit of arrogance. Winning trophies was the past, so enjoy the present. Who says they win another one for 15 years?",
      "“Now they’re going to have a BBQ, think of the fans! They’ll let you know when the parade is on whether it was right to do. Do not leave the fans out because it is about the fans. I would want a parade.",

      "That will come as no surprise to a host of English clubs. Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City and Man Utd have long been tracking Simons, while Bayern Munich are also believed to be watching closely.",
      "However, Leipzig’s asking price and Simons’ preference for a Premier League move put English sides firmly in the frame.",
      "Reports suggest Leipzig want a quick and sizeable return on their January investment, with the Bundesliga side expected to demand around €80 million (£67m).",

      "The Netherlands international has nine goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga this season, despite Leipzig enduring an up-and-down campaign.",
      "Last term, he registered 25 goal contributions across all competitions and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.",
      "Speaking recently, Simons hinted at his future, telling Sky Germany: “I’m still a young player, I have many dreams and the club knows that. But right now, the most important thing for me is to play well in the upcoming games. Then we have the international matches, and after that we’ll sit down and see what happens.”",
      "Simons’ desire to play Champions League football is thought to be a key factor in his decision. Leipzig are currently seventh in the Bundesliga, with their hopes of qualifying for next season’s competition all but over.",
      "That could give the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool the edge. Man Utd are also interested, but their financial flexibility may depend on Europa League success and the Champions League qualification that comes with it, as revealed by Duncan Castles recently.",
      "He said: “Their problem is an obvious one in that they don’t have much money to play with, certainly not the kind of money that Leipzig are looking at as a sell fee.",

      "With Victor Lindelof expected to leave this summer, and ongoing concerns over Matthijs de Ligt’s fitness amid a number of other injuries, defensive reinforcements are a top priority for INEOS this summer.",
      "Defence isn’t the only priority, as the Red Devils are looking to move early in the market to secure their top targets, including Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "Tah, 29, is viewed as one of the most experienced and dependable defenders on the market. And with his contract up at the end of the season, he had emerged as a serious candidate for a reshaped Man Utd backline under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But Bayern Munich have now made their move.",
      "According to Romano, the Bavarian giants have submitted a full proposal for Tah, including a complete salary package, and have now received internal approval to press ahead.",
      "The only thing left, Romano said on X, is a green light from the player himself.",
      "“Bayern formal proposal to Jonathan Tah has been approved internally at the club, salary included,” Romano confirmed.",
      "“Green light needed from the player in order to close the deal and get it done, as final crucial step. Up to Jonathan Tah.”",
      "Barcelona were also linked earlier this year but are now out of the race. Romano confirmed the Catalan side have no intention of moving for the Germany international, citing their wealth of centre-back options as the reason. “Not because of FFP,” he added, “but because they have many centre-backs.”",
      "Real Madrid, Tah’s current boss Xabi Alonso’s new home, are reportedly focused on other targets. And that leaves Bayern, once again, looking likely to poach a top performer from a direct Bundesliga rival.",
      "It’s a hammer blow to Utd, who were one of the first English clubs to seriously explore the free-agent opportunity and saw Tah as an ideal blend of experience, physicality and leadership.",
      "His 400+ appearances for Leverkusen, capped off by a historic unbeaten title-winning season last term, had put him firmly on the radar of INEOS chiefs.",
      "Tah himself confirmed earlier this year that his decision to leave Leverkusen had already been made.",
      "“Definitely,” he said when asked if he would leave at season’s end.",
      "“I made the decision not to renew my contract and to stick with it. That’s the case now. The club knows about it. Everything has been said from the beginning.”",
      "But there remains a flicker of hope for Utd. If Amorim’s side can secure Champions League football by lifting the Europa League, they could re-enter the frame with a more attractive sporting package.",
      "But for now, Bayern are firmly in control.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly ‘increasingly confident’ of signing Bayer Leverkusen Jonathan Tah on a free transfer as their third summer signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘reached out’ to Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Jonathan Tah as they ‘sense an opportunity’.",
      "Man Utd are weighing up whether to attempt to beat Barcelona and other clubs to the free transfer of Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah, according to reports.",

      "But we’re not sure pointing out that United’s own biggest Premier League leap is a mere three places ‘from seventh to fourth’ is all that relevant. The fact they’ve never finished below eighth is kind of the point.",
      "When you look at the club’s entire history, not since 1964 has the club jumped ten spots in the league, and that needed the brilliance of Sir Matt Busby to be achieved.",
      "Yes, but it also needed the non-brilliance of finishing 11th or lower the year before. United haven’t even had the opportunity for a 10-place jump since the final few years before football history officially began – and going from 13th in 1990 to sixth in 1991 feels at least vaguely adjacent to this latest supposed mission.",
      "In all, since those far-off days of 1964, United have had a whopping five whole seasons where a 10-place top-flight finishing position jump was even possible, and in three of those only winning the league could have achieved it. And in one of those they did go from 11th to second, between 1987 and 1988.",

      "Last season, in this specific example, when Xabi Alonso was busy winning the Bundesliga and pointedly not preparing to take over at Real Madrid or anywhere else. It was quite significant news at the time.",

      "Manchester City: Title challenge\nWeird for City’s target not to just be as straightforward as winning the league, but it does feel like they might need to walk, or at least jog, before they can run here.",
      "City being City and Pep being Pep, it still wouldn’t entirely surprise us to see them 12 points clear this time next year, but right now it would be enough just to see them in genuine contention again and with Guardiola looking willing and able to build another great team.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Top six\nNot what we’d have gone for, because there currently appear to be – at a rough estimate – 15 teams better placed to achieve this but it is apparently the target United’s brains trust has set Ruben Amorim and his merry band of dafties, so there it is. No point us making up our own target when the actual club has already set one.",
      "We’d have to be quite the insufferable little tagnut to think our target is more important than the club’s own. All we’ll say is this: the very best of luck to you all.",
      "",
      "Newcastle: Remain in Champions League qualification mix, make better job of Champions League itself\nWinning a trophy and now almost certain to be back in the Champions League next year – possibly even as Premier League runners-up – makes this a wildly successful season of target-hitting jubilation on Tyneside.",
      "The silverware was just so absurdly overdue that it mattered not one bit that it was ‘only’ a Carabao; now it’s a question of whether a Newcastle freed of that particular albatross can really kick on.",
      "For the short term next season, it seems reasonable to suggest that maintaining their position among the upper echelons of the Premier League would suffice as long as it’s accompanied by making a better go of the Champions League itself.",
      "Newcastle were, in truth, a touch unlucky on their last go at it a couple of years back as events and circumstance transpired against them. They were always competitive in a tough group, but they did still finish bottom of it.",
      "The new format should help, and something akin to Aston Villa’s run this season provides a fair benchmark.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Don’t be one-season wonders, make decent stab at whichever lesser European comp they’re in\nAmong the more interesting teams next season, because what happens next has such a wide range of possibilities. Has this season been a bit of a rogue one? One in which the sheer scale of the fallibility pretty much everywhere outside Anfield – and Forest won there anyway – has serendipitously combined with Forest’s xG-baiting, p*ss-boiling counter-attacking game?",
      "Or have they actually cracked a code that will allow them to compete at the top end for multiple seasons? We don’t need to see another genuine tilt at Champions League qualification, necessarily; just enough to confirm this season hasn’t been, to be unnecessarily harsh about it, a fluke.",
      "Comfortably top half would be enough for that, while Forest also have the chance to turn (likely) Champions League disappointment this season into something more positive next season. This season has starkly shown the gulf that exists between those European competitions and the potential for even the very daftest of English clubs to have their fun in the lesser ones.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Restore sanity\nOnly Spurs. Only Spurs could have such two obvious ambitions as ‘win trophy’ and ‘qualify for Champions League’ and find themselves one win – against a team they’ve already beaten three times this season – away from achieving both and yet also find themselves entirely mired in mortifying existential crisis.",
      "Even at Man United, an even bigger and at this time even stupider football club, the sense of crisis is not so all-pervading. The Europa League final feels far less like a pivotal sliding doors moment for them than it does for Spurs.",
      "United don’t have the same desperate, yearning hunger for a trophy – they win them all the time regardless of how sh*t they happen to be at any given moment. And they are still Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. They’ll still attract players, they’ll still have the chance to build what they want to build under Ruben Amorim, even if losing the final mires it in greater early uncertainty.",
      "Spurs are completely f*cked if they don’t win the final, and might be quite f*cked even if they do. Even if they do win it, they probably need to thank Ange Postecoglou profusely for delivering on his second-season-trophy promise in the most absurd manner imaginable and move on.",
      "What they definitely need to be next season is just less utterly, repeatedly and predictably mental.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Don’t give promoted clubs any reason to be optimistic\nWe’re currently of the view that West Ham’s current level of sh*tness – worse than absolutely everyone bar the cast adrift relegated clubs and the two idiots who aren’t even trying in the league anymore – is not particularly reflective of where they can or should be.",
      "Appointing Graham Potter when they did was both a shrewd move, one that reflected a reality in which the trajectories of both parties had pulled them into each other’s orbit at an opportune moment where it didn’t look like an embarrassing option for either, yet also one that conceded the current season was being written off.",
      "That’s not necessarily a bad thing. The Julen Lopetegui idea had proved a bad one, and there was no point persisting with someone serving up Moyes-lite dullness with no obvious way out of the doldrums.",
      "Potter has not necessarily improved results or performances, but he does offer at least the prospect of better and above all more watchable things to come.",
      "When we think of Good Potter, of Brighton Potter, we think of a meticulous manager with carefully crafted and well-drilled plans. He is a manager who absolutely needs a pre-season. And if anything is left of that Potter, and we really think he’s still in there, then it is only when next season is firmly under way that we can even begin to assess where he and West Ham are at.",
      "The vital thing to do at the start of the season, though, is to avoid offering any encouragement at all to those promoted clubs looking for someone they might be able to drag into a fight. There are few contenders for that role, and West Ham shouldn’t really be one either, but circumstance places them as one of the few for whom a noticeably poor start would offer genuine succour to the newbies.",
      "",
      "Wolves: Start properly, don’t require managerial change by November\nWolves have a recent habit of allowing the sloppy end to one season to bleed into a difficult start to the next, often accompanied by rushed or half-baked managerial change.",
      "They lost four of their last six games in 2020/21, and then four of the first five in 2021/22. That season ended with a seven-match winless run, followed by one win in the first nine of 2022/23.",
      "The 2022/23 season then ended with four defeats in their last seven games, and one win in six started the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "That season ended with seven defeats in the last 10, mirrored by seven defeats (and no wins) in the first 10 games of this season.",
      "The fact Wolves have pretty comfortably remained a Premier League club throughout all that tells you that in the middle part they’re generally doing fine.",
      "But these stumbling finishes and slow starts feel like an unnecessary frustration.",
      "It did look like they might be about to buck the trend this time with a six-game winning run through March and April raising genuine hopes of approaching the summer with momentum and optimism.",
      "May, though, has brought a pair of defeats and with games against Palace and Brentford to come there is no guarantee Wolves do snap back out of it before the summer. And as with West Ham above, and Wolves’ own early struggles this season, it would appear a particularly bad time to be offering early hope to newcomers.",
      "Wolves also have a fine manager on their hands; it would be deeply careless should a continuing trend for slow starts leave them feeling the pressure to switch to a tried-and-tested firefighter by November.",
      "Someone like Gary O’Neil, maybe."

      "Arsenal and Andrea Berta are already on top of the most tempting release clauses in world football, with Liverpool eyeing up one with perhaps the best value.",
      "This is an inexhaustive list of players with release clauses which could actually viably be triggered from summer 2025 onwards. We are talking sub-£100m, not your daft £1bn La Liga jobs.",
      "",
      "Joan Garcia\nArsenal are leading ‘half of Europe’ in the race to sign a keeper they almost landed last summer. They will be hoping for smoother talks with Espanyol, and perhaps even for them to lose their La Liga relegation battle as a £20.9m release clause would drop to £12.5m.",
      "",
      "Vanja Milinkovic-Savic\nIf Chelsea or Manchester City act on their apparent £16.7m interest in the Torino keeper and brother of Sergej then expect every other Ruben Amorim press conference to be spent explaining why no-one currently at Manchester United should really be blamed for releasing a teenager who couldn’t get a work permit in 2015. He is 6ft 8ins so that’s something.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale\nAfter suffering his third Premier League relegation in six seasons, all at different clubs and with a spell at Arsenal in between, England international Ramsdale can thank the £25m clause he inserted into his contract for the fact he’ll probably be back in the top flight soon enough.",
      "",
      "Dean Huijsen\nBournemouth spent £12.8m on a teenaged centre-half whose professional career comprised of 15 appearances for Juventus and Roma last July; within a season they are preparing for a £50m auction on their full Spain international.",
      "",
      "Jeremie Frimpong\nThe homegrown bonus of Manchester City academy product Frimpong is obvious but even without it his brilliance at wing-back for Bayer Leverkusen will convince many that £33.5m is something approaching a steal. Liverpool certainly seem to be of that mind.",
      "",
      "Enzo Boyomo\nIt could depend on which European competition Aston Villa qualify for but they are known admirers of Osasuna centre-half Boyomo, who has been crucial for a side he only joined a year ago. Boyomo stayed at Real Valladolid for just one campaign too before moving to Pamplona; whoever triggers his £21m release clause might expect to keep him for a little longer.",
      "",
      "Kevin Lomonaco\n“I really like the Premier League. It’s what I watch the most. I like West Ham,” should raise an absurd number of red flags within the departments of any and all clubs charged with scrutinising the character and even sanity of 23-year-old Lomonaco. The centre-half has attracted interest from the Hammers, Crystal Palace, Sevilla and Wolfsburg in his £16.7m release clause.",
      "",
      "Jan Bednarek\nAny club desperate to sign a centre-half with two recent relegations on his CV can do so for the cheap old price of £6m.",
      "",
      "Martin Zubimendi\nIt is still widely assumed that Arsenal have wrapped up a £50.1m deal for Zubimendi early and avoided all those awkward Didn’t Want Him Anyway hoops Liverpool forced themselves to jump through last summer. But they could start bottling transfers instead of just titles to put the Real Sociedad lifer back on the market.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze\nCrystal Palace averted the potential crisis of having both Eze and Michael Olise’s release clauses triggered in the same summer but the fine print in the former’s deal will be reactivated in the summer. There will be no shortage of potential suitors at £68m.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha\nNot two months separated Cunha signing a four-and-a-half year contract extension with an improved release clause of £62.5m, and the Brazilian saying he has “made it clear that I need to take the next step. I want to fight for titles, for big things,” before claiming to have been misquoted. The reality is that 15 goals and four assists in 29 games for a relegation-battling side will sufficiently tempt someone.",
      "",
      "Nico Williams\nAndrea Berta might have taken up the easiest post in world football considering Arsenal are pursuing yet another player whose valuation is certain. The sporting director just needs to fill in the gaps of persuading Williams that a £48.4m move to north London is in his best interests.",
      "",
      "Wilfred Ndidi\nThere is unlikely to be a massive rush to bring in Ndidi after his second relegation in three year with Leicester, but the 28-year-old is on the radar of Crystal Palace, Everton and Fulham and it does feel as though a more stable environment would benefit him.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres\nAnother Arsenal target – to the chagrin of many supporters – but really any aspiring team in world football will have at least taken a look at Gyokeres before wincing ever so slightly at that £86m release clause. Sporting are among the best sellers across the globe and will back themselves to get the best possible deal.",

      "Victor Osimhen\nA record of 28 goals and five assists in 32 games for Galatasaray can be disregarded through the Turkish Super Lig rule of transfers but his age, affordability (£62.5m) relative to other strikers on the market and undoubted pedigree in Serie A cannot. Osimhen should be top of the Manchester United shopping list.",
      "",
      "Benjamin Sesko\nThere is some debate as to the exact numbers which would compel Leipzig to countenance the sale of Sesko – £62m is the strongest recent claim – but less doubt about whether his record of 35 goals in 79 appearances in Germany is worth the risk on a 21-year-old.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean\nEverton might not get involved but after scoring 23 goals in 42 games this season, Kean could repay the faith shown in him by Fiorentina with another big move. For two weeks from the start of July the Manchester United target is available for as little as £45m.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap\nThe highest-scoring new signing in the Premier League this season is one of only eight players aged 22 or under to reach double figures for goals in Europe’s top five divisions. It would be grossly unfair if Ipswich were able to bring that down to the Championship so the fact a £40m release clause becomes active upon their relegation makes sense.",
      "",

But they will not waver in their determination to extend Iraola’s contract – and perhaps even remove that £10m release clause with Spurs lurking in the shadows.",

      "Serie A giants Inter Milan are ready to propose a loan move with an option to buy for Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee in the summer, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have had their worst ever Premier League campaign with Ruben Amorim’s side currently on a run of seven matches without victory.",
      "Qualification for the final of the Europa League, where they will face Tottenham later this month, has barely masked their current 16th position in the Premier League with just ten wins all season.",
      "Only four teams in the Premier League have scored fewer goals than Man Utd with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund coming in for a lot of criticism this season.",
      "Hojlund and Zirkzee have only scored seven Premier League goals between them this campaign and now Man Utd are looking for new attackers in the summer.",
      "Wolves attacker Matheus Cunha now seems a deal that is very likely to happen with transfer expert Fabrizio Romano confirming that there is a “positive feeling” that a deal – which is at the “advanced stages” – will be done.",
      "READ: Man Utd, Chelsea starlets three of 10 Premier League youngsters ripe for loan",
      "Romano said: “No changes on Manchester United and Matheus Cunha deal: talks remain ongoing with positive feelings on both sides. The deal remains at advanced stages, working on details of the agreement.”",
      "And now Inter Milan are showing interest in Netherlands international Zirkzee with Italian publication Corriere Dello Sport claiming that the Nerazzurri’s intention is ‘to propose a loan with an option to buy to United’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "In an effort to show Man Utd that they are serious about a deal for Zirkzee, the offer from Inter Milan ‘perhaps, under certain conditions, could become an obligation’.",
      "The €40m the Red Devils paid for Zirkzee is described as ‘not a stratospheric figure for a top-level striker’ if Man Utd are looking to get their money back, while ‘even the salary would not be an obstacle’.",
      "As well as Hojlund, ‘it is likely that they too would look favorably on a new placement for Zirkzee’ if INEOS can bring in the new faces they want in the summer.",
      "Speaking in January, The Athletic’s David Ornstein revealed that there was “uncertainty” surrounding Zirkzee’s future at Old Trafford.",
      "Ornstein said: “I think there’s been uncertainty around his immediate future because his transfer so far from Bologna hasn’t really gone to plan. There’s a feeling inside United at the moment that maybe that was a mistake.",
      "“It is very early days, and this story focuses on him and his intentions. Despite a lot of interest reportedly building from elsewhere, he doesn’t intend to leave at the time of recording, and things can change.”",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee will be out for the rest of “this season” after picking up an injury of late.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘re-evaluated’ his attacking options, and has decided to ‘keep’ one striker and ‘listen to offers’ for another.",
      "Ruben Amorim heaped praise on Man United Joshua Zirkzee in his Newcastle press conference, also admitting the likes of Bruno Fernandes may be rested.",
      "Andre Onana should probably keep his mouth shut but that was much better from Manchester United. Joshua Zirkzee has put a debate to bed.",
      "Ruben Amorim has picked out two Man Utd stars who “have to improve” and insists they “must be careful” with Kobbie Mainoo on his return from injury.",
      "The former Man Utd coach claims Ruben Amorim needs to “find a solution” for an “invisible” Red Devils star and his struggling teammate."

      "READ: Man Utd, Chelsea starlets three of 10 Premier League youngsters ripe for loan",
      "“For some reason, it just hasn’t happened the last few years at United. When I was playing my best football it was because I was free, I was expressing myself, enjoying myself.",
      "“It didn’t look like that when Marcus was here. He needs to find a place where he was loved and can reach the levels he is capable of.”",
      "While Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans are expected to depart upon the expiry of their contracts this summer, Man Utd could make money on Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia after their loan spells end.",
      "Giggs has explained why he doesn’t “see a way back” for any of these four players.",

      "“I think he’s already made up his own mind and it might have even been taking out of his own hands by the power that be to bring money in to get his kind of player in.",
      "“Marcus leaves a little bit of a sour taste, he is one of our own, he’s come through, he’s done so well when he was first in the team.",
      "“But he didn’t look happy, he looks under pressure and not enjoying his football.",

      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen has given his verdict on whether Ruben Amorim should be sacked or not if the Red Devils lose to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd have had a nightmare Premier League campaign with Amorim’s side currently winless in their last seven matches after they were beaten 2-0 by West Ham at Old Trafford over the weekend.",
      "The Red Devils are 16th in the Premier League and have won just ten of their 36 matches, while only four sides have scored fewer goals than Amorim’s side this season.",
      "Amorim is under pressure to turn around results ahead of next season with his side’s Europa League campaign glossing over a poor campaign.",
      "Man Utd, who beat Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate in their semi-final, will face Tottenham in the final of the Europa League later this month with the winners qualifying for the Champions League next season.",
      "There had been rumours that a loss in that match could prove costly for Amorim but The Guardian insisted yesterday that Man Utd ‘intend to retain’ Amorim ‘next season even if they lose the Europa League final against Tottenham’.",
      "The Man Utd hierarchy believe that ‘the Portuguese deserves this summer transfer window to improve the squad and sign players better suited to his tactics’.",
      "And former Red Devils assistant manager Meulensteen would back that decision and insists that Amorim “will definitely be there at the start of the season”.",
      "In an exclusive interview with GiveMeSport, Meulensteen said: “You have to give Ruben another season. I’m sure he is not happy that he has not got more out of this squad in the Premier League. He keeps almost confirming that in every interview, which I find a little bit strange.",
      "“What people want to hear is a bit of reassurance. But if you keep saying ‘maybe I’m not the right man for the job’, it doesn’t sound good.",
      "“I don’t know why he keeps saying it. It has been an amazing run in the Europa League and, against Athletic Bilbao, they were very good over two legs. There were no problems and it was a really confident walk into the final.",
      "“But in the final they will play against Tottenham, who have had an equally disastrous season but it’s a Premier League team. Tottenham have definitely shown that they are capable of beating Manchester United.",
      "“They haven’t been firing on all cylinders but, if they have got everybody fit outside of James Maddison and as long as they’ve got Pedro Porro and Micky van de Ven fit and have stability in the backline, it’s a one-off game.",
      "“Amorim will definitely be there at the start of the season, but he has to make improvements in the first three months of the season in the Premier League.”",
      "Amorim claims it was a “simple” decision for him to pay for the Man Utd staff and their families to attend the Europa League final instead of Ratcliffe and INEOS.",
      "Man United boss Ruben Amorim is doing what Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cost-cutting INEOS crew won’t: paying for staff to attend the Europa League final.",
      "Richard Keys has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has ‘ripped the heart out’ of Manchester United, who are now an ’embarrassing’ side that Ruben Amorim doesn’t want to be part ...",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has set a bold target for Man Utd next season after Ruben Amorim admitted he was “embarrassed” by the club’s performance this season.",

      "Chelsea will be busy in the ‘exceptional’ early transfer window added for Club World Cup signings, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United affected.",
      "",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool to Real Madrid)\nLiverpool supporters have undeniably been burned by One Of Their Own choosing to fly the coop. The subsequent scorched-earth policy over Alexander-Arnold has resulted in some Anfield boos and could yet engulf murals, statues and even the official end date of his Liverpool contract.",
      "But the phrasing Liverpool used to confirm the imminent conclusion of a 21-year union felt deliberate while Real Madrid attempt to negotiate a small pay-off to facilitate a quicker exit. They stressed that Alexander-Arnold will leave ‘once his deal ceases on June 30, 2025,’ four days after the Spanish side’s final group game.",
      "If Liverpool are unmoved by the prospect of six-figure offers then Alexander-Arnold could join Los Blancos in time for the knockout stage, the first round of which could well pit Real against Manchester City. Thomas Tuchel could have a say too.",
      "",
      "Alvaro Carreras (Benfica to Real Madrid)\nAs well as Alexander-Arnold and Alonso, it is thought that Real Madrid also want a new centre-half and left-back through the door as early as possible.",
      "William Saliba and Ibrahima Konate are on the shortlist for the former but both will be difficult to procure from elite Premier League sides and Champions League rivals at all, never mind so early in the window.",
      "There is also Jorrel Hato of Ajax, who seems a far more realistic possibility, or Castello Lukeba of Leipzig.",
      "Former Manchester United defender Carreras is the most prominent right-back mentioned, but they have a cheaper option on Juventus target Miguel Gutierrez after selling him to Girona a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Chelsea or Real Madrid)\nChelsea are inevitably expected to be busy, with the wonderfully vague latest round of speculation claiming they want A Winger and A Striker to arrive in time for the tournament.",
      "But their interest in Huijsen is clear, as is the level of competition they will face for him. Bournemouth are unlikely to stand in the way of the centre-half – and a £50m release clause renders that largely out of their hands anyway – and they might not mind if Chelsea’s desperation prevents a summer-long auction.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool are also in the running but Huijsen ‘dreams’ of Real Madrid and Xabi Alonso could have his new squad adorned with a shiny centre-half.",
      "",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest to Manchester City)\nThe belief is that Manchester City will not struggle to agree personal terms with Gibbs-White, but talking Nottingham Forest into ruining European campaign preparations by selling a crucial player with two years left on his contract for anything less than a premium price might be slightly more difficult.",
      "But then winning the Club World Cup could earn almost £100m in prize money so if Gibbs-White can seamlessly replace Kevin de Bruyne the reported nine-figure fee would be repaid instantly.",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Manchester City, Bayern Munich or Real Madrid)\nOne transfer saga already playing out involves a probable £100m playmaker, three European giants and an apparent family disagreement.",
      "While Wirtz himself remains open to any and all outcomes, it is believed that his father favours Bayern Munich and his mother has been championing the fourth option: staying at Leverkusen.",
      "That does seem unlikely after five successful years with the former Bundesliga champions, who stand to lose their manager and a couple of key players this summer.",
      "Wirtz might turn his back on a transitional season and Real Madrid have become contenders through their impending appointment of Alonso. Bayern will always be in contention for a player performing brilliantly in the Bundesliga, while Wirtz and his entourage flew in for talks with Manchester City recently.",
      "",
      "Tijjani Reijnders (Milan to Manchester City)\nInterest in Dutch midfielder Reijnders was said by David Ornstein and James Horncastle to be ‘independent’ of the moves for Gibbs-White and Wirtz, but Manchester City will still encounter difficulties over signing Reijnders.",
      "With ludicrous money planned to be spent elsewhere, PSR will come into play after Milan made it clear that they would settle for nothing less than a record sale. Kaka remains their most expensive outgoing transfer at £56m so the ballpark starts there.",
      "",
      "Joao Felix (Chelsea to Flamengo or Benfica)\nIt remains perhaps the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, playing out entirely predictably with barely any minutes for the Blues followed by a January loan to Milan during which precisely zero needles have moved.",
      "Yet the idea of Felix will forever entice sporting directors with more money than sense, so of course both Flamengo and Benfica have been linked with either a loan or a permanent move which would ideally be put in place in June, and probably lead to Chelsea being stunned that the Portuguese is under contract with them for another six years.",
      "",
      "Jorginho (Arsenal to Flamengo)\n“If Jorginho comes, it will be after the season in Europe ends. I hope it will be in time for the World Cup,” said Flamengo chief Jose Boto in early June. The Brazilian club’s manager, former title-winning Chelsea defender Filipe Luis, has “a lot of respect” for “a great player”.",
      "",
      "Roberto Firmino (Al-Ahli to Flamengo)\nAfter two seasons in Saudi it seems that Firmino wants to enter the next and final phase of his career, rounding things off by playing in Brazil again for a bit.",
      "Flamengo are interested but could encounter complications if they pursue both Jorginho and Firmino, with a pair of players in their 30s stretching the wage bill perhaps too far.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs to Atletico Madrid)\nIt feels unlikely that Diego Simeone would put up with a fraction of the nonsense Romero has inflicted upon Spurs, but equally the Atletico manager is more likely than anyone to coach the ever-loving Christ out of that side of the World Cup winner.",
      "Romero landing at Atletico would be a remarkable and vaguely offensive fall upwards but negotiating with Daniel Levy in any instance seems perilous, never mind when working within a briefer window.",
      "There are suggestions emanating from Spain that the centre-half has agreed a five-year deal to move to the Spanish capital, but the paper that is signed on is worthless unless Spurs receive £60m.",
      "",
      "Alex Baena (Villarreal to Atletico Madrid)\nAtletico are expected to be busy and could use their Club World Cup spot as an excuse to expedite those summer plans.",
      "A disappointing drop-off in three competitions has persuaded Simeone to bring in reinforcements and beating Barcelona to the signature of Baena would be a fine start, although winning a transfer race against a side with no money should really be a given.",
      "Villarreal will be satisfied provided the 23-year-old’s £38.2m release clause is paid.",
      "",
      "Tom Bischof (Hoffenheim to Bayern Munich)\nLiverpool might closely monitor how talks between Hoffenheim and Bayern Munich go over an academy graduate’s early release from his contract in time to join up with new employers in the United States.",
      "The champions announced in January that Bischof would be joining upon the expiration of his Hoffenheim deal at the end of the season. That was before the ‘exceptional’ window was added, since which Bayern have decided they would quite like to open their present early actually.",
      "“Bayern have already contacted us. We won’t stand in Tom Bischof’s way,” said Hoffenheim sporting director Andreas Schicker. “If a good solution can be found, he can take part in the Club World Cup,” he added, with “good solution” in this instance apparently German for ‘suitable compensatory package’.",
      "Anything more than £500,000 and Liverpool will be forwarding copies of the deal to the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "Mats Hummels (Roma to Borussia Dortmund)\nWhile Hummels announced his imminent retirement from playing in April, he is human and the lure of facing Fluminense, Ulsan HD and Mamelodi Sundowns can only be resisted for so long.",
      "It can only be assumed that Roma are not particularly bothered about keeping the bench-warmer for any longer than is necessary, which means the one remaining obstacle to a stunning comeback is basically injury.",
      "Nico Schlotterbeck is sidelined for the foreseeable, and if Dortmund suffer one more setback in defence then chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke has already publicly described an emergency deal for Hummels as “the first alternative”.",
      "",
      "David Hancko (Feyenoord to Juventus)\nTwo factors prevented Hancko from joining Liverpool and reuniting with Arne Slot this season, but the ship on his big move might not necessarily have sailed. After three years in the Eredivisie, Serie A might be calling.",
      "Juventus made their move in January but were greeted with a brick wall as Feyenoord refused to countenance the mid-season loss of two important players, Santiago Gimenez having already left for Milan.",
      "But their interest has not waned and the draw masters are hoping to welcome Hancko early, reportedly agreeing a five-year contract with the small matter of meeting the £25.5m asking price to come.",
      "",
      "Luis Henrique (Marseille to Inter)\nThe Champions League finalists are not resting on their laurels and have seen off competition from Juventus and Bayern Munich to agree personal terms with Marseille forward Henrique.",
      "Inter are eager to push the deal through in time for the Club World Cup, with Marseille only likely to be moved by offers of around £25.5m.",
      "",
      "Oumar Solet (Udinese to Inter)\nPetar Sucic is scheduled to arrive from Dinamo Zagreb for around £10m this summer, leaving defence as the remaining position of interest for the Italians.",
      "French youth international centre-half Solet only joined Udinese in January but has been mentioned; Genoa’s Koni De Winters is on a list of alternatives.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Victor Osimhen, Marco Silva, Nuno Espirito Santo, Simone Inzaghi, Xavi and Jose Mourinho to Al-Hilal\nThe money set aside for the doomed pursuit of Mo Salah has been retained by Al-Hilal while they identify the marquee name they would like instead. A £510m budget probably won’t be governed by PSR restrictions.",
      "Only two players have been named with any degree of conviction, with ‘top target’ Fernandes the subject of a ‘record-breaking’ move – reports of a £60m release clause have been rubbished – and £63.7m Osimhen always an option considering his availability.",
      "There is also the small matter of who has the honour of guiding Al-Hilal into the tournament, with Jorge Jesus sacked following defeat in the Asian Champions League semi-final.",
      "The well-connected Ben Jacobs produced a list of replacements including but not limited to the managers of Fulham, Nottingham Forest, Champions League finalists Inter and Fenerbahce, as well as the unoccupied Xavi.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Al-Hilal)\nLiverpool could also be heavily impacted by the Saudi side’s desperation to make a transfer statement ahead of the Club World Cup, with two known targets still on the radar.",
      "Nunez was the subject of at least one January bid from Al-Hilal, while Diaz was targeted by the same club in the summer of 2023. Liverpool could generate £136m with a double sale but it seems unlikely they will dispense with both.",
      "",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr to anyone)\nSince it became clear his actual team would take no part, the media have done their utmost to deliver one final chapter in the Ronaldo v Messi story by linking the Portuguese with a temporary move to all manner of participating teams.",
      "The first round of speculation came before he extended a contract which was set to expire at the end of this season, when the idea of a one-month spell with one of the teams involved was mooted. Al-Hilal, Inter and Real Madrid were mentioned.",
      "In recent weeks Chelsea and Palmeiras have joined the ranks of clubs who cannot afford Ronaldo even for four weeks and know the circus surrounding him is not vaguely worth sacrificing squad harmony and morale.",
      "READ NEXT: Club World Cup 2025: What is it, why is it, who’s in it, should we care, and where can we watch on TV?",
      "Gary Neville has labelled Real Madrid’s “p*ss-take” bid to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold early as an “insult” to Liverpool.",

      "Some modern legends of the game are out of contract in 2025; will they sign on again to give themselves a shot at World Cup 2026?",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold’s move to Real Madrid is reportedly ‘close’ to being confirmed as Liverpool have set the price for the Spanish giants to pay.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal are one of three Premier League clubs ready to pay £50m for Dean Huijsen, who ‘dreams’ of joining Real Madrid.",

      "Daniel Farke is going to be a busy man, and exploring the loan market could be a stellar method to improve his squad and ultimately stay up.",
      "Here are 10 Premier League youngsters Leeds (or the clubs around them) should try to sign on loan in the summer transfer window…",
      "",
      "Evan Ferguson (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nGod bless Brighton and their world-class recruitment team. Albion players account for 30% of this feature and it could have been a lot higher, ignoring Valentin Barco, Facundo Buonanotte and a couple of others. We start with former wonderkid-turned-disappointment Evan Ferguson.",
      "The Irish striker might think he has bigger fish to fry than newly promoted Leeds United, but we’re not sure. After all, he’s currently warming the bench for West Ham – a team 15th in the Premier League – after struggling to play for Brighton in the first half of 2024/25.",
      "There was talk in January of one of the ‘Big Six’, namely Arsenal, looking at him as an emergency option, but that never came close and he ultimately joined a wildly underperforming team who have been unable to improve under Julen Lopetegui’s replacement, Graham Potter.",
      "Brighton and Ferguson need to work out a way to untap the potential everyone was ranting and raving about in 2022, because his stock is falling dramatically and a player once guaranteed to fetch the Seagulls at least £100million is now worth less than half that amount. Another loan might be ruled out considering how poorly his Hammers spell has gone, but minutes are much more likely at a newly promoted team like Leeds, even if Joel Piroe bagged 19 in the Championship this term.",
      "WIN Europa League final tickets – and support the Red Cross",
      "",
      "Harry Amass (Manchester United)\nManchester United are in no way inclined to hand out favours to Leeds United and Leeds United are probably too proud to go to Old Trafford asking for help. Regardless, we have families to feed and want a Man United player in this list.",
      "There is, as always, logic behind this. Leeds are set to lose Junior Firpo – reportedly to Real Betis – and need to sign at least one left-back in the summer. Getting a promising Premier League youngster on loan is cost-effective, but if the profile is right, also very clever on-the-pitch-wise.",
      "Amass’ integration into the United first team has been far from seamless, even though we were told he’d fit Ruben Amorim’s system to a tee. He’s struggled, and that’s to be expected really, given how dysfunctional and easy to play against this United team is.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is the first-choice left-wing-back and Luke Shaw – also able to play left-centre-back – is likely ahead of Amass in the pecking order, so Amass could do with a year out on loan. Rivalries aside, we honestly think Elland Road would be perfect.",
      "",
      "Julio Enciso (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nEnciso is one of Brighton’s most promising youngsters and he has impressed on loan in a rubbish Ipswich Town team. Fingers cannot be pointed at the young Paraguayan for Ipswich’s relegation this season; he has been one of very few bright spots in a miserable campaign.",
      "He is the sort of player capable of getting you off your seat, whether that be with a 30-yard screamer or a piece of skill, which is one of the fundamentals you want from a young whippersnapper, as well as energy, commitment and effort. Which might all basically be the same thing.",
      "Brighton might be reluctant to send Enciso to a promoted club again considering the last six all went immediately back down without putting up much of a fight, but Leeds feel… different. If there’s a Championship club that stands a chance of staying in the Premier League, it’s them. There isn’t much logic to this other than they’re a big club with a rich history. Yep, it looks like we are relying on aura for a relegation battle. Excellent.",
      "",
      "Marc Guiu (Chelsea)\nThere is no way into the Chelsea team for poor Guiu, who turned down an equally difficult pathway at Barcelona to earn more money in London. Game time has been scarce and almost exclusively only in the league phase of the Europa Conference League, and it would make no sense to stagnate his career and development further by keeping him on the periphery again next season.",
      "He is only 19 and six goals in six European games is a positive sign, especially the first-half hat-trick he scored against… Shamrock Rovers. FFS. And we thought the financial disparity between Chelsea and semi-final opponents Djurgardens was bad.",
      "A hamstring injury has ruled Guiu out since February, but even so, he couldn’t get a kick in the Premier League when fit. Leeds and Burnley should give serious thought to signing the Spanish striker this summer, even if we’re not sure how good he is yet.",
      "",
      "Lewis Miley (Newcastle United)\nThis is ambitious, but not completely out of the question. Newcastle are set to return to the Champions League, barring a complete disaster, and will need a big squad in 2025/26 to ensure lightning doesn’t strike twice and they falter domestically as well as in Europe. That makes keeping Miley more sensible than sending him out on loan to Leeds, but there is still a strong chance it could be a career-defining move for the young Geordie.",
      "For a city obsessed with football, Newcastle doesn’t produce a vast amount of talent and Miley is arguably their best academy graduate this century. Eddie Howe will be very careful with his development and won’t make any rash loan decisions. Leeds will need to ensure they are right for him if by some chance they do target Miley. And if they get him, they’ve got a reyt gem.",
      "",
      "Ibrahim Osman (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nCurrently on loan at Feyenoord in the Eredivisie, Osman cost Brighton £16million last February and was sent to the Netherlands in August. Three goals and three assists in the Dutch top flight is pretty underwhelming, especially in comparison to Yankuba Minteh – who left Newcastle for Brighton last summer after a season at Feyenoord – and his 10 goals and three assists.",
      "Osman doesn’t seem ready to come in and play consistently for the Seagulls and after an average loan abroad, joining a newly promoted Premier League team feels like a natural next step.",
      "Leeds’ attack was devastating in the 2024/25 Championship, scoring 95 goals – a division high by 24. Second? Norwich City down in 13th, obviously. Still, they will need more quality up front, especially if Manor Solomon doesn’t join permanently or extend his loan.",
      "",
      "Luis Guilherme (West Ham)\nSpeaking of which, the Whites could probably do with at least two new forwards. Finding a game-changing addition or their next Raphinha is a big ask, so the low-risk additions of Osman and/or West Ham’s Luis Guilherme could work.",
      "The issue with this one is that no-one really knows if Guilherme is any good. We’re not sure if Graham Potter even knows. The positive thing is that he’s a young Brazilian winger and Brazil have produced loads of world-class ones. Let’s just hope he can get closer to the level of Raphinha and Vinicius Junior than Marquinhos and Kenedy.",
      "",
      "Josh Acheampong (Chelsea)\nFocusing entirely on the forward areas would be naïve and very costly. As touched on already, a new left-back is a priority for Daniel Farke, but adding someone with the versatility of Acheampong would go a long way to providing the depth necessary to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Like most players at Chelsea, the 19-year-old is under contract for the foreseeable, signing an extension until 2029 last December, so the Blues clearly rate him highly, and if they do, there’s a strong chance they give him a loan to spread his wings in 2025/26.",
      "He is capable of playing right and centre-back, and there is not one downside we can think of for Leeds, Chelsea or Acheampong.",
      "",
      "Archie Gray (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThis is extremely unrealistic considering how much football Archie Gray has played this season, but considering it’s Leeds we are talking about, there is a chance… ever so slightly.",
      "The reasons for Spurs not sanctioning the loan exit of Gray are much more compelling than the reasons to do it, if we are not jumping the gun by going plural there.",
      "The 19-year-old used to play for Leeds and is welcome back at Elland Road. Go on, Spurs, make it happen; it could be the perfect way to give Gray some positional stability and ensure his progress is not further hindered.",
      "",
      "Stefan Bajcetic (Liverpool)\nForgotten Liverpool starlet Bajcetic has been on loan at RB Salzburg and Las Palmas this season, reuniting with Pep Lijnders in Austria. Jurgen Klopp’s old assistant manager lasted 29 games and six months before being sacked.",
      "Liverpool snapped up Bajcetic for a measly £224,000 in December 2020, making his first-team debut a little under two years later. After showing immense promise, injuries began to hold him back and a loan was the right call last summer. Still, it’s not been a comfortable year for the 20-year-old, who was recalled in January and instantly sent to Las Palmas in his native Spain.",
      "At least moving to La Liga was the right call. He’s played a lot more in his home country, but his performances haven’t been great. Next year could be make-or-break for Bajcetic, and Leeds signing him would be risky, but the potential reward is huge.",
      "READ NEXT: Football fans love to hate and love to scoff; this misery-full weekend left us delighted",
      "The resurgence of Marcus Rashford is excellent if embarrassing news for Manchester United, with Arsenal and Spurs loanees far less likely to join permanently.",

It would be annoying if the Old Trafford Banter Years swept up yet another trinket to pull further clear of Arsenal’s haul in this renaissance period, but the alternative of Spurs being happy is unthinkable.",

It feels as though the Seagulls will probably be shopping in more similar markets to the latter this summer so removing the lure of the Champions League from the transfer equation could be advantageous.",

      "Matheus Cunha’s anticipated move to Manchester United is edging closer, with the deal reportedly set to reach a total of €80million (£67.2million).",
      "The Brazilian forward is expected to leave Wolves this summer after signing a new contract in February that included a release clause in the region of £60 million.",
      "Cunha has been outstanding for Wolves this season, scoring 15 goals and providing six assists in 31 Premier League appearances.",
      "His most recent performance against Brighton was less than ideal, as he gave away a penalty, but there is no chance that interested clubs will be deterred.",
      "United are the frontrunners for Cunha’s signature, despite Arsenal showing interest during the winter transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils are reportedly in talks with Wolves, and transfer journalist Valentin Furlan claims the deal could reach €80m (£67.2m). This would include a €74 million release clause, along with an additional €6 million in ‘extras.’",
      "Though Arsenal made a ‘late approach’, discussions between United and Wolves have continued to progress.",
      "United’s pursuit of Cunha has been steady, and a ‘verbal agreement’ between the two clubs is reportedly close.",
      "While the deal has not yet been finalised, the groundwork for the transfer is in place, with personal terms for Cunha nearing completion, Furlan adds.",
      "Cunha’s potential move to United – who are 16th in the Premier League – would be part of the club’s ongoing efforts to strengthen their attack, following a season marked by inconsistency in the final third.",
      "The Brazilian’s versatility – capable of playing as a central striker, winger, or No.10 – makes him an appealing option.",
      "Despite Arsenal’s late interest, it is understood that Cunha is keen to join United, where he is likely to feature as a wide No.10 in their front three.",
      "Wolves, for their part, have been preparing for Cunha’s potential departure, which would bring in a significant transfer fee.",
      "Along with Cunha, United are also interested in adding Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap this summer.",
      "Reports suggest that United are in competition with several clubs for Delap, with his £30million relegation release clause being a key factor.",
      "In addition to strengthening their attack, United are also eyeing a new wing-back and central midfielder.",
      "The club’s summer transfer plans are heavily dependent on the result of the Europa League final, as victory over Spurs would secure a spot in next season’s Champions League, along with £100million in prize money.",
      "Ex-Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs has picked out two ideal signings for his former club, who need “ten” additions to get back on track.",

      "A former England international has likened one of Man Utd’s summer transfer targets to Eric Cantona, but warns they’ll need to do much more.",

      "There is a possibility of a bidding war, even with the release clause in place, given how many clubs want to sign him.",

      "“What we’re hearing this afternoon is that Manchester United are in pole position to sign him. One source has even told us that he believes the deal is very close and that the player would be happy to move to Manchester United, even though United aren’t having a great season. He still feels they’re a big, big club.",

      "“Obviously, the top, top players have other options, but lots of clubs are interested in signing Liam Delap — Chelsea, for example. Potentially Nottingham Forest as well.",
      "“But I think it’s interesting that United are currently in pole position, and we believe the player would be happy to move there. Although, I think maybe we should wait and see what happens in the Europa League final next week.",
      "“I think United will be able to pay his release clause anyway. It’s £30million, which, in the grand scheme of things for top clubs — even in the PSR era, even if you’re not in the Champions League — United should be able to afford.",
      "“But I think from a player’s perspective, it might be wise to wait and see what happens over the next few days. For instance, whether Chelsea are going to be in the Champions League, and whether Manchester United will be. But I think, regardless of that, I get the feeling the player would be up for moving to United, even if they don’t make the Champions League.”",

      "Wednesday 14 May 2025 19:27, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has said he is far from quitting as Manchester United boss after warning he could walk away if results do not improve next season.",
      "Amorim was \"embarrassed\" after West Ham came to Old Trafford and won for the first time in nine matches to move above United, whose dreadful Premier League campaign has left them 16th in the table after losing 17 games.",
      "The United boss warned that everyone at the club must \"seriously think about a lot of things\" before saying they should \"give space to other people\" if the poor form continues after the summer.",
      "But Amorim insisted in his press conference ahead of next Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham that he has no plans to step down.",
      "Asked if he would seriously resign, Amorim said: \"I am far from quitting.\"",
      "\"What I am saying is that since I arrived here I am always talking about the standards. I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League, and not say something and take responsibility,\" he added.",
      "\"I have a clear plan of what to do. I understand the problems of the team.\"",
      "But the United boss, far more upbeat than in the aftermath of the defeat to West Ham, warned \"we need to perform or else they will change us\".",
      "Amorim also confirmed he had agreed to pay for his backroom staff to go to next week's Europa League final after reports claimed the club would not be covering the cost of their tickets.",
      "This is just the latest cost-cutting measure implemented under United's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has overseen more than 400 redundancies since taking control of football operations from the Glazer family.",
      "Amorim, who acknowledged it is \"hard to manage things\" at United, said the cut-backs made it difficult for the club to pay for those staff still in a job.",
      "\"We have had a lot of people leaving and a lot of changes in our staff,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"In our club at the moment it is sometimes hard to understand when to take and when to give and to respect the people when we have taken their jobs to survive and rebuild.",
      "\"It is complicated for the club to give to other members of staff, so it is a really hard position.",
      "\"That situation was explained and my reaction was to help because - I am not a good guy - it is not going to change my life. The players had the same reaction.",
      "\"Everybody wants the staff and the families there.\"",
      "Amorim says injured United defenders Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven and Diogo Dalot are pushing to feature in next week's Europa League final.",
      "Yoro joined fellow centre-backs De Ligt and Heaven on the sidelines after limping off in Sunday's 2-0 loss to West Ham with a foot injury.",
      "The trio were absent from training just a week out from facing Spurs and head coach Amorim said: \"I don't know if they are going to be available.",
      "\"We are going to try to push because it's the final matches and this is a final, you know that. All the players want to play that really bad, so I don't know.",
      "\"I think they will not go to Chelsea [on Friday], but we will have a possibility to have some of them in the final.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are ruled out of the match against Tottenham next Wednesday.",
      "Jonny Evans and Toby Collyer were in training a week out from the final, while full-back Dalot did an individual session before the main group trained as he seeks to make it to Spain.",
      "The 26-year-old has made 51 appearances for United this term in all competitions but last month suffered a potentially season-ending calf injury.",
      "\"Dalot is trying really bad,\" Amorim said. \"I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, second injury [follows] and then it's a big thing.",
      "\"We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad, so we will see but he's working really hard to get in the final.\"",
      "\"I am working really hard, you can imagine how much I want to be back as soon as possible,\" he said."

      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",

      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",

      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",

      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Monday 12 May 2025 10:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim insists Man Utd are \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\" after admitting to being “embarrassed” about his side's lack of urgency amid their Premier League struggles.",
      "United returned to earth with a bump three days after reaching the Europa League final as fellow strugglers West Ham secured their first Premier League win at Old Trafford since 2007.",
      "Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen scored in a 2-0 triumph that meant United have now lost an eye-watering 17 top-flight matches this term, with nine of them coming on home turf.",
      "Their latest meek performance infuriated Amorim, who says there is a \"lack of urgency in everything we do\" and a worrying mentality at a club sitting 16th in the standings.",
      "\"For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK', and 'we cannot change our position so much so it's OK',\" the United boss said.",
      "\"That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.\"",
      "Amorim said it is \"the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club\" - one that is without a league title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",
      "\"I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here. Everybody is thinking about the final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club.",
      "\"We have bigger things to think and we have to change a lot of things in the end of the season.\"",
      "Amorim then appeared to cast doubt over his own role at United he reiterated that United \"need to change a lot of things during the summer\" and acknowledged that could eventually lead to a change in the dugout, having overseen just six league wins since succeeding Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Asked how he changes the players' attitude given his struggles to do so, he said: \"I don't know, and I don't want to talk about players. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team.",
      "\"I have that feeling, we need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this.",
      "\"If we start like this, or if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.\"",
      "So poor have United been that he even suggested that Champions League qualification may be an issue.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I'm not concerned about the final,\" he said. \"It's by far the smallest problem in our club. We need to change something that is deeper than this.",
      "\"We are showing that in the end of this season that playing Premier League and Champions League for us is the moon, so we need to know that.",
      "\"I'm not concerned about the final. They (the players) will be focused and I don't know what is best, if it's playing Champions League or not. So, let's think about Chelsea to improve a lot of things.\"",
      "Man Utd deserve to be in a relegation scrap.",
      "If you take the three relegated clubs out of the equation, Manchester United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games.",
      "They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and top-flight is so great, otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go. If they lose both their remaining league games, they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",
      "Apart from the flashy feet of Amad Diallo, who got 80 minutes under his belt down the right-flank, this was another dispiriting afternoon for the locals. West Ham carried the greater attacking threat, were more robust without the ball and were clinical with their finishing.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Yet this team are one win away from playing Champions League football next season. Someone make it make sense."

      "Amad was the spark and he was denied by a smart save from Alphonse Areola, but the atmosphere soon went flat as West Ham, who were without win in eight league games themselves, took control.",
      "Mohammed Kudus was the standout player on the pitch and his drilled cross into the six-yard box was flicked in from close range by Tomas Soucek to give the visitors the lead.",

      "The West Ham supporters were celebrating again soon after as Manuel Ugarte was caught in possession by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Kudus then exploded into space and the ball broke for Wan-Bissaka, who decided against shooting and played the ball across goal for Bowen to tap home at the far post.",
      "Man Utd tried to find a way back into the game and their best opportunity fell to Rasmus Hojlund, but the striker was brilliantly denied from close range by Areola at full stretch as the Hammers sealed a first league win since February.",

You can feel it at the beginning of the game. Between our box and opponent's box there is a lack of urgency. That is something we have to change in this club.",

      "West Ham have completed only their fifth top-flight double over United, after 1926/27, 1928/29, 1976/77, and 2006/07. Indeed, this was the Hammers' first league win at Old Trafford since 2006/07, ending a run of 16 league trips there without a win (drawn three and lost 13).",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game.",

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.",
      "Surely but surely nobody can argue this is anything but a successful season.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",

      "UEFA has also introduced a new \"value pillar\" of payments for the first time this season - which could be worth an additional £10.5m to clubs.",
      "This is a complicated bonus based on your club's historical success in Europe and how much your country pays for its broadcast rights to the Champions League.",
      "As we approach the end of the Premier League season, just seven points separate six teams fighting for the remaining places below champions Liverpool, whose place is already assured.",
      "Crucially, England's co-efficient score means the Premier League has five spots this season, rather than the usual four.",
      "Arsenal could clinch their place with victory over Liverpool on Super Sunday, with Man City, Newcastle and Chelsea currently occupying the other spots, and Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Five spots will become six now that both Tottenham and Manchester United have reached the Europa League final.",
      "Both sides are in the bottom half in the Premier League and not in the conversation for a top-five finish, but the Europa League winners earn qualification to the Champions League.",
      "An English Europa League winner does not mean the fifth-placed Premier League team lose their Champions League place."
