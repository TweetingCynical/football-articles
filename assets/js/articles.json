      "Ben Foster has lifted the lid on Cristiano Ronaldo's freakish dedication behind the scenes at Manchester United, revealing the superstar had no interest in joining his team-mates for a drink. The former Red Devils goalkeeper has highlighted how Ronaldo's work ethic was on another level and he was often the first to arrive and last to leave the club's Carrington training ground.",
      "The pair played together during Ronaldo's first spell at Old Trafford when he was signed as an 18-year-old from Sporting CP in 2003. Foster joined United two years later and witnessed the legendary Portuguese forward's commitment to learning his craft first hand.",
      "A large amount of importance is often placed on attending team social events at football clubs. Foster disclosed earlier this month how the biggest penalty on his old club Wrexham's internal fines list is for missing the players' Christ‎mas night out.",
      "However, he said Ronaldo was excused by his colleagues over his refusal to go out drinking due to his immense talent. The ex-Real Madrid and Juventus star is still playing at the age of 40 and finding the net regularly for Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr and the Portugal national team.",
      "He has now scored a record 143 goals in 225 games for his country, as well as 805 in 1,068 appearances at club level. And Foster believes Ronaldo's strong professionalism has been key to the longevity of his career.",
      "Speaking during an appearance on talkSPORT, the former England shot-stopper said: \"He was absolutely always on it, the first one in and last one to leave training. I'd get there early sometimes and he'd already been there. He'd already had all his massages and he'd be in the gym.",
      "\"There's nobody else who can do what Cristiano has done and maintain this level for so long. He's a freak. He had no interest in it [going for a drink]. Honestly, he's not a drinker. Ronnie has got no inkling to want to get involved.",
      "\"He knew that there would be people trying to sort of expose him, or take pictures or get him in uncompromising positions. When it comes to football and wanting to do it properly and working hard, he's there.",
      "\"He might not want to get involved off the pitch with all the little bits and bobs, but when it comes to football duty and training hard and doing everything professionally and properly, he was top of the list.\"",
      "Ronaldo's attitude made him a popular figure with United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, with Foster describing him as the \"teacher's pet\". However, he said being favoured by the Scotsman was a fair reward for his performances on the pitch.",
      "\"He would always talk glowingly about Ronaldo, but it was quite easy to talk glowingly about him,\" Foster said. \"He did everything properly behind the scenes. He was never disruptive and he wanted to work out.",
      "\"When he got on the pitch on a Saturday afternoon or for a Champions League match on a Wednesday night, it was invariably him who would be rescuing the team. It's quite easy to talk glowingly about somebody like that, but it was very obvious that he was definitely the teacher's pet.\"",

      "Ex-Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp's reaction to having a fake Manchester United contract put in front of him said it all. United could be in search of a new head coach should Ruben Amorim's poor run continue.",
      "One name that has loosely cropped up as a potential replacement should Amorim be sacked is former Liverpool manager Klopp. The idea of Klopp signing for the Reds' bitter rivals is unfathomable, but we were given a small glimpse into how he might react to a United offer back in 2024.",
      "Liverpool had just exited the FA Cup at the hands of United 4-3 in April of last year in what was Klopp's final season in charge before he made way for Arne Slot.",
      "The loss was a crushing one as young Amad Diallo sealed Erik ten Hag's team's win in the dying seconds. Upon entering the press room, ready to speak to the media in an understandably disgruntled headspace, a bizarre piece of paperwork appeared in front of Klopp.",
      "As Klopp sat down for his presser at Old Trafford, he held up what appeared to be a signed United contract, expressing his confusion. But things were not as they seemed.",
      "The contract was signed by YouTuber and popular streamer IShowSpeed, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr. The internet celebrity, known for his outrageous antics in videos, visited Old Trafford that year due to his admiration for club legend Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "United welcomed the 20-year-old American by offering a tour of the dressing room, giving him his own jersey and inviting him to the press room, where he signed a mock contract.",
      "It's uncertain whether the contract was intentionally left behind to unsettle the Liverpool boss after the match, especially since his tenure at Anfield was ending that summer. Nonetheless, Klopp appeared bemused by the ordeal.",
      "Regardless, Klopp ever managing United is unthinkable. After stepping away from his role at Anfield, he took up a position with Red Bull as their Head of Global Soccer.",
      "Klopp dropped a hint as to whether he'll ever manage again last month. He was asked by The Athletic if he missed being a coach and replied: \"Not. At. All.",
      "\"I was super happy with the way Liverpool performed [last season]. I watched some games. But it is not like, 'Oh, it's Saturday!' I didn't know when games started.",

      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko has received mixed reviews in the early days of his Old Trafford career. The 22-year-old arrived at United from RB Leipzig in the recent summer transfer window for a fee which could rise to £73.7million.",
      "The Red Devils beat Champions League side Newcastle United to Sesko's signature, with Arsenal also interested in the forward before opting to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting instead. Sesko endured a slow start to life at M16, with no goals in his first six appearances for Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "But the Slovenian has picked up some form with two goals in his last two appearances. Amorim will be hoping his striker can prove some of his critics wrong, with Sunday's trip to Premier League champions Liverpool a perfect opportunity to show his worth.",
      "With all that said, below is a look at some of the United legends to have questioned Sesko - despite his recent good form for Amorim's men.",
      "Rio Ferdinand admitted in September that he was 'worried' about Sesko's quiet start to life at the Red Devils.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the former United and England defender said: \"The one I'm worried about is Sesko. He ain't getting no chances man, he ain't getting no opportunities, there's nothing created for him.",
      "\"That's the concern. A new striker comes in the football club, gets in the team, you've got to think about creating chances for him. Getting him on the end of things. He's got to think about getting on the end of things.",
      "\"That's something I think has got to be looked at, and fixed quick. I don't want to think about what it could turn out to be.\"",
      "Former midfielder Nicky Butt feared last month that United have made a mistake by signing Sesko instead of a more ‘experienced striker’.",
      "Asked if he was impressed by United’s summer business, Butt told BetMGM: \"I was and I wasn’t. I know [Matheus] Cunha has done really well over the last couple of seasons, but I would really like an experienced striker.",
      "\"I hope I’m wrong, but I really hope they aren’t making the same mistakes with [Benjamin] Sesko as they did with Rasmus [Hojlund]. A young player coming in with no Premier League experience - it just feels like history repeating itself.",
      "\"Honestly, for what it would have cost, I would have gone and brought in someone like Ollie Watkins, someone to help and pull the young strikers out of a bad patch. When young players are just coming into the club, when the onus is on them to score goals, if they’re having a few bad games, they have to have the safety net of being pulled out of the firing line.",
      "\"Ollie Watkins, or someone like that, would be who I would have been looking to bring in.\"",
      "Ex-goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has claimed signing Sesko and offloading Rasmus Hojlund was a 'weird' decision from United during the summer transfer window.",
      "\"The signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years,\" Schmeichel told BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "\"You only have to see what he's doing at Napoli with Kevin de Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with - he's scoring goals. I've consistently said this for two-and-a-half years - Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goal-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "\"We let him go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service.",
      "\"You spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don't have the number six we should have, and there's the goalkeeping position as well.\"",
      "Paul Scholes has been another former player to question Sesko's signing - comparing him to Hojlund.",
      "\"You look at Rasmus Hojlund, 22-year-old kid, came when he was 20 years of age,' Scholes said on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast.",
      "\"One centre-forward for Manchester United and everything was on him, the pressure was on him and he couldn't handle it. He should be coming in and out of the team. There should be three or four centre-forwards there.",
      "\"This summer, what do they do? They let him go and they buy another one, very similar, exactly the same! 22 years of age. He's started ok, he looks like he's getting better. But where's the common sense in that?\"",

Matheus Cunha has revealed he will play in any position Amorim asks him to. But he's missing the point. Instead, Cunha should be telling Amorim to pick him in his best position - the one from where he can be most effective.",

      "Cunha speaks of the 'privilege' of wearing that famous United shirt. But it is one that can weigh heavy like a burden, too, on big signings like him. And he needs to stop talking of how grateful he is to be at United, and focus on helping them get back to being successful.",
      "Winning at Anfield would be a great place to start. And Amorim needs to do what some other managers have done in recent times, and exploit Liverpool's defensive weaknesses.",
      "He needs the likes of Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes to get in behind Liverpool's back four.",
      "Show the reigning champions some respect, but not too much.",
      "Amorim should break with tradition, cast aside his 3-4-3 and go with a 4-2-3-1 formation. He needs protection in front of his defensive line, with Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro providing a shield and base for United's more attacking stars to thrive.",
      "United have a forward line which compares to the best around. But what's the point, if this isn't being exploited?",
      "Amorim insists not even the Pope himself could persuade him to change an approach and formation which continues to fail.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim looks to be aiming to complete a special Mason Mount project over the next few months. Despite missing a few weeks through injury, the 26-year-old made his fourth start of the season in the 2-0 win over Sunderland before the October international break.",
      "Mount had already featured from the off against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley, though he was forced off at half-time against the latter. The former Chelsea man marked his first start since then with a superb touch and finish from the edge of the box against the Black Cats at Old Trafford.",
      "His inclusion resulted in Matheus Cunha dropping down to the bench, with many seeing that as a surprise given the expectation he would form a front three with fellow new arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, that now looks unlikely, as Amorim considers Mount to be a \"super talent\", according to The Sun. They have also claimed that Mount is viewed by Amorim as England's most underrated player and is of the belief there is not an attacker like him in Thomas Tuchel's squad.",
      "Though Amorim will not be in charge of the decision, it has been added in their report that he will be taking some action, as he is planning to do everything he can to give Mount a platform to impress Tuchel.",
      "One thing in Mount's favour is the fact that Tuchel is in charge, with the duo having won the Champions League together back in 2021. However, the likes of Morgan Rogers, Cole Palmer, Eberechi Eze, Jude Bellingham and Morgan Gibbs-White will almost certainly be ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "It is no surprise that Amorim has these private feelings on Mount given what he has said about him publicly in the past.",
      "“I really love Mason Mount,” he admitted back in March. “I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club. We will try to manage the load.",
      "“You saw players who had a lot of problems in time, but they can then stay fit and I believe a lot in Mason Mount. We need players like Mason Mount.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, Mount is fully behind Amorim, with the United attacker offering a verdict on his uncertain future at the start of October.",
      "“We’re 100% behind the gaffer,” Mount told BBC Sport. “We’ve had some results that hurt us – the team, the staff and the fans – but that was important today.",
      "“We thought after Chelsea it would be the start of something and then we go to Brentford and have a disappointing result. It starts today and we’ll be working hard over the break. We want to get back-to-back wins, then three in a row and push on for the top four.”",

      "Callum Gribbin was tipped for big things at Manchester United. But at 26 years old, he isn't garnering the £100million fee that academy coaches once thought he might be worth.",
      "The Salford-born dynamic midfielder joined United's academy at a young age and caught early comparisons to Ryan Giggs. Liverpool and Manchester City reportedly came calling when he was 16, but he committed his future to his boyhood Premier League side and penned a four-year deal, beginning with a one-year scholarship.",
      "United icon Nicky Butt later sang his praises after an under-19 UEFA Youth League performance, but Gribbin's potential was never realised. He was released in 2019 after injury troubles and after spells with Barrow, Radcliffe and FC United of Manchester, he signed for Northern Premier League side Warrington Rylands in February.",
      "Discussing his situation in 2024, Gribbin detailed his United departure, claiming that academy coaches stated he'd either return as a £100m footballer or be working in a fast food restaurant.",

      "Gribbin continued: \"I definitely see football differently now. As a kid, I just loved it. Then you get older and you realise it's ruthless and not as you imagined when you were growing up.",
      "\"I can understand why so many people fall out of love with it. I've not gone through that myself – I don't think I have ever fallen out of love with it. But you do have this distaste for it sometimes because there are parts of the game that are cruel.",
      "\"I do have to take some responsibility and say, when I was younger, I didn't handle myself in the best way. I let myself down massively at times. Towards the end of my time at United, I was difficult.",
      "\"I wasn't getting a chance in the first team and I was unhappy about it. I went into self-destruct and started getting up to the wrong things away from football.",
      "\"I was immature and, because I was so talented, I think I relied on it. I abused it over the years. I relied on my talent getting me through all the time. So I do think I needed the lesson of getting released. I have grown up so much. Looking back, I see it completely different now from how I did at the time.\"",
      "Four years after leaving United, Gribbin suffered a gruesome injury. Playing against Warrington Town in 2023 he ruptured his knee ligaments and his career suddenly plunged into doubt.",
      "His club at the time, FC United of Manchester, appealed for help and Gribbin applied for funding from the PFA to pay for a career-saving operation. It cost £7,500 and half of this was paid for by the PFA, with Gribbin's club funding the other half.",
      "\"If you're at a top club and you've done your knee, you're looked after in-house,\" he admitted. \"The club will take care of everything and you don't need to worry about anything other than getting fit again. When you're at the bottom, though, it's nothing like that.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has now held talks with Rangers over the managerial vacancy at Ibrox, with the Scottish giants still to decide who will replace Russell Martin at the helm.",
      "Rangers have been searching for a new head coach since Martin paid the price for the club's torrid start to the 2025-26 campaign at the start of the month. He was sacked having won just one of the seven league games he oversaw and required a police escort following his final game - a 1-1 draw away at Falkirk - after fans tried to stop the team bus leaving.",
      "Solskjaer is currently unattached after being sacked by Besiktas earlier this year, with the former Manchester United manager looking for his next role. No decision has yet been made on who will become Rangers' new head coach, though it is known that the club's former defender, Kevin Muscat also in the running for the job.",
      "Speculation over a possible return to the dugout for Solskjaer follows comments made by the Norwegian's former United team-mate, Paul Scholes. He hinted earlier this week that Solskjaer had met with Rangers, though he did not mention the former Molde chief by name.",
      "Solskjaer has held just the one permanent coaching role since leaving Manchester United in November 2021. He was eventually replaced at the helm by Erik ten Hag after Ralf Rangnick had a spell as interim boss, and, in an unusual twist, it emerged earlier this month that United briefly considered attempting to get Solskjaer BACK after sacking Ten Hag last year.",
      "The Sun claim that United gave at least some thought to turning to Solskjaer - who was at the helm for just shy of three years previously - on a temporary basis if they were unable to lure Ruben Amorim away from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Amorim did agree to leave Sporting mid-season in order to become United's new head coach, though he has gone on to endure a pretty torrid time in the Premier League.",

    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "Antoine Semenyo has quickly made a name for himself this season at the Vitality Stadium and is now become one of the hottest names in the Premier League after just seven matches in the top tier of English football. With Bournemouth sitting in the Champions League spots, the forward has been earmarked as a potential top target for the likes of Liverpool and Manchester United already.",
      "With almost 82% of the goal involvements for the Cherries already this season, Semenyo has quickly made the case that he is the talisman the Andoni Iraola's side has been lacking to push themselves to the heights of European football. Bournemouth were so close last season before picking up just three wins in their last 13 matches saw them drop from 6th - and a Europa League spot - to 9th.",
      "Still the positives were there with Iraola guiding his side to their first ever top 10 finish in the Premier League which is incredible considering just 16 years ago they narrowly missed out on relegation from the Football League altogether. The club needed someone instrumental to step up to the mark and really hit the ground running - it maybe a 38-game marathon season but the Premier League is unforgiven if you are left to rue missed chances. Enter Semenyo.",
      "After his best season so far in his professional career with 13 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions, including 11 in the Premier League, Semenyo had all the markings of the main man the Cherries needed to get them over the next hurdle of securing European football. This weekend they find themselves facing Crystal Palace who are enjoying their first European campaign in the Conference League and the former Bristol City forward is 3/1 with Betfred to score anytime at Selhurst Park.",
      "Right now, the forward has already netted in six times in the league which included braces against Liverpool on the opening night of the new season and against Fulham before the international break. His involvements have been lethal to opponents too with assists against Wolves, Brighton and Fulham - all at home - securing a maximum nine points too. The only times he has blanked was away at Tottenham - the only time he has received a booking but Bournemouth still won - and at home in a goalless draw to Newcastle.",
      "Nine goal involvements in seven appearances is not something to quickly dismiss at either as at the time of writing this only Erling Haaland has a better record with 10 involvements. For comparison, Semenyo has outdone Mo Salah, Cody Gakpo and Florian Wirtz combined - although Wirtz is yet to actually break his duck it still emphasises Semenyo's ability on the big stage.",
      "The 25-year-old Ghanaian international has had somewhat of an unorthodox CV in comparison to his peers and rivals. A youth product in Bristol City's academy programme, Semenyo had spells at National League South side Bath City before temporary switches at Newport County and Sunderland. On reflection, it seemed nothing spectacular happened with only six goals in the 55 appearances he had - but he failed to find the mark for the Black Cats in League One.",
      "He soon found his feet as a first-team regular for the Cherries just five seasons ago and earned the nod with a permanent transfer to Bournemouth three years later. Apart from the free signing of Darren Randolph, Semenyo was the cheapest signing that season at £10.5 million with winger Dango Ouattara (£20m) plying his trade at Brentford and centre-back Illia Zabarnyi (£24m) now at PSG.",
      "The recruitment has been solid at Bournemouth in recent years and Semenyo is testament to that with the Cherries now finding themselves in serious contention for a spot in Europe. They sit in the Champions League spots right now and while that is a stretch - currently 8/1 with the bookies - the Dorset club find themselves as solid outsiders for a top six finish at 2/1 which are solid odds for a team aiming for a spot in the Europa League this season.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was one of four Manchester United players who missed training just days out from the team's clash at Liverpool. Matheus Cunha, Amad and Casemiro were also given time off by head coach Ruben Amorim, reports the BBC.",
      "It is unclear whether the quartet were missing due to fitness issues or if the coaching group are just managing their individual schedules following the international break.",
      "Brazil played over in Asia, beating South Korea before losing to Japan as they spurned a two-goal lead. Portugal were closer to home but Fernandes played a crucial role for his country as they beat Ireland but were then held by Hungary.",
      "Fernandes and Casemiro have dove-tailed as a midfield duo in the opening weeks of the season - a selection that has divided opinion. The Portuguese star is limited and unable to influence games by playing deeper whilst Casemiro's ability to get around the pitch has been flagged as an issue.",
      "Cunha, a summer mover from Wolves, has spent time on the sidelines this term whilst Amad is still looking to find his best form having been a strong performer last term in what was a struggling side.",
      "United are aiming to win back-to-back matches in the Premier League for the first time this season - and the first time under Amorim - when they head to Anfield. Wins on the red side of Merseyside have been hard to come by in recent years, but last term they did earn a credible draw.",
      "Amorim is likely to be without Noussair Mazraoui, who has missed the last two matches with what has been described as a minor injury. Lisandro Martinez was also missing from training but the Argentine is edging closer to a return after major knee surgery.",
      "United have lost three of their seven games so far this season, leaving them in midtable. Two of those losses have come against top six teams with Manchester City and Arsenal both getting the better of them.",
      "Despite the noise on the red side of Manchester they will head to Anfield to face a team that had been beaten in their three games prior to the international break. Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea all beat them, but the three games were all on the road. Liverpool have not lost a Premier League game at Anfield since September 2024.",

      "Roy Keane has questioned why Dan Ashworth was only given a few months at the helm of Manchester United. After an extended period of gardening leave at St. James' Park, Sir Jim Ratcliffe appointed the 54-year-old as the club's new sporting director in the summer of 2024.",
      "It was thought that the British billionaire was a big admirer, having publicly applauded his work at the start of the year. Ratcliffe described Ashworth as 'one of the top sporting directors in the world', adding that he would be a 'very good addition'.",
      "The former FA technical director eventually joined United's new-look boardroom as part of a wider restructure.",
      "Despite coughing up a seven-figure fee for a cherry-picked expert, Ashworth was only given five months in the hot seat.",
      "During his spell at Old Trafford, United splashed £200m on five new players: Manuel Ugarte, Leny Yoro, Noussair Mazraoui, Mattijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee. Many of those would have been tailored to Erik ten Hag, who was sacked in October.",
      "Ratcliffe himself was pivotal in the decision, which was 'instigated by United' despite an official statement claiming his departure was mutual.",
      "Speaking on the Rest Is Football podcast, Keane noted Ashworth's premature exit as he questioned some of the club's decision-making.",
      "Ian Wright got the ball rolling. On United, the Arsenal legend said: \"You have to start somewhere. You can't see the end. Jason Wilcox – he was the technical director, now he's the sporting director – so Man United are just promoting...",
      "\"Why don't they just go out and get a top director of football. [Manchester] City wouldn't do that. Arsenal wouldn't do that.\"",
      "Keane chimed in: \"But United did do that, didn't they, with Dan Ashworth.\"",
      "Wright replied: \"And what happened to him? They have to go again.\"",
      "Keane, who was bemused by the situation at United, said: \"How many months was he there, Dan? Did they wait a couple of years for him? They paid big compensation, and he's out the door.\"",
      "Jamie Carragher threw his hat in the ring, suggesting there's a culture problem at Old Trafford. The former Liverpool defender said: \"Manchester United, they are the club in this country that have probably the most eyes on them, the most media on them.",
      "\"And we say you're not a Manchester United player if you can't deal with that. They're not a Manchester United player straight away. They almost have to grow into being a Manchester United player.\"",
      "Carragher then added: \"It feels like so many players at United leave and – I don't say they go and be amazing, world-class players, but you think they do a lot better somewhere else than they do at United.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Owen Hargreaves has slammed the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - suggesting other positions needed sorting first. The Red Devils splashed the cash during the summer transfer window as they attempted to put a dire season behind them.",
      "Brazilian forward Cunha was signed for £62.5million from Wolverhampton Wanderers, while Mbeumo sealed a £71m move from Brentford. The former has yet to find the net, while Mbeumo has scored just once.",
      "And former United star Hargreaves has claimed both players were not needed together and the club should have instead used those funds on signing an elite midfielder and a first-choice goalkeeper.",
      "The Red Devils were linked to a host of high-profile midfielders including Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba. But they were unable to find an agreement for either and eventually did not add to their midfield ranks.",
      "Speaking on The Breakdown, Hargreaves said: “Bruno is their best player by a country mile, then they go and sign two number 10s to play in his position, and he has to play as a defensive midfield player almost.",
      "“I appreciate that you needed more goals. They (United) have thought that more goals will get us higher up the table than, say, a world-class goalkeeper.",
      "“But actually, you have the best number 10 in the division, and you drop him (deeper) because you want someone to play through midfield because you have Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "“So why didn’t you just sign a central midfield player to play there and let Bruno do his thing with Cunha? Then a goalkeeper. It would have fixed a lot of issues.”",
      "United did of course welcome a new goalkeeper to Old Trafford late in the window after sealing a £18m deal for Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens, while Andre Onana was allowed to join Turkish side Trabzonspor.",

      "After some adequate pre-season performances, Wirtz provided an assist in Liverpool's Community Shield loss, but it has all been downhill since then. He is yet to contribute to a goal in the Premier League and continues to be come under fire for subpar showings.",
      "Wirtz has been a Liverpool player for less than four months. But, thanks to some underwhelming showings, he has seen his name linked with a loan move away from Anfield.",
      "Ex-Arsenal and Chelsea star Emmanuel Petit told BoyleSports: \"I heard that Xabi Alonso wants Real Madrid to keep an eye on Florian Wirtz ahead of a possible loan in January.",
      "\"That's how much he respects him as a player. Alonso knows his quality, many players in Germany have also defended him. Wirtz recently stated in the press that he isn't panicking.",
      "\"He knows his quality and believes that sooner or later, it will show on the pitch. I hope for his sake it does, because if it doesn't, it will be very difficult for him to cope with the pressure and criticism.\"",
      "Although some have been critical of Wirtz and his performances, a trio of German icons agree that he will come good on Merseyside. Director of the German national team Rudi Voller told Sky90: \"He's not only an extraordinary footballer, he also has a great character.",

      "Germany legend Lothar Matthaus added when speaking to Sky: \"[Struggling] is normal after such a big move abroad. But he's a superb player, he will get used to the Premier League over time and be able to handle the even bigger pressure.\"",
      "Not all have been so friendly to Wirtz since his Liverpool switch as he found out on Monday evening when Germany faced Northern Ireland. He played almost all of the 1-0 World Cup qualifying win but did not endear himself to the home supporters.",
      "After defender Dan Ballard's goal was chalked off by the Video Assistant Referee inside 15 minutes, the crowd's frustrations grew and Nick Woltemade's first-half strike didn't ease this anger.",
      "Wirtz then felt the fans' annoyance in the second half when he threw himself to the ground in the penalty area. Northern Irish supporters were up in arms over what they considered a dive and no penalty was awarded.",
      "The 22-year-old was then jeered every time he got the ball. Boos rang out minutes after the incident when he again went down just outside the box.",
      "Another who voiced their doubts about Wirtz over the intentional break was ex-Everton defender Joleon Lescott. The 42-year-old believes that if the Reds could recoup their £116m fee from Bayer Leverkusen for Wirtz, then they would oblige.",
      "\"I'm not convinced,\" Lescott admitted on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"If Liverpool could get their money back at the end of the season, they would do it.",

You’ve got to be seen to be progressing and as it stands at the minute they are not progressing. 10th in the league at the minute. It’s just the lack of consistency.",
      "\"Obviously, they’ve won the game against Sunderland now before the international break, but they’ve got some tough games coming up. Liverpool on Sunday. It’s that consistency that they need to find. If they can start to do the three, four, five games winning in a row, then they can really shoot up the table. But as it stands at the minute, it’s so hit and miss.”",

      "Manchester United remain hopeful of securing a deal to purchase land surrounding Old Trafford for their new stadium project.",
      "Back in March, United revealed ambitious proposals for a cutting-edge 100,000-capacity stadium, with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe suggesting the scheme could be finished by 2030.",
      "The rail yard surrounding Old Trafford belongs to Freightliner and the site will be key to the plans for a new 100,000-capacity stadium. Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester's Mayor, had previously indicated that compulsory purchase powers might be employed to obtain the area if negotiations reach an impasse.",
      "During the summer, reports suggested Freightliner had valued the site at £350million, though Burnham dismissed that sum, stating: \"I think everyone should file that one away.\"",
      "United and Freightliner have continued talks and are progressing towards reaching an agreement, based on the most recent fans' forum minutes published on Wednesday.",

      "\"To accommodate the scale of the proposed new stadium – including a canopy – and to avoid disruption to the existing stadium during construction, we are working to secure additional land.",
      "\"We've been engaged in constructive discussions with neighbouring landholders and are optimistic about reaching mutually agreeable terms in the coming months.\"",

      "\"We remain excited by the vision set out by Foster + Partners for a new stadium at the heart of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area.",
      "\"We always said this was a conceptual design, with more detailed architectural work to follow. While we remain keen to advance as quickly as possible, the timetable is subject to progress on land assembly and financing, which depends on key stakeholders working together.\"",
      "The club has admitted that they can't deliver their ambitious vision for Old Trafford alone, and have been working closely with national and local government, as well as Trafford Council.",
      "It's also understood that the club and city region are aligned in their goal to bring significant fixtures from the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2035 to the stadium, including the final, as much of the regeneration of the area will have been completed by then.",

      "Matheus Cunha is content to feature in any role Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim assigns him to. The Portuguese manager has come under fire for refusing to budge from his tactical approach during a disappointing spell of results.",
      "Ever since Amorim arrived in Manchester, he has made it abundantly clear that his wing-backed 3-4-3 system is set in stone and won't be changing. Throughout a dreadful previous season and a troubling beginning to this campaign, with three losses from seven matches, he has encountered relentless pressure to alter his team's setup.",
      "Squad members have allegedly started questioning the formation, with much of the criticism focusing on how skipper Bruno Fernandes is deployed in an unsuitable deeper midfield role. Despite this, Amorim maintains that not even the Pope could convince him to switch tactics.",
      "Whilst it has been suggested that many of United's players are unimpressed by this stance, Cunha, who arrived from Wolves this summer in a £62.5million deal, has no concerns about his positioning and rejects the idea that his boss should modify his approach.",
      "\"I think that because I play for Manchester United and people follow me more on the pitch, they understand better how I play,\" Cunha told Globo.",
      "\"I think it's part of having that weight, which is a privilege. It's a weight that came after the Tokyo Olympics [for Brazil in 2021]. And if it means having that weight and becoming a champion, I think it's worth putting up with a little bit of confusion about where [I] play.",
      "\"I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number 9 shirt. I play my entire base as a midfielder, and when I became a professional, I encountered this world of 4-3-3. It seems like you have to adapt: either play centre-forward, winger, or 'eight'.",
      "\"They eliminated the midfielder position, and you have to adapt. But I see it positively, as it has given me experience, many more positions, and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team. Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.",
      "\"What I was searching for as a person more than anything else, I'm slowly finding. You constantly want to improve; that's innate in human nature, but I can't help but stop and enjoy this moment.",
      "\"Feeling privileged to wear the jersey of one of the greatest clubs in the world... it's a spectacular personal moment. I have an incredible family, another little girl now, everyone is doing well and healthy. I'm enjoying all of this in a positive way.\"",
      "Amorim himself tackled the criticism last month with passion as his side wallowed in the Premier League's lower reaches. He told reporters: \"No, no, no. No one. Not even the Pope [could get me to change formation].",
      "\"This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. There will be an evolution, but we need to make all the good steps. If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure, it doesn't matter if he's all around the world, is saying: 'You need to change the system.' And I'm going to change. In this moment, they will look at me in a different way.\"",

      "Ex-Manchester United star Paul Parker is convinced that Ruben Amorim has a \"personal\" issue with Kobbie Mainoo, who continues to be used as a squad player and is yet to play a full Premier League match this season.",
      "Mainoo came through the ranks at Old Trafford and was handed his debut by Erik ten Hag. He immediately shone and by the end of his debut season scored a goal in the FA Cup final as United shocked Manchester City at Wembley.",
      "He went on to play for England as they made the final of Euro 2024, but since Ten Hag was replaced by Amorim his stock has fallen and his minutes have decreased. Mainoo failed to even get off the bench in the first two games and has since had to make do with substitute cameos.",
      "Amorim has taken to starting Casemiro, whose future at the club has previously been questioned, ahead of him despite the Brazilian being into his 30s. Bruno Fernandes is also being played in a deeper role, which doesn't suit his qualities, ahead of Mainoo.",
      "Parker maintains the matter must be personal as he told MyBettingSites: \"We also have to ask why Mainoo hasn’t been used in that midfield. Somewhere along the line because I’ve been looking at it, it has to be personal. It has to be personal and the truth has to be told somewhere. He doesn’t like him or he doesn’t like him as a player. It doesn’t make any sense at all.”",
      "Despite Mainoo's meteoric rise at Manchester there has been talk of him being moved on, in part motivated by the PSR benefits of selling an academy player. He would still command a hefty fee but United have a famed history of backing their young talent and Parker has warned against selling him, especially given what he produced early on.",
      "He said: “It would cause big problems if they allow Mainoo to go because he’s a local boy. But it’s not just about that, it’s about what he’s achieved in a short space of time and he hasn’t been given the time and the respect.”",
      "Amorim has been questioned on his use of Mainoo but has been open about the improvement he wants to see in his game. \"I believe a lot in Kobbie but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done. I think he can do so much better. He can improve in a lot,\" he said.",
      "Mainoo is also competing with the likes of Manuel Ugarte, who is another player struggling for minutes under Amorim. It was also well documented that those on the red side of Manchester wanted to sign a No 6 to go into the middle of the park, leading to their interest in Carlos Baleba.",
      "United's style under Amorim, which he's refused to veer from, requires legs in midfield and that has been cited as an issue with the current starting line-up in the early weeks of the season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Liverpool are set to host Manchester United in a thrilling Premier League clash at Anfield on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Arne Slot's squad had a rough patch before the international break, suffering three consecutive losses. The Reds were defeated by Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea all within a week's span.",
      "After a fortnight off, this weekend's match against United presents the perfect opportunity for the Reds to rebound and get back on the winning track, having triumphed in each of their five home matches this season. Slot will be crossing his fingers that most of his team return from international duty unscathed.",
      "The break has also provided some injured players with an opportunity to accelerate their recovery.",
      "With that in mind, here's the latest injury update from the Reds' treatment room.",
      "The Dutch midfielder only played 45 minutes during Netherlands' 4-0 victory over Finland at the weekend, with Ronald Koeman confirming that the player has been battling a hamstring issue.",
      "Gravenberch himself, confessed that his withdrawal was merely a precautionary measure.",
      "Potential return date: October 19, vs United (H).",

      "The former Eintracht Frankfurt star has now travelled back home after failing to feature in France's 3-0 victory over Azerbaijan.",
      "Once he rejoins the Reds, Konate will undergo assessment to determine whether he's capable of starting against United this weekend.",
      "Potential return date: Unknown.",
      "The Brazilian goalkeeper hobbled off during Liverpool's 1-0 loss to Galatasaray in the Champions League, with Slot admitting it was \"never good\" to witness a player limp off in that manner.",
      "Alisson sat out his country's match against South Korea last week and was also absent for the Japan fixture. Given this, Slot isn't optimistic about Alisson being available to face United.",
      "\"It depends on how fast the recovery goes, so it's clear that he is not going to play for Brazil,\" Slot remarked following his side's loss to Chelsea.",
      "\"I will be surprised if he [Alisson] will be there for the first game after the international break. From there on things can go a bit faster or a bit slower. It's difficult to say the amount of days and weeks. For the upcoming games he will not be apart of us or the Brazil team.\"",
      "Potential return date: November.",
      "Endo didn't link up with his international colleagues for friendlies against Paraguay and Brazil during the international break, with Japan issuing a statement last week.",

      "The extent of Endo's injury remains unclear, but he could potentially return to the pitch on Sunday.",
      "Potential return date: October 19 vs United (H).",
      "Italian centre-back Leoni is facing a year-long absence from the field after suffering an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) rupture during last month's Carabao Cup match against Southampton.",
      "\"He's not in a good place, of course,\" Slot admitted. \"He tore his ACL which means that he will be out for around a year. Being so young, coming to a new country, playing so well in your first game, it's very hard to take the positives. You always try to look at the positive side and that is that he is still so young.",

      "\"I was on the grass with the kids coaching, and you come away from a session thinking, 'How can I adapt, how can I change it, how can I make it better?'.",

      "\"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job? No, especially with the route I want go down now,\" he said.",
      "\"You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it’s a results business. If you don’t get results, I don’t care what length of contract you’re on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",
      "\"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I’ve seen from United this season in every department. But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don’t win there, you’ve got Brighton coming up and that’s not an easy game the way they’re playing at the minute.",
      "\"If you get a draw against Liverpool and then go and beat Brighton at home, you’ve gathered a bit of momentum and can they really kick on and use it as a catalyst to do something? How many times have we said that over the last six years? Would I like to see Amorim succeed, do really well in the back end of this season and maybe win a trophy? Of course. I’d love nothing more.\"",

      "Over the last few years, locals have argued they are being priced out of attending matches at Old Trafford, and United received intense backlash over ticket prices last term.",
      "The rising kiosk costs were discussed at the latest fans' forum. United were asked why prices had risen without fan consultation, which was out of line with previous years.",
      "United said: \"For the past two seasons, we have trialled discounting beer in response to fan feedback. Unfortunately, this has coincided with significant increases in food and beverage costs —around 25–30% in the last three years — since kiosk prices were last reviewed holistically.",
      "\"To reflect rising operating and supply costs, we are not able to continue offering this discount for the 2025/26 campaign, and some kiosk prices have therefore increased.",
      "\"The most notable changes are Carling (500ml) rising from £3.80 to £4.95 - which remains below the price charged three years ago - and a pint of Madri increasing from £3.80 to £5.75.",
      "\"While these adjustments represent an increase on recent seasons, our prices remain competitive. A pint of beer at Old Trafford is still below the Premier League average of £6.",
      "\"It is also beneath the average cost of £6.29 at five local pubs commonly used by fans on matchdays. Based on publicly available data, Old Trafford will continue to offer the 9th cheapest pint in the Premier League.\"",
      "United were also asked to explain the reason for them increasing the ticket prices for the Under-21s' game against Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford.",
      "In November, United charged £3 for adults and £1.50 for children to watch the Under-19s against AZ Alkmaar at Old Trafford. That meant the total cost for one adult and one child to attend that game was £4.50, yet the same tickets for the clash with Bilbao cost £15 - a 233% increase.",
      "The club said: \"The price for the youth game v Athletic Bilbao was higher than some previous youth games to help offset the significant costs of staging a fixture at Old Trafford, including staffing, stewarding, and safety requirements.",
      "\"Similarly, for the U21 fixture this season, ticket prices were set at £5 (juniors) and £10 (adults). While this is higher than the U19 game last year, it still represents a reduced price point compared to first-team fixtures, and we remain committed to ensuring these games are as accessible as possible.",
      "\"We also continue to explore opportunities to distribute free tickets to local schools and community groups. We know how special it can be for young supporters to attend these matches, and feedback like this helps us as we review both pricing and community access for future youth fixtures.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's regime has prioritised cutting costs since gaining control of football operations.",

      "Manchester United have implemented changes to prevent turnstile congestion at Old Trafford.",
      "United were criticised by fans who encountered problems at the turnstiles before the season's opening fixture against Arsenal.",
      "The club rolled out a new ticketing system for every supporter for 2025/26, meaning fans now enter Old Trafford using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology.",
      "All tickets are digital on a smartphone and downloaded to a device's wallet. The tickets are scanned to gain entry at the turnstiles, but mass confusion occurred before the Arsenal game when hundreds of supporters could not gain entry, and they were sent to the ticketing office by unprepared stewards.",
      "One fan described the Arsenal delays as a \"disgrace\" while another supporter revealed their 77-year-old mother, a platinum season ticket holder, missed the game due to the changes.",
      "The issue was discussed at the latest fans' forum, and United said: \"Thanks to all supporters who shared constructive feedback regarding NFC tickets after our opening home game against Arsenal.",
      "\"Your input has been invaluable in helping us to both improve the transition to NFC tickets and supporter user journeys this season. Since then, we’ve introduced a number of changes to help ensure entry flow rates are back in line with previous seasons, and we’re pleased to confirm this was achieved by the Burnley match.\"",
      "The following changes were confirmed by United in response to feedback from fans:",
      "• Improved pre-match communications: emails now include clearer information and animated guides. For Chelsea, these started a week earlier than usual, with extra reminders in the build-up to the game.",
      "• Daily reminders: fans who hadn’t yet added tickets to their Apple or Google wallets received reminder communications during the days before the game.",
      "• Booking confirmation enhancements: we added in extra details for ticket buyers and those receiving forwarded tickets.",
      "• App notifications: in-app messages were pushed via the official app during match week.",
      "• How-to resources: updated videos have been added to the dedicated app tickets webpage: manutd.com/apptickets, plus content shown on stadium screens above turnstiles.",
      "• Turnstile guidance: animated images and GIFs were added to show where and how to scan your ticket at the scanner.",
      "• Hands-on support: fans were invited to test their phone on handheld scanners at the Supporter Services building on non-matchdays.",
      "United added: \"These changes have already made a real difference: for Chelsea, queues at Supporter Services were much smaller, and queries were resolved quickly.\"",
      "The club introduced NFC tickets under instruction from the Premier League. United phased the introduction of the NFC tickets over the past year to help fans adapt to the change, but there were still problems.",

      "Hello and welcome to live coverage of all the latest Manchester United news on Thursday, October 16.",
      "The Reds' season is currently on hold due to the second international break of the season, and talk has quietened around Ruben Amorim's suitability for the top job at Old Trafford for now after a 2-0 defeat of Sunderland last time out.",
      "Amorim's future may well have been knocked down the news agenda, but United were plunged into further uncertainty last week when the mega-rich Saudi Arabian government official Turki Al-Sheikh made huge claims about a takeover of the club on social media.",
      "That sparked speculation online about what this could mean for the Reds' immediate future. More claims have since been made with the latest of those involving Eric Cantona.",
      "We will have all the latest on that, top transfer headlines and injury news as the Reds' return to action with a clash against Liverpool this weekend edges closer...",
      "Manchester United saw an interesting fixture change made for December when TV picks for upcoming months were confirmed yesterday.",
      "On Thursday, December 4, United will face West Ham at Old Trafford in front of the Sky cameras. Thursday nights are very rarely the home of Premier League football.",
      "Often, this day is reserved for European action, particularly the Europa League and Conference League. However, an exception has been made in December due to the new rights package that was agreed for the 2025/26 season.",
      "Sky have chosen to copy the approach of TNT and spread the fixtures across Tuesday, December 2, Wednesday, December 3 and Thursday, December 4. The majority of matches that week will be played on the Wednesday and when multiple matches are taking place that night, staggered kick-off times have been agreed of 7.30pm and 8.15pm.",
      "Ruben Amorim appears to rate Manchester United academy starlet Shea Lacey very highly.",
      "According to The Daily Mail, he is said to be enthused by the version of Lacey he is currently seeing which has seen him be treated like any other first-team player.",
      "It has also been claimed that there is a genuine effort being put in to surround him with the best conditions possible in order to ensure he can succeed in the future.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has rarely featured for Manchester United this season which has seen him consider his future at Old Trafford.",
      "The Netherlands international was a key player under Ruben Amorim for the latter stage of last season but an influx of new attackers over the summer has resulted in him playing just 82 minutes in United's first eight games.",
      "According to The Times, he will consider departing in January with a temporary return to Italy possible. AS Roma are believed to be monitoring his situation while fellow Serie A Como are also interested.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Matheus Cunha and Amad were among the players to miss Manchester United full training on Thursday.",
      "Ruben Amorim granted additional time off for the players who had been travelling for international duty or trained throughout the break.",
      "Club sources confirmed that some players who were given additional time off by Amorim still reported to Carrington. However, they completed light recovery work instead of participating in full training.",
      "Eric Cantona has been mentioned in the latest Manchester United takeover claim following fresh investment talk from the Middle East.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs, via United Stand, he has held direct talks over potential taking up ambassadorial role that would see him back a prospective consortium in a bid for Man United. Other ex-United stars have also been contacted, but it would not be with a view to invest.",
      "However, as things stand nothing is advanced with the Glazers also not involved in any form of talks about possibly selling.",
      "Ruben Amorim has a special plan in place for Mason Mount at Manchester United over the next few months.",
      "The 26-year-old scored a great goal in the win over Sunderland with that likely no surprise to Amorim as considers Mount to be a \"super talent\", according to The Sun.",
      "They have also claimed that Mount is viewed by Amorim as England's most underrated player and is of the belief there is not an attacker like him in Thomas Tuchel's squad.",
      "Though Amorim will not be in charge of the decision, it has been added in their report that he will be taking some action, as he is planning to do everything he can to give Mount a platform to impress Tuchel.",
      "Man United's hopes of building a new stadium to replace Old Trafford took a step forward this week as confidence grows on purchasing land near to the ground.",
      "In the latest fans' forum minutes, a United spokesperson explained that the club were 'optimistic' that they would be able to agree a deal for the land on the rail yard, which is owned by Freightliner, 'in the coming months'. Reports had suggested that Freightliner valued the land at around £350m but Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham played down that figure.",
      "MEN Sport has had a look at what some of the key figures in the process - including Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Gary Neville - have said about the new stadium. Gary Neville has spoken openly of his desire to see the Reds build a new stadium near the Theatre of Dreams. Earlier this year, he wrote on LinkedIn: \"Well, I’ve been harping on about the stadium for years now.",
      "\"My honest view with United is that it’s non-negotiable that we should have the best stadium in the world and the best training ground. We know football always moves in cycles and you can never guarantee success on the pitch, but we hope that that returns quickly. However, it’s always in the control of the owners of the club to be the best in class when it comes to where we play football and train. I’ve really enjoyed being on the task force and when we were presented with the vision in our last meeting on Friday my initial feeling was 'here we go'.",
      "\"There’s a lot of work to do on and off the pitch to make the stadium happen but if what we are looking at today and in this video are delivered then Manchester United will be back where it belongs when it comes to its stadium and ground. The task force is now closed and I hope the club can get this project away as quickly as possible and get 100,000 United fans in that stadium with hopefully a successful team on the pitch.\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "Man United are reportedly interested in signing four promising midfielders, including Jobe Bellingham and Adam Wharton, according to TEAMtalk.",
      "The report adds that Wharton is highly regarded by his current club’s coaching staff, who believe he is a perfect fit for their system, though Chelsea are also showing strong interest in him.",
      "As for Bellingham, United are said to be on red alert and closely monitoring the 20-year-old. Meanwhile, FC Porto's Victor Froholdt is also being linked alongside Carlos Baleba.",
      "Although there are currently no talks over a new contract for the England midfielder, Wharton is considered a key figure in Palace's long-term plans.",
      "The 20-year-old signed a five-and-a-half-year deal upon joining from Blackburn in 2024, leaving him under contract until 2029.",
      "Danny Simpson says that the first 20 minutes of Manchester United's clash with Liverpool will be their key to victory.",
      "Speaking exclusively to the MEN via MightyTips, when asked about if it's the best time for United to be playing their fierce rivals, Simpson said: \"There's two ways of looking at that. They're not used to losing three games, but they're all away from home for a start.",
      "\"Palace, Galatasaray, Chelsea, I think any time you play them, it feels way tough. They've had a little bit of a break, so is it the time to strike and make them lose four games? Or are they going to be angry and come out fighting because they're back at home and the crowd is going to be even noisier, and it's Man United. So, United, yes, they got a win against Sunderland, but albeit, no disrespect, it was Sunderland at home.",
      "\"If I was a United player, I'd be thinking it is a great time to just start the game well, actually, to make the players and the fans nervous. I think the first 20 minutes is going to be so key. I've played at Anfield loads, and they can make you nervous after the first 10, 15 minutes. It's hard to recover. Especially if you go 1-0 down. If United can somehow just get through that storm at 10 minutes, maybe create a few chances, nick a goal, then it would be really nervous times for Liverpool.\"",
      "Simpson also noted how the international break could prove problematic for players returning to club level, especially if they pick up certain injuries when representing their respective nations. The 38-year-old added: \"It's hard as well with the international break because we don't know what condition the players are coming back in, and the manager has no idea until maybe tomorrow or Thursday.",
      "\"So, it's always a tricky one after the international break. United have got to go into that thinking, 'Listen, why not?'\"",
      "Man United icon Wes Brown has backed his former club to target the Crystal Palace midfielder ahead of Carlos Baleba.",
      "\"I’d have to go for Adam Wharton. I love him, and I think it’s always good if you can add an English player to the squad,\" he told 10Bet Casino. \"He’s strong, he’s talented, he’s technically good, and he knows his job on the pitch. He knows the Premier League and I’d have no problem if United bring him in.",
      "\"I think he could maybe be the right replacement for Casemiro. He’s not going to be there for years to come, and it might be time for that position to be freshened up. The midfield is all about combinations and partnerships, so if Wharton comes in he'd have to be able to link up with the players we’ve already got.",
      "\"We saw for England when it was Scholes, Lampard and Gerrard, you can’t just shove your best players into a team and hope it works. It’s not as simple as that. You need a manager to make sure the combinations are right, and for Wharton, I think he would be the right man for that position in midfield.\"",
      "Wharton's stock has gone nowhere but up since he moved to south London last year. However, it appears he would be significantly cheaper than Baleba if the £60m figure attached to his name proves accurate.",
      "Fernandes was among four Manchester United players to miss training just days before the team's clash with Liverpool.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Amad, and Casemiro were also given time off by head coach Ruben Amorim, according to the BBC. It is unclear whether the four players missed training due to fitness concerns or if the coaching staff were simply managing their schedules after the international break.",
      "Fernandes and Casemiro have operated as a midfield duo in the opening weeks of the season, a pairing that has divided opinion. The Portuguese star is limited when playing deeper and struggles to influence games, while Casemiro’s mobility around the pitch has been highlighted as a concern.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Man United are still chasing a transfer for Brighton midfielder Baleba.",
      "\"(Ruben) Amorim was pushing a lot for Baleba in the summer transfer window,\" Romano said. \"Amorim saw Baleba as a perfect target for Man United in terms of intensity in the midfield in terms of skills in terms of potential in terms of knowledge of the Premier League.",
      "\"He was considered as a perfect signing by people at the club and by the manager. Brighton closed the doors to that possibility. January at the moment Brighton don’t want to send a player. So it remains a difficult deal for January for the summer.",
      "\"We will see what’s going to happen there because my United might be there and Brighton feel that maybe other clubs could also join the race for an important talented midfielder like Carlos Baleba. So for sure, a situation to watch, also because just in general Baleba or another Man United are looking for an important midfielder to add to the squad in 2026.",
      "\"We will see what kind of opportunities there will be in January or eventually in the summer transfer window. But midfield will be a crucial position to cover for Manchester United next year 2026.\"",
      "Paul Parker is adamant that Ruben Amorim has a 'personal' grudge against Kobbie Mainoo. As quoted by the Express, The former United defender said: \"We also have to ask why Mainoo hasn't been used in that midfield.",
      "\"Somewhere along the line because I've been looking at it, it has to be personal. It has to be personal and the truth has to be told somewhere. He doesn't like him or he doesn't like him as a player. It doesn't make any sense at all.\"",
      "Parker added: \"It would cause big problems if they allow Mainoo to go because he's a local boy. But it's not just about that, it's about what he's achieved in a short space of time and he hasn't been given the time and the respect.\"",
      "According to ESPN, United have not ruled out the possibility of offering Casemiro a new contract. The 33-year-old midfielder has recently entered the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, making him available on a free transfer in the summer.",
      "The report claims Casemiro would need to take a pay cut in order to extend his stay. It's said that United want to continue reducing their wage bill following the departures of David de Gea and Raphael Varane.",
      "ESPN reckons that the Brazil international is one of the biggest earners at Old Trafford, having signed a lucrative contract when he arrived from Real Madrid in 2022.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, United want to sign Harry Kane. The report claims that the Reds view the Bayern Munich striker as a key player for their rebuild, but any chance of securing his signature coyld hinge on their results in the Premier League.",
      "It's said that Tottenham Hotspur are willing to pay the release clause in Kane's contract, which is thought to be worth about £52m, and pay the wages required to bring him back to north London.",
      "TEAMtalk reckon that the England captain is keen on a return to the English top-flight, with Alan Shearer's goal tally in his sights.",
      "In an interview with the Metro, Danny Simpson urged United to sign Ivan Toney in the January transfer window. The former Leicester CIty defender said: \"He’s obviously got the temperament and he knows the league.",
      "\"I actually think as well, because he’s been out in Saudi Arabia, he would actually now come back to maybe play a different role where you are a rotation option. You’re going to get a lot of games, but you might start, you might come off the bench.",
      "\"So I think that’s something, if I were him, you can’t turn that down. Coming to the club like Man United and playing a different kind of role, because you’ve been in Saudi Arabia – that might give him a chance to get with England in the summer, because we’re still short of various strikers...\"",
      "Speaking to BetMGM, as quoted by the Daily Mail, Phil Jones addressed the question marks over Ruben Amorim's future. The former United defender said: \"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job?",
      "\"No, especially with the route I want go down now. You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it’s a results business.",
      "\"If you don’t get results, I don’t care what length of contract you’re on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.\"",
      "Jones added: \"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I’ve seen from United this season in every department.",
      "\"But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don’t win there, you’ve got Brighton coming up and that’s not an easy game the way they’re playing at the minute...\"",
      "Peter Schmeichel still can't wrap his head around why United sold Scott McTominay to Napoli last year. Speaking on the Sacked in the Morning podcast, the former Reds goalkeeper said: \"This is a Scottish podcast, the best example is Scott McTominay.",
      "\"He is so much Manchester United. A manager comes in, he knows he’s got anything. United are probably two years and a bit to prove himself.",
      "\"And then you look at him, he’s not that kind of player who’s going to score or create that goal. They don’t trust him to be the one they’re building the team around.",
      "\"They want the good, neat players, and he’s just been the victim of that time and time again. I just don’t get what he’s doing at Napoli. They are Manchester United players.",
      "\"You will get no one with more enthusiasm for Manchester United than Rasmus Hojlund. He was writing about being a Manchester United player when he was 10 years old.\"",
      "According to journalist Graeme Bailey, United are considering a move for James Garner at the end of the season. The Everton midfielder, who swapped Old Trafford for Goodison Park in the summer of 2022, has caught the eye in the early stages of the season.",
      "Garner has recently entered the final year of his contract at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, making him available on a free transfer un the summer. The 24-year-old has been undroppable for David Moyes, starting in each of Everton's nine games across all competitions this term.",
      "Speaking to Globo during the international break, Matheus Cunha lifted the lid on his difficult start to the season. The United forward, who signed from Wolves in the summer, said: \"I think that because I play for Manchester [United] and people follow me more on the pitch, they understand better how I play.",
      "\"I think it's part of having that weight, which is a privilege. It's a weight that came after the Tokyo Olympics [for Brazil in 2021]. And if it means having that weight and becoming a champion, I think it's worth putting up with a little bit of confusion about where [I] play.",
      "\"I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number 9 shirt. I play my entire base as a midfielder, and when I became a professional, I encountered this world of 4-3-3. It seems like you have to adapt: either play centre-forward, winger, or 'eight'.",
      "\"They eliminated the midfielder position, and you have to adapt. But I see it positively, as it has given me experience, many more positions, and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team. Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.\"",
      "In the aftermath of United's pulsating draw with Liverpool in January, Bruno Fernandes wasn't afraid to air out his frustrations. Speaking to reporters, the Reds skipper said: \"I’m pretty upset.",
      "\"Because, if we can show this today against Liverpool at Anfield, who are first in the league and who have been probably the outstanding team in the league this season, why can't we do this every week?\"",
      "Nine months on the same concerns remain. Ruben Amorim's side have only won three of their opening seven league games, and they were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby Town.",
      "On Sunday afternoon, the Reds will lock horns with Liverpool at Anfield. The reigning Premier League champions may fancy their chances, but United have shown signs of promise recently...",
      "Crystal Palace are reportedly keeping tabs on the future of Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jobe Bellingham. The younger brother of Real Madrid and England international Jude joined the Bundesliga heavyweights from Sunderland this summer for around £31m.",
      "Unfortunately for the 20-year-old he is yet to register a goal contribution or complete a full 90 minutes of football for the club. German outlet Bild recently claimed Ruben Amorim's side are monitoring his situation.",
      "But they are not the only ones as Crystal Palace are interested in his services, according to GiveMeSport. Dortmund manager Niko Kovac is far from giving up on him, recently highlighting the England U21 international as a player with a \"huge upside.\"",
      "Dion Dublin believes Manchester United may just beat Liverpool at Anfield this weekend. He insisted the Red Devils are due a major victory which can push Ruben Amorim's campaign forward, despite the recent 2-1 home victory over Chelsea.",
      "\"We know that Liverpool have been better than Manchester United for many, many years. But this is a rivalry, it is tribalism - it could go either way.",
      "\"As an ex-Man United player, I want them to win the game. They are due to have a very potent, winning game. Liverpool watch out - it is going to be a close one.",
      "\"Liverpool have lost their last three games - this is where they can be at their most dangerous because they may not be in their stride but they have got so many amazing, world-class players. If they turn it on, nobody can live with them. I am hoping they don't turn it on. But if they do, it is going to be some game.\"",
      "Ex-Manchester United defender Wes Brown believes the return of Lisandro Martinez will be like a new signing to Ruben Amorim. The left-footed, central-defender has been out injured since February after suffering an ACL in the loss to Crystal Palace.",
      "The Argentine was recently training on the grass, with other reports suggesting he could soon be training with the first team very soon. While it will be a long time until he is starting for United again, Brown believes Martinez's return cannot come soon enough.",
      "He told the Metro: \"Luke Shaw has done well on the left of the three, but even with that, I think a club always needs competition for places. When Lisandro Martinez is fit, he’s a rock for the team.",
      "\"He was excellent for a couple of seasons, but he hasn’t played a lot of games recently. He’d need to learn to play alongside Yoro and De Ligt, but if he comes back soon, it’ll be like a brilliant new signing for the manager.",
      "\"Amorim likes to have a left-footer on the left of that back three, and he’s ideal for it. He’s still got a big future at the club, and when he gets back into the side I hope he slots in seamlessly. It’ll be a huge boost for the club and the manager.\"",
      "Dion Dublin believes Ruben Amorim has to guide Manchester United into the top four at the absolute minimum. With three wins, one draw and three defeats, United are currently residing in 10th, below newly promoted Sunderland.",
      "Despite spending more than £200million in the summer, the results have not been coming for Amorim. Looking at the season so far, Dublin warned him anything less than finishing in the top four is unacceptable.",
      "\"They should be winning the Premier League, they should be getting into the Champions League every single year. Where they are right now, European football would be a good season.",
      "\"If Man United win on Sunday, they will be in a better place mentally. I think there will be more harmony in the dressing room.",
      "\"Beating Liverpool for Man United has got to be the stepping stone where they need to go, 'We have beaten one of the best teams in the world, never mind the Premier League. This is when we have to start turning it on.'\"",
      "Tomorrow evening, Manchester United's women's team will take on Atletico Madrid in the Red Devils' second UEFA Women’s Champions League fixture. The Red Devils overcame Valeranga 1-0 in their opening fixture with Maya Le Tissier converting a penalty.",
      "Here's how you can watch Marc Skinner's side in action against the Spaniards, who recently lost 6-0 to defending champions Barcelona.",
      "Those who wish to tune in can do so with a subscription for Disney+. MUTV, the United App and the club's official YouTube channel will be hosting a watch along of the match.",

      "Eric Cantona has been mentioned in the latest Manchester United takeover claim following fresh investment talk from the Middle East. The Glazer family recently opened the door to outside funding with Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquiring a minority stake in the club last year.",
      "In his 20 months officially as part of United, Ratcliffe has made a huge impact which has included giving Erik ten Hag a new contract before sacking him, appointing Ruben Amorim and also reshaping the club at boardroom level with multiple dismissals and hires.",
      "Even though he only recently made an investment, takeover rumours were sparked over the international break when Saudi official Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for United. He was later forced to clarify that he was not the potential investor, with talkSPORT stating the belief was they are UAE-based.",
      "Their report added that some United legends had been approached over being involved in any potential bid, with some clarity on exactly that and specifically one name that was approached, being revealed.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs, via United Stand, Cantona has held direct talks over potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him back a prospective consortium in a bid for United. Other former players have also been contacted, but it would not be with a view to invest.",
      "When Ratcliffe put forward his bid, there was concrete talk of Sheikh Jassim also possibly investing but that never materialised and it has been noted in this update that he is categorically not back at the table. However, as things stand on the takeover front, nothing is advanced with the Glazers also not involved in any form of talks about possibly selling.",
      "The United owners seem to be rarely involved in day-to-day proceedings at the club with Ratcliffe recently admitting that is very much his remit. He also went on to issue response to the criticism they have faced for numerous years.",
      "\"That probably sums it up,\" Ratcliffe admitted when asked if they were happy for him to take control of matters. \"We're local and they're the other side of the pond. \"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United.",
      "\"We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",

      "Manchester United's hopes of building a new stadium to replace Old Trafford took a step forward this week as confidence grows on purchasing land near to the ground.",
      "In the latest fans' forum minutes, a United spokesperson explained that the club were 'optimistic' that they would be able to agree a deal for the land on the rail yard, which is owned by Freightliner, 'in the coming months'. Reports had suggested that Freightliner valued the land at around £350m but Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham played down that figure.",
      "MEN Sport has had a look at what some of the key figures in the process - including Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Gary Neville - have said about the new stadium.",
      "Neville has spoken openly of his desire to see the Reds build a new stadium near the Theatre of Dreams. Earlier this year, he wrote on LinkedIn: \"Well, I’ve been harping on about the stadium for years now.",
      "\"My honest view with United is that it’s non-negotiable that we should have the best stadium in the world and the best training ground. We know football always moves in cycles and you can never guarantee success on the pitch, but we hope that that returns quickly.",
      "\"However, it’s always in the control of the owners of the club to be the best in class when it comes to where we play football and train. I’ve really enjoyed being on the task force and when we were presented with the vision in our last meeting on Friday my initial feeling was 'here we go'.",
      "\"There’s a lot of work to do on and off the pitch to make the stadium happen but if what we are looking at today and in this video are delivered then Manchester United will be back where it belongs when it comes to its stadium and ground. The task force is now closed and I hope the club can get this project away as quickly as possible and get 100,000 United fans in that stadium with hopefully a successful team on the pitch.\"",
      "It has been well documented that Ratcliffe's preference since buying a minority stake in the football club has been to build a new stadium, rather than re-develop the existing ground. When asked about why it was important to move out of Old Trafford and his thoughts on fans being potentially upset at the decision, the Ineos founder explained: \"I think I sort of get that and I understand that sort of attachment to the past.",
      "\"But really at the end of the day, I think for the fans, the single most important thing is that we win silverware, you know? I mean, what raises your spirits at the weekend is when we win football matches.",
      "\"If we lose a football match at the end, it sort of dampens your spirits, doesn't it? But we want to see the best footballers in the world winning football matches playing for Manchester United, and I think that's what we'll achieve with the new stadium.",
      "\"I think that's more difficult in the old stadium. My only interest in Manchester United is that we get it back to the greatness, really to the place where it should be.",
      "\"You know, we all think of Real Madrid as being a fabulous team or Barcelona. We don't think about Manchester United in those terms at the moment.",
      "\"But we should be thinking about Manchester United in those terms. It should be one of the top three or four teams in Europe, and that's where I want to get United back to.\"",
      "In July, United confirmed that Lord Seb Coe had been appointed as the Chair-Designate of the Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) for the Old Trafford Regeneration project. Coe will be one of the key figures working to deliver the plans to create not just the new stadium, but redevelop the area surrounding Old Trafford too.",
      "\"I’m delighted that I’ve been asked to be the chair designate of the proposed Old Trafford Mayoral Development Corporation,\" Coe explained in a statement. \"Throughout my career, I’ve seen the difference that sports-led regeneration can make in fostering strong communities and acting as a catalyst for economic growth.",
      "\"That was certainly true of the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics – and now, I believe, Greater Manchester’s moment has come. Working with Trafford Council and the Mayor, there’s huge potential to bring new homes and jobs to the area around the Manchester United stadium.",
      "\"And looking ahead, I see a chance to bring the FIFA Women’s World Cup to a new Old Trafford Stadium in 2035. The home nations are the sole bidder, which presents a rare opportunity to bid to host the global football family.\"",
      "United's legendary former manager gave his seal of approval to the new stadium in March when the plans were first revealed. \"Manchester United should always strive for the best in everything it does, on and off the pitch, and that includes the stadium we play in,\" the 83-year-old explained.",
      "\"Old Trafford holds so many special memories for me personally, but we must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where new history can be made.\"",
      "The architect behind the plans for the new stadium, Lord Norman Foster, insisted in March that the new stadium plans should excite United supporters. \"This has to be one of the most exciting projects in the world today, with incredible regional and national significance,\" he explained.",
      "\"It all starts with the fans’ experience, bringing them closer than ever to the pitch and acoustically cultivating a huge roar. The stadium is contained by a vast umbrella, harvesting energy and rainwater, and sheltering a new public plaza that is twice the size of Trafalgar Square.",
      "\"The outward-looking stadium will be the beating heart of a new sustainable district, which is completely walkable, served by public transport, and endowed by nature. It is a mixed-use miniature city of the future – driving a new wave of growth and creating a global destination that Mancunians can be proud of.\"",

      "In the aftermath of Manchester United's pulsating draw with Liverpool in January, Reds skipper Bruno Fernandes aired his frustrations.",
      "It wasn't so much with United's showing at Anfield, where they came from behind to lead 2-1 before being pegged back in an enthralling draw, it was more that Ruben Amorim's side had shown they were capable of going toe-to-toe with the best.",
      "The 2-2 with Liverpool last season came a few weeks after United beat Manchester City at the Etihad while United also knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup at the Emirates last winter.",
      "Those displays against the teams that took the top three places in the Premier League belied United's ultimate 15th place finishing position as the Reds endured their worst domestic campaign since they were relegated in 1974. That was Fernandes' main gripe, the absence of consistency that saw United take one step forward and two steps back.",
      "\"I’m pretty upset,\" lambasted Fernandes moments after the full time whistle at Liverpool in January. \"Because, if we can show this today against Liverpool at Anfield, who are first in the league and who have been probably the outstanding team in the league this season, why can't we do this every week?\"",
      "Nine months on the same concerns remain. Amorim's men have won three and lost three of their opening seven league games and been dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "There were positives in defeat to Arsenal on the opening day and wins over Chelsea and Sunderland hinted at the potential in this United side. But demoralising defeats to Brentford and Manchester City undermine any signs of progress.",
      "Fernandes and Amorim will hope this weekend's trip to Liverpool can provide a positive result and a springboard to consistency.",

      "A victory at Anfield would be something of a statement performance and restore hopes that United could close the gap to the top four in their bid to bring Champions League football back to Old Trafford.",

      "But amid transfer talk linking the Reds with the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Balbea, and rumours around a potential Saudi Arabia takeover, dining at Europe's top table has argubaly never been more important.",
      "United need Champions League football to improve and succeed on and off the pitch. The absence sets clubs like United back around £85million as a starting position given the income guaranteed from matchday, broadcasting and prize money revenues. The figure would be swelled further by progress into the knockout rounds.",
      "In the absence of European nights, United look set to play to travel abroad mid-season for a friendly fixture having visited Asia immediately after the 2024-25 campaign to play two friendlies. Those fixtures earned the Reds around £8million, while a summer tour to America will have swelled coffers further.",
      "And while it is not certain whether United want to play a Saudi Pro-League club or a similarly placed European giant, such as AC Milan, head coach Ruben Amorim said last week: \"We have to do it.",
      "\"We knew that when we missed Europe, we had to compensate [for] a lot of things, including our fans and the budget. So we are putting [it] all together to do that.\"",
      "In a competitive global environment United have to try and maximise revenue. Historical success means they have a huge fanbase across the world but recent on-pitch struggles mean plenty of other clubs are making significant progress in reaching a global audience.",
      "United are enduring a season without European football, another dagger to their financial heart, with the absence of Champions League football conservatively put at £85million while the Reds did not even have the fallback of playing in the Europa League.",
      "A second successive campaign with no continental football would be a catastrophic blow to United's ambitions on and off the itch. It would hinder attempts to bring in elite players to help reshape Amorim's squad, while it would once again leave the Reds counting the cost financially.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already introduced swathes of cost-cutting measures, many controversial, since he took on partial ownership and if United cannot find a way into the Premier League's top four there will be once again be questions asked by Ratcliffe.",
      "He gave Amorim a public vote of confidence last week but a second successive campaign outside of Europe's elite, and outside of the revenue streams the competition brings, will not sit well in the United boardroom.",
      "The Reds have work to do on the pitch to ensure they can compete with the leading lights of the Premier League. This weekend's clash with Liverpool at Anfield is an acid test. Arne Slot's side are defending champions and twice broke the British transfer record in the summer as they added leading talent to their squad from a position of strength.",
      "Both sides are locked on 20 English top-flight titles, United haven't won one for more than a decade and won't win it this season.",

      "Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's reaction to being presented with a mock Manchester United contract was quite telling.",
      "With Ruben Amorim's poor run of form, United may be on the lookout for a new head coach. The Red Devils have struggled to bounce back from a disappointing end to last season, suffering three defeats in their first seven Premier League matches.",
      "Despite significant summer spending, pressure is mounting on the manager. In a surprise to many, Klopp's name has been mentioned as a potential successor should Amorim be dismissed.",
      "The notion of the German joining United, Liverpool's arch-rivals, seems unthinkable, but we got a glimpse of his possible reaction to such an offer back in 2024.",
      "Liverpool had just been knocked out of the FA Cup by United in a thrilling 4-3 match in April of last year, during Klopp's final season before Arne Slot took over. The defeat was particularly painful as young Amad Diallo scored the winning goal for Erik ten Hag's team in the final moments.",
      "A peculiar document appeared in front of Klopp as he entered the press room, clearly upset and ready to address the media. As Klopp prepared for his press conference at Old Trafford, he held up what looked like a signed United contract, expressing his bewilderment. However, things were not as they seemed.",
      "The contract was signed by YouTuber and popular streamer IShowSpeed, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr. The internet celebrity, known for his outrageous antics in videos, visited Old Trafford that year due to his admiration for club legend Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "United welcomed the 20-year-old American by offering a tour of the changing room, providing him with his own shirt and inviting him to the press room, where he penned a mock contract.",
      "It remains unclear whether the contract was deliberately left behind to wind up the Liverpool manager after the fixture, particularly since his spell at Anfield was concluding that summer. Nevertheless, Klopp appeared puzzled by the situation.",
      "Regardless, Klopp ever taking charge of United is, for the time being, inconceivable. After leaving his position at Anfield, he accepted a role with Red Bull as their Head of Global Football.",
      "Klopp has since suggested he won't return to management. Last month, in an interview with The Athletic, he was asked if he missed being a manager and responded: \"Not. At. All.",

      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko has faced a mixed reception during the opening stages of his Old Trafford stint. The 22-year-old joined United from RB Leipzig during the recent summer transfer window in a deal potentially worth £73.7million.",
      "The Reds secured Sesko's signature ahead of Champions League outfit Newcastle United, whilst Arsenal had also shown interest in the striker before deciding to pursue Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting instead. Sesko struggled initially at M16, failing to find the net in his opening six outings under Ruben Amorim's guidance.",
      "However, the Slovenian has since rediscovered his scoring touch with two strikes in his previous two matches. Amorim will be eager for his frontman to silence his doubters, with Sunday's encounter against Premier League champions Liverpool presenting an ideal platform to demonstrate his capabilities.",
      "With that in mind, below is a look at some United icons who have raised concerns about Sesko - despite his improved displays for Amorim's squad.",
      "Rio Ferdinand confessed in September that he harboured concerns regarding Sesko's sluggish introduction to life with the Reds.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the former United and England centre-back commented: \"The one I'm worried about is Sesko. He ain't getting no chances man, he ain't getting no opportunities, there's nothing created for him.",
      "\"That's the concern. A new striker comes in the football club, gets in the team, you've got to think about creating chances for him. Getting him on the end of things. He's got to think about getting on the end of things.",
      "\"That's something I think has got to be looked at, and fixed quick. I don't want to think about what it could turn out to be.\"",
      "Ex-midfielder Nicky Butt expressed concerns last month that United may have erred by bringing in Sesko rather than a more 'seasoned striker'.",
      "When questioned about his thoughts on United's summer transfer activity, Butt told BetMGM: \"I was and I wasn't. I know [Matheus] Cunha has done really well over the last couple of seasons, but I would really like an experienced striker.",
      "\"I hope I'm wrong, but I really hope they aren't making the same mistakes with [Benjamin] Sesko as they did with Rasmus [Hojlund]. A young player coming in with no Premier League experience - it just feels like history repeating itself.",
      "\"Honestly, for what it would have cost, I would have gone and brought in someone like Ollie Watkins, someone to help and pull the young strikers out of a bad patch. When young players are just coming into the club, when the onus is on them to score goals, if they're having a few bad games, they have to have the safety net of being pulled out of the firing line.",
      "\"Ollie Watkins, or someone like that, would be who I would have been looking to bring in.\"",
      "Former goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has expressed his confusion over Manchester United's decision to sign Benjamin Sesko and let go of Rasmus Hojlund during the summer transfer window.",
      "\"The signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years,\" Schmeichel shared on the BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "\"You only have to see what he's doing at Napoli with Kevin de Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with - he's scoring goals. I've consistently said this for two-and-a-half years - Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goal-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "\"We let him go on the stats that he scored very few goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service.",
      "\"You spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don't have the number six we should have, and there's the goalkeeping position as well.\"",
      "Paul Scholes, another former player, has also questioned the signing of Sesko, comparing him to Hojlund.",
      "\"You look at Rasmus Hojlund, 22-year-old kid, came when he was 20 years of age,' Scholes said on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast.",
      "\"One centre-forward for Manchester United and everything was on him, the pressure was on him and he couldn't handle it. He should be coming in and out of the team. There should be three or four centre-forwards there.",
      "\"This summer, what do they do? They let him go and they buy another one, very similar, exactly the same! 22 years of age. He's started ok, he looks like he's getting better. But where's the common sense in that?\".",

      "Sport Central Audience Writer",
      "Peter Schmeichel has claimed that Manchester United made the wrong decision by signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig and, in turn, offloading Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli during the summer transfer window.",
      "Sesko, 23, made the £66.26million plus £7.36m in add-ons switch to Old Trafford in August. After a difficult start to life at United, the Slovenia international has found the net in each of his last two appearances.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund, 22, joined Napoli on a season-long loan deal back in September. Antonio Conte's side have an obligation to buy the forward should they qualify for the Champions League. Since his move to Naples, Hojlund has scored four times in his first six games, forming a dangerous partnership with Kevin De Bruyne in the process.",
      "Allowing Hojlund to leave and bringing in Sesko, though, is a decision that doesn't make sense to Schmeichel, who has criticised United for making such a move and hit out at the club's creative players for Hojlund's woes.",
      "\"The signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have had Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years,\" Schmeichel told BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "\"You only have to see what he's doing at Napoli with Kevin De Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with - he's scoring goals. I've consistently said this for two-and-a-half years - Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goal-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "Schmeichel added that there were more pressing concerns at United that needed to be addressed first, such as sorting out their goalkeeper position and defensive midfield area.",
      "\"We let him [Hojlund] go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service. You have spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don't have the No.6 we should have, and there's the goalkeeping position as well.",
      "\"This season alone we've conceded nine goals from goalkeeping errors,\" he added. \"When I played, when Edwin van der Sar played, when David de Gea played, the brief was win 10 points a season, you don't give points away.",
      "\"Why did we bring someone in that we didn't need? Because the head of recruitment comes from RB Leipzig [also Sesko's former club] and he's got to make a mark.\"",
      "For me, Schmeichel is bang on in the fact that United had more pressing issues to sort out first and should have signed a new goalkeeper and a central defensive midfielder before addressing the striker position.",
      "It's clear that United had to fix the goalkeeper department and sign a new elite No.1 with Andre Onana struggling and Altay Bayindir failing to impress. Although the Reds managed to bring in Senne Lammens late in the transfer window, it would have been preferred if a more experienced campaigner was signed earlier in the summer months.",
      "The same applies for a new midfielder, though United didn't even manage to bring a new one in and have opted to stick with Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo as their four options in that position. That is something that could prove to be a major mistake for United, who lack real strength and steel there.",
      "While I agree with Schmeichel in that sense, I do think that he is wrong in the opinion that United should have kept Hojlund and not signed Sesko.",
      "At one point last season, Hojlund went through a 21-game goal drought which lasted more than 22 hours. However you dress that up, it's nowhere near good enough for someone that is playing for United.",
      "Across his United career, Hojlund scored just 26 times in 95 appearances. His Premier League return was particularly poor, hitting 14 goals in 62 outings - averaging almost one every five matches.",
      "Schmeichel has put the blame on United's creative players for Hojlund's shortcomings in a Reds shirt, but I think the finger should be pointed at both parties, including the forward who, at times, looked lost.",
      "There is no surprise that Amorim decided to pick Joshua Zirkzee ahead of Hojlund, before the former Bologna man suffered a season-ending hamstring injury. Zirkzee seemed to suit Amorim's system much better.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo may have helped Hojlund to score more, but neither have the creative ability of De Bruyne, who has been able to conjure up several high quality chances for the Dane at Napoli.",
      "Sometimes you need the striker to create opportunities for himself and that is what Sesko has the potential to do and more so, at least, than Hojlund who it felt like needed top class service instead.",
      "I have no doubt that Hojlund is going to score a hatful of goals for Napoli in Serie A, but sometimes the fit isn't right for the player and that is what I think it was for him at United. Therefore, the right decision was made for him to be offloaded out loan and the Reds brought in another centre forward in the shape of Sesko.",

      "Manchester United are confident that a deal can now be struck to secure land around Old Trafford which would, subsequently, pave the way for their proposed new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "United's plans for the new state-of-the-art venue - which is initially expected to cost around £2billion - have been complicated by an ongoing problem with Freightliner, who own an important bit of land behind the Stretford End.",
      "According to reports from The Daily Mail, United have offered around £50million to buy the land while Freightliner are seeking a more ambitious sum of £400million - a fee the Reds feel as 'unrealistic'. United feel that a compulsory purchase order could eventually be made, in which case the government would intervene to set a fair price.",
      "However, the report added that the club have held 'constructive' discussions with Freightliner - and are optimistic about striking a deal 'within the coming months'.",
      "Should a deal be struck up, it would mean that United can press ahead with plans, which were drawn up by Lord Norman Foster, for a new stadium complex to be built.",
      "Even though that would be another positive step, United still need to find funding for their huge project which is anticipated to cost £2bn-plus. Despite this, the club hope the new venue, dubbed 'Wembley of the North', can be finished in time for the start of the 2030/2031 season.",
      "In July, it was revealed that United are considering introducing 'Personal Seat Licences' - a method that would see supporters charged up to £4,000 for the right to buy a season ticket at the new stadium.",
      "Fans are being asked for their feedback on a variety of areas including facilities and cost.",
      "Once the new stadium is constructed and opened, United's existing home is, in turn, set to be demolished. United would likely continue to be playing at Old Trafford until they move into their new stadium, however.",
      "Architects at Foster and Partners said the new stadium would feature an umbrella design and a new public plaza that is 'twice the size of Trafalgar Square'. The design will feature three masts described as \"the trident\", which the architects say will be 200m high and visible from the Peak District.",

      "Manchester United will come up against Liverpool for the first time this season on Sunday and Arne Slot is likely to call upon Hugo Ekitike at some stage in the contest.",
      "While the headlines from the summer transfer window were stolen by Alexander Isak, Ekitike has managed to hit the ground running on Merseyside. The Frenchman has five goals in 10 appearances for Liverpool so far this season and has mostly kept Isak out of the starting line-up when available.",
      "Had it not been for his bizarre red card against Southampton in the Carabao Cup, Ekitike could have added further goals to his tally. Ahead of the contest this weekend, it is hard to imagine Ekitike representing United.",
      "However, had Isak been granted his exit from Newcastle sooner, there is a real chance that Ekitike could have gone to Old Trafford. Last month, the 23-year-old was quizzed about the possibility of signing for United.",
      "\"Liverpool are Premier League champions, with great players and great history,\" Ekitike replied as he justified his decision to move to Anfield from Eintracht Frankfurt. \"I think it was a good choice for me and that's why I chose Liverpool as it was the best option and I wanted to come.\"",
      "United will be hopeful that their inability to sign Ekitike will not come back to haunt them on Sunday. The Reds did manage to bolster their centre-forward position eventually as Benjamin Sesko was welcomed into the team.",
      "Sesko has got off to a slower start than Ekitike but he joined a team with more work to do than Liverpool. That being said, the Slovenian has scored in back-to-back matches for United prior to the international break to boost his confidence.",

      "As the dust settled on England's European Championship final defeat to Spain 18 months ago, few could have imagined Kobbie Mainoo would have earned just one cap since that 2-1 defeat in Berlin.",
      "Mainoo started the Euros final in midfield as a teenager and enjoyed an impressive tournament on the back of a breakthrough season at club level for Manchester United that culminated in a goal in an FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.",
      "England and United hero Rio Ferdinand tipped Mainoo to go and become one of the greats, while Gareth Southgate heaped praise on the midfielder ahead of selecting him in his final squad in 2024.",
      "But now, with England having confirmed their place in the World Cup in North America next summer, Mainoo is in the international wilderness.",
      "His sole cap since that final against Spain came in September 2024 when he played 77 minutes of a Nations League win over Republic of Ireland.",
      "Mainoo has slipped down the pecking order at Manchester United since Ruben Amorim's arrival with the head coach viewing him as a direct rival for captain and virtual ever-present Bruno Fernandes. It's meant Mainoo has been restricted to cameo appearances off the bench in the top flight. His only start this term was in the Carabao Cup shock loss at League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "The 20-year-old asked to leave United on loan in the summer window but that request was knocked back and any similar attempts to depart in January are likely to fall on deaf ears despite his lack of gametime.",
      "Amorim might not view Mainoo as a certain starter, but he knows the value in having a player of his quality in the squad should injuries strike.",
      "Not that any of that helps Mainoo, whose faint hopes of making a late run into England contention will be all but over if he can't find games at United.",
      "During the international break, Mainoo has made no secret of the fact he has been working hard on his strength and conditioning during his down time.",
      "He has been put through his paces by a fitness team at Complejo Deportivo Arroyo, Enmedio, a fitness centre and sports complex in the Spanish town of Estepona, posting updates on social media.",
      "The motivation for posting such content is clear – Mainoo and his camp want the world to see just how hard he is training and that he is doing everything he can to force his way into boss Amorim's plans and earn his way back into United's starting line-up.",
      "But Amorim is unlikely to budge any time soon on his selection stance. United resume their Premier League campaign at Liverpool on Sunday. Mainoo will likely again have a watching brief.",

      "Former Manchester United player and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is back on the job hunt after being fired by Besiktas at the end of August.",
      "The Norwegian was let go by the Turkish giants after losing to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport in Conference League qualifying. Since then, the rumour mill has gathered pace around where Solskjaer could be heading to next.",
      "Vacant managerial positions at Rangers and the Swedish national team are believed to be on Solksjaer's radar but, as of yet, no contracts have been signed. But with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest surrounding the 52-year-old and his potential next job.",
      "Since his exit from Besiktas, Solskjaer has been spotted back in England reuniting with one of his former United colleagues Kieran McKenna. The Ipswich Town head coach was promoted to the first-team coaching staff by Jose Mourinho but spent most of his time working with Solskjaer.",
      "Shortly after Solskjaer left United, McKenna joined the Tractor Boys and took them from League One to the Premier League before their relegation back to the Championship. On September 12, the Reds legend was in the crowd for the 5-0 victory over Sheffield United before returning shortly before the international break as Ipswich beat local rivals Norwich City 3-1.",
      "Some have insinuated that Solskjaer is the subject of an anecdote Paul Scholes shared on his The Good, The Bad and The Football Podcast. He told his fellow presenters Paddy McGuinness and Nicky Butt: \"I was actually with a lad the other night, who told me he was actually going to meet Rangers, and I’m not sure if he did, but his name hasn’t been mentioned.",
      "\"They contacted him, and he’s going to meet them in London the day after.\" When asked by McGuinness and Butt if it was Solskjaer, Scholes replied: \"No comment,\" but did reveal this person was not a current manager.",
      "Scholes could have also been referring to Michael Carrick but the wry smile suggests that McGuinness and Butt were potentially spot on with their Solskjaer guess.",
      "The bookmakers still consider it to be unlikely that Solskjaer is welcomed in at Ibrox, but reports have suggested that he has held talks with Sweden over their head coach role. Swedish media outlet FotbollDirekt understands these talks have taken place but his camp are refusing to comment on the matter.",
      "Solskjaer would not be alone in wanting the Sweden job though. Olof Mellberg and Graham Potter are also thought to be keen, with the latter expressing his interest after being sacked by West Ham United.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "According to reports, there has been an “approach” to a Manchester United legend, who is in “direct talks” over his involvement in a potential takeover.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s minority takeover of Man Utd was initially met with huge positivity, though he has become an incredibly unpopular figure.",
      "The INEOS chief owns a stake in the region of 29% and has taken control of football operations at Old Trafford, while the Glazer family remain in the background.",
      "Ratcliffe has become unpopular by sanctioning a major cost-cutting programme to balance the books at Man Utd, but has brutally made staff cuts, reduced payments to club legends and hiked ticket prices.",
      "Therefore, a large portion of United’s fanbase got excited when Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh claimed that a new takeover is ‘advanced’.",
      "There have since been conflicting reports on a potential deal, but journalist Ben Jacobs has moved to clear up a few key details.",
      "Jacobs has confirmed that talks are not “advanced”, though a group from the UAE is interested, while a “few variables” set the full takeover price.",
      "“So the latest is as follows: number one, the Glazers have not had an offer from anybody,” Jacobs said on The United Stand.",
      "READ: Man City would face 23-point deduction as Man Utd, Chelsea also in breach of £546m PL ‘salary cap’",
      "“Could they be holding talks behind other people at the club’s back? Absolutely. Are they advanced? No. And then where does the money come from? Well, Turki Al-Sheikh confirms something that we broke on this show, that it’s not Saudi Arabia.",
      "“I don’t want to disappoint the chat, but Sheikh Jassim is not coming back to the table. There is no possibility, I am told. And in addition to that, the number the Glazers want is in excess of 5 billion pounds. And if you go back through the SEC filing to look at the different bids from shape, none of the offers were anywhere close to that number.",
      "“And what makes the number higher is if, whilst this drag on clause is valid, the Glazers do sell. So Jim Ratcliffe is guaranteed $33 a share, which takes the overall valuation of the club to something around 4.7 billion.",
      "“So again, not far off that 5 billion pound number. And all of this means, if someone’s to buy the club now, they’re going to have to pay a premium, and then Sir Jim Ratcliffe would have to go buy a wanted 100% so there’s a few variables here.”",
      "The “most interesting thing” revealed by Jacobs is that United legend Eric Cantona has held “direct talks” with the group and has been “approached” about “coming on board”.",
      "“The last thing, and the most interesting thing that I can add, and I think this counts as a bit of a United Stand exclusive, is that within the UAE, one company in particular is involved in these talks,” Jacobs added.",
      "“It’s unclear whether they will front the consortium, but international holding company or IHC, which has been around for about three decades, have been part of talks to put together a perspective of a UAE-based Consortium.",
      "“We don’t know whether anything is going to materialise. And as we said on talkSPORT a few weeks ago, some ex-Manchester United legends have also been sounded out not to invest, but just to be ambassadors.",
      "“And quite interestingly, some, I think they’ll be excited to others, I think they will almost feel the optics of this are not quite right because of the kind of personality he is. One ex-Manchester United legend in particular has held direct talks about maybe coming on board.”",
      "He added: “I would just stress one thing really, clearly, it is nowhere near as advanced as Turki implied, nor have the Glazers had any kind of direct contact.",
      "“Yet there’s no guarantee this even develops into anything. But Eric Cantona is one of the names that has been approached.”"

      "“I thought Liverpool fully deserved to get beat by Crystal Palace and Galatasaray. They must get back on track now,” Merson told Sportskeeda.",
      "“All the three Liverpool defeats have come away from home and now they return to Anfield. We all know Liverpool are a different beast on home turf, and Manchester United haven’t been great on their travels!",
      "“I said this before as well, Liverpool went too top heavy in the summer transfer window. People told me Alexander Isak would help Liverpool walk the league.",

      "“I have a feeling Isak will start this game because of the transfer fee. You just can’t leave him out when you pay that kind of money, can you? If you pay over £100 million for players, they have to be in the line-up for the big games and this is one of them,” Merson added.",

      "“I also think Florian Wirtz is a decent option for this game. Manchester United are not strong in midfield and I wouldn’t be surprised if Slot deploys Wirtz in that no.10 role. I believe Wirtz can cause problems to United too.",
      "“We have to talk about Mohamed Salah as well, he has struggled so far this season. Without Trent Alexander-Arnold, he isn’t the same player.",

If you don’t get results, I don’t care what length of contract you’re on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",

But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don’t win there, you’ve got Brighton coming up and that’s not an easy game the way they’re playing at the minute.",

That’s right, it’s some more words about Ange Postecoglou. We have never been more back.",
      "Here are just five managers who could really, really do with a win this weekend, ranked by how likely failure to do so might see them sacked in the morning, or at the very least facing all manner of unhelpful headlines and cracked-badge imagery and relentless use of the word ‘beleaguered’.",
      "",
      "You do feel a bit for Burnley. They’ve had a couple of paddlings, sure, and those are par for the promoted course. Nobody expects any promoted side to entirely avoid paddlings.",
      "Parker himself took that a bit too far, of course, when at Bournemouth he considered 9-0 defeats to be inevitable, but the general principle is sound. Sometimes as a promoted side you will get battered.",
      "But Burnley have been desperately close to some truly eye-catching results in other games, with heartbreaking late penalties costing them points at home to Liverpool and in a relegation six-pointer at Old Trafford.",
      "The encouraging nature of so many Burnley performances, combined with the laser focus of manager-crisis-based coverage to more conspicuous catastrophes elsewhere, has meant Parker has not found himself in the spotlight at all.",
      "But Burnley do have only four points from seven games and haven’t yet beaten anyone who was in the Premier League last season. At some point they really are going to have to beat somebody who was in the Premier League last season.",
      "That can wait until next weekend’s trip to Wolves, though, because it’s another six-pointer for Burnley before that at home to Leeds. Far too early to talk about must-win games, but you do feel the Clarets need at least one win from these two games. Because after that it’s Arsenal and suddenly Burnley could be looking distinctly adrift and Parker therefore in inevitable job-security bother.",
      "",
      "Liverpool have been forced to spend the international break in mini-crisis purgatory after a disastrous run of disastrous form saw them disastrously tumble all the way down to second in the league table a whopping one point behind runaway leaders and champions-elect Arsenal, who are infamously simply unstoppable once they get their noses in front in October.",
      "But that mini-crisis will surely escalate to full-blown regular-sized crisis if he makes another bollocks of another game, especially with the game in question being at home against giant-crisis Manchester United.",
      "Of course all the crisis talk at Liverpool is quite daft, but if they do fail to beat what has become in recent years, with all due respect to Spurs, the Premier League’s most reliable banter club then we will tick past a full month since Liverpool last won a league game. And even with an interlull in the middle of that run it would still be quite bad, wouldn’t it?",
      "That would still be a very long time to go without winning a league game, for a team that is trying to win the league.",
      "The other problem for Liverpool, beyond their own tribulations, is that in the last couple of seasons a trip to Anfield has proved one of those occasions where the old 1990s muscle memory kicks in and United produce an actual performance. They’ve escaped Anfield with a point in each of the last two seasons since losing so horrifically 4-0 and 7-0 in 21/22 and 22/23.",
      "A win for Liverpool and the mini-crisis is over. That’s the beauty of a mini-crisis – it’s quite easily escaped. But anything less and there is significant danger of escalation of the threat level. And then it gets harder to reach escape velocity. We estimate it might really be as little as a week before Slot is declared a bald fraud if things go badly. Vigilance is key.",

      "Sunderland away has developed an uncomfortably six-pointerish feel for Pereira and a Wolves side that remains the only team in the Premier League yet to record a victory this season. When you consider that the Premier League includes West Ham, you start to realise just how bad that is.",
      "Not even a visit to Dr Tottenham could fully cure Wolves of their long-standing slow-starting ills, but a pair of 1-1 draws before the international break was something at least.",
      "Really does feel like it’s very much time to actually get a win now, though. It’s getting silly, and while Manchester United and Nottingham Forest continue to provide absurd level of cover for Pereira and indeed every other manager in the league, there really is only so long that can continue.",

      "It’s a staggering achievement, one that belies the talk of United being in some kind of crisis, and one that would instantly elevate Amorim into the pantheon of truly great Premier League managers to have achieved something so staggering as not one but two victories in a row, placing him alongside such Barclays managerial luminaries as David Wagner, Velimir Zajec, Paul Ince and Ricky Sbragia.",

      "With no wins in his first seven games, a run that has included defeats to Swansea, Sunderland and Midtjylland, Postecoglou is under the most severe of pressure already and with the entire footballing world lining up to scream ‘We told you so’ at Forest if and when they do give in and pull the plug.",
      "And it really might be after this game if Forest don’t show something. Turning a game against Chelsea into a must-win caper for a manager so early into a reign does still feel impossibly harsh, but it’s also hard to overstate just how quickly and thoroughly Postecoglou has burned through any goodwill and wriggle room across some gentler games.",
      "This was a manager who arrived at Forest with absolutely no recent Premier League form to point to in his defence and who never looked the right fit for the squad he would inherit. Forest have speedrun the entire Angeball experience, and really could be in the final throes already. Alas, without the inexplicable European trophy to show for it.",

      "Almost a year on from his arrival at Old Trafford, the future of Amorim at United looks increasingly uncertain with a 15th-place finish last season followed by an unremarkable start to the new campaign.",
      "Minority owner Jim Ratcliffe has given his backing to the Portuguese coach but his tactical inflexibility has become increasingly frustrating for the home crowd.",
      "While plenty of former United players have had their say as to who should succeed Amorim, one still backing him is Pallister who suggested the 40-year-old still deserved time.",
      "“I don’t think it’s over,” Pallister exclusively told F365. “He’s under immense pressure.",
      "“But we can’t just carry on sacking managers, we need some kind of stability there. But ultimately, he knows if results keep going the way they have been, then the pressure is going to mount. That’s just the nature of football. You can’t hide away from that, and I’m sure he’s aware of that. I think he said it himself.”",

      "Pallister did though address Amorim’s reluctance to deviate from his preferred 3-4-3 formation, saying that while it is good to have a system, a manager needs to be able to change it during a game.",
      "“He’s not for changing with his system, which is what everybody seems to be talking about,” four-time Premier League winner Pallister said. “I would like to see him being a little bit more adaptable because if it doesn’t work like that, change it within the game.",
      "“That, I believe, is what’s not working. Maybe change it, otherwise you’re just making the same mistakes time and time again.",
      "“And we talk about managers not having a plan B – at the moment, that doesn’t look like a plan B. We’re sticking to it, and that’s all fair and well starting with that but if it’s not working, why can’t you change it within the game?”",
      "Next for Amorim is a trip to Anfield, a stadium United have not won at in over a decade, and Pallister conceded if United are “humiliated”, the pressure will build on Amorim’s job.",
      "“Massive game coming up against Liverpool on Sunday,” he said. “The victories so far have been against 10-man Chelsea and Burnley and Sunderland, who came up from the Championship last year, and both at home.",

      "As the Premier League clubs prepare to vote on a new ‘salary cap’ rule known as ‘anchoring’ we’ve crunched some already-crunched numbers to work out exactly why Chelsea and the Manchester clubs are in a state of panic.",
      "Under the proposed system, clubs would be limited to spending no more than five times the broadcast and prize revenue earned by the team finishing last in the Premier League on their ‘football squad costs’, which include wages, amortisation (transfer fees spread over duration of contract) and agents’ fees.",
      "Based on the 2024/2025 prize money table, that would mean a spending limit of £546m for Premier League clubs.",
      "Anchoring would work on top of the squad-cost ratio rules (SCR), which could replace the existing profit and sustainability rules which permit losses of £105m over three years. SCR limits spending to 85% of revenue.",
      "To be approved, the proposal would require support from at least 14 of the 20 clubs, and unsurprisingly, Manchester United chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe is dead set against the idea.",
      "“[Anchoring] would inhibit the top clubs in the Premier League,” Ratcliffe said. “And the last thing you want is for the top clubs in the Premier League not to be able to compete with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, PSG – that’s absurd. And if it does, it then ceases to be the finest league in the world.”",
      "Is that “the last thing you want”? Answers on a postcard. It’s undoubtedly the last thing United want, along with Manchester City and Chelsea, who would now be in breach if the rules were in place this season.",
      "Well, we don’t quite know. The wages and amortisation figures we’ve used from the brilliant Swiss Ramble are from the 2023/2024 season, along with the agent and intermediary payments from 2024/2025, but it gives us a decent idea, so we’ve ranked Premier League teams (excluding the relegated/promoted trios) from lowest season expenditure to highest.",
      "The proposal is for a second breach to be dealt with by a six-point deduction, with an additional point for every £6.5m spent over the £546m mark, so we’ve also worked out just how many points the three offenders would have been docked.",

      "Peter Schmeichel has hit out at Manchester United over five mistakes in the transfer market, including one summer signing brought in purely because one “powerful” Red Devils chief just had to “make a mark” at the club.",
      "Ruben Amorim remains under significant pressure at United – he’s second in the sack race – having picked up just 37 points in his 34 Premier League games in charge and faces the daunting task of Liverpool at Anfield as they return to action after the international break on Sunday.",
      "And Schmeichel is baffled by his former club’s moves in the transfer market; in particular their £66m signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig to replace Rasmus Hojlund, who moved to Napoli.",
      "While Sesko has two goals in eight appearances for United this term, Hojlund has hit the ground running in Naples, scoring four in six, having been given the service that Schmeichel believes he would have received at Old Trafford had he remained at the club.",
      "“At United you’ve got a head coach [Ruben Amorim], then you had a director of football [Dan Ashworth], a technical director or whatever Jason Wilcox’s title is, and you’ve got a head of recruitment [Christopher Vivell], who is very powerful,” he told BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "“You’ve got a lot of people deciding on who is coming in.",
      "“For instance, the signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years.",
      "“You only have to see what he’s doing at Napoli with Kevin de Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with – he’s scoring goals.",
      "“I’ve consistently said this for two and a half years – Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goals-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "“We let him go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service.”",

      "He added: “You spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don’t have the number six we should have, and there’s the goalkeeping position as well.",
      "“This season alone we’ve conceded nine goals from goalkeeping errors. When I played, when Edwin van der Sar played, when David de Gea played, the brief was win 10 points a season, you don’t give points away.",
      "“Why did we bring someone in that we didn’t need? Because the head of recruitment comes from Leipzig [also Sesko’s former club] and he’s got to make a mark.",
      "“When I played, the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson] was in charge. He said ‘him in and him out’. Now it’s different people with different agendas that decide. How can you create a stable environment to have a football team that can go out and win every game?”",

      "“What’s he doing at Napoli?” said Schmeichel. “He is so Manchester United.",
      "“The problem was his versatility, because you have players who can only play in one position. Managers didn’t trust him to build the team around. They want the neat players. He was the victim of that time and again.",

      "Man Utd could look to sign Mateo Retegui from Saudi Pro League side Al-Qadsiah over the next couple of transfer windows, according to reports.",
      "There were rumours ahead of their match against Sunderland that a bad result could see Man Utd look into replacements for Ruben Amorim over the international break.",
      "Amorim seems one poor result away from extra pressure at the moment, due to their inconsistent form, and the Man Utd head coach faces Liverpool at Anfield in his side’s first match back after the international break.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to judge Amorim after three years at Old Trafford but the Portuguese’s record of 37 points from 34 Premier League matches is surely setting alarm bells ringing in the boardroom.",
      "But they could support Amorim in January as Man Utd are still struggling to score goals with just nine in their first seven Premier League matches of the season.",

      "And now Spanish publication Fichajes insists that Man Utd have ‘identified a more than interesting target in the Middle East’ to give Benjamin Sesko some competition.",
      "Man Utd are ‘keeping a close eye on’ Retegui, who moved from Atalanta to Saudi Pro League side Al-Qadsiah last summer, and they have added him to ‘their list of candidates to strengthen their forward line’.",
      "The Spanish outlet adds: ‘Reports estimate that United could pay between 50 and 60 million euros (£44m and £52m) for his signing, a figure that pales in comparison to what Al Qadsiah paid, but which could convince if they negotiate well.",
      "‘The English club sees Retegui as an interesting player to complement or compete with its current attacking options. His recent performances support this.’",
      "Retegui has scored three goals in four Saudi Pro League appearances, while he has contributed four goals and four assists in Italy’s last four World Cup qualifiers.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta is another striker linked to Man Utd and Fichajes claims that the Red Devils have put the France international ‘on their offensive radar’.",
      "In a separate report, the website added: ‘United are looking to strengthen their forward line, and Mateta appears to be a solid alternative. With players like Mbeumo lacking consistent goalscoring potential, the club’s need for him is becoming imperative.",

      "Another classic international break is in the books, and who could forget the thrills and spills of England’s rollercoaster ride to an easy 3-0 win over Wales and an easy 5-0 win over Latvia?",
      "Truly, the history books will have to be rewritten. Everything else is a footnote. England are going to the World Cup. We thought they might.",
      "We all know there’s a conspicuous elephant in the England selection room right now and we’re sure you’re eager to see just how far Jude Bellingham has fallen here. Some of you may even have skipped ahead. Naughty, but we’ll forgive you.",
      "Personally we’re more interested in just how far Djed Spence has climbed, but we fully appreciate that might just be us.",
      "As ever, the number-one and most important rule to keep in mind with the Ladder is this: this is not our top 50, but our best guess at what we think Thomas Tuchel’s top 50 is. And, just to set ourselves thoroughly up for November’s disastrous fall, we do think we’re starting to get a handle on how he’s approaching the job now. And who that is good/bad news for.",
      "Last month’s England Ladder is here for your perusal, with the brackets below indicating each player’s ranking within it.",
      "",
      "And just like we always do and just like we knew we would again, after bumping Kane down a spot just to feel alive we pop him straight back to the top. Has perhaps never been under less threat for his starting spot in this team, and does seem like a fever dream now to consider he was struggling so much during the Euros last summer that actual cheers greeted him being replaced by Ollie Watkins.",
      "The lack of competition for his place might be of more concern if he wasn’t just so unbelievably brilliant. We will still fight anyone who says he’s playing better than ever; he’s just doing all the same incredible things he did for years and years and years except instead of doing them for a silly team in a truly elite league he’s doing them for a truly elite team in a silly league.",
      "But the key thing here is the incredibleness and brilliance. Even those of us who believe his real goal tally to be zero must accept that Kane is now quite likely to reach 100 goals for a country where for over a century the 50-goal mark appeared to represent an unbreakable ceiling.",
      "Ronaldo-like longevity cannot be ruled out for a player who looks after himself impeccably, making it highly conceivable that when his England career does finally end he will have twice as many goals as any other England player in history.",
      "And people will still argue he isn’t an all-time great. Maybe he just needs a haircut.",
      "",
      "Just a brilliant player whose role and its importance grows with every game for both club and country. A perfect example of how stepping up in class as he did when leaving West Ham for Arsenal can help mould an excellent player into a truly world-class one.",
      "Very little more you could want from a midfielder than what Rice now delivers on a regular basis, and his set-piece prowess in particular absolutely screams tight-tournament-game difference-maker.",
      "As we say in every Ladder these days, the numbers next to his and Harry Kane’s names are largely meaningless because both are absolute nailed-on certainties.",
      "",
      "Has played every competitive game since Thomas Tuchel took over and has conceded not one goal. Quality of opposition a factor, for sure, but it’s still a remarkable degree of faultlessness for a player who absolutely loves playing for England and has become exceptionally good at it.",
      "",
      "Brilliant against Wales, quieter against Latvia, still we’re pretty certain when push comes to tournament shove a definite starter on the right in a full-strength England team, no matter how persuasive and admirable and extremely-useful-to-have-around-just-in-case the charms of Noni Madueke may be.",
      "As it is for England, so it is for Arsenal. It’s a very good situation for both, and there’s no real need to complicate it beyond that, we don’t think.",
      "",
      "Lovely to have him back in an England shirt for the first time in a year, and it just looked and felt right to have him there. There really is a lovely experienced and reassuringly reliable spine to that England team with Stones back in position ahead of Pickford and behind Rice and Kane.",
      "",
      "Continues to look utterly suited to and entirely unflustered by international football, and that partnership with Rice already looks like one that manages the neat yet deceptively difficult trick for a midfield duo of highlighting and accentuating each man’s strengths rather than each man’s flaws.",
      "It’s a trick that has quite famously proved beyond some of England’s very best central midfielders ever.",
      "One of the biggest and most significant problems to which Tuchel had to find a swift answer on this short sprint to attempted World Cup glory was ‘Who partners Declan Rice in midfield?’",
      "It is no longer a big or significant problem.",
      "",
      "His absence against Latvia was reportedly nothing more than ‘managing minutes’ so for now we’re still assuming he’s ahead of Ezri Konsa in the centre-back pecking order but there’s no real doubt now that both are in the top three of said centre-back pecking order.",
      "We very much enjoyed his ‘centre-back playmaker’ role against Wales. You just don’t see that often.",
      "",
      "Injured Reece James is injured. So, so utterly frustrating, but it does at least appear on this occasion that his latest absence from England duty was precautionary rather than strictly necessary and represented just some sensible club-country joint dialogue and decision-making towards a mutually beneficial final outcome.",
      "We’re very sure that a fully fit James is Tuchel’s first-choice right-back, given their history and James’ quality, but above all that because of the fact that in his absence during this break Tuchel didn’t actually even take the chance to look at a different right-back.",
      "Centre-back Ezri Konsa did the job for most of the Wales game, with left-back Djed Spence finishing that job and then staying there for the Latvia game.",
      "A left-back doing a passable fill-in job at right-back was at least a fun little Tuchel reversal of one of Gareth Southgate’s favourite tropes.",
      "",
      "We find ourselves in agreement with Tuchel but not, perhaps, with a majority of England fans that Gordon is the first-choice starter on the left-wing now.",
      "As with Morgan Rogers, the evidence Tuchel is showing us tells us that’s how he sees it, Gordon having started each of the last three games.",
      "We didn’t really understand much of the criticism of Gordon’s performance against Wales. The frustration that the end product wasn’t quite there is fine, but it seemed to be overplayed in regard to what was there, which was further evidence of how Gordon’s direct running on the left offers a counterpoint and contrast to England’s more methodical and patient approach elsewhere, giving them the ability to alter the pace and direction of their attacks in a pleasingly defence-disorienting manner.",
      "He also struck up an instant rapport with Djed Spence that possibly answers another of England’s thornier pre-World Cup posers.",
      "But even if the criticisms after Wales were valid, the Latvia performance silenced them. Created a big early chance for Harry Kane – and if you create a big chance for Harry Kane at this moment in time and don’t end up with an assist to show for it you can count yourself particularly unfortunate – before grabbing his chance to score a brilliant counter-attack goal the one moment Latvia’s back nine were briefly otherwise engaged on a rare and foolhardy attack .",
      "Your mileage may vary, but for us for now – and, far more importantly, for Tuchel – he’s won the battle with Marcus Rashford.",
      "",
      "A better showing against Latvia really would have been even more persuasive but when you combine the fact Rogers has started four of England’s last five qualifiers, including each of the last three in the No. 10 position, with everything Tuchel has side about backing and continuing to select the men in possession who are doing the business for him it becomes impossible to conclude anything other than that at this moment of time Rogers is England’s first choice in that position.",
      "And, as ever, while we may call it ‘our’ F365 England Ladder it is always nothing more nor less than our best guess at figuring out the current England manager’s Ladder.",
      "Sweep away all the narrative and the discourse and the noise, and when viewed like that it’s pretty clear how the land currently lies.",
      "",
      "Resurrected his Tottenham career in spectacular style last season, culminating in Europa League glory and a long-awaited chance for another trophy-and-cigars photo op, and now spending this season making a momentous climb in the England standings.",
      "In the summer, we had him down at 47 among the ‘might be in with a shot if injuries strike, we suppose’ afterthought slots, far too close to Phil Neville for comfort. By last month he’d jumped into a tentative ‘could make the final squad, actually’ position. And now we think he’s Tuchel’s first-choice left-back. Fight us.",
      "He’s the best pure defender England have available among their vast array of full-back options, probably on either flank, and our argument would be this: if you’re starting him, as Tuchel did in both games here, in friendlies and straightforward easily-won qualifiers, then you are surely definitely going to start him in your actual tournament games where defending might actually matter.",
      "Despite starting his career the other way round, Spence is now definitely a left-back who can do a job at right-back, and for England that really is probably the more useful way round to be. Is clearly working on becoming a more effective contributor to the attacking side of the game, and, while Wales were startlingly and surprisingly flimsy opposition at Wembley, there were plenty of encouraging signs in the way he and Gordon linked up on the left flank that night.",
      "He just looks the right fit at the right time, and a potentially huge beneficiary of Tuchel walking the walk with his ‘backing the players who deliver for me’ approach to selection.",
      "READ: Roy Keane guilty of lazy stereotypes with Djed Spence ‘defensive side’ worries",
      "",
      "The elephant in the room and the press have basically already told us this is going to be the only talking point for the now-moribund November international break. With England qualifying in record time and flawless fashion (six games, six wins, no goals conceded remember) something has to be bad and terrible and that something is going to be the Bellingham Situation. It already is the Bellingham Situation, but next month’s Bellingham Week will plumb fresh depths.",
      "And there’s no way out of it for any of us now. It’s going to be all the media want to talk about, which they will combine with sad shaking of their heads as if they are not responsible for any of it. And this happens especially if Tuchel picks him in November, but especially if he doesn’t.",
      "Which brings us to the big question for our purposes. Will Tuchel in fact pick him? It does seem to have been almost entirely overlooked and/or forgotten that this is a player who’s played about 120 minutes of football this season and for whom a fortnight spent building up fitness and sharpness really might prove just more useful in the long term than playing in two really very low-key and low-pressure internationals for England.",
      "But we must also consider that Tuchel is not keeping secrets or playing games. He’s very, very clear: he will back the players who deliver for him, and across the last two Bellingham-less international breaks, England’s non-Bellinghams have delivered for him. Tuchel even suggested Bukayo Saka only got back in this time because Noni Madueke, in Tuchel’s eyes the man in possession, was injured.",
      "This one really does feel like it’s more about Bellingham now than Tuchel. The England manager has no vendetta against Bellingham and nothing he’s said suggests he has any problem at all with picking him again in the future. But Tuchel is evidently now very comfortable with not picking Bellingham, and England’s results mean only Bellingham can change that. He has to a) play and b) play well for Real Madrid.",
      "If he does that, we’re pretty sure Tuchel will pick him. But it still feels pretty wild to be having any of this kind of uncertainty about a player who has for several Ladders in a row now formed part of the straightforward default top five. A group including Kane, Rice, Saka and Pickford, where, sure, there might be some internal shuffling of the order amongst them but you were still always dealing with the core five inked-in certain starters. At the very, very least, Bellingham is no longer part of that little group.",
      "",
      "An international break that did absolutely no harm to Konsa’s rock-solid squad-member status. Did a perfectly passable job as right-back in the first game before slotting seamlessly into his more customary centre-back role for the second.",
      "Neither game was among the more arduous of Konsa’s career, but there was one excellent tracking run and last-gasp chance-snuffing tackle for the highlight reel in Riga.",
      "He’s still one player where we will deviate slightly from the general rule that Tuchel’s most recent starters are his starters, because there are explanations as to why Konsa started both games.",
      "We don’t think he starts when everyone is available, given the explanations at hand for why Konsa started these games – and did so in different positions.",
      "What he definitely hasn’t done is fall many rungs from his previous ‘just outside the starting XI’ position.",
      "",
      "Seems very unlikely Henderson could play his way into a first-choice starting role in England’s dynamic new midfield, but also feels even less likely he could now play his way out of his current squad role as canny senior pro and standards-setter.",
      "Again, we don’t need to overcomplicate this one. Tuchel has picked him in his squad at every opportunity, but started him in a game only once, with five further caps coming as a relatively late substitute.",
      "You don’t necessarily have to agree with it or like it, but you can’t argue with the role clarity on display here.",
      "",
      "A very lively cameo from the bench in Riga adds another layer of intrigue to the No. 10 battle, while Eze also obviously offers another tantalising option in the wide areas.",
      "Has made four appearances for England during this qualifying campaign, with three of those as substitute for the last 30-odd minutes.",
      "We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: we’re still getting to know Tuchel and his ways and, while we do think we’re getting the hang of him now, when he shows us how he sees a player with this level of clarity we will cheerfully go along with it.",
      "Eze is a valued and valuable member of the squad, a dynamic game-changing option from the bench, but not yet a regular starter. All of that is absolutely fine.",
      "",
      "Got himself a goal in a decent enough performance against Wales, and we have absolutely no problem at all with Watkins filling that all-important Harry Kane’s Back-up role that exists in any England squad.",
      "What we do have a problem with is the fact Watkins now appears to be pretty much as unchallenged for that particular role as Kane is for his.",
      "",
      "Deeply unfortunate injury timing given how well he was playing for both club and country, but when he returns we fully expect him to be a thoroughly capable and entirely trusted Saka back-up for both club and country.",
      "",
      "Came on for Gordon in both games this month. A slight curiosity of that is that this therefore represents a break where his place within the squad has become more assured even as he has slipped slightly further away from a starting berth.",
      "Does just feel like Tuchel prefers what Gordon offers on that left-hand side, but Rashford has done himself no harm with his form for Barcelona or work during this camp, and offers a nice level of international and big-tournament know-how in a squad that is still a bit of a mix of a handful of extremely experienced veterans and a whole bunch of excellent but quite inexperienced players, yet not all that many in the 40-80 cap sweet spot.",
      "",
      "Current reports suggest an eight-week lay-off for Livramento after that nasty looking injury against Arsenal. Could have been better, could also have been much worse. But it does mean that he’s also set to miss the November international break and hand Djed Spence further opportunity to bed himself in as England’s first-choice left-back, a position that had looked there for Livramento’s taking.",
      "",
      "Assorted injury hassles have restricted him to barely an hour of football for England during Thomas Tuchel’s reign to date, meaning he is one player it is still desperately hard to place. Is he a Gordon, or is he a Foden? We just don’t yet quite know exactly how Tuchel sees him.",
      "This is where we were with just about every player a few windows ago; it’s a relief at least that Palmer is now something of an outlier in that regard.",
      "",
      "Still the only other goalkeeper Tuchel has used besides Pickford during his eight games in charge, sitting on the bench in the No. 13 shirt for each of the other seven.",
      "Ergo: he’s the second-choice keeper until we see some kind of evidence that he isn’t.",
      "",
      "An obviously excellent footballer but perhaps the least starry of England’s many, many attacking options across both flanks.",
      "Yet we must again defer to the evidence Tuchel is presenting us. Bowen has been involved in all but one of the international breaks for which Tuchel has been in charge, and has made an appearance in five of the six games for which he’s been in the squad.",
      "And if you’re a fringe player who was going to miss out on one international break so far under Tuchel, you would definitely want it to be that grisly one in the summer where England scraped a wholly unconvincing 1-0 qualifying win over Andorra before losing a friendly to Senegal.",
      "Shrewd work from Bowen; the only other Tuchel game in which he’s played no part at all was the other game against Andorra, in which England were scruffy 2-0 winners.",
      "Causation and correlation be damned; the facts are that Bowen has played some part in Tuchel’s five most convincing matches as manager of England, and no part in the three least convincing. If nothing else, it’s a handy knack.",
      "",
      "A key rule of Thomas Tuchel England squads does appear to be that once you’re in them, it is up to someone else to force you out. And after seven years in the international wilderness, Loftus-Cheek is now very much in Tuchel’s England squads.",
      "",
      "In the squad again, and came off the bench against Latvia to perform a role that mainly amounted to being a very, very large target for England’s flurry of free-kicks and corners in the closing minutes of a long-settled contest.",
      "What it does do is tell us that he’s still one of Tuchel’s four centre-back picks at this stage, albeit clearly the least secure with Stones, Guehi and Konsa all looking like World Cup certainties.",
      "",
      "Look, third-choice keeper is rarely a position to worry yourself about unduly. If you reach a point in a tournament where you’re using your third-choice keeper, you’re probably already mired in deep and inescapable sh*t anyway.",
      "And the fact Trafford has sat on the bench as third-choice keeper for every single one of Tuchel’s games to date remains the most compelling data point available to us.",
      "But there’s an obvious cloud on the horizon here with Trafford having lost the No. 1 spot at Man City to Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Pretty hard to argue at this time that if England did find themselves having to actually use a third-choice keeper that you’d be more reassured to see Trafford out there than, say, Nick Pope.",
      "",
      "If you’re a promising young midfielder and Pep Guardiola says he wants to turn you into a full-back, let him. Earned his first senior call-up this month after Reece James’ withdrawal, and while he didn’t get his chance in the end against either Wales or Latvia nor did any other right-back.",
      "Which means under the rules of Tuchelism, O’Reilly is in until he isn’t. Because there has to be another full-back in there; you cannot possibly pick Reece James as your only specialist right-back and then rely on Spence or a shuffled-along centre-back as your only cover.",
      "Whether that ends up being O’Reilly or someone less rogue, time will tell. But again. Tuchel’s rules, not ours. Nothing we can do about that, apart from the times when we decide we’re simply going to break them.",
      "",
      "Did get some minutes against Wales, but did little with them really. He’s a damn fine player and one of our favourites, but very clearly now sits behind Morgan Rogers and probably Eberechi Eze and, when it comes down to it, almost certainly also Jude Bellingham among England’s really very good No. 10 options. And we’ve not even mentioned Cole Palmer or Phil Foden, until just now, when we did mention them.",
      "With Anderson’s emergence reducing the likelihood of any Bellingham return being alongside rather than in front of Rice in England’s midfield, it does all rather leave Gibbs-White looking like your classic ‘one of six players cut from the provisional squad’ next summer. The James Ward-Prowse role, if you will.",
      "",
      "You felt for him during the Latvia game. Just isn’t playing enough football for Arsenal, and short of a Riccardo Calafiori injury we’re really not sure that’s going to change. It was entirely understandable that he looked so far off it when handed a chance to impress in Riga, but the problem for Lewis-Skelly is that there isn’t really a huge amount he can do about it apart from just knuckle down and hope.",
      "Currently hard to shift the notion that with all things being equal and if nothing materially changes between now and next summer he will find himself behind both Djed Spence and a fit-again Tino Livramento in the pecking order.",
      "And third-choice left-back isn’t usually a great position to be in when tournament squads are being finalised and whittled down.",
      "",
      "Might be a slight case of heart ruling head here because we really do love Wharton and feel like England might have missed a trick with him. Elliot Anderson appears to have locked down a starting spot alongside Rice and that’s all good. We have no issue there; Anderson is a fine player and definitely seems to be one of those who just looks right at home in the international game.",
      "But it would be a massive shame if Tuchel can’t find at least a squad role for someone of Wharton’s supreme talent and ability to offer a fresh approach from an unusual angle. He’s your classic ‘footballer in an era of athletes’ kind of player, one who just sees the game slightly differently, capable of spotting and most importantly delivering the kind of passes others simply cannot.",
      "The concerns around his ability to cover the requisite ground for Tuchelball are valid if dreary, but we do love the idea of Wharton as a bench option for times when a particularly stubborn low block requires unlocking.",
      "And luckily we can bump him up the list slightly here without breaking any of our own rules, because Tuchel himself admitted Wharton was unlucky to be overlooked this time around given his Crystal Palace form.",
      "‘He deserves to be with us,’ Tuchel said after naming his latest squad. Yes, Thomas. Yes he does. If only there were someone who could make that happen.",
      "",
      "Has spent pretty much his entire England career being just about the hardest player to place in the Ladder and the one most likely to make us look very clever and then very stupid on a month-by-month rota basis.",
      "We still don’t have much idea what to do with him and precious little Tuchel-era data to go by. The positive spin on it might be that while Reece James does appear to be Tuchel’s first choice the manager didn’t take the chance to look at any other actual right-backs during James’ absence this month, which would indicate a door that remains there to be opened.",
      "Does, though, still feel like the question at the moment with TAA and the World Cup is not so much ‘Is he in the squad?’ but ‘How far away from the squad is he?’",
      "",
      "Could a great big grown-up year like 2026 really feature a good old-fashioned, full-throated Jack Grealish Clamour? It absolutely f*cking could, you know. We are so back.",
      "",
      "Remember when Tuchel started him over Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back that time? That was a good bit. And people say Germans have no sense of humour.",
      "",
      "The only way is down until something changes. And that change is going to have to be increasingly drastic while looking increasingly unlikely. Foden is currently destined for an absolute puzzle of an England career.",
      "",
      "Has impressed for Bayer Leverkusen after a summer move Liverpool might live to regret to a fairly hefty degree, and was on the bench for the Wales game before being forced out of the squad to face Latvia by injury. Stones, Guehi and Konsa appear absolute certainties for the final squad, but there does look like being at least one centre-back spot – currently held by Dan Burn – for which competition at least still exists.",
      "",
      "Playing Premier League and Champions League football – and playing them very well indeed apart from that costly 30-second wobble against Arsenal – while England’s third-choice goalkeeper rides the bench at Man City. Has to give him some chance, doesn’t it? And at the very least positions him as a non-panic-inducing option should some misfortune or other befall any of the three keepers currently ahead of him.",
      "",
      "That Senegal game really did hurt a lot of chances for a lot of players.",
      "",
      "You do occasionally just get those players where, for no apparent rhyme or reason, international football just passes them by. With each passing international break the fear grows that Branthwaite really could find himself alongside Steve Bruce on Sporcle quizzes 15 years from now.",
      "",
      "Permanently injured, which really doesn’t help your chances of an international recall. Yet a glance around the Premier League reveals just how little Solanke might have to do for Spurs if/when he does recover from injury to find his way back into the England frame should Ollie Watkins or, heaven help us all, Harry Kane get injured.",
      "",

      "The Red Devils also brought in a new goalkeeper in Senne Lammens but many fans and former players think they overlooked the signing of a new midfielder.",
      "Man Utd are crying out for a quality defensive midfielder and were briefly linked to Baleba over the summer before it became evident the Red Devils couldn’t afford the huge £115m fee which Brighton were demanding for the Cameroon international.",

      "READ: World Cup turncoats include £50m Manchester United signing and iconic winner’s son",
      "The report adds: ‘Sources have told The i Paper that Wharton’s effortless ascendancy, along with the fact Baleba seems to struggle with the attention, having not completed a single full 90 minutes for Brighton this term, has caused several senior United figures to rethink their shortlist.’",
      "Transfer insider Graeme Bailey reckons Man Utd could sign a midfielder in January but a loan signing could be more realistic before a big signing in the summer.",
      "Bailey told United In Focus: “It could be the case that we see a midfield signing in January, maybe even a loan before we see a more permanent fixture in the summer.”",
      "On Baleba and Wharton, Bailey added: “And United are fully aware of the prices we are talking about, they know Baleba, Wharton and the like are not £50million or £60million players, they realise they are twice that. Ineos are backing United and know the sort of finances need to compete at the top.”",
      "Brighton chairman Tony Bloom insisted that Man Utd’s pursuit of Baleba was not a saga as the Red Devils very quickly “went away” after learning the midfielder wasn’t available for sale.",
      "Bloom said: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga.There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn’t available this summer and they went away.",
      "“So we’ve had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim “would be vulnerable” if a UAE-based consortium push through a takeover of the club, according to a journalist.",
      "There was speculation ahead of the match that a heavy defeat could see Amorim facing the sack with the Portuguese head coach gaining just 37 points from 34 Premier League matches since replacing Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe came out last week and claimed he wants Amorim to remain in the position for three years to give him the best chance of making his mark.",
      "That is unlikely to happen if Amorim doesn’t improve and Daily Mail journalist Chris Wheeler reckons he’s even more likely to be out of work if a rumoured takeover by UAE-based consortium goes through.",
      "Wheeler said in a Q&A in the Daily Mail: “Ask any manager and they will tell you that new owners and good job prospects rarely go hand in hand. Erik ten Hag was on thin ice the moment Ratcliffe assumed the day-to-day running of the club, and eventually fell through it despite a late reprieve after winning the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "READ: World Cup turncoats include £50m Manchester United signing and iconic winner’s son",
      "“So Amorim would be vulnerable even if he was on a par with United’s expectations after bringing him in from Sporting Lisbon a year ago and spending heavily on new players to fit his system. A ‘haul’ of just 37 points from his first 34 Premier League games – not to mention no European football and a Carabao Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town – is well below par.",
      "“Ratcliffe and the hierarchy he has put in place at Old Trafford have invested heavily in Amorim, so it would be embarrassing in the extreme to pull the plug now. A new owner is unlikely to have any such reservations.”",
      "Man Utd spent over £200m on new signings over the summer transfer window with the Red Devils concentrating on improving their frontline.",
      "Many fans and former players reckon it was a mistake to not sign a midfielder but Wheeler insists Man Utd “won’t be short of a few quid” over the next couple of transfer windows as long as they comply with PSR.",
      "Wheeler added: “The latest financials released last month underlined the scale of United’s challenge: the club posted a record £666.5m revenue over the last year, but still made an overall loss of £33m – down 70.8 per cent on the previous year.",
      "“United do have money available, but they have to operate carefully within the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules. Ratcliffe has made investment in the first team his priority, which is why United spent another £236m on new signings this summer – roughly in keeping with previous years.",
      "“A central midfielder was the glaring omission among the five players brought in, which raised questions over the wisdom of signing two No 10s in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“Whether United need two central midfielders depends largely on the futures of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo, with Casemiro coming to the end of his contract and doubts over Manuel Ugarte’s performances. They will also look to strengthen elsewhere in the team.",
      "“United’s revenue streams will remain strong despite the absence of European football, and the losses are coming down. As long as they stay within PSR, United won’t be short of a few quid in the summer – or even in January – if needed.”",

      "It later emerged on Monday that a UAE-based consortium, who are ‘very serious’ about buying the club, held a meeting in London earlier this week with Man Utd officials.",
      "Former CBS Sports journalist Jacobs insists that the deal could be “advanced” but only “in terms of internally putting itself together”.",
      "Jacobs said on talkSPORT: “It’s not Saudi. I’m getting denials from sources that it’s Qatar and that Sheikh Jassim may return. But there is a group specifically from the UAE that are interested and are exploring whether or not they can put together a consortium and have actually approached some ex-Manchester United players not to invest, but to be ambassadors.",
      "“That’s where we’re at the moment. This group may be advanced in terms of internally putting itself together, but they haven’t placed a bid, nor have they even alerted the Glazers yet. We’ll have to wait and see how it develops.”",
      "The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell has a theory that the Glazers are trying to get some interest going in Man Utd before they attempt to sell in 2027.",
      "Speaking on the Talk of the Devils podcast, Whitwell said: “Some people will now say that it’s in the Glazers’ interest before February to get a new deal in place with somebody else because that creates competitive tension and they get a higher price for their shares.",
      "“But also after that point, why would anybody want to buy the club now, because there is this automatic minimum there, so why wouldn’t they just wait until February 2027?",
      "“So maybe all this kind of chatter, is it because the Glazers want to – I don’t know, I’m theorizing here – but there’s a world where they could want to get some interest around it to get something going before that deadline.",
      "“After that, they might not be able to get the same kind of price. It’s a fascinating dynamic.”",
      "Journalist Andy Mitten also had his say on the takeover rumours, he said: “I don’t have any evidence of the investment. And I’m a little bit sceptical because I’ve seen people before say stuff that doesn’t end up being true, and then they get caught out and say, ‘Whoa, I was only sort of saying what I’ve heard.’ And they realise that there’s a level of scrutiny to this, that they’ve got to back up what they’ve said.”",
      "Host of the podcast, Ian Irving, added: “You think he (Turki Alsheikh) would be aware of that, though, considering his position and considering his social media following. He knows what impact that tweet is going to make.”",
      "Mitten replied: “I would have thought Rio Ferdinand would have been aware when he said Manchester United are going to be taken over by Qatar, which was completely baseless. Sometimes people make mistakes.”",
      "Before he continued: “From Manchester United’s perspective, they’ve got absolutely no idea of this, but the Glazers are hardly going to be ringing around journalists to say what it is.”",

Usually a manager’s job would be to protect players but when he himself is facing daily questions about his tenure, it is understandable that the players get caught in the crossfire.",

      "That environment is hardly conducive to success and there is a growing list of players who leave and begin playing like they aren’t carrying an Indiana Jones-style boulder on their back. Scott McTominay has become a deity in Naples. Antony looked a lot more like an £86million footballer at Betis than he did at United. Marcus Rashford seems to have remembered that football can be quite fun and not a massive burden now that he is in Barcelona. Even Rasmus Hojlund looks like a striker.",
      "Joining United has become one of the smarter career moves if only for the immediate boost you get on exit and it is easy to see a scenario where Cunha becomes another example,",
      "The Brazilian is undoubtedly talented and undeniably kept Wolves in the Premier League last season, but he has been signed to a system where he has no obvious place.",
      "At Wolves, the team was built around him, allowing him to line up on the team sheet as a centre-forward but not really play like one. In Amorim’s 3-4-2-1, there is no obvious space to do that.",
      "The Portuguese boss is not the first manager to fall in love with Mason Mount, which means his starting spot is pretty much locked down. Benjamin Sesko has scored twice since he started leading the line and Bryan Mbeumo is more suited to a wide-right role than Cunha.",
      "Cunha may well be a £62.5million signing that has no obvious place in the team. The player himself commented on this, bringing up his youth spell as a midfielder before 4-3-3 took over the game and he suddenly had to become a number nine.",
      "“I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number 9 shirt,” Cunha said.",
      "“I played my entire base as a midfielder, and when I became a professional, I encountered the world of 4-3-3. You have to adapt: either play centre-forward, winger, or ‘eight’.",
      "“They eliminated the midfielder position, and you have to adapt.",
      "“But I see it positively, as it has given me experience, many more positions, and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team.",
      "“Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.”",
      "While it’s true that versatility is a positive trait, it can also make it hard to nail down a position. Amorim began the season with Cunha as the centre forward but pulled him deeper after the signing of Sesko, and there is every chance that for United’s next game away at Liverpool, Cunha is again on the bench as he was for the win over Sunderland.",
      "Cunha started up front for Brazil in the first game of this international break and although he did not score, he did provide an assist. After his time with Brazil is over, he heads back to the doom and gloom of United and if it feels like a long time after two months, just imagine how long it will feel come the end of a most likely underwhelming season.",

      "🔴 Amorim's system could trouble Liverpool💪 Merino showing his value to Arsenal🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Ruben Amorim's system continues to dominate the discourse around Manchester United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw but it might just work in his side's favour when they face Liverpool on Super Sunday.",
      "Arne Slot's side, on an uncharacteristic run of three consecutive defeats, tend to find playing against back threes more difficult.",
      "The issue has been most apparent against Crystal Palace, one of few other Premier League sides who habitually deploy a back three. Liverpool are winless in three games against them if you throw in the penalty-shootout defeat in the Community Shield in August.",
      "Even the five Premier League games Liverpool have won against back threes since the start of last season, away at Crystal Palace, Southampton and Burnley and at home against Wolves and West Ham, have been nervy affairs settled by one-goal margins.",
      "Manchester United have of course caused problems for Slot's side too, securing a 2-2 draw on their last visit to Anfield in January, when they used their wing-backs to create overloads in wide areas in a performance described by Gary Neville as their best under Amorim.",
      "They will return to Anfield as underdogs on Sunday. Amazingly, Manchester United are yet to win back-to-back Premier League games under Amorim. But their last visit offers a blueprint to follow and they typically fare better in these kinds of assignments.",
      "In fact, in Premier League games in which they have had less possession than their opponent under Amorim, Manchester United's win rate is nearly twice as high as when they have had more, while their loss rate drops from 64 per cent to 25 per cent.",
      "The numbers are of course influenced to some extent by game-state. A team holding a lead is more likely to relinquish possession, just as a team trailing is more likely to have more of it as they try to open their opponent up and find a way back into the game.",
      "But the trend is not unique to Manchester United.",
      "Since the start of last season, Premier League sides using back threes have had less possession, on average, in games they have won and drawn compared to the games they have lost.",
      "It supports the argument that a back three is a reactive system, and at its most effective, at least in most cases, when used as a means to absorb pressure and spring forward quickly using transitions.",
      "Whether it is the right approach for a club of Manchester United's stature in the long-term is debateable. On Sunday against Liverpool, though, it probably offers their best hope of getting a result.",
      "The 29-year-old made it six goals in four appearances for Spain with his double against Bulgaria on Tuesday. Only Erling Haaland and Memphis Depay have scored more times in European World Cup qualifying. Merino's tally is equal to Harry Kane's.",
      "His eye for goal is not new. Merino has scored 16 times in 35 games for club and country since his late double in Arsenal's 2-0 win over Leicester in February, when he was pressed into the role of striker for the first time following an injury to Kai Havertz.",
      "The positional change proved transformative for Merino, who had never previously played up front. But his goals for Spain have come from midfield and so did his latest for Arsenal, the headed equaliser in the late victory over Newcastle at St James' Park.",
      "Merino excels at timing his runs into the box. \"He can smell danger,\" said Mikel Arteta in February. But his extraordinary aerial threat, showcased again with his headed double against Bulgaria, is not his only weapon when it comes to finishing scoring chances.",
      "Spain's Luis de la Fuente uses the same term. \"He is so complete, we are lucky to have him,\" he said. Merino's value to Arteta is similarly clear. But it is fair to say perceptions externally are not universally positive. He continues to be mischaracterised as a defensive player, his selection seen by some as a symbol of conservatism.",
      "Merino is not a fleet-footed creator in the mould of Eberechi Eze or Martin Odegaard, that is true. But he would not be starting every game for Spain if he lacked technical ability and his off-the-ball qualities are invaluable in pressing opponents high up the pitch.",
      "Goals are of course the most important currency of all and, in Merino's case, it is worth noting context as well as volume.",
      "He counts Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle, Real Madrid, France and Netherlands among the teams he has scored against over the last eight months. His eight Premier League goals have won Arsenal twice as many points as any other player's.",
      "It all adds up to make him vitally important to both club and country, despite fierce competition for places on both fronts. It would be no surprise to see him show his value again at Craven Cottage.",
      "Donyell Malen was Aston Villa's match-winner as his double clinched a 2-1 victory over Burnley in their last game and he added another goal for Netherlands during the international break.",
      "He has had to be patient since arriving at Villa from Borussia Dortmund in January but looks ready to belatedly make his mark in the Premier League with Spurs next up on Sunday.",
      "Last week's column examined Mohamed Salah's dip for Liverpool and why he's missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. There was also a look at Arsenal's formidable defensive numbers this season and Graham Potter's unceremonious end at West Ham.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Thursday 16 October 2025 14:57, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and sees value in backing Man Utd at Liverpool.",
      "Ange Postecoglou's arrival at Nottingham Forest came with big promises of high tempo, pressing and attacking football but so far what we've seen is a defence creaking under the pressure of playing Postecoglou's style. Forest are leaking goals at a rate of 2.1 per 90 minutes since the Aussie took charge.",
      "So my eyes are drawn to the anytime goalscorer market for Chelsea. Enter Alejandro Garnacho at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Chelsea under Enzo Maresca are looking to use wide players more than Garnacho was utilised at Manchester United - here, he can stretch defences and find more one-vs-one opportunities. Garnacho has already shown glimpses in his early appearances that he could be the next player to flourish away from the Old Trafford spotlight.",
      "Given the defensive issues at Forest and Garnacho's knack for getting in the right place at the right time, he looks great value to score with Sky Bet in a game that should sail past the over 2.5 goals line.",
      "Being ahead of a curve is the name of the game when trying to consistently beat the market. And betting against Brighton before it becomes trendy to do so is very much a tactic on my radar.",
      "Yes, they are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are. Brighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.5 expected goals per game over the last 14 Premier League matches - that's the worst per-90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.",
      "Their pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 19 Premier League games, too.",
      "The fact we can get a team as reliable and dangerous as Newcastle at 10/11 on the draw no bet makes this best-bet-of-the-weekend material.",
      "Every so often in the Premier League, a fixture becomes more than just three points. There's six points on offer here.",
      "Both clubs know a win shifts momentum, belief and in many cases season trajectories. And these 'six-pointers' very often produce open, high-intensity, attacking football - something which isn't portrayed by the market.",
      "The last 33 'six pointers' in the Premier League - a subjective definition of the fixture - has seen an average of 2.8 goals scored. When assessing the odds, the 6/5 being dangled by Sky Bet on over 2.5 goals being scored is hard to resist.",
      "Both sides have quietly made a habit of turning this fixture into a cure for insomnia. The last nine meetings between the two have all landed for under 2.5 goals backers with just a measly total of 10 goals scored in those nine meetings.",
      "And Palace are fast becoming a friend of the under-goals backer with Oliver Glasner building such a watertight defensive unit. Across their last 17 games in all competitions the average match goals sits at just 1.85 per 90.",
      "The market hasn't quite caught up with just how consistently dull this fixture has been. Under 2.5 goals should be shorter than it is at 10/11 with Sky Bet and represents the best angle into what looks set to be a tight, cagey contest.",
      "Jake O'Brien vs Jeremy Doku is shaping up to be a mismatch and one punters should be looking to profit from.",
      "If O'Brien emerges from this duel with clean shorts, his shoes on the right feet and a clean sheet, I'll tip my betting cap to him. But I'd rather side with reality and back him to get carded at 7/2 with Sky Bet, a price that screams value.",
      "Doku isn't just a livewire, he's a walking yellow card generator. The Belgian winger has been fouled 2.43 times per 90 in the Premier League this season and he is the reason why opposition right-backs and right centre-backs have picked up a card in six of City's seven games he's featured in.",
      "The numbers and the eye test both agree: Wolves are far better than their results suggest.",
      "There's a case to be made that Vitor Pereria's team have far more in the tank than the league table currently shows.",
      "Wolves have taken just two points from seven games but the expected points, based on their underlying metrics provided by Opta, show they should have seven points in the bag.",
      "That type of gulf usually evens itself out across a season and it is something to profit from.",
      "The chances are being created in attack and restricted to a good level in defence, so it's just the finishing touch of the Wolves strikers and very efficient finishing of opposition strikers that has been costing them in what is a fine-margin sport. When a little bit of regression to the mean kicks in, results will follow.",
      "Starting here, where they are 21/10 with Sky Bet for the away win.",
      "Arsenal have only conceded three goals in 10 games in all competitions - they are shipping the fewest goals per game of any team in Europe's major leagues. We shouldn't be surprised though as Mikel Arteta has been overseeing what has been one of the best defensive teams we've ever seen in the Premier League for three seasons now.",
      "That's why backing them to win matches along with the under 3.5 goals angle thrown into the mix at a juicier price is the smart way to boost Arsenal's outright win price here from 1/2 to 6/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "They dominate territory, limit chaos and once they get their noses in front, they manage games like a team with title-winning maturity. Across their last 18 wins in all competitions, 16 have landed for punters who have added the under 3.5 goal line into the equation. It should land again.",
      "The international break can be a problem for some managers - not Unai Emery.",
      "Aston Villa are unbeaten in the last 10 Premier League games after an international break, winning eight. Whatever Emery does in this fiddly time for managers is working wonders.",
      "Meanwhile, Spurs' encouraging start to life under Thomas Frank has been somewhat undermined by a pair of disappointing results in their last two Premier League home games after being battered by Bournemouth and only drawing with Wolves courtesy of a last-minute equaliser. It means Spurs have won just three of their 17 Premier League home games since November last year.",
      "Villa are an obvious play on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "The markets haven't quite woken up to just how sharp Amad Diallo has looked recently, nor how well he's linking up with Bryan Mbeumo, who's become his perfect foil in United's new-look attack.",
      "There's a real chemistry brewing here.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo might not have been the attacking duo many expected to define this United side, but their movement and understanding has been electric and could just be the catalyst for Ruben Amorim.",
      "At 9/2 to score with Sky Bet, the value's there on Amad.",
      "And against a Liverpool side that's been anything but watertight down their left flank, this looks the perfect storm for the United hotshot to make a big statement.",
      "Liverpool will, as always, dominate territory and possession but that only increases the space Amad can exploit on the counter. Pair that with his on-field connection with Mbeumo and United have the tools to create more problems for Liverpool, who do look short at 4/7 with Sky Bet for maximum points.",
      "West Ham are in 'season-defining' territory already.",
      "The Hammers are winless in eight home Premier League games, a run that played a huge part in Graham Potter losing his job. It's their longest winless run since moving to the London Stadium and, in its current miserable guise, the place feels a world away from Upton Park.",
      "When you're knee-deep in a relegation scrap, you don't need talk of 'underlying numbers' - you need street-fighting survival football. Nuno Espirito Santo brings exactly that.",
      "Call it what you want - reactive, pragmatic and at times boring - but it's effective when backs are against the wall. West Ham need points and Nuno will bag them plenty based on his body of work. The home win looks the call here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo is on track to reach an unprecedented scoring milestone but when he could hit his 1,000th goal? Between the Lines returns for a bonus edition to break down the numbers.",
      "Ronaldo set yet another scoring record when he became the outright top scorer in World Cup qualifying history with his double in Portugal's 2-2 draw against Hungary on Tuesday night.",
      "The goals put him on 41 from 51 World Cup qualifying games, moving him clear of the previous record-holder, former Guatemala striker Carlos Ruiz on 39, with Lionel Messi third in the list on 36.",
      "Ronaldo has now scored a record 143 goals in 225 games for his country in addition to 805 in 1,068 games at club level, putting him on a staggering combined total of 948 career goals.",
      "Ronaldo turned 40 in February but he continues to rack up impressive numbers at club level as well as internationally, albeit against weaker opposition in Saudi Arabia, where he has scored 104 goals in 117 appearances across four seasons with Al-Nassr.",
      "With 32 goals already for club and country in 2025, he is maintaining a remarkably consistent level of productivity in front of goal. Ronaldo has averaged more than 50 goals per calendar year since 2010.",
      "His highest scoring year came in 2013, when he smashed 69 goals and won the Ballon d'Or. Amazingly, his total has only dipped below 39 goals once in a calendar year in the last decade and a half.",
      "It seems there's a lot more to come from him too.",
      "With Portugal set to qualify for next summer's World Cup, and with two years to go on his Al-Nassr contract, Ronaldo is projected to become the first player in recorded history to reach the 1,000-goal mark in October 2026 based on his current scoring rate.",
      "Ronaldo's opening goal against Hungary was his 181st with his weaker left foot. His second was his 608th with his right.",
      "His double demonstrated his all-round threat attacking threat and Ronaldo is of course similarly dangerous aerially, with 157 of his goals, roughly 17 per cent, having come with his head.",
      "His goals have been split relatively evenly between home and away and neutral venues. His tally includes 178 penalties but he has also scored 135 times from outside the box, including 64 direct free-kicks.",
      "By competition, the biggest share of his goals has come in LaLiga, where he scored 311 times across nine seasons with Real Madrid.",
      "He remains the top scorer in Champions League history with 140 goals and also found the net 103 times across two spells in the Premier League with Manchester United.",
      "His favourite opponents, in terms of which sides he has scored the most goals against, are all based in Spain, with Sevilla, in particular, grateful to have seen the back of him.",
      "Ronaldo smashed 27 goals in just 18 appearances against the Andalucian side, with Real Madrid's bitter rivals Atletico and Barcelona also featuring high up in the list.",
      "Tottenham rank as his favourite English opponent, with Ronaldo having scored 14 times in 20 games against them, while Luxembourg are his favourite opponent internationally.",
      "On 948 and counting, Ronaldo's quest for 1,000 goals continues.",
      "On the subject of goalscoring, Monday's Between the Lines looked at England's reliance on Harry Kane and the worrying lack of other options. Where are all the English No 9s?",

      "Which top performers are flying under the radar in the Premier League so far this season? We pick an Unsung Heroes XI...",
      "Henderson has been an integral part of Crystal Palace's recent club-record unbeaten run. The 28-year-old shot stopper started 18 of Palace's 19 unbeaten games between April and October and this season has kept six clean sheets in 11 appearances - no other Premier League goalkeeper has kept more clean sheets in all competitions this season.",
      "Henderson also boasts the best figures so far in the Premier League this season for xG prevented - he has conceded five Premier League goals this season despite being expected to have conceded almost eight goals.",
      "Signed permanently from Fiorentina this summer for £14m, Kayode has been one of Brentford's best attacking outlets this season. The 21-year-old Italian has started all of the Bees' seven Premier League games - either at right-back or right wing-back - and currently tops the charts for most successful dribbles of all Premier League defenders this season.",
      "He also ranks third of all defenders in the top flight this season for most passes played into the box (38) and fifth for most sprints (131).",
      "Senesi has been one of Bournemouth's key performers this season. He has been part of a well-marshalled defence which has helped steer his side to a club-record start to the season, with the Cherries winning 14 points from their opening seven Premier League games. The 28-year-old Argentine has started all of these games.",
      "His tenacity this season brings up a statistic that no other player in the division has made more clearances and interceptions combined than Senesi.",
      "Tarkowski has been very much Mr Reliable at the back in recent seasons for Everton. The 32-year-old has been ever-present for the Toffees in the Premier League this term and has helped them up into eighth position in the table - this time last season they were lying 16th.",
      "Tarkowski's strength is winning the ball for his team - of all Premier League defenders this season, only Patrick Dorgu has won more duels than the Englishman and only Virgil van Dijk has won more aerial duels.",
      "Mitchell has been another one of Palace's reliable constants in recent seasons with the 26-year-old having started 66 of Palace's last 67 Premier League games. It could be argued that he has been unlucky not to have added to his two England caps - the last of which came in 2022 - especially when you see that no player has won more tackles than him in the Premier League this season.",
      "He has also been productive offensively, whipping in seven successful open play crosses, the only defender with more this season is Wolves' Hugo Bueno.",
      "It seems the £29m paid by Everton for Dewsbury-Hall could be a shrewd piece of business. The 27-year-old started Everton's opening six Premier League games this season which was his best run of top-flight starts for two-and-a-half years. He started only two Premier League games for Chelsea in all of last season.",
      "When comparing his time so far at Everton to his previous four Premier League seasons for Leicester and Chelsea, we can see his passing accuracy has improved and he is creating more chances. His four chances created in the 2-0 win vs Brighton in August was the most he had made in a Premier League match since a game for Leicester in February 2023.",
      "Stach arrived from Hoffenheim for £17.4m this summer and the 26-year-old German hasn't looked back since. The 6ft 4in midfielder has started all seven of Leeds' Premier League games so far and has already recorded a goal and an assist - both coming in the 3-1 win at Wolves last month.",
      "His all-action game is backed up by the fact that only Elliot Anderson has covered more ground in the Premier League than Stach this season and only Bruno Fernandes and Jack Grealish have created more chances than the German.",
      "Ndiaye has been another one of Everton's bright sparks this season, the 25-year-old is the club's top scorer this season with three Premier League goals and, going further back, has nine goals in his last 18 league starts since January.",
      "The Senegalese attacker boasts a 50 per cent shot conversion rate this season, scoring from half of his six shots taken. No Everton player has shown more desire to win the ball back or to take a player on as the stats suggest.",
      "Minteh has arguably been Brighton's best player this season, the 21-year-old Gambian - signed from Newcastle for £30m in the summer of 2024 - has been an ever-present in the league and has recorded either a goal or an assist in three of Brighton's last four Premier League games.",
      "He currently ranks in the top two of all Premier League players this season for sprints (only Adrien Truffert more), touches in the opposition box (currently top with Jack Grealish) and successful take-ons (only Mohammed Kudus more).",
      "Anthony has made a blistering start to the season, having been involved in five of Burnley's seven Premier League goals scored so far. With four goals and an assist, only Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo have scored more goals this term. He has, in fact, scored four goals in his last six Premier League appearances, having scored just three in his previous 34.",
      "The 25-year-old - signed for just £8m from Bournemouth this summer - has outperformed his xG by +1.8 this season which is the fourth best record in the Premier League. Another standout stat is that the only Englishman to have scored more league goals than Anthony in Europe's major Leagues this season is Harry Kane.",
      "Brentford's No 9 has made an impressive start to the season having scored five goals in his eight appearances, including four Premier League goals - his first in the competition. Last season his campaign was disrupted with two knee injuries which is why the 24-year-old Brazilian made only one Premier League start for the Bees last term.",
      "Two of his four Premier League goals came inside the first 20 minutes in the 3-1 win vs Man Utd in late September - only Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney have scored more goals across Brentford's first six games of a Premier League season.",

      "Ultimately, this is a United side that is suffering from scars from a mentally tough previous season - finishing 15th as well as losing a European final. They have lost a lot of games as well, 21 of Ruben Amorim's 50 in charge.",
      "But despite disappointing losses and performances to the likes of Grimsby and Brentford, there is still a feeling of optimism inside the walls of Carrington.",
      "United feel, despite some of the poor results, that their data and metrics show that this side are improving. The eye test suggests that they are as well, looking at the performance against Arsenal, and first halves against Burnley and Sunderland.",

      "They look like they have a potential emerging No 1 in Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko had by far his best game for United so far, his pressing and ability to bring others into play were particularly impressive.",

      "The £200m new look front line of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha all look back to match fitness, as well as Mount, who scored a lovely goal against Sunderland before the break.",
      "If United can rescue a positive season from a rollercoaster start, there is room for optimism next summer in what could be an intriguing transfer window for United.",
      "With big contracts set to expire, there will have to be decisions made on the likes of Harry Maguire and Casemiro.",
      "There is a realistic prospect that the Brazilian's contract won't be renewed next summer and his three-year stay at United could come to an end.",
      "If that does happen, the freed-up space on the wage bill would represent an opportunity for United to strengthen in that area of the pitch.",
      "A midfielder remains a key area for United to strengthen next summer and although they have been long-term admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba, he is just one of a number of players they have looked at in the position.",
      "After a £50m redevelopment of the men's first-team training facility completed in the summer, United's next aim at Carrington is to upgrade their academy facilities.",

      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",

      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",
