      "Barcelona are considering sending Marcus Rashford back to Manchester United after a difficult start to his loan spell, according to a bombshell report from Spain.",
      "Rashford joined the Catalan giants at the end of July, ending his recent difficulties at Old Trafford after being frozen out of the first team by manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The winger has featured in all three of Barcelona's first three La Liga games but is yet to impress for the team after playing a total of 95 minutes. He started Barcelona's 3-2 win at Levante last month but was hooked at half time, with the hosts leading 2-0 at the time.",
      "He was also brought on as a sub during the season opening win at Mallorca and the 1-1 draw against Rayo Vallecano, but fans and pundits are yet to be convinced he will be a valuable member of the squad.",
      "And there are reportedly concerns about Rashford in the boardroom too, according to Spanish outlet El Nacional, who says the club expected better displays from the England international at this point.",
      "It adds that bosses have founded his performances 'disappointing' and that they expect an improvement soon, but their patience won't be infinite.",
      "The report also suggests that president Joan Laporta and sporting director Deco were never convinced over Rashford's signing - having preferred Nico Williams or Luis Diaz.",
      "Hansi Flick was the one who pushed for the move, feeling he could help Rashford recapture the form that turned him into a superstar at Old Trafford. Speaking after the opening game of the season, Flick said he was confident that Rashford would have a strong impact with the Spanish champions.",
      "\"He gives us more possibilities,\" he said last month. \"I know he's more comfortable playing as a winger, but with his strengths, he contributes a lot to our play. I'm confident we'll see a great Marcus Rashford this season.\"",
      "The Spanish side would have to pay a fee of around £4.3m if they decided to send Rashford back early. Chelsea had to pay a similar penalty fee of £5m to United after refusing to take up their obligation to sign Jadon Sancho at the end of last season.",
      "The news continues Rashford's turbulent year after initially falling out with manager Amorim, who took issue with the player's attitude in training.",
      "Speaking brutally about Rashford at the start of the year, the coach said he would rather play his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital than someone who \"doesn't give the maximum\".",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Chelsea midfielder Cole Palmer has sent a cryptic message to Kobbie Mainoo after his request to leave Manchester United on loan was denied. Frustrated by his lack of opportunities, Mainoo, 20, reportedly asked to leave Old Trafford on a temporary basis in the closing days of the summer transfer window.",
      "After United's 1-1 draw away to Fulham, which marked the second consecutive Premier League game where Mainoo was an unused substitute, Amorim said the midfielder is directly competing with Bruno Fernandes for a place in the starting XI. Things got worse for the young Englishman when he started in United's humiliating League Cup second round exit to Grimsby Town.",
      "Chelsea have previously been linked with him, but the Blues made no approach this summer. The midfielder recently uploaded a picture of himself carrying out his own training sessions during the international break, as well as a cryptic picture of the scene from hit movie Whiplash, where main character Andrew punched a hole in his drum kit, suggesting he is growing restless at his current situation.",
      "Palmer, who is also absent from England's squad due to a groin injury he picked up before Chelsea's 5-1 away victory over West Ham United, then responded with his own suggestive message in the comment section of Mainoo's post. The ex-Manchester City midfielder wrote: \"3 my boy\" along with a love heart emoji.",
      "Some interpreted this to mean Mainoo should look for an exit from Old Trafford, although what Palmer ultimately meant remains the subject of conjecture. Last summer, Mainoo started all but two of England's matches to the Euro 2024 final, including the final itself.",
      "Despite the likes of Jude Bellingham, Adam Wharton, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden either being ruled out through injury or not selected, Tuchel chose not to call-up Mainoo.",
      "Similarly to his challenge at Old Trafford, the young midfielder has a difficult task ahead of him when it comes to forcing his way into Tuchel's plans.",
      "The intense, personal training sessions in the gym and on the training field could earn him a start in United's huge clash against Manchester City after the break. With Amorim insistent on deploying his 3-4-3 formation, Mainoo has to either displace Fernandes or Casemiro, a player the United boss has relied upon since his move to Old Trafford.",
      "It's a tall order for the United academy star, as Fernandes is United's captain and, arguably, the club's best player of the last five years, while Casemiro is a specialised, deep-holding midfielder.",
      "Explaining why Mainoo did not get on against Fulham, Amorim said: \"Mainoo is fighting for his position with Bruno. I changed two midfielders.",
      "\"I left Mason Mount there because we wanted to score a goal and when I changed, I felt the team needed one holding midfielder. So he needs to fight for his position. At the moment he is fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "In the Red Devils' narrow 3-2 home victory over Burnley, Amorim opted to deploy Mainoo ahead of Ugarte, suggesting the youngster has moved one step close to the United boss' thoughts. He boasts 10 international caps for England, having made his debut in the 1-0 home loss to Brazil in March 2024.",

      "Grimsby Town boss David Artell insists nobody can diminish his players' display following their shock Carabao Cup triumph over Manchester United. The Mariners have been embroiled in controversy this past week after the EFL slapped Town with a penalty for fielding an ineligible player in their second round win.",
      "United are not believed to be mounting an appeal against the League Two outfit's sanction. The penalty saw Grimsby hit with a £20,000 fine for their administrative blunder.",
      "It's understood the Mariners reported the breach themselves and the EFL announced their verdict. That's despite previous FA Cup precedent seeing clubs ejected from the tournament.",
      "\"The club has made a statement, and I refer them to the statement,\" said Artell. \"From my point of view as head coach, no one can take away that performance. Nobody can.",
      "\"We were the better team for 70 minutes or for 75 minutes. We should have been 3-0 regardless of everything else that has gone off since, and I am extremely proud of the performance of the players, all of the players. I thought we deserved to win the game.",
      "\"What happens surrounding that isn't in my domain [to say] but, like I say, nobody can take away the performance of the players and the manner of the victory, certainly not in my eyes anyway. What happened was unfortunate, we owned up, made a statement, let everyone know and we move on.\"",
      "Grimsby were found to be in breach of the laws after Clarke Oduor came on against the Red Devils. Oduor joined the Mariners on loan from Bradford City one day prior to the cup fixture.",
      "However, it later came to light their loanee's deal had gone through 119 seconds after the deadline. And as such, he was not eligible to feature for the club.",
      "Of their fine, £10,000 must be paid before a predetermined deadline, while the other £10,000 is suspended until the end of the season. Liverpool, Accrington Stanley and Sunderland are the other three clubs who have in the past been fined for similar League Cup infractions.",
      "Grimsby's reward for advancing past United is a third-round fixture against Championship side Sheffield Wednesday. This will mark the first time since 2019 that the former has featured in the third round of the tournament.",
      "Despite the triumph over United, Grimsby have failed to maintain their momentum and lost their last two fixture. Artell's side are looking to bounce back from their most recent disappointment, a 1-0 defeat to Bristol Rovers, as they prepare to take on MK Dons on Saturday.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho's new Chelsea team-mate Wesley Fofana has dropped a hint about what to expect in west London. Garnacho, 21, joined the Blues from Manchester United on transfer deadline day in a deal worth £40million.",
      "The South American has been getting up to speed with Enzo Maresca's side in his first training sessions with the club. In a video uploaded to social media, Garnacho could be seen being worked hard in his first training session.",
      "This may not be too surprising as the winger spent the entire pre-season training on his own at the Red Devils, after being sent out to United's so-called 'Bomb Squad' of players who were banished from the first team. There was no sympathy for Garnacho in west London, as could be seen in Fofana's cutting response to him.",
      "During his first training session, Garnacho could be seen struggling for breath as he was put through his paces. The start of the clip shows him sitting down on the floor with his feet stretched out as a Chelsea coach says: \"Take a stretch, have a breather, take your time!\"",
      "The next clip showed the United academy graduate, before he went on to shake his head, saying: \"I can't move my legs now man. That sprint in the last one.\"",
      "Watching his new team-mate struggle for breath, Fofana, who has had more than his fair share of injury problems at Stamford Bridge, said: \"Welcome to Chelsea Football Club, eh.\"",
      "The Frenchman's short, but serious message, highlighted to Garnacho he will need to work extremely hard, every day in training, if he is going to thrive in west London. He faces serious competition for places with the Blues, as he will be up against £52m summer signing Jamie Gittens, the dynamic Pedro Neto and Brazilian superstar Estevao Willian.",
      "With Cole Palmer also primarily starring as a No. 10 and centre-forwards Liam Delap and Joao Pedro impressing while on the pitch with each other, Garnacho may also find himself in competition with the latter. He will have the international break to get up to speed in the capital, as Argentina chose not to call him up for their clashes against Venezuela and Ecuador.",
      "He arrives at a bustling Stamford Bridge, which has seen the Blues start the Premier League campaign in positive fashion. A nervous 0-0 draw was followed by a 5-1 away demolition of West Ham, before the Blues edged their way past local rivals Fulham at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The forward could make his debut when Chelsea travel to Brentford in their first match after the international break. Garnacho was also included in Chelsea's squad for the Champions League, which could see him face off against Bayern Munich in their first Champions League clash since the 2022-23 campaign.",
      "He will then be champing at the bit for the Blues' next Premier League clash which will be a first return to Old Trafford and a reunion with United boss Ruben Amorim.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Martin Drury is reportedly leaving Brentford just two months after being appointed.",
      "Drury became a part of Keith Andrews’ coaching staff with the Bees this summer as the club tried to rebuild. Brentford lost long-term manager Thomas Frank to Tottenham and Andrews stepped up to take his first head coaching role.",
      "Andrews brought in Drury as his assistant first-team coach, but the relationship has not lasted long at all. BBC Sport reports that he is leaving the club just three Premier League games into the new season, with no explanation yet given.",
      "Drury has previously worked at United, West Brom, Bradford and Valencia before linking up with Brentford in July. After being appointed, he posted on X: “Delighted to be joining such a fantastic football club. Very much looking forward to working with all the staff and this exciting group of players.”",
      "Before joining Brentford, Drury had worked as an assistant to Carlos Corberan at La Liga side Valencia. “With great sadness, I am leaving Valencia,” he wrote on July 5. “The city, the club, and the incredible people with whom I have grown up will always be in my heart.",
      "“Thank you very much to the players and the staff; I have enjoyed every day with you all. I will be a Valencianista forever and I hope to be able to return someday.”",
      "Drury began his coaching career at Bradford, where he worked his way up to become head of coaching at the Bantams’ academy. He worked across a variety of the club’s academy sides before that, spending six years with Braford in total.",
      "Drury moved to Manchester United, where he coached the under-15s side for two years. But it was his relationship with Corberan that helped him make the step up into senior first-team football, first as his assistant at West Brom.",
      "He decided to leave Corberan and his staff at Valencia to work alongside Andrews in the Premier League. “Martin has been on a long journey and had lots of different experiences,” the Irishman said upon his arrival in west London.",
      "The departure of Frank to Tottenham left a void at Brentford, who filled it by promoting Andrews from set piece coach to head coach. The club also lost star players Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United and Yoane Wissa to Newcastle in the summer transfer window.",
      "They have started the campaign with defeats against Nottingham Forest and Sunderland and a win over Aston Villa. Brentford also beat Bournemouth 2-0 in the Carabao Cup.",

      "He was expected to play in a higher division this season after gaining experience in League Two last term but has remained at Carrington after the summer transfer window closed.",
      "According to the Manchester Evenings News, a loan move was the \"most logical option\" for Bennett but now it wouldn't be a surprise if he started training with the first team.",
      "It adds that he has \"outgrown academy football\" and could now be ready for the next step after a staff member reportedly said: \"Rhys has his sights set high.\"",
      "That quote could be pointed towards breaking into Amorim's group this season, the report says, as he looks to make his Red Devils debut this season, having previously trained with the first team during pre-season training camps.",
      "The Portuguese boss is known for bringing youngsters into his first team after doing so with the likes of Toby Collyer, Tyler Fredricson, Amad, Chido Obi and Harry Amass.",
      "Despite an influx on new signings arriving this summer, Amorim still named Fredricson on the bench against Arsenal and Fulham, which should give Bennett confidence that he can break through.",
      "Fredricson was given an opportunity to start in United's shock Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town last month but was hooked at half time and Bennett could sense an opportunity to replace him in Amorim's thinking, the report goes on.",
      "He played 38 times in all competitions for Fleetwood last season, scoring once, as the team finished in 14th place.",
      "There is real hope for Bennett after he captained a Manchester United Under-18s side that won the FA Youth Cup in 2022, the same team that featured breakthrough stars such as Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Dan Gore.",
      "Speaking last season, Bennett said the experience of battling for points in League Two taught him a lot and added a huge string to his bow in terms of playing under pressure.",
      "\"That has been massive for me and I like having that bit of added pressure to games and scenarios. When I was younger, I used to get carried away with thinking, ‘what's the next couple of years going to look like?’ You can lose focus on what's in front of you right now. It’s still in the back of my mind, but the focus is on the next game and getting the most out of this.\"",

      "Michael Owen has confidently stated that he was a better player than Wayne Rooney as a youngster. Owen was a teenage phenomenon at Liverpool, where he began scoring goals consistently at the age of 17.",
      "The England striker was prolific during his early years with the Reds, where he enjoyed by far the best years of his career. Owen netted 158 goals in 297 appearances for the club over eight years and won the Ballon d’Or as a 22-year-old in 2001.",
      "He carried that form over into international football, registering 40 goals in 89 appearances for England, a record that aids the comparison with Rooney. The Manchester United legend started out at Everton, where he burst onto the scene as an exciting and raw 16-year-old talent.",
      "Rooney earned a £25million move to United as an 18-year-old and went on to become the club’s all-time record goal scorer. He also comfortably passed Owen’s tally of 150 Premier League goals, reaching 208, and his number with England, notching 53 from 120 games.",
      "While both were undoubtedly great English strikers, the question of who was better at an early age has been raised on social media. Match of the Day posed the question on X: “Who was the better player at the age of 17, Michael Owen or Wayne Rooney?”",
      "Owen replied: “At 17 I scored 18 PL goals (winning the Golden Boot), Wazza scored 6. At 18 I again scored 18 goals (again winning the Golden Boot and coming 4th in The Ballon d’Or), Wazza scored 9. In our opening 7 seasons, Wazza didn’t outscore me once (117 goals v 80).",
      "“In which time I became the 2nd youngest Ballon d’Or winner ever. Injuries hindered me from then on while he sustained his level. Therefore, he’ll go down as a better player than me. But, at 17, please……”",
      "Owen went on to join Real Madrid in 2004, but only spent one year in Spain, with injuries later impacting his career, which took him to Newcastle, United and Stoke. He expanded on his assessment of his career on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast this week.",
      "“Was there another 18-year-old who was near me at 18? I was light years clear of anything in my age group – anything and probably anything around my age group in England,” he said.",
      "“I got into the Liverpool team and won the Golden Boot at 17. Forget all the achievements, there will never ever be a two-time Golden Boot winner as a 17-year-old and 18-year-old in the Premier League.”",
      "He added: “I sort of split my career into two: almost Liverpool and maybe Madrid, and then afterwards, because I just wasn't the same. Not that I didn't like it – I loved it at United. I love you (Rio) and the lads and whatever.",
      "“But I'm not me. I'm not me. You know what I was when I was 18, and you know what I was when I was 30. It's like, I was half-embarrassed. I'm coming out to these big stadiums, St James' Park, Old Trafford, with my name on my back.",
      "“It's like, can I not just change my name and just think of something, like call me something else? I don't want people to remember me like this. [I was] still good, still scoring, but I'm not what I was. It's killing me. But it's like, what can you do?”",

      "Pep Guardiola's warning over Jadon Sancho's mentality fell on deaf ears when Manchester United finally signed the winger back in 2021. Sancho broke through the Manchester City youth academy in 2017 under the Spanish boss.",
      "However, the 25-year-old failed to ever make a professional appearance for the Cityzens as he was shipped off to Borussia Dortmund in a deal worth around £8million. Asked in 2019 why Sancho was sold on rather than deployed by Guardiola, the 54-year-old said: \"I don't know.",
      "\"He didn't want to take this challenge [to fight his way into the first team], this opportunity to discover if he was able to. He decided to go there. So, it's perfect. It's going well and congratulations on what he is doing.",
      "\"He is doing an incredible performance. He did it incredibly well this season. What would have happened this season [at City]? I don't know. Again, with the players, it depends on them and what they do on the pitch.\"",
      "While Guardiola was quick to share his delight that Sancho was seeing success in the Bundesliga, his comments regarding the winger's will to fight for his place may have sounded alarm bells among many managers.",
      "Sancho's tally of 50 goals and 64 assists in 137 outings for Die Schwarzgelben between 2017 and 2021 was alluring enough to see United snap him up in a £73m move after a prolonged chase for his signature.",
      "But his tenure with the Red Devils has been far from smooth sailing in the years since. In his first two seasons at Old Trafford, Sancho managed just nine Premier League goals from 55 games, before he rejoined Dortmund after falling out with Erik ten Hag for his performances in training.",
      "Speaking following United's 3-1 loss to Arsenal back in September 2023 – a game in which Sancho did not travel for – Ten Hag said: \"Jadon, on his performances in training we did not select him. You have to reach a level every day at Manchester United and we can make choices in the front line. So for this game he was not selected.\"",
      "Sancho, meanwhile, was quick to fire back at his manager's comments, claiming that he was being used as a \"scapegoat.\" He wrote on social media: \"Please don't believe everything you read.",
      "\"I will not allow people saying things that is completely untrue, I have conducted myself in training very well this week. I believe there are other reasons for this matter which I won't go into, I've been a scapegoat for a long time which isn't fair!",
      "\"All I want to do is play football with a smile on my face and contribute to the team. I respect all decisions that are made by the coaching staff, I play with fantastic players and grateful to do so which I know every week is a challenge. I will continue to fight for this badge no matter what!\"",
      "The Englishman returned to Dortmund on a short-term loan in January 2024 before making his way back to the Red Devils in the summer, where he drew a line with Ten Hag on their disagreement. However, his tenure at Old Trafford didn't last long, joining Chelsea on a season-long loan with a £25m obligation to buy dependent on performances.",
      "Despite a somewhat fruitful campaign with Chelsea, the board ultimately opted not to exercise their mandatory purchase, instead paying a £5m penalty to see Sancho head back to the north west under new boss Ruben Amorim. But yet again, his tenure at Old Trafford was curtailed when the Portuguese tactician deemed him surplus to requirements with regards to his own plans.",
      "As a result, Sancho has secured a transfer deadline day move to Aston Villa on loan, where he will hope for a Premier League resurgence under Unai Emery. Given that Sancho's contract expires next summer, there is no obligation to buy attached to the deal. However, the United board also have the option to extend his contract by a year to prevent him walking away from the club as a free agent.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have had a rollercoaster start to the season. Following last year’s disappointment, fans were optimistic of better this campaign.",
      "And with the £200m spend in the summer transfer market, things looked positive. But United got off to a poor start in the Premier League having lost to Arsenal, while they were then held by Fulham.",
      "Things hit new lows as Amorim’s side were ousted from the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town. United finally got their first win of the campaign last time out as they squeezed past newly-promoted Burnley at Old Trafford.",
      "And while that has quietened the discontent at the club, it has not totally silenced it. For the time being though, United stars will be focusing on their international commitments.",
      "With that being said, take a look at all of the news coming out of the red half of Manchester:",
      "Despite Man United’s huge outlay this summer, it appears that Ruben Amorim was not totally satisfied. The Portuguese was keen on signing Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth and even went as far as holding face-to-face talks with the forward.",
      "Amorim is reported to have met Semenyo for dinner in London at the end of last season to judge the player's character. CEO Omar Berrada and transfer chief Jason Wilcox also held conversations with Bournemouth.",
      "But those efforts were in vain as Semenyo eventually penned a new contract with the Cherries.",
      "Chelsea might have a problem when it comes to Alejandro Garnacho. The Argentine completed a £40m move to Stamford Bridge from Man United in the final few days of the window.",
      "But he might have some catching up to do. Garnacho did not have a pre-season with United ahead of his switch and is already feeling the effects in West London.",

      "Emiliano Martinez's family have spoken out after the Aston Villa goalkeeper missed out on a deadline day transfer to Manchester United. Martinez, 33, was a target for the Red Devils, who wanted to sign a new goalkeeper before the summer transfer window closed on Monday.",
      "But United also had Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens on their radar, sparking an internal debate over which shot-stopper to pursue. Ultimately, Ruben Amorim's side pressed on to reach an agreement with Antwerp and signed 23-year-old Lammens for an initial £18.2million plus £3.5million in add-ons.",
      "That was despite Martinez agreeing personal terms with the Red Devils and waiting at Villa's training ground on Monday for a call which never came. It's also been reported that the former Arsenal star asked United defender and fellow Argentine Lisandro Martinez to vouch for him.",
      "But Martinez, who missed Villa's 3-0 loss at home to Crystal Palace in the lead-up to deadline day, remains in a part of Unai Emery's squad and is under contract until 2029. The length of his deal and his reputation as a World Cup winner is why Villa Park chiefs would've demanded much more than what United paid for Lammens.",
      "Martinez's brother, Alejandro, and his father, Alberto, have now discussed the 'dispute' which led to the failed move. \"I was told that Emi gave a lot as a professional and as a person, they love him, and you could see that on the pitch,\" Alejandro told DSports Radio.",
      "\"He is well-liked, and the directors didn't want to sell him because he is the key player in the team, and another team wanted him. It was a commercial dispute.",
      "\"These are decisions made by club officials. It didn't happen, but it's like everything else in business. The sporting side of things was left out of it, and everything is fine.\"",
      "His brother also brushed off suggestions that Martinez had fallen out with Emery. \"Emi never had an argument with Unai,\" Alejandro continued. \"It was all within the management's control, and the clubs couldn't agree.",
      "\"At Aston Villa, he's the Diego [Maradona] of Napoli. He gave a lot at Villa, like Kun [Aguero] did at [Manchester] City, like Leo [Messi] did at Barca. They're legendary players, and it's going to be hard to surpass what he did at Aston Villa.\"",
      "Dad Alberto added: \"This is a job, this is a factory, and factories have employees. He's just another employee, and the factory won't let him go if he's good. It's all business. Tomorrow it will happen, today it didn't happen.\"",
      "Martinez is now with the Argentina squad, playing keeping a clean sheet in Thursday's 3-0 victory over Venezuela. After travelling to Ecuador for their final World Cup qualifier, he'll return to Birmingham and prepare for next Villa's trip to Everton next Saturday.",

      "Patrick Dorgu has revealed that Rasmus Hojlund's late departure from Manchester United came as a shock. Hojlund, 22, completed a season-long loan move to Napoli on transfer deadline day, having spent two years with the Red Devils.",
      "United have banked a loan fee of £5.2m and the Danish striker will join for Napoli on a permanent basis for £38m next summer if the Serie A winners qualify for the Champions League. Hojlund became surplus to requirements at Old Trafford after United shelled out an initial £66.3m plus £7.3m in add-ons for fellow striker Benjamin Sesko, who immediately usurped him in the pecking order.",
      "Ruben Amorim said that he was 'really happy' with Hojlund in pre-season, and the 22-year-old stated during the Red Devils' tour of the USA that he wasn't planning on leaving. But when it became clear that Sesko was going to sign and Joshua Zirkzee would be his backup, the writing was on the wall for Hojlund.",
      "Initially, the former Atalanta hotshot wasn't convinced about the move to Napoli - even reportedly harbouring reservations when he landed in Italy for his medical last weekend. After signing on the dotted line, Hojlund returned home to Denmark for international duty.",
      "There, he met up with Dorgu. The United wing-back has spoken about Hojlund's departure, comparing it to that of Christian Eriksen after his contract with the Red Devils expired in June.",
      "\"That's how it is in football. You never know when it's your turn to move on,\" Dorgu told Danish outlet Ekstra Bladet. \"We knew it would happen to Christian, but it was perhaps a bigger shock that Rasmus had to move on.",
      "\"I talked to him a lot during the process and could sense which way it was going. Hopefully, we will now see each other every time on the national team.\"",
      "Dorgu, speaking ahead of Denmark's World Cup qualifier against Scotland on Friday, appreciated his compatriots' company when he joined United in January, but he's ready to be independent and lives alone in Manchester. \"I have been very happy to be team-mates with Christian and Rasmus,\" the left-sided defender continued.",
      "Will Rasmus Hojlund be a success at Napoli? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"It was a big plus for me that they were at the club when I joined. That way it was easier to become part of the squad. But it was in no way decisive for my choice of Manchester United. I was thinking much more about the coach’s plans and ideas with me when I had to make the decision.",
      "\"I travelled alone to Italy when I was 17. I am also alone in Manchester and I am fine that way. You become incredibly strong mentally when you travel alone so early, because you have to make a lot of decisions. I am sure that mental strength has also helped me on the pitch.\"",

    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "A list of five reasons why Erik ten Hag was ruthlessly sacked Bayer Leverkusen has emerged in the wake of his shock departure. Ten Hag, 55, only lasted three games at the German club, who needed to replace Xabi Alonso this summer after he made the move to Real Madrid.",
      "The ex-Manchester United boss had been appointed on May 26 and was axed on Monday - before the transfer window had even closed - meaning that his rudderless reign lasted just 98 days. Ten Hag, who leaves with a daily earning of £86,000 because of his £5.2million salary and severance package - was always facing a difficult task at the Bay Arena.",
      "Alonso's time in charge was a rousing success, winning the Bundesliga in 2024 to end Bayern Munich's stronghold on the German title - all while going unbeaten domestically. Leverkusen then finished second last term, only losing three league games.",
      "But it wasn't just Alonso who left. In a summer of widespread change, Leverkusen lost star man Florian Wirtz, influential wing-back Jeremie Frimpong, the experienced Granit Xhaka, defensive rock Jonathan Tah and captain-goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky.",
      "Despite there being plenty of goodwill for Ten Hag to succeed in the circumstances, he's been branded the worst club in their history. A report has now revealed five reasons why he was axed so soon.",
      "First of all, according to German outlet Bild, Ten Hag failed to get along with any of his players or staff, even those who arrived with him in July. Following a rocky pre-season which included a now infamous 5-0 hammering against Flamengo's under-21s, the Dutchman is said to have refused to 'rousing' speech before Leverkusen's first league game Hoffenheim which ended in a 2-1 defeat.",
      "Next, Ten Hag was accused of 'interfering' with Leverkusen's transfer plans and only proposed to sign players who are represented by the same agency as him. The 55-year-old is part of SEG, who also represent Rasmus Hojlund, and reportedly worked on the big-money deals which brought Andre Onana and Antony to United.",
      "Further to the transfer trouble, it's claimed that Ten Hag didn't know about Lucas Vazquez's arrival from Madrid until after the Spanish wing-back had signed his contract. The former Ajax manager also insisted that Xhaka wouldn't be moving to Sunderland, despite Leverkusen agreeing to let the Swiss midfielder go, which he eventually did.",
      "Thirdly, Ten Hag's training sessions didn't inspire confidence. He reportedly insisted that doing press-ups was important as working with the ball, and his sessions were 'unusually long'.",
      "Staff were also concerned about the 'cold' atmosphere around the club since Ten Hag's appointment. A major disconnect emerged, with even nutritionists and physios becoming disillusioned.",
      "And finally, results on the pitch were damning. Having started with 4-0 win away to fourth-tier side Sonnenhof Grossaspach - who had two went sent off - in the first round of the DFB Pokal, Leverkusen failed to win either of their first two Bundesliga games.",
      "Their campaign began with the aforementioned 2-1 loss at home to Hoffenheim before a humiliating 3-3 draw at Werder Bremen. It went down as an embarrassing result because Bremen were already down to 10 men when Ten Hag's side went 3-1 up with less than half an hour to play.",
      "Within 48 hours of full-time, Leverkusen chiefs decided to brutally wield the axe. Ten Hag quickly responded with a statement criticising the club's hierarchy for not giving him the 'time' or 'space' to 'implement his vision', and he described his dismissal as 'unprecedented'.",
      "He also stated: \"This was never a relationship based on mutual trust.\" Leverkusen are yet to appoint his successor, with Xavi Hernandez, Ange Postecoglou and Edin Terzic all linked.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wayne Rooney has revealed that Jose Mourinho ignored his request to up standards during his time at Manchester United. The Portuguese coach spent two-and-a-half years at Old Trafford and had a mixed time of things.",
      "He led the Red Devils to the Community Shield, Europa League and the League Cup during his debut season with the club. But ahead of the Red Devils’ appearance at Wembley, Rooney was taken aback by the slipping standards displayed by a number of his teammates.",
      "And he even went as far as speaking with Mourinho in an effort to get United stars to fall in line. Speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show, he said: “I remember we went to the League Cup final and players were wearing the suits with big, bright yellow trainers and stuff like that.",
      "“I went to Mourinho and said, ‘Listen, I've spoken to the players and you need to have a word here and to keep the standards. We can't have that going to Wembley into a cup final’.”",
      "And despite Rooney’s request, Mourinho appeared not to crack the whip at Old Trafford. He added: “He's like, ‘Yeah, yeah, I'll speak to them’. And then as we came down to leave, I've seen Jose there and he's got a zip-up top with no tie on. I was thinking, ‘What's the point?’",
      "“He was more relaxed on it, so, what's the point? Why am I even bothering with this? I think now it's just wear what you want and they have phones, caps, whatever, trainers would suit.”",
      "United have had a long tradition of players being expected to wear club suits before games. It was a tradition started by legendary former boss Sir Alex Ferguson and was re-adopted by a number of Mourinho’s successors including Louis van Gaal and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "But Rooney has revealed that the Portuguese wasn’t as stringent, having been relatively relaxed during his spell with Chelsea. Rooney said: “When you used to look at Chelsea, if you looked at the players who weren't in the squad, they were on the bench and they were all in their own clothes, and I thought it looked a bit scruffy.",
      "“Whereas at United, it was really professional and everyone, even if you're not in the squad, would be in the club suits. It looked really professional, and it's gone now.",
      "“I think now it's the same with every club, they just wear whatever they want. But I just always think, United looked really professional.”",
      "The suits have once again disappeared under current boss Ruben Amorim, who can regularly be seen sporting a tracksuit on the sidelines.",

      "Manchester United's deadline day capture of Senne Lammens has been branded as \"desperate\" amid suggestions a switch for Emi Martinez was agonisingly close. The Red Devils snapped up Belgian goalkeeper Lammens from Royal Antwerp in an £18.2million deal on the final day of the summer transfer window.",
      "The move came after major concerns emerged about the form of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir at the beginning of this campaign following costly blunders from both. Aston Villa's Martinez was also strongly tipped for a late move to Old Trafford after being omitted from Unai Emery's squad for their loss to Crystal Palace last weekend.",
      "Martinez eventually stayed at Villa Park as United opted for Lammens instead. United supporters will be hoping the 23-year-old's arrival will put an end to the club's ongoing issues between the posts.",
      "However, former Red Devils keeper Ben Foster has cast serious doubt over whether Lammens is capable of securing the No. 1 spot. The ex-England and Wrexham star branded the transfer a \"panic buy\" and queried whether United have done their homework on their new signing.",
      "\"Being a goalkeeper for United is the hardest goalkeeping position to play in world football,\" Foster said on his Fozcast podcast. \"You need someone with broad shoulders.",
      "\"I've watched a lot of videos of him on YouTube... and he looks on the eye test like he's a competent goalkeeper. I'm yet to see what he's like with the ball at his feet though and I think he's a panic buy.",
      "\"United have probably always got some sort of list of goalkeepers that they look at and they keep tabs on. There will be scouts all over the world, but I don't think they've done an in-depth analysis. A deadline day goalkeeper signing tells me that your club is desperate.\"",
      "Lammens conceded just 32 goals across 30 appearances for Royal Antwerp in Belgium's top flight last term, racking up seven clean sheets. The shot-stopper claimed the division's player of the month gong on two occasions, making 173 saves throughout the season.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim had previously insisted he was content with his current crop of keepers, though attempts to secure fresh talent intensified as the transfer deadline approached. Villa's Martinez made his desire for a switch to Old Trafford crystal clear, yet a move for the Argentine ultimately collapsed.",
      "Foster - who enjoyed a five-year stint with United from 2005 to 2010 - believes the deal was nearly done following Emery's icy response when quizzed about Martinez's predicament last week. He also suggested club chiefs could have sealed the transfer had they truly wanted it, with the 32-year-old now facing an uncomfortable return to Villa following the international break.",
      "Foster said: \"The fact that he missed Aston Villa's game the other night tells me that a deal was very close. It could be a million things [that went wrong]. It could be a medical issue, it could be a wages issue, it could be the transfer fee between the two clubs.",
      "\"None of us know what it is yet but I think that any of that could have been overcome. It's going to be interesting to see what happens to Emi Martinez now, though.",
      "\"If he doesn't get a move anywhere, then he's going to have to go back to Aston Villa. You saw the interview with Unai Emery before the game the other day and he wouldn't talk about him one little bit.\"",

When you look at our team we are starving for leaders on the pitch. He is a leader, he has to improve that part, he has to improve his game so we are happy to continue with Harry.”",
      "So far this season United have gone with a back three of Matthijs de Ligt, Luke Shaw and Leny Yoro. That has left Maguire watching on from the bench with Lisandro Martinez still needing to come back from injury. The England star remains the most expensive defender of all-time.",
      "Several Englishman, some in their prime, others in the twilight years of their careers, have headed to the Middle East. Ivan Toney is currently playing in Saudi Arabia whilst the likes of Jordan Henderson having a brief stint. Chris Smalling is also plying his trade there.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho was left ‘unable to move’ after his first Chelsea training session. The Argentine winger is already hard at work following his £40m switch from Manchester United.",
      "But those expecting Garnacho to have an instant impact at Stamford Bridge might have to bide their time. The forward did not have a pre-season at Old Trafford ahead of his move having been exiled by Ruben Amorim.",
      "And that has left him somewhat off the pace when it comes to his fitness. After his first training session with the Blues, Garnacho revealed he was already feeling the effects.",
      "Speaking to a member of the Blues’ media team, Garnacho said: “Can’t move my legs now man.\" He added: \"I sprinted in the last one.”",
      "Garnacho was left out of the Argentina squad for the current international break so Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca will be hoping that he can build his fitness over the next few weeks. Explaining what he could bring to the Blues, the Italian coach said: “When we are looking for a winger, we are looking for someone who is good one-v-one and who can attack and create something.",
      "“Jamie Gittens [signed from Borussia Dortmund this summer] is that profile, and we will see with Garnacho. He is a good winger in one-versus-one and he can create things. This is the way I see things.”",
      "One star who was however called up was Garnacho’s international and now club teammate Enzo Fernandez. And it appears that the midfielder was very keen to see the move get over the line.",
      "“I spoke to Enzo during the summer because he had been asking a lot of times, ‘When are you coming, when are you coming?,” Garnacho said.",
      "“I kept saying that he had to be patient, and we would play together. He texted me when I joined to say congratulations, and I can’t wait to see him and play together. I had to be patient too, but now I can’t wait to get started.”",
      "Should Garnacho get up to speed as planned, he could potentially make his debut for the Blues in just over a week’s time. The Blues travel to Brentford next Saturday, where they will aim to continue their unbeaten start to the campaign.",
      "He will be made to wait for his home debut though - Chelsea’s next outing at Stamford Bridge not coming until September 27 against Brighton. The Blues take on Bayern Munich, Garnacho’s former club Manchester United and Lincoln City away from home before then.",

      "While Manchester United spent more than £200million on summer signings, Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo was the one who got away. United head coach Ruben Amorim met with the Ghana international, it has been claimed, only for Semenyo to agree a new deal at the Vitality Stadium.",
      "\"I’ve grown so much at the club, both on and off the pitch, and I’m really happy to have signed ahead of returning for pre-season,\" Semenyo told club media after signing an extension until 2030. “From the fans to the staff and my teammates, I can’t speak highly enough of the people around the club.\"",
      "Newcastle and Tottenham were both linked with the 25-year-old, though interest cooled after he agreed his new deal. According to The Transfers Podcast, though, United were interested since the spring and pushed hard for a move.",
      "Ruben Amorim is reported to have met Semenyo for dinner in London at the end of last season to judge the player's character. CEO Omar Berrada and transfer chief Jason Wilcox also held conversations with Bournemouth over the former Bristol City star, but to no avail.",
      "United were ready to fork out £55million on Semenyo, valuing his proven Premier League quality. However, the player himself is said to have committed his future to Bournemouth after learning United were planning to pay him less than what they offered to other targets.",
      "Those targets, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, both joined United for more than £60m. Cameroon international Mbeumo is already off the mark for his new club, scoring in a 3-2 league victory over Burnley, but Cunha was injured during the same match.",
      "Semenyo has kept up his good form for Bournemouth after scoring a career-high 11 league goals last term and 13 in all competitions. He scored both goals for the Cherries as they faced Liverpool on the opening weekend of the season, and also set up Marcus Tavernier's winner in a victory over Wolves.",
      "He scored home and away against United last season as Bournemouth won at Old Trafford and conceded a last-minute equaliser in the reverse fixture. The two teams won't meet until December this season.",
      "Bournemouth's ability to hang onto Semenyo was important in the light of a number of high-profile summer exits. Three members of last season's back four completed big-money exits, with Milos Kerkez joining Liverpool, Illia Zabarnyi moving to Paris Saint-Germain and Dean Huijsen making a dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "The Cherries also cashed in on Dango Ouattara, who joined Brentford for around £42m, with Philip Billing and Mark Travers among the fringe players to move on. Andoni Iraola's side have also spent big over the summer, making defender Bafode Diakite the second most expensive signing in their history and also picking up Djordje Petrovic and Ben Gannon Doak from other Premier League clubs.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro avoided a red card after standing on the leg of a stricken opponent while playing for Brazil. The Selecao enjoyed a comfortable 3-0 win over Chile in World Cup qualifying on Friday at the Maracana in a match that saw a nasty foul by Casemiro go unpunished.",
      "Goals from Chelsea winger Estevao, West Ham playmaker Lucas Paqueta and Newcastle midfielder Bruno Guimaraes saw Carlo Ancelotti pick up his second win in his third game as Brazil boss. It was a chance for Ancelotti to experiment, with Brazil already assured of their place in next year’s World Cup, while Chile sat bottom of the group with their chance already gone.",
      "Estevao put the home side in front by heading in a deflected shot from close range before Casemiro was fortunate not to be sent off on the stroke of half-time. The veteran midfielder clearly stood on the leg of Chile midfielder Felipe Loyola, who writhed around in pain on the floor.",
      "The United star appeared to look down as he planted his foot, before looking up at the referee and apologising to his opponent. He was shown a yellow card, and with no VAR in operation, escaped any further punishment.",
      "Ancelotti’s side made the game safe midway through the second half when Paqueta headed in Luiz Henrique’s cross at the back post. Guimaraes then grabbed a goal of his own by converting from on the goal line.",
      "Brazil were already assured of their place at the 2026 World Cup, which takes place across Canada, the United States and Mexico. Ancelotti took over as manager this summer following the dismissal of Dorival Junior at the end of March.",
      "The former Real Madrid manager is in his first role as an international boss and will be under huge pressure for results following a turbulent period. His arrival is good news for Casemiro, who played under the Italian coach during his successful period at Real.",
      "Casemiro has 77 caps for the national team and is still a starter at Manchester United at the age of 33. He has started all three of United’s Premier League games this season in holding midfield, with Ruben Amorim not trusting Kobbie Mainoo or Manuel Ugarte in the position alongside captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Asked what his ambitions were for the season, Casemiro told the United club website: “To have a great year. To have a great year at the top level, because at the end of the season we have the World Cup.",
      "“So, I want to arrive at the World Cup in good form. I want to enjoy the year, to arrive in top form, and it is the title that I am missing. So, I want to win titles here. We have new signings of top quality that will help us a lot.”",

      "Daniel Levy has stepped down as Tottenham's executive chairman after almost 25 years at the club. And an admission made by the iconic Sir Alex Ferguson summed up his shrewd and often frustrating negotiating skills.",
      "Levy, who joined the Spurs board in December 2000, has been the figurehead behind the north London club's move from White Hart Lane to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He now steps down with no changes being made to his ownership or shares in the club, as the Levy family will continue to own 29.88 per cent of the share capital of ENIC.",
      "It comes hot on the heels of Vinai Venkatesham's arrival as Chief Executive Officer, while Peter Charrrington has joined the board and stepped into the role of Non-Executive Chairman, in what has been described as a move prioritising sporting success.",
      "Levy was renowned during his time with Spurs for his approach to transfers, building up a reputation as a shrewd negotiator with an eye for a deal. However, these tactics rubbed legendary Manchester United boss Ferguson the wrong way when the two were pitched against each other in negotiations over Dimitar Berbatov 17 years ago.",
      "Berbatov eventually sealed a switch from White Hart Lane to Old Trafford for £30million, although the bitter fallout saw Tottenham complain to the Premier League over the move. Afterwards, Ferguson was less than complimentary when reflecting on the negotiations.",
      "\"That whole experience was more painful than my hip replacement,\" he penned in his book, Leading, displaying just how difficult Levy was to deal with, effectively paying the now-63-year-old a backhanded compliment about his negotiating skills.",
      "After Levy's exit was announced, he released a heartfelt statement: \"I am incredibly proud of the work I have done together with the executive team and all our employees.",
      "\"We have built this club into a global heavyweight competing at the highest level. More than that, we have built a community,\" he continued.",
      "\"I was lucky enough to work with some of the greatest people in this sport, from the team at Lilywhite House and Hotspur Way to all the players and managers over the years.",
      "\"I wish to thank all the fans that have supported me over the years. It hasn't always been an easy journey but significant progress has been made. I will continue to support this club passionately.\"",
      "Charrington will now step up as the Non-Executive Chairman, and he stated after joining the Tottenham board: \"I am very honoured to become Non-Executive Chairman of this extraordinary club and, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Daniel and his family for their commitment and loyalty to the club over so many years.",
      "\"This is a new era of leadership for the club, on and off the pitch. I do recognise there has been a lot of change in recent months as we put in place new foundations for the future. We are now fully focused on stability and empowering our talented people across the club, led by Vinai and his executive team.\"",

      "The Premier League's 10 best players so far this season have been determined by Opta's stats with Chelsea midfielder Moises Caicedo the top performer after three games.",
      "England's top flight has paused due to the first international break of the season, allowing teams to take stock of where they're at following the opening weeks. Liverpool sit top with the only 100 per cent record and yet none of their players make the list so far.",
      "They've been impressive going forward with Hugo Ekitike hitting his straps early, but the Reds have by no means produced scintillating performances to secure their three wins. They conceded four times in their first two games - against Bournemouth and Newcastle - and needed late winners on both occasions to pick up the three points.",
      "None of Arsenal's players have earned enough 'Opta points' either - which is what has determined the early rankings. They are metrics that measure contribution to games via actions such as goals, tackles, and goal conceded. A player who plays 90 minutes will typically end up with totals between 10 and 40 points - and the player at the top of the tree averages 31.7 so far.",
      "Caicedo's influence in midfield has long been lauded and he will be a crucial figure for the Blues. Another midfielder sits in second in the form of Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, who is now in the England fold.",
      "Trevoh Chalobah has enjoyed a renaissance at Chelsea have previously been cut adrift by Enzo Maresca, but he's now become an influential figure in the backline. Tottenham's Guglielmo Vicario is the only goalkeeper in the top 10 after he kept two clean sheets.",
      "Two playmakers in Bruno Fernandes and Lucas Paqueta, both men who've been on target this season, are ranked in fifth and sixth and continue to have major influence over games, particularly in the final third. Joao Pedro's impressive start at Chelsea has him in eighth.",
      "The Brazilian has scored twice in his three games since moving from Brighton. His Blues' team-mate Enzo Fernandez is narrowly ahead, meaning Chelsea have four players in the top 10, by far the most of any club. They remained undefeated with their only dropped points coming in the goalless draw with Crystal Palace.",
      "Despite Manchester City's below par start to the year Erling Haaland scrapes into the top 10. He has scored three times, finding the net twice against Wolves. His former team-mate Jack Grealish has also enjoyed an impressive start to life at Everton as he bids to reignite his career.",

      "Keane had been at United since the age of 11, until he finally left to join Burnley in 2015 after a successful loan spell at Turf Moor. Keane's two years playing under Sean Dyche earned him plenty of attention and he joined Everton in 2017 for a fee that could rise to £30m.",
      "The centre-back is still an important player at Everton and has 12 England caps to his name.",
      "An Italian centre-half, Fornasier joined the United set up in 2009 from Fiorentina.",
      "Although he helped United lift the 2011 FA Youth Cup and appeared in the Under-21 Squad, he failed to make a first team appearance and headed back to Italy in 2013.",
      "Spells at Sampdoria, Pescara, Venezia, Parma, Trapani, Cremonese and Monopoli followed. Fornasier currently plays for Nardo in Serie D.",
      "A powerhouse of a defender, there were high hopes for Sean McGinty at United.",
      "Unfortunately, these failed to materialise and McGinty was sent out on loan to Morecambe, Oxford United, Carlisle United and Tranmere before finally leaving in 2013 to Sheffield United in search of first-team football.",
      "McGinty has subsequently played for Rochdale, Aldershot, Torquay United, Partick Thistle, Greenock Morton, Ayr United, Hamilton Academical and Airdrieonians.",
      "Another defender straight from the United academy who sadly couldn’t make the grade at Old Trafford. Although appearing for England at all youth levels, Thorpe struggled for appearances at Rotherham United, where he joined after leaving United permanently in 2015.",
      "After spells at Bradford, Bolton and ATK of the Indian Premier League, Thorpe had a break from professional football. He last played for Greater Manchester club Stalybridge Celtic in 2024.",
      "After making his United senior debut in a cup game against Newcastle in 2012, Tunnicliffe famously won his father £10,000 after he bet £100 at 100/1 that his son, aged nine at the time, would make a first-team appearance for the Reds.",
      "Sadly, it did not progress much beyond that for the Bury-born midfielder and he left the club in 2014 to join Fulham, signed by former United coach Rene Meulensteen. Tunnicliffe went on to make 59 appearances, scoring twice for the Cottagers.",
      "Loans at Wigan and Blackburn came next, followed by a free transfer to Millwall in 2017. Tunnicliffe then played for Luton and Portsmouth before signing for Australian club Adelaide.",
      "Where to start with Paul Pogba?",
      "He became United's record signing after leaving United for Juventus in 2012 under acrimonious circumstances before re-signing in 2016 for £89m.",
      "Pogba had been promoted to the first team by Sir Alex Ferguson for a FA Cup game against Crawley Town in 2011, however, first-team opportunities would later be hard to come by, with Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick ahead him.",
      "He would make three first-team appearances in the Premier League and Europa League before his free transfer to Juve.",
      "Pogba's second stint in Manchester did not hit the heights that were expected, although he did win the League Cup and Europa League during his six-year stay.",
      "He returned to Juventus in 2022, but he was suspended in September 2023 due to the failure of a drug test. Pogba's contract was ended by mutual consent at the end of last year and he made his return to football with Monaco this summer.",
      "Lingard joined United at the age of seven and as a reward for winning the FA Youth Cup, he was handed his first professional contract in the summer of 2011. He was soon sent out on loan, and Leicester City was the chosen destination, with Lingard going on to make his competitive debut at The Foxes.",
      "Lingard was again sent out on loan in 2013 by David Moyes to Birmingham and Brighton, while finally managing to break through to the first team in 2014.",
      "He famously scored the winning goal in the 2016 FA Cup final and he also scored the opening goal in United’s 2016 FA Community Shield win, while also netting in the 2017 League Cup Final.",
      "The forward hit his peak in 2018 where an impressive season for United was followed by his key role in England's fourth-placed finish at the 2018 World Cup. Lingard was excellent during a loan with West Ham in 2020/21, but he remained at United for another season and left permanently for Nottingham Forest in 2022.",
      "Lingard has been playing for South Korean K League club FC Seoul since his surprise move in February 2024.",
      "Arguably the key man in the Class of 2011, Morrison overshadowed fellow teammates Pogba and Lingard with his pace, flair and vision. United legend Gary Neville described Morrison as 'a Paul Gascoigne-type who could beat men and score some incredible goals'.",
      "But off-field issues undermined his talent and United reluctantly let Morrison go. In 2012, he joined then Championship side West Ham and after spells at QPR, Cardiff, Lazio, Club Atlas and Ostersunds, Morrison returned to England with Sheffield United in 2019.",
      "Morrison only made four appearances for the Blades. He joined Dutch club ADO Den Haag and later signed for Derby County, which was followed by a move to reunite with Wayne Rooney at D.C. United.",
      "The 32-year-old midfielder currently plays for Precision FC in Dubai.",
      "After starting his footballing career at Ajax, Van Velzen became one of the youngest players in the FA Youth Cup winning team after joining in 2010. The tricky forward signed a professional contract in 2012 and was sent out on loan to Royal Antwerp in Belgium.",
      "He returned a few months later but by the summer of 2013 the decision was made to release Van Velzen from his contract. Van Velzen returned to the Netherlands and played for FC Utrecht, FC Volendam and Roda JC in the Eredivisie before a return to England in the summer of 2019.",
      "Van Velzen signed for League Two side Crawley, but he only made five appearances for the club and he went back to the Netherlands, where he still plays for VVSB.",
      "The lanky forward was United’s target man, becoming top scorer for the youth team with 16 goals including eight in their FA Youth Cup winning campaign.",
      "Keane made his first-team debut in late 2011, coming on in a defeat to Blackburn Rovers, but a knee ligament problem ruled him out of the entire 2012/2013 season.",
      "With a few unsuccessful loan spells away from United, Keane eventually left to join former Reds assistant manager Mike Phelan at Hull City in 2016. It took him two years to score his first goal for the club, coming in a 5-0 away win to Burton Albion in April 2018.",
      "Keane currently plays for Preston North End after stints with Ipswich Town and Wigan.",
      "Blackett left United permanently in 2016 after a loan spells at Blackpool, Birmingham and Celtic.",
      "He made over 100 appearances for Reading before representing Nottingham Forest, FC Cincinnati and Rotherham, but Blackett has been without a club as a free agent for over a year now.",
      "Cole joined Fulham along with Tunnicliffe in 2014. He currently plays for Warrington Town.",
      "Coll joined Derry City after being released from United, but his spell there only lasted half a season and he stopped playing professional football.",
      "Cofie worked his way around the lower reaches of the Football League and non-league circuit, adding 12 clubs to his name after leaving United. He entered coaching at the age of 27 in 2020.",
      "Centre-back Massacci returned to Italy following his release from United in 2012. He dropped out of football after leaving ASD Valentino Mazzola in 2017."

      "Manchester United defender Patrick Dorgu has revealed his reaction to losing compatriots Christian Eriksen and Rasmus Hojlund as club team-mates at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Dorgu joined United in the January transfer window from Italian side Lecce and has made the left-wing-back slot his own in Ruben Amorim's starting XI.",
      "He became the fourth Danish player in the squad, joining Eriksen, Hojlund and young forward Chido Obi, but now that contingent has been cut down to two.",
      "Eriksen left the club on a free transfer at the end of last season and is still on the lookout for a new club. Hojlund joined Napoli on a season-long loan deal which includes an obligation to turn the deal permanent.",
      "Dorgu has described Hojlund's departure as a 'bigger shock' and admitted it was a 'big plus' for him joining United knowing his international team-mates were at the club.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "“That’s how it is in football,” Dorgu told Ekstrabladet, as translated by Sport Witness.",
      "“You never know when it’s your turn to move on. We knew it would happen to Christian, but it was perhaps a bigger shock that Rasmus had to move on.",
      "“I talked to him a lot during the process and could sense which way it was going. Hopefully, we will now see each other every time on the national team.",
      "“I have been very happy to be teammates with Christian and Rasmus. It was a big plus for me that they were at the club when I joined. That way it was easier to become part of the squad.",
      "“But it was in no way decisive for my choice of Manchester United. I was thinking much more about the coach’s plans and ideas with me when I had to make the decision.",
      "“I travelled alone to Italy when I was 17. I am also alone in Manchester and I am fine that way. You become incredibly strong mentally when you travel alone so early, because you have to make a lot of decisions. I am sure that mental strength has also helped me on the pitch.”",
      "Dorgu was an unused substitute on Friday in Copenhagen as Denmark were held to a 0-0 draw by Scotland in their first World Cup qualifier.",
      "Denmark are back in action on Monday as they make the trip to Greece in their second group match of their qualifying campaign and Dorgu will hope to be involved.",

      "The 18-year-old signed for United this summer from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in a deal that could rise as high as £7million.",
      "He broke into their first team as a 17-year-old and has already made an impression at United, training exclusively with the first team since his arrival.",
      "Leon featured throughout pre-season for United and impressed enough to be retained with the first team squad beyond the summer window.",
      "Fellow teenage left-back Harry Amass, who made seven appearances for United last season was shipped off on loan to Championship side Sheffield Wednesday instead.",
      "Certainly Ruben Amorim has been impressed. \"He did really well, he's learning things, he's powerful,\" the United boss said of Leon back in July. \"He's going to be a very good player.\"",
      "It means Leon is back-up to Patrick Dorgu and the challenge now facing the talented teenager is getting into the United side.",
      "He made his debut for the under-21s in their friendly against the PFA free agents' XI in midweek and will likely feature for them more regularly while he waits for his chance in the first team.",
      "But the hype around his potential in Paraguay is huge. Cerro Porteno chairman Juan Jose Zapag described him as 'a left-back like no other in the world, the kind that's rare to find'.",
      "And his motivation now will be to try and force his way into his country's thinking ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "La Albirroja's 0-0 draw with Ecuador was enough to secure their place in the World Cup for the first time in 16 years and that led the country's president, Santiago Pena, to declare a public holiday.",

      "Junior Alonso of Atletico Mineiro and Agustin Sandez of Rosario Central are the two men standing in his way but if he needed extra motivation to succeed at United then he has just found it.",

A number of notable players will be featuring for United this afternoon including Darren Fletcher, captain for the occasion Michael Carrick, Dimitar Berbatov and Patrice Evra.",

      "He made 479 appearances in total before moving on to Celtic. Injury would cut his spell in Scotland short, though, and he retired having racked up just 12 games for the Glasgow club.",
      "Some fans may be surprised to see Keane not playing today but the 54-year-old has already expressed his reason for not featuring in charity matches. \"I'm not fit,\" he previously told Off The Ball.",

      "Chelsea midfielder Cole Palmer has delivered a mysterious message to Kobbie Mainoo following the rejection of his loan request from Manchester United.",
      "The 20-year-old has been left frustrated by his limited playing time and reportedly sought a loan switch from Old Trafford during the final days of the summer transfer window. Following United's 1-1 stalemate at Fulham, where Mainoo remained on the bench for the second straight Premier League fixture, Amorim revealed the midfielder is in direct competition with Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth.",
      "Matters deteriorated further for the young England international when he started in United's embarrassing League Cup second round elimination against Grimsby Town. Whilst Chelsea had been previously linked with the Stockport born star, the Blues failed to make any formal bid during the summer window.",
      "The midfielder recently posted an image of himself conducting individual training sessions throughout the international break, alongside a mysterious photograph from the acclaimed film Whiplash, depicting the moment protagonist Andrew smashed through his drum kit, hinting at his mounting frustration with his present circumstances.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Palmer, who is also missing from England's squad owing to a groin problem sustained prior to Chelsea's 5-1 triumph over West Ham United, subsequently replied with his own enigmatic response in Mainoo's comments section. The former Manchester City player posted: \"3 my boy\" accompanied by a love heart emoji.",
      "Some viewed this as a suggestion Mainoo ought to consider departing Old Trafford, though Palmer's true intentions remain a matter of speculation. During last summer's campaign, Mainoo featured in all but one of England's matches leading to the Euro 2024 final, including the showpiece itself.",
      "Despite key players such as Jude Bellingham, Adam Wharton, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden being unavailable through injury or omission, Tuchel opted against selecting Mainoo. Much like his situation at Old Trafford, the promising midfielder faces an uphill battle to break into Tuchel's thinking.",
      "Looking back on his performances at the European Championships, United legend Rio Ferdinand was left shocked by reports Mainoo was looking for a loan exit. The former defender said: \"David Ornstein was saying that Kobbie Mainoo is open to leaving, which is.",
      "\"I don't want to hear that. Kobbie, if you're watching, if you're hearing, [or] people that are next to him. Don't let me hear that. Please man. I need you stay at the club, be patient. Please.",
      "\"I know it's difficult and it's easy for me to say. I want to see you here. If we were sitting here going; 'Do you know what? After his exploits with England that Kobbie Mainoo can't get into the Man Utd team and they're thinking about selling him - and he wants to go.'",
      "\"You couldn't have bet me any money that'd be happening right now, and not this soon after his exploits with England, and how good he was, and how much we were all waxing lyrical about him.\"",
      "Ferdinand also commented on Mainoo's Instagram post, simply writing: \"Work.\"",
      "In United's close 3-2 home win against Burnley, Amorim chose to introduce Mainoo from the bench instead of Ugarte, indicating the young player is increasingly on the manager's radar.",
      "He has earned 10 caps for England, making his debut in the 1-0 home defeat to Brazil in March 2024.",

      "Ruben Amorim enters into the 2025/2026 edition of the Premier League knowing that he needs to show tangible improvements that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos can be encouraged by. Being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round to Grimsby Town was a rude awakening - and their top-flight form has been a mixed bag.",
      "The defeat to Arsenal showed signs of improvement, while the draw against Fulham was underwhelming. Victory against Burnley was essential to bounce back from the loss to Grimsby but the performance was a rollercoaster of emotions for supporters at Old Trafford and watching on from home.",
      "All is very much still to play for this season, though, so as the Premier League breaks this weekend for World Cup qualifiers, we have taken a look at where pundits think United will finish this season;",
      "Unsurprisingly, the most optimistic pundit is former captain Gary Neville. He was quite positive after the Reds lost to Arsenal and, before that opening fixture, he set out what the hope was for United this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"United will be looking at Champions League, that will be the ambition. Not playing in Europe has to help, because there's basically more training time, less pressure on the players, less injuries.",
      "\"It means that the best players can play more often in the league, and not have those demands of a Thursday night game. But we've got to start the season well - and there are some tough fixtures early on.\"",
      "Former midfielder Paul Scholes is hopeful about where United can finish up this season, but he fears that Amorim may well be punished by a failure to improve his midfield. \"Although it is looking better, I still think there are issues with the team,\" he told The Overlap Fan Debate.",
      "\"But, top-six. I think top-six would be more than acceptable.",
      "\"As much as you don’t want to say that, I always think Manchester United should aim for the very best and aim for the highest. I am just not sure.",
      "\"I think there are too many good teams now. Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City are all on the up. Arsenal [as well], I did not even mention Aston Villa, Newcastle.",
      "\"I think there is a lot of competition now to get top-six.\"",
      "Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand all feel United will be in the same conversation for Europe, but will likely miss out on the top prize of the Champions League. \"Man Utd seventh, but they could be sixth,\" Ferdinand succinctly predicted when doing his Premier League predictions on TikTok.",
      "\"I mean, they have bought, you know, three players in,\" Lineker said on The Rest is Football. \"We don't know how good Sesko is going to be in the Premier League.",
      "\"I think he scored, what, 13 goals last season? Mid-table? I see mid-table.",
      "\"They need to improve on last season... So, I think to get into Europe, I mean, it seems ridiculous to say that about Manchester United, doesn't it? To get into any kind of European football next season would probably be a bonus.\"",
      "Agreeing with this assessment, Shearer added: \"I mean, clearly they'll improve on last season.",
      "\"They can't be as bad. Yeah, they've made a couple of really good signings but, yeah, I think seventh, eighth, ninth, something like that.\"",
      "\"They looked like Man Utd players, they were happy to deal with the pressure, they're good characters. But we've mentioned it many times before, there are problems at the back.",
      "\"We've heard noises about them not being boring, but ultimately you've got to score goals to win football matches or then you're constantly under pressure. The expectations around the club are so low now that everyone is almost happy.\"",
      "\"Mid-table - 10th, maybe ninth,\" he later predicted.",
      "\"The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary [Neville] said on commentary, everyone is okay with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better. So it does worry me.\"",

      "Last month, a Manchester United staff member touched on the future of Rhys Bennett.",
      "\"Rhys has his sights set high,\" they said. That comment was perceived as Bennett wanting a loan in the Championship, but perhaps it was alluding to the youngster's ambition to break into the senior squad.",
      "In the final days of the transfer window, United sources said Bennett could still go out on loan, which seemed the most logical option for the defender after his Fleetwood Town stint.",
      "However, it became clear in the final hours of deadline day that Bennett was unlikely to leave.",
      "That leaves the 21-year-old in an interesting situation because he has clearly outgrown academy football. Bennett will only gain match fitness from playing for the Under-21s in the first half of the campaign.",
      "Could Bennett contribute to the first-team squad? With the benefit of hindsight, maybe that is what the United staff member meant, so don't be surprised to see him in training at Carrington.",
      "Bennett has not made his first-team debut for United, although he could sense an opportunity after Tyler Fredricson was involved. Fredricson was named on the bench against Arsenal and Fulham, and he started against Grimsby Town before being hooked at half-time in the Carabao Cup debacle.",
      "Fredricson made two senior appearances last season. Bennett is slightly older, more experienced after his Fleetwood loan and may fancy his chances of usurping his fellow academy graduate in Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "No player emerged with credit from the Grimsby performance, but it was a particularly tough evening for Fredricson, who received an earful from Amorim throughout the first half.",
      "Fredricson has always had a strong reputation in academy circles. Bennett is also highly regarded and captained the Under-18s to FA Youth Cup success at Old Trafford in 2021/22.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Dan Gore starred in that supremely talented young team, but Bennett was the captain and opened the scoring in the final against Nottingham Forest.",
      "In the last three years, Bennett has watched Mainoo, Garnacho, Gore and Charlie McNeill make their senior United debuts. He shared the dressing room with those players during the FA Youth Cup run, but he's been forced to bide his time and work hard to get a sniff of a potential opening.",
      "Has that opening finally emerged? The Denton-born lad has the next six months to achieve what he dreamt about as a kid: a debut for United. The time is now for him to push toward making it a reality.",
      "It won't be easy for Bennett, but he must back himself to progress after watching Fredricson receive minutes. They play in the same position and Bennett will think he can achieve what Fredricson has.",
      "Bennett should be hardened from his Fleetwood loan last season. The centre-back made 38 appearances across all competitions and gained crucial experience of fighting for points each week.",
      "\"That has been massive for me and I like having that bit of added pressure to games and scenarios,\" said Bennett last season about playing competitive football with Fleetwood.",
      "“When I was younger, I used to get carried away with thinking, ‘what's the next couple of years going to look like?’ You can lose focus on what's in front of you right now. It’s still in the back of my mind, but the focus is on the next game and getting the most out of this.”",
      "The elephant in the room is that Bennett is unlikely to feature prominently. Amorim has Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Luke Shaw; Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven and Noussair Mazraoui as options for the back-three.",
      "Lisandro Martinez will also return from the sidelines in the coming weeks. However, injuries could completely change the state of play and Bennett will be ready if an opportunity arises.",

    "body": [
      "Pep Guardiola's warning about Jadon Sancho's mindset was ignored when Manchester United secured the winger's services in 2021.",
      "Sancho emerged through the Manchester City youth system in 2017 under the Spaniard's guidance, but the 25-year-old never managed to make a senior appearance for the Citizens before being transferred to Borussia Dortmund in a deal valued at around £8million. When asked in 2019 about why Sancho was sold rather than utilised by Guardiola, the 54-year-old said: \"I don't know.",
      "\"He didn't want to take this challenge [to fight his way into the first team], this opportunity to discover if he was able to. He decided to go there. So, it's perfect. It's going well and congratulations on what he is doing.",
      "\"He is doing an incredible performance. He did it incredibly well this season. What would have happened this season [at City]? I don't know. Again, with the players, it depends on them and what they do on the pitch.\"",
      "While Guardiola was overjoyed to see Sancho enjoying success in the Bundesliga, his comments concerning the winger's determination to compete for his position may have raised concerns among managers. Sancho's record of 50 goals and 64 assists across 137 appearances for Die Schwarzgelben between 2017 and 2021 proved enticing enough for United to secure his signature in a £73m transfer following an extended pursuit.",
      "However, his spell with the Red Devils in the years that have followed have been anything but straightforward. Across his first two seasons at Old Trafford, Sancho netted just nine Premier League goals in 55 appearances, before returning to Dortmund following a disagreement with Erik ten Hag regarding his performances in training.",
      "After United's 3-1 defeat by Arsenal in September 2023 – a match Sancho wasn't included in the travelling squad for – Ten Hag said: \"Jadon, on his performances in training we did not select him. You have to reach a level every day at Manchester United and we can make choices in the front line. So for this game he was not selected.\"",
      "Sancho, however, was swift to respond to his manager's remarks, alleging he was being made a \"scapegoat.\" He wrote on social media: \"Please don't believe everything you read.",
      "\"I will not allow people saying things that is completely untrue, I have conducted myself in training very well this week. I believe there are other reasons for this matter which I won't go into, I've been a scapegoat for a long time, which isn't fair!",
      "\"All I want to do is play football with a smile on my face and contribute to the team. I respect all decisions that are made by the coaching staff, I play with fantastic players and grateful to do so, which I know every week is a challenge. I will continue to fight for this badge no matter what!\"",
      "After his brief return to Dortmund, Sancho returned to Manchester United in the summer of 2024, where he resolved his differences with Ten Hag. However, his stint at Old Trafford was short-lived, as he moved to Chelsea on a season-long loan with a £25m obligation to buy based on performances.",
      "Despite a somewhat successful spell with Chelsea, the board decided against exercising their mandatory purchase option, instead paying a £5m penalty to see Sancho return to the north west under new manager Ruben Amorim. Yet again, his time at Old Trafford was cut short when the Portuguese coach deemed him unnecessary for his plans.",
      "Consequently, Sancho has secured a deadline day transfer to Aston Villa on loan, where he hopes to revive his Premier League career under Unai Emery. With Sancho's contract set to expire next summer, there is no obligation to buy attached to the deal. However, the United board also has the option to extend his contract by a year to prevent him from leaving the club as a free agent.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's Premier League campaign is just three matches old and already there are concerns starting to come to light regarding injuries.",
      "The Reds have started the season with a mixed bag of results. United's Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town was undoubtedly the low point of the opening fixtures, but there have been signs of encouragement following the victory over Burnley and even in the defeat to Arsenal.",
      "When the Premier League returns a week on Sunday for United, all eyes will be on Ruben Amorim as they travel to Manchester City for the derby. A replica of the result from last season will do the Portuguese head coach wonders, but if he is to do that, he may have to do it without some of his key players.",
      "One star who is a huge concern for the game against City is Lisandro Martinez. The Argentine has been sidelined since February with injury, and while he is back on the grass at Carrington, it is unlikely that he will be able to come straight back into the starting line-up.",
      "Martinez, should he return against Pep Guardiola's team, will likely have to settle for a place among the substitutes. As for his defensive partner Diogo Dalot, he has become a fresh concern for United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The full-back has withdrawn from the Portugal squad recently due to a 'muscle discomfort'. United will be hoping this is merely a precautionary measure but could call upon Patrick Dorgu to fill in on the left were he to be out of the derby.",
      "Mason Mount hobbled off against City the last time United travelled to the Etihad Stadium and he could miss the side that faces them this time around after playing '30 minutes' with an injury against Burnley. His issue does not appear to be too serious and the hope is that he can at least make the bench.",
      "Finally, United will be holding their breath on Matheus Cunha. Despite having not scored for the club yet, the Brazilian has been a near-constant threat for the Reds, so it was a concern when he looked to have picked up a hamstring issue against the Clarets.",
      "Cunha has since taken to Instagram to suggest that he will be 'back soon'. However, it is unclear whether this means his return shall be swift for the City fixture or not.",

      "While Victor Lindelof, who was released at the same time as Eriksen, has now signed for Aston Villa, the Dane remains without a club. As he is a free agent, the decision was made not to call him up to the Danish squad for this month's World Cup qualifiers.",

      "\"This looks like a friendly thing, where Christian Eriksen is over and having fun with some friends. Where is the ambition to play football?",

Whether a move in January could be revisited remains to be seen, but there is now likely to be speculation that a deal could be agreed in the New Year.",
      "If that does happen, the signing of Semenyo would certainly strengthen the forward options currently available to Ruben Amorim at United. Semenyo plays on the right wing for Bournemouth, but is also capable of performing on the left just as easily.",

      "Although Amorim has stuck to his guns so far and not shifted away from his preferred 3-4-3 formation, a 4-2-3-1 could see Cunha utilised a No.10 role behind Sesko to help provide creativity in the midfield and final third for United. That would allow the Brazilian, Mbeumo, Semenyo and Sesko to all take to the field at one time.",

      "After over six months without a club, he signed a two-year deal with French side AS Monaco.

      "The latest of them is Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo. Journalist Duncan Castles revealed on The Transfers Podcast that Semenyo was aggressively targeted by United in the summer window , with a £55 million deal on the cards.

With Semenyo also able to play a central role, his addition may have meant that Chido Obi would have been allowed to go out on loan in search of more game time.",

      "The third area that United could have strengthened more is the goalkeeping department. The club did complete the deadline day signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, but the step up to first choice at Old Trafford could be difficult.",

      "“At the moment the four players competing in central midfield are Jordan [Henderson], Declan [Rice], Elliot [Anderson] and Ruben [Loftus-Cheek]. They are all very mobile players and there is not one deep number six, maybe John Stones but he left this morning.”",
      "What an extraordinarily depressing quote that is, and for so many reasons. The way in which Thomas Tuchel breezes through several dispiriting barriers to England winning the World Cup next summer in the space of two sentences is almost impressive.",
      "We’re not done with anger yet in the five stages of grief at Henderson being selected again, so we’re a ways off accepting he’s genuinely competing for a midfield spot and yet, when you look at the alternatives, we wouldn’t be at all surprised to see him starting against Andorra on Saturday.",
      "We would much rather see Anderson or Loftus-Cheek alongside Rice, but with this being the former’s first call-up and the latter’s first for nearly seven years, we’re prepared for Hendo doing his shouty thing and plenty of finger-pointing while displaying that all-important trait: mobility.",
      "Quite apart from questioning whether a 35-year-old can even be counted in a class of “very mobile players”, it’s hardly the exciting midfield characteristic one would hope is being picked out by the manager of one of the best international teams in the world as being key to success. “Wow, did you see how mobile he was there?” Jesus.",
      "And why is there “not one deep number six”, Thomas? England need one. Obviously. Every football team in the world has one. England are not going to win the World Cup without one. So don’t replace an injured Adam Wharton – surely the best bet to fill that gap as things stand – with Loftus-Cheek. It makes no sense.",
      "What about Angel Gomes? He’s starting in midfield for Marseille and was arguably the standout player of Lee Carsley’s caretaker reign. Archie Gray, maybe? It doesn’t really matter. This is the first of three international breaks before the World Cup and England need to be playing games of football with a No.6.",
      "And no, not John Stones. Why would you look to fix England’s biggest problem by weakening its second biggest? All things being equal, it should be Stones and Marc Guehi as the Three Lions centre-back pairing. Again, obviously.",
      "Tuchel could do with a midfield bolt from the blue. Someone to come from nowhere to provide a solution; to vie with Wharton for that starting spot which he looks very much on course to merit but will also be his by default.",
      "Ruben Amorim could do England, himself, Manchester United and Kobbie Mainoo a massive favour in one fell swoop.",
      "He desperately needs a partner for Bruno Fernandes. Casemiro is no longer up to it and Manuel Ugarte is yet to show himself capable while offering very little hope of that ever being the case. Mainoo meanwhile continues to be told that his only option of breaking into the first team is through ousting captain and talisman Fernandes. But why?",
      "He’s a 20-year-old footballer who is by all accounts a hard-working professional who’s very clearly desperate to be playing football this season in order to go to the World Cup this summer.",
      "We can think of no individual more open to being coached (imagine that?) into playing a slightly different role which would see him play every game for club and ensure his place in the England squad next summer. There’s literally no downside.",
      "Greenwood isn’t in Tuchel’s England ‘thoughts’ but would a Harry Kane injury change that? What if he was a No.6 and not a striker?",
      "England boss Thomas Tuchel has claimed that former Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood is not currently close to a potential Three Lions recall.",
      "Thomas Tuchel has been warned he faces the same issues as past England managers, with Jordan Henderson accused of blocking young talent.",
      "A ‘significant U-turn’ suggests Manchester United already regret a £100m transfer decision, which has exposed ‘furious’ Ruben Amorim…",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has every right to “not like” Ruben Amorim as the Man Utd manager is very clearly “the problem” in his case.",
      "Amorim may well look at the fate that’s befallen five of his six Manchester United predecessors this summer and think twice about resigning."

      "A ‘significant U-turn’ suggests Manchester United already regret a £100m transfer decision, which has exposed ‘furious’ Ruben Amorim…",
      "Ruben Amorim remains under fire at Man Utd and there are signs that the pressure is getting the better of him as the inexperienced head coach is running out of allies.",
      "A supposed transformative summer transfer window does not appear to have made much, if any, difference. There are the same problems at Man Utd, who are just as toothless in attack and easy to play through despite investing £230m on signings and ridding themselves of some deadwood.",
      "Amorim’s bullish insistence on sticking with his failing 3-4-3 formation continues to limit Man Utd, with his refusal to adapt, a la Ange Postecoglou, likely to be a key factor in his eventual downfall, which could be sooner than most expected.",
      "There is yet to be evidence of a Man Utd player performing better in Amorim’s formation than previous set-ups, with Kobbie Mainoo among the most high-profile victims of the head coach’s appointment.",
      "Mainoo has gone from legitimately being one of the best prospects in the world to a benchwarmer for a very poor Man Utd side, with Amorim a main contributor to the Premier League giants not seeing the best of the England international for many months.",
      "Man Utd supporters were glad that common sense prevailed in the final week of the transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Co. swiftly shut down Mainoo’s hopes of leaving on loan to secure regular game time ahead of next year’s World Cup, with his positive standing highlighted in a GiveMeSport article on the club’s midfield situation.",
      "The report claims ‘United have made a significant U-turn as internal discussions with Mainoo have resulted in him being increasingly confident that he can become a key part of Amorim’s plans’, while ‘there have been indications that they would be more keen to sell Bruno Fernandes’.",
      "Within a day of this revelation, a contrary report from Football Transfers claimed that Amorim was ‘left furious’ that Man Utd’s clear verdict on Mainoo prevented a late-window move for Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher.",
      "Would Gallagher have been a solid addition as a last resort? Yes, probably. But Amorim’s stance, both reported and public, does expose his carelessness regarding a Man Utd player with a higher ceiling than most in their current squad, who should be among the head coach’s main priorities.",
      "Amorim should be doing all he can to make Mainoo a vital component in his team, and it says a lot about the head coach’s position that club chiefs appear to have given Mainoo such a level of internal backing.",
      "Integrating Mainoo would be made easier had they cashed in on Fernandes when £100m from the Saudi Pro League was on the table in the summer, with Man Utd’s ‘willingness to sell’ (as per GiveMeSport) suggesting they already regret doing what they could to retain their club captain’s services instead of ushering him to the exit door.",
      "There’s no doubting Fernandes’ quality and he was easily Man Utd’s best player last season, but his early-season struggles from a deeper position has made it clear that the club’s decision not to maximise his value and use the profit to make the game-changing signing of a top-tier No.6 (E.g. Carlos Baleba) was a huge mistake that will hold them back for at least another year.",
      "READ NEXT: If Mainoo ‘doesn’t like’ Amorim who can blame him? Man Utd boss is clearly ‘the problem’",
      "After an incredibly depressing England admission in his press conference on Friday, Thomas Tuchel could really do with a favour from Ruben Amorim and Man Utd",
      "‘There is still plenty going on at Old Trafford’ apparently, and that includes the Manchester United news that big Benjamin Sesko has shown his ‘true colours’.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s decision on Kobbie Mainoo after he looked to leave Manchester United last month.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has every right to “not like” Ruben Amorim as the Man Utd manager is very clearly “the problem” in his case.",
      "Amorim may well look at the fate that’s befallen five of his six Manchester United predecessors this summer and think twice about resigning.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted to bring in Conor Gallagher before the transfer window shut but the Man Utd board insisted on keeping Kobbie Mainoo."

      "How good is Senne Lammens?",
      "The stats suggest the new Manchester United goalkeeper knows his way around a six-yard box. And the YouTube compilations will tell you whatever you want to be told.",
      "So the short answer: f*** knows.",
      "Unless you’re an avid watcher of the Jupiler Pro League, then you will know as little as we do. And it’s ok to admit that you’ve never seen Lammens play and that until quite recently, you had never heard of the 23-year-old.",
      "There may come a day very soon that you will long for those times of blissful ignorance. Because Lammens is set to have every catch, kick, fumble and twitch scrutinised from every angle when he assumes responsibility for the ‘hardest job in football’.",
      "When he takes his place in the Old Trafford goal, United fans just need to hope that the recruitment figures at Old Trafford have thoroughly done their homework on Lammens. And that they have finally learned how to pick a goalkeeper.",
      "United will have seen the same stats we have – and reams more – that suggest Lammens is a very good goalkeeper indeed. In the Belgian Pro League.",
      "Last season, for Royal Antwerp, he conceded 32 goals, whereas xG tells us he ought to have been beaten 44.5 times. Not accounting for two own goals – one of which was scored by Lammens himself – the numbers suggest he conceded 0.5 goals per game fewer than expected.",
      "In that metric, he is unmatched in Europe’s top five leagues. None of which he was playing in, of course. But even accounting for the level, it’s a very impressive claim.",
      "He made a few of those last season. Lammens stopped 11.2% of the crosses swung into Antwerp’s box. Only six keepers in the top five European leagues were more effective. For comparison, Andre Onana stopped 5.4% of the crosses in his vicinity – half the number Lammens managed in two more matches.",
      "The stats paint a picture of a very competent goalkeeper, a ‘strong all-rounder’ as Lammens described himself this week, and that would make a very welcome change for United fans, their nerves frayed by watching Onana shamble around their goal for two seasons. And when he was finally replaced, in came Altay Bayindir, who seemingly reached the highest level having never had to face a corner-kick before.",
      "United, hopefully – we make no assumptions of them these days – have dug a little deeper on Lammens, though. Because nothing on a spreadsheet can tell them or us how the 23-year-old will cope with the step up and the spotlight about to shine upon him.",
      "In that respect, United’s decision to opt for Lammens over Emiliano Martinez remains a surprise. Martinez, outwardly, possesses more confidence than is healthy for a functioning adult in society, but an ideal level of self-belief for an elite goalkeeper. United’s keeper concerns down the years have generally been solved by experience and the simple answer to their current problems would have been someone with Martinez’s CV and presence.",
      "No question, this is a gamble for United. Going for a much younger, inexperienced, unproven option carries huge risk for the reward of a stable presence in their nets.",
      "Even if that’s what Lammens proves to be in the long term, things will almost certainly get dicey in the meantime.",
      "David De Gea was younger and had to grow into his United shirt – literally and metaphorically – when he arrived in 2012, but Sir Alex Ferguson saw something worth persevering with during a rotten 18 months at the start of his career at Old Trafford.",
      "Would De Gea have been afforded that settling-in period in today’s climate? Very unlikely. He was fortunate to be part of a very fine team while being shielded by the sheer force of Fergie. Lammens will enjoy the benefit of neither of those things, or anything even close.",
      "When he makes mistakes – he will because all goalkeepers do; the best just keep them to an absolute minimum – Lammens will be ridiculed, mocked and written off by a wider public that never tires of rejoicing in the Red Devils’ misery.",
      "But in between the inevitable misjudgements, if he can rise above the pathetically low bar the current keepers have set, then United have to show more resolve than we suspect they possess while allowing Lammens the necessary time to develop into the keeper they apparently feel he can become.",

      "We’ve ranked the 20 best Premier League players under the age of 21, as of September 4. Trust us, it wasn’t easy.",
      "The sheer volume of young talent in the league is outrageous. At one point we considered limiting it to teenagers, but that wasn’t the plan. Still, whittling it down to just 20 has been a migraine-inducing task, and some brilliant prospects have inevitably been left out.",
      "Our first draft was ridiculous; 39 names made the cut initially. Back then, Burnley, Wolves, Leeds United, Aston Villa, and Nottingham Forest were the only clubs without a representative. By the time we trimmed the list down, Bournemouth, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Sunderland joined them among the Premier League’s youth-neglecting b**tards.",
      "Since we dropped nearly as many players as we kept, we’ll throw in honourable mentions right up until first place (in no particular order). Just to give ourselves extra work. But everything we do, we do it for you.",
      "It’s tough to avoid a so-called ‘Big Six’ bias with lists like this. The best teams usually have the best players: young, prime, or old. That doesn’t mean every talented youngster starts at a big club, but the food chain tends to funnel them there sooner or later.",
      "This is a combination of the best players ranked in terms of ability, but it’s also a bit of a ‘players to watch’ feature. Talent-wise, you might argue that Rio Ngumoha and Max Dowman are shoo-ins, but we’re not convinced they’ll actually start a league game in 2025/26. There’s no need for those two to be added as honourable mentions then. Lovely.",
      "",
      "Signed from Slavia Prague for £19million this summer, Diouf has played every minute for West Ham so far this season. He’s registered an assist in each of his last two appearances, helping the Hammers earn their first win of 2025/26 at Nottingham Forest on matchday three.",
      "Honourable mention: Oliver Scarles (West Ham United)",
      "",
      "From one wing-back to another, we’ve seen Diouf play in a back four already, but every time Dorgu has started for United, it’s been in Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. After costing around £25m, there are high expectations for the 20-year-old. We’re yet to be convinced, but he does seem well-suited to the wing-back role. It’s hard to judge any player while playing in Amorim’s dysfunctional system, to be fair.",
      "Honourable mention: Chido Obi (Manchester United)",
      "",
      "Brighton completed the signing of Tzimas in February, allowing the striker to stay at FC Nuremberg in Bundesliga 2 for the rest of 2024/25. He scored 12 goals in 24 league appearances last term and made a significant impact on his Albion debut, registering two goals and one assist in 24 minutes off the bench at Oxford United in a 6-0 Carabao Cup second round win.",
      "Honourable mention: Charalampos Kostoulas (Brighton & Hove Albion)",
      "",
      "Injuries curtailed Odobert’s debut season in north London, but he’s come off the bench in three out of three league games this term. The Frenchman is an exciting winger, as shown in his first few appearances under Ange Postecoglou. After improving Kevin Schade’s game at Brentford, you’d back Thomas Frank to get Odobert flying. Not literally, obviously.",
      "Honourable mention: Ben Gannon Doak (AFC Bournemouth)",
      "MORE FEATURES ON F365\n👉 Why the five post-Fergie Man Utd managers before Amorim were sacked\n👉 Are we seeing the return of the big man up top? Giants incoming this summer…\n👉 Chiesa has Liverpool fans, a goal and Rio Ngumoha to blame for second huge mistake",

      "A record spend was made by Premier League clubs this summer, yet many still have maddeningly-obvious holes in their squad.",
      "Manchester United may or may not have filled the one in their goal with the signing of Senne Lammens. Since the vast majority of us know next to nothing of the young goalkeeper bought from Royal Antwerp, only time will tell. Just as likely as Lammens being the competent stopper United need is the prospect of him being eaten alive while jumping from comparative obscurity into the hardest position in football right now.",
      "United moved at glacial pace to recruit in one of the positions that anyone with functioning eyes could see they had to. In the other, the Red Devils had a sniff and thought they can make do.",
      "Apparently, United believe they have ‘strong and versatile’ options to play in Ruben Amorim’s midfield. We doubt the manager agrees with whoever watched United over the last year before reaching that conclusion.",
      "There is not so much a hole in Amorim’s engine room as an asteroid-sized crater. One that could ultimately cost Amorim his job if European qualification really is a non-negotiable target this season.",
      "If United and Amorim fall short, then the manager’s dogmatic belief in his one and only system looks likely to be the primary reason. And without a deep-lying midfielder who can destroy and dictate, Amorim is almost being set up to fail.",
      "That they were so keen on Carlos Baleba suggests there are important people at United who haven’t missed the bleeding obvious. Brighton’s valuation made United cower so far into submission that they appeared scared to consider the possibility that Baleba might not be the only No.6 on earth.",
      "Already, with the window still shaking from being SLAMMED SHUT, there is talk of renewed interest in Baleba and other midfielders next summer. Have United missed their best opportunity to land Baleba? If he shows the form he’s widely thought to be capable of this season, Brighton will be looking for another record fee, by which time the £100million they wanted last month will seem cheap. And United might not have the free run they could have enjoyed this summer.",
      "Regardless, Amorim cannot afford to think so far ahead. Right now, he appears to be living game-to-game, even if the United hierarchy are said to have no plans – yet – to rip up their latest plan. Though if he goes, it is just as likely that it won’t be the club’s decision.",
      "With United’s forward line completely and expensively remodelled and a goalkeeper who isn’t Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir, Amorim’s overwhelming priority now is to make do and mend his midfield hole.",
      "The chasm lies next to Bruno Fernandes. The captain’s suitability to a central midfield role is a debate for another time, but his more permanent shift into a deeper position makes it more imperative that any partner has legs.",
      "Casemiro had legs for days; pins among the best in Europe. But those days have passed.",
      "Amorim, probably correctly, says Kobbie Mainoo is an alternative to Fernandes, not a foil.",
      "Which leaves one possible option: Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Ugarte was bought last summer for this exact job. United sacrificed Scott McTominay to add some Uruguayan bite into Erik ten Hag’s midfield. A year on, Ten Hag has been sacked twice; McTominay is the King of Naples; and Ugarte looks further than ever from filling his brief.",
      "We should make allowances for any midfielder coming into the hustle and bustle of the Premier League from Ligue 1 and, prior to that, the Portuguese league. Ugarte was 23 when United paid £42million up front to pluck him from PSG – perhaps their gratitude ought to have raised our suspicions – and there is a long list of stars who took time to adjust before ultimately thriving in Our League.",
      "If United did not see their midfield as a priority this summer, increased expectations of Ugarte must have prompted that judgement. Which makes his start to the season all the more concerning.",
      "Overlooked for Casemiro, Ugarte came off the bench midway through the second halves of the defeat to Arsenal and draw at Fulham. Not coincidentally just as whatever control United had gained in either game began to slip.",
      "He started in the Carabao Cup. Ugarte certainly wasn’t alone in stinking out Grimsby but he was one of three hooked at half-time while Amorim’s patience dangled by a thinning thread. Struggling to keep up with the pace in your first season in the Premier League is understandable. Being miles off it against League Two opposition is infinitely more damning.",
      "So poor were those 91 combined minutes that hopes for Ugarte being the answer to Amorim’s problems are slimmer than ever. Which is even more peculiar when you consider that no United player should be more familiar with the manager’s expectations.",
      "Ugarte thrived under Amorim as a Sporting player. His form through two seasons – 61 starts in 85 appearances – earned the midfielder his £50million move to PSG. When Amorim took over from Ten Hag, Ugarte was expected to gain more than most.",
      "Instead, Ugarte is going under. Amorim hinted in pre-season at Ugarte’s struggles with confidence and ‘off the pitch’ matters that may be hampering his efforts to establish himself in United’s midfield. The manager wasn’t telling anyone what we had not already assumed from the sight of opponents running off the back of Ugarte and some questionable decision making on the ball.",
      "In many ways, Ugarte’s struggle is a symbol of the wider sentiment around United. The feeling most prominent in the manager’s mind, if not resignation, is hope rather than expectation. But if Ugarte is ever to emerge from whatever slump he has fallen in to, it has to happen now.",
      "It’s been a long old week of net spend chat and ‘This Means More’ self-love so we have banned net spend from this Mailbox.",
      "Konsa knows Aston Villa have been hampered by The Rules but doesn’t know why or which rules have thwarted them. No wonder the fans think there’s a conspiracy.",
      "Daniel Levy is no more but what does this new dawn mean for Tottenham? Here are five reasons we should be afraid, very afraid.",
      "The summer transfer window is now shut, but how closely were you paying attention? We have 20 testers on every Premier League club’s summer business…",
      "‘There is still plenty going on at Old Trafford’ apparently, and that includes the Manchester United news that big Benjamin Sesko has shown his ‘true colours’.",
      "According to reports, Daniel Levy has an excuse for the main reason behind his exit from Tottenham Hotspur amid a ‘deliberate move’ by the club’s owners."

      "As is always the case, three weeks into the new Premier League campaign, many of us are considering a career switch as we reflect on our pre-season predictions.",
      "Florian Wirtz as PFA Player of the Year? Sunderland going down? Idiots.",
      "It remains a cause of great frustration for us soothsayers that the transfer window remains open after the start of the season and believe it shutting on Monday merits another bash at those predictions.",
      "",
      "Liverpool winning three games from three having played well for roughly 30 minutes across those victories over their greatest title challengers Arsenal, a raging Newcastle and a Bournemouth side that’s won both games besides without conceding a goal puts them way out in front as title favourites, if they weren’t already, as they will play well at some point, with the small matter of a new £130m striker to aid them in that quest.",
      "",
      "Wouldn’t it be neat if the top four after three games was the top four at the end of the season, and d’you know what? We think it just might be. Chelsea have had favourable fixtures but have added a bit of The Arsenal to their armoury, while The Arsenal arguably now have too much of The Arsenal for even Eberechi Eze to balance out, so they’re coming third.",
      "And while Manchester City’s opening day thumping of Wolves led to knee-jerk claims that they were Back, two defeats in two since, including one with Rodri at the base of their midfield, suggests they’re still more than a bit 2024/2025. Tottenham meanwhile have hired a very good manager and had a perfectly serviceable transfer window, in the end.",
      "",
      "We’re far from convinced that the signing of striker Tolu Arokodare from Genk will move the needle enough for pointless Wolves, who also kept hold of Jorgen Strand Larsen, but we can’t see much of a creative spark anywhere. West Ham confused us greatly with that win over Nottingham Forest and will probably have enough anyway. Burnley and Leeds to join Wolves.",
      "",
      "Kudos to Joe Williams for picking Sunderland as the pleasant surprise before they picked up as many wins (2) in their first three Premier League games as Southampton managed in the whole of last season.",
      "And with their newfound status as a Premier League stalwart they signed Manchester United-linked Brian Brobbey and former Chelsea winger Bertrand Traore from Ajax on deadline day, while Arsenal-linked Lutsharel Geertruida joined on loan from RB Leipzig. That’s big boy sh*t, yeah.",
      "",
      "Nick Wolte… nah. That would be f***ing brilliant though, wouldn’t it? Him and Yoane Wissa do have a very good chance of beating the tally of the strikers they’ve replaced (23: Alexander Isak – 23; Callum Wilson – 0) but we’re not convinced either will a) play enough to win it or b) be prolific enough get anywhere close to matching Erling Haaland, who will presumably bumble his way to 30-odd to come out on top after three in his first three games.",
      "Isak arguably had a better chance of winning it by staying at Newcastle, as he’s set to share the goalscoring load with Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike after his excellent start to the season. Regretting it already, we imagine.",

      "There were three Joao Pedro calls before the season started and he’s already got two goals and two assists. Chelsea’s best player being a striker is very, very strange.",

      "Plenty went for Viktor Gyokeres and after one very good game and two in which he did next to nothing he may not prove to be Arsenal’s all-conquering solution, but also doesn’t look as though he will stink the place out. Benjamin Sesko, however.",
      "Four off-target shots in 80 minutes of Premier League football off the bench following a £66m move to solve Ruben Amorim’s goalscoring woes probably isn’t exactly what he had in mind, and he did himself no favours by stepping up tenth in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town having put a stoppage-time chance over the bar from roughly four yards out to ensure the game went that far.",
      "",
      "Jack bloody Grealish. We can’t not count loan moves in this after four assists in two-and-a-bit games. Not sure we’ve ever been more pleased for a footballer ever.",

      "Florian Wirtz looks more likely to be in a different category and it’s not biggest bloody bargain. Cole Palmer’s not really played. F*** knows. A Liverpool player probably. Virgil van Dijk.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo will be lucky to survive the international break, if indeed he wants to keep his job and we really don’t think he does.",
      "His relationship with transfer guru Edu looks to be beyond mending and we can’t imagine owner Evangelos Marinakis is overly thrilled by Nuno leaving their club-record signing out of his 25-man Europa League squad having bankrolled their biggest transfer window in history and the sixth-biggest in world football this summer.",
      "It feels as though he’s putting nails in his own coffin.",
      "",
      "Arsenal have been handed a favourable Champions League draw, which matters in so much as Mikel Arteta can rest and rotate players rather than it making any real difference to the knockout stages, they’ve now got a very deep squad and may be boosted in their bid to go all the way in Europe when the Premier League becomes a near impossibility in the new year.",
      "",

      "Man Utd “could live to regret” their decision to sign Senne Lammens over Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, according to ESPN journalist Mark Ogden.",
      "The Red Devils mainly strengthened their attack in the summer transfer window with around £200m spent on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "They did bring in a new goalkeeper on deadline day with Lammens signing from Royal Antwerp for a fee of £18.2m after deciding to go for the Belgian rather than Martinez.",
      "There had been reports that Man Utd were ‘leaning towards’ a deal for Aston Villa keeper Martinez before deciding last minute to concentrate their efforts on Lammens.",
      "A report on Wednesday claimed that Sunderland and Leeds had both looked at Lammens earlier in the transfer window and decided to pull out of deals as the goalkeeper ‘did not convince other top-flight clubs when they assessed him’.",
      "And Ogden reckons their decision to not pursue the Argentina international over Lammens could come back to bite them this season.",
      "READ: Why the five post-Fergie Man Utd managers before Amorim were sacked",
      "Ogden told ESPN: “They were playing a strange game with the goalkeepers. It looked like Emi Martinez was on his way to Man United, but they preferred Lammens.",
      "“I’m kind of surprised by that because, for me, Martinez is what they need right now. They need someone with a strength of character, personality, and world-class ability to sort out the defence and add confidence.",
      "“They believe that Lammens is the better bet, and that the cost of getting Martinez on a short-term loan was too high in terms of wages, so they went with Lammens. I think they could live to regret that.”",
      "Altay Bayindir has been starting ahead of Andre Onana, who could still leave in the next week, this season with the latter only playing in their League Cup defeat to Grimsby Town on penalties.",
      "It is unclear whether Lammens will come in to be No.1 or start behind Bayindir but the Belgian is excited about his move to Man Utd.",
      "Lammens told MUTV: “This is my dream move. When I was five, United was at the height of football and you keep in your memory how big Manchester United is, so, when I heard they were interested, it was like a childhood dream.",
      "“I remember being a kid, Manchester United winning the Champions League and winning the league, and also [I want] to help the team get to a level that you can compete for a title again and to play Champions League again. That’s also one of my biggest points, that I want to grow with the team and go up to the heights that used to be Manchester United.",
      "“It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and the Premier League is the biggest competition in the world.",
      "“In my team in Antwerp, there were some players who were also in England and, when I talked to them about Manchester United, you could directly see their face change. The club alone, the aura of the club, it’s massive, and being here today, seeing it, it’s a different level.",
      "“It’s crazy. So, that was also a big part of why I chose Manchester United. I’m very happy that we could get it done today.”",
      "Man Utd have been told by Ben Foster that they made a “panic buy” on the deadline day when they brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Aston Villa will reintegrate their £150,000-a-week goalkeeper after he unsuccessfully pursued a move to Premier League rivals Manchester United.",
      "It has been claimed that Chelsea could ‘almost immediately agree’ a mega-money transfer after signing Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United.",
      "Man Utd hope Senne Lammens will reward them by becoming their long-term No.1. In the meantime, the Red Devils must accept the risk of choosing potential over proven…",
      "Premier League rivals Leeds and Sunderland chose to reject the signing of new Man Utd goalkeeper Senne Lammens in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd appear to have three second-choice keepers and no first-choice, while Liverpool and Spurs have gambled on their first-choice defence staying fit."

      "Thursday 4 September 2025 08:37, UK",
      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on Deadline day.",
      "There were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 18:08, UK",
      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",
      "Dublin's iconic Croke Park will welcome the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings on Sunday September 28, before the latter stick around to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham the next week.",
      "The Denver Broncos then take on the New York Jets at Tottenham followed by the Los Angeles Rams against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley, before the Indianapolis Colts host the Atlanta Falcons at the Olympiastadion and the Washington Commanders meet the Miami Dolphins at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.",
      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles return as defending Super Bowl champions after dethroning the Kansas City Chiefs in a 40-22 victory in New Orleans in February, denying Andy Reid's side a third straight championship.",
      "Josh Allen's Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens resume their pursuit of a Super Bowl berth in the face of Kansas City's monopoly on the AFC, while Jayden Daniels leads a new era for the Washington Commanders. The Detroit Lions loom as one of the league's most prolific offenses as the Minnesota Vikings seek to maximise a Championship-calibre roster, while Micah Parsons prepares to alter the NFC entirely after his blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers.",
      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""

      "Premier League clubs spent a record £3.19bn in the summer window; Liverpool and Chelsea broke spending and selling records; clubs targeted Premier League-ready signings; Sunderland had a net spend twice as high as European champions Paris Saint-Germain",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "Manchester United finally offloaded most of their 'bomb squad' as Antony completed a permanent move to Real Betis, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho joined Napoli and Aston Villa on loan respectively.",
      "The club had begun Transfer Deadline Day with Antony, Hojlund, Sancho and Tyrell Malacia exiled from Ruben Amorim's squad - with only the latter remaining at Old Trafford until January at least.",
      "Antony's return to Betis ended a summer of speculation over whether he would end up back in LaLiga, having spent the second half of last season at the club and racking up seven goal contributions in 17 games.",
      "He joined them for £21.7m, a loss of £64m from when Man Utd paid Ajax £86m for him in 2022.",
      "Jadon Sancho, who had been a target for Roma, joined Villa as one of a number of late additions to Unai Emery's squad, with Rasmus Hojlund making a temporary move, which could become permanent, to Napoli, who have been seeking further striking reinforcements all summer.",

      "Lammens joined from Royal Antwerp on a five-year deal for a fee of around £18.2m, including add-ons. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez had been discussed, but it was decided internally that Lammens was a better option.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10 respectively and it is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for any of Man Utd's other 'keepers, it would be considered.",
      "Antony had made no secret of his desire to avoid returning to Old Trafford at the end of last season, including a tearful interview while on loan at Betis where he said he had fallen out of love with football at United.",
      "In the end, he got his wish - but he had to wait right up to the end of the transfer window for it to happen. He leaves Old Trafford having played 62 Premier League games across three seasons, but contributed just eight goals and assists.",
      "He arrived at the club in 2022 as one of the major signings of the summer, following former boss Erik ten Hag from Ajax, but never managed to recreate his Eredivisie form for United.",
      "A number of clubs had been interested in bringing in Sancho this summer, including Chelsea, where he spent last season on loan and featured heavily in their run to the Conference League title. But, having failed to agree terms with the Blues, he returned to Old Trafford - and they paid a £5m fine as per the terms of his loan.",

      "Hojlund had impressed in pre-season and looked like he may end up as Man Utd's starting striker for a second season in succession, especially after expressing his wish to remain at Old Trafford - and Ruben Amorim's positive words about him.",

      "Manchester United have completed a £18.2m deal to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens; the Belgian shot stopper is now one of four goalkeepers at Man Utd, though they could sell any of the other goalkeepers to Saudi Arabia or Turkey as their windows close later",
      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed the Deadline Day signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "United have agreed a deal for the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper for around £18.2m plus add-ons.",
      "The club looked at other options, including Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, but after much deliberation and negotiation, they feel Lammens is the right choice for the club moving forward.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper impressed United. No 'keeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United will move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Altay Bayindir, Andre Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10, respectively.",
      "It is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for their other goalkeepers, it would be considered.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim had previously said he was happy with his goalkeeping department, despite several high-profile errors from Onana and Bayindir across the early stages of the season.",
      "Lammens is now the fifth signing of the summer for Amorim, taking their summer spend to £232m, following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The keeper was signed two years ago from Club Brugge and the sale represents nearly 100 per cent profit for the Belgian club.",
      "He made 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League last season for Antwerp, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "Speaking on the club's official channels after signing, Lammens said:",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben [Amorim] and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, added: \"Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential.",
      "\"We are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.\"",
      "\"Manchester United have signed Senne Lammens with an eye to the now as well as the future.",
      "\"The 23-year-old keeper, tipped to be Thibaut Courtois' successor in the Belgium national side, is seen as the best solution to strengthen an underperforming goalkeeping department after a shaky start to the season by the likes of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "\"It's no secret they looked at other options, such as tried and tested Emiliano Martinez at Aston Villa, but with all factors considered, United felt Lammens was the direction they wanted to go in.",
      "\"Although Lammens has limited experience - only one season as a first-choice No 1 at Royal Antwerp, United are confident in Lammens' potential to compete immediately as well as having room to grow with a side that has the ultimate aim to win the Premier League title in three years time.\"",
      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",
      "\"An interesting thing is that when Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, they were tracking him then. So there's obviously been a like there for quite some time.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
      "\"It's not about never making mistakes - it's about how you recover from them, your body language, and whether you look authoritative. [Onana and Bayindir] don't fill that role.\""

      "Isak was the most expensive signing of the window at a British-record £125m, followed by Florian Wirtz at £116.5m, while Hugo Ekitike (£79m, Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool), Benjamin Sesko (£73.7m, RB Leipzig to Man Utd), and Bryan Mbeumo (£71m, Brentford to Man Utd) also made big-money moves.Adam Smith",
      "It seemed top-level football's evolution was leaving the traditional striker behind as recently as a few years ago. This summer's transfer window underlines how quickly the game can change. Reports of the death of the No 9 have been greatly exaggerated.",
      "In a record-breaking summer, spending by Premier League clubs on forwards vastly outweighed other positions. The rush to add firepower was led by the elite clubs. Manchester City were the only member of the so-called big six not to sign a striker having started the resurgence with Erling Haaland.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £200m on Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. Chelsea invested £90m in Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. Arsenal and Manchester United went for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko at £63.5m and £73.7m respectively. Spurs struck a late loan deal to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Newcastle finally sanctioned the departure of Isak to Liverpool as they completed the £55m signing of Yoane Wissa from Brentford having already brought in Nick Woltemade for £69m from Stuttgart.",
      "Further down the league, Wolves kept Jorgen Strand Larsen and added another target man in Tolu Arokodare from Genk for £23.4m. Brighton spent £31.4m on Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos, while Nottingham Forest and Everton spent similar sums on Arnaud Kalimeundo and Thierno Barry.",
      "The No 9 is back in fashion.Nick Wright",
      "It was the summer of striker statements, Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both speaking out - one of them in the hope of leaving Newcastle United and the other in the hope of joining. Ultimately, both got their wish, reminding us all that player power still exists.",
      "\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way,\" announced Wissa of Brentford's stance. \"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship cannot continue,\" argued Isak. Newcastle were quick to respond that no promise had ever been made.",
      "There are those who would gladly have refused Isak his move to Liverpool and allowed the Swede to sit out his contract, effectively putting his career on hold. The logic goes that this would have sent out a strong message that Newcastle could not be bullied.",
      "Given the vast resources of the Saudi owners, this would have been an option. But profit and sustainability rules mean that while they could afford it, they could not afford to have their budgets slashed, damaging the ability of the club to compete as it might.",
      "And so, player power endures. With that in mind, spare a thought for Jorgen Strand Larsen, the Wolves striker wanted by Newcastle who was not able to get his move. \"I know him very well,\" said Vitor Pereira, the Wolves boss. \"He will never force [a move].\"",
      "The result is that while Strand Larsen faces what looks likely to be a relegation battle, Wissa is preparing to take on Barcelona in the Champions League. The actions of those players who withhold their labour might be distasteful. But they can certainly pay off.Adam Bate",
      "The Premier League clubs outside the traditional top six recognise they are unable to compete with the financial power of those in it. They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.",
      "Brentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.",
      "So-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.",
      "Bournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.",
      "Brighton sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, Crystal Palace let Eberechi Eze go to Arsenal for £67.5m and Wolves made £95.8m selling Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.",
      "The buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.",
