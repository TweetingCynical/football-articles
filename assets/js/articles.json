      "Ruben Amorim has already analysed where Manchester United must improve ahead of their impending return to Premier League football. Currently on a five-match unbeaten streak, United host Everton on Monday with a win potentially placing them in the Champions League places.",
      "With a feel-good atmosphere surrounding Old Trafford for the first time since the Portuguese manager's arrival last November, he publicly revealed the issue that he must solve in order to prolong their positive run.",
      "Andre Onana has played just one game for United this season - their shock loss to Grimsby Town - before joining Trabzonspor on loan in September. With Senne Lammens impressing between the sticks, former United favourite Gordon Strachan believes the Cameroonian's Old Trafford career is all but over.",
      "The Scotsman told Esports News: \"I think Andre Onana has played his last game for Manchester United. At United you must have a presence in goal - whether it’s physical, attitude, or character, you have to be a presence. I don’t think he had that when he played for the club.",
      "\"A big problem for me is that I'm not sure Onana really wanted to be at Old Trafford. He looked like he’d rather be somewhere else and that might be what he needs to start enjoying his football again.",
      "\"At no point did I think he was enjoying playing football for United. I'd be shocked if I saw him play again for the club. I think his United career is over in that respect.\"",
      "Despite being on his longest unbeaten run since arriving in Manchester last year, Amorim still has a bone to pick with his team. A vibrant first half performance followed by an insipid showing in the next 45 minutes has been something of a theme for the Red Devils.",
      "Topsy-turvy games against Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur has led Amorim to believe his squad's mindset must improve when they are leading matches. After being asked why the drop-off in games exists, he told the Premier League: \"I think we lose intensity.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.",
      "\"I think when we are in advantage, we lose that thing of wanting to continue to press in the same way. We had that against Brighton until we suffered the first goal. So it’s a lot of things together.",
      "\"We think about 'let’s not suffer a goal' and our mindset should be 'we have one goal, we must get another and have the opportunity to kill the game'. So it is mental but it is also physical, we need to improve in that aspect also.\"",
      "Nearing a year since his last Manchester United appearance, Marcus Rashford has looked like the player of old this season at Barcelona. With 15 goals and assists in 16 games across all competitions, the 28-year-old's form has seen him return to international duty with England.",
      "The forward racked up two more appearances for the Three Lions during the break, and it was Rashford who impressed Eberechi Eze the most as the Arsenal star revealed just how talented his compatriot is.",
      "During his appearance on the Beast Mode On podcast, Eze said: \"I’ve always known he’s a good player, but for that first camp, I remember going away like, ‘okay, this guy’s part of some other stuff.’",
      "\"The way he strikes the ball. The way he’s running with the ball, how he operates is. He’s an incredible, incredible player. And so, nah, I’ll be honest, I enjoy watching him.\"",

      "The Premier League could introduce significant changes to the financial structure of the division during the latest shareholder meeting, with representatives from all 20 clubs set to vote on three key proposals on Friday. It has been 10 years since the league introduced financial measures, with the most recent model, profit and sustainability (PSR), drawing plenty of criticism.",
      "The current system allows Premier League clubs to make losses of up to £105million over a three-year period, though some clubs have found ways to get around this system. Others have been punished, such as Nottingham Forest's points deduction in 2024 or Everton's points deduction back in 2023.",
      "As a result, three new proposals have been made that could dramatically change the landscape of the Premier League, depending on how each club votes. The proposals made are called top-to-bottom anchoring (or merely anchoring for short), squad cost rules (SCR), and sustainability and system resilience (SSR).",
      "SCR is a system already in place for UEFA competitions, where a percentage of revenue can be spent on player expenses, while SSR is a rule in place to ensure that short-term and long-term financial commitments can be met. Anchoring is the final and most controversial of the bunch, however.",
      "Anchoring places a limit on how much a club can spend on wages - and amortisation from transfer fees - which is set based on the poorest club in the division. The amount is then five times how much is distributed to the poorest club in the division, putting a cap on the spending of all 20 clubs with the same limit.",
      "It essentially puts a wage cap of sorts on the division, only allowing for it to grow with the revenue gained by the Premier League as a whole. That has been met with support and scrutiny across the board, with potential for legal battles to take place if it is pushed through.",
      "Fourteen of the 20 clubs would need to vote in favour of these measures for them to go through, with some big decisions to be made on how it impacts each member and their own position. For that reason, there could well be some conflict as to whether anchoring in particular will be pushed through.",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are thought to be against the proposal, with The Athletic reporting that Arsenal are also expected to vote against anchoring, but could vote for SCR if the prior proposal is voted down. The report adds that champions Liverpool, Aston Villa, Everton, Sunderland and Burnley are expected to give their support to all three proposals.",
      "The main argument from the bigger clubs in the division against anchoring is that it is an additional measure that caps their spending, on top of potential squad cost rules that they already adhere to in UEFA competitions. Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe made his view clear when speaking to Bloomberg about the proposals back in 2024.",
      "He said: \"(Anchoring) would inhibit the top clubs in the Premier League, and the last thing you want is for the top clubs in the Premier League not to be able to compete with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, PSG - that's absurd. And if it does, it then ceases to be the finest league in the world.\"",
      "The Times reported that as many as eight Premier League clubs hold reservations over a change in the financial rules at Friday's shareholder meeting. With eight teams already expected to vote a certain way on anchoring, that leaves another 12 up in the air heading into the meeting.",
      "On the other side, SCR could impact the likes of Brentford, Bournemouth, and Crystal Palace due to their current method of utilising the transfer market to generate revenue, which could hint at their viewpoint on the proposal, though it's unclear exactly how they will vote on all three, including the controversial anchoring proposal.",
      "It's just the latest challenge for the Premier League in dealing with the vast wealth it has generated from becoming one of the most-watched leagues in the world. Now it's put to the clubs as to which way they will go with the latest proposals.",
      "Friday's vote may bring clarity on the future of English football and the direction the top flight is going in, but it may also create further confusion over what is next.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ex-PSV Eindhoven midfielder Ibrahim Sangare had to be persuaded to return to the club's training ground after learning that boss Ruud van Nistelrooy had quit his position. The Manchester United legend took the reins at the Dutch outfit between July 2022 and May 2023.",
      "During that period, he guided them to a runners-up spot in the Eredivisie, while the side also claimed the Dutch Cup. Despite the triumph, the one-time Man Utd and Netherlands striker left his position after just one campaign following a disagreement with higher-ups at the club.",
      "While that decision, reportedly, pleased some members if the squad, others weren't quite so happy. Speaking immediately after van Nistelrooy's departure, ESPN journalist Milan von Dongen revealed Sangare's remarkable response.",
      "He said: \"They had to get him out of there to get him back. He was furious about van Nistelrooy's departure. So there will also be talk within the group of players.\"",
      "Shortly after, Sangare secured a transfer away from PSV. The Ivory Coast midfielder was sold to Premier League outfit Nottingham Forest. He's still a member of the Forest squad - and scored his first goal for the club in the 3-1 win over Leeds United before November's international break.",
      "Just over a year after departing PSV himself, van Nistelrooy returned to a coaching position with United, where he became Erik ten Hag's assistant. The dismissal of Ten Hag just over three months later resulted in the former striker overseeing four United fixtures on a temporary basis.",
      "United remained undefeated in those four encounters; grabbing wins against Leicester City (x2) and PAOK, and drawing with Chelsea. Despite that, Ruben Amorim chose not to retain van Nistelrooy within his backroom team, with him departing the club after the Portuguese manager's arrival.",
      "Van Nistelrooy didn't remain unemployed for long, taking charge at Leicester City just weeks afterwards. He was given the mission of keeping the club in the Premier League.",
      "But, in his 27 games at the helm, the Foxes secured just five victories and three draws. They finished the campaign in 18th place in the standings, with the Dutchman dismissed this summer.",
      "Following his exit, striker Odsonne Edouard - who was on loan with Leicester from Crystal Palace - criticised van Nistelrooy. The Frenchman failed to make any appearances under him.",
      "Speaking with L'Equipe, Edouard said: \"Being a great striker doesn't necessarily mean being a great coach. At the beginning, I played a little [under Steve Cooper], then things didn't work out with Ruud van Nistelrooy. I didn't get along well with van Nistelrooy. I found myself blocked for seven months without playing.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy has remained without a club since departing Leicester. He was linked with the FC Twente position back in September, but that role has since been taken up by John van den Brom.",

      "Alan Shearer has downplayed the pitential impact of Benjamin Sesko's injury on Manchester United's Premier League campaign. The Slovenia striker - who was signed from RB Leipzig for a hefty £74million this summer - suffered a knee injury during United's 2-2 draw against Tottenham ahead of the November international break.",
      "As a result, the 22-year-old missed Slovenia's final two World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Sweden. It's also estimated that he could be side-lined for up to a month.",
      "Despite United's loss of their big-money signing, Newcastle icon Shearer doesn't believe that United manager Ruben Amorim will be overly troubled. Speaking via Betfair, Shearer said: \"Benjamin Sesko's injury won't impact Man Utd too much.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has already shown that, if you're not up to it, he won't play you. He's already made enough big decisions not to be phased by what the outside noise is.",
      "\"I don't suspect that bothers him at all. He'd love Sesko to be fit, come off the bench and have an impact, but he won't have that option.\"",
      "Sesko was one of several high-profile signings at Old Trafford this summer, as Amorim attempted to revamp the squad that he inherited from Erik ten Hag last November. Other notable arrivals include Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "And Shearer also reckons Amorim is well-equipped in terms of squad depth to continue to thrive in the Premier League. He added: \"Given how well the likes of Cunha and Mbuemo have been [doing] since joining, it's not as if Sesko's injury is a disaster. Results are improving at Man Utd.\"",
      "Following a disappointing 15th-place finish in the top-flight standings last season, the United hierarchy would have expected enhanced displays from Amorim and his players after granting him substantial transfer funds this summer, alongside a complete pre-season tour to refine his squad.",
      "Additionally, they remain undefeated across their last five matches, due to their triumphs over Sunderland, rivals Liverpool and Brighton, plus stalemates with Nottingham Forest and Spurs. Supporters will anticipate their team picking up where they left off earlier this month, too, when Premier League football returns for the Red Devils on Monday evening.",
      "United play host to a rejuvenated Everton outfit under David Moyes' guidance at Old Trafford next week. The club then travel to face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday, November 30, before a frantic fixture list commences in the run-up to the New Year.",
      "In the coming weeks, United will be hitting the road to play against Wolves and Aston Villa in the Midlands - as well as hosting West Ham United and AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford. They also have a Boxing Day showdown with Newcastle United to look toward.",

      "Manchester United are set for crunch talks with the FA to ensure that their new £2billion stadium will host the 2035 Women's World Cup final instead of Wembley. The Red Devils unveiled plans to build a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium earlier this year, part of a wider redevelopment project in the local area.",
      "As well as giving United's first-team a new home, having played at Old Trafford since 1910, they want the arena to host major events both inside and outside of football. One showpiece that has been targeted is the Women's World Cup final in 10 years' time.",
      "Next year, it's expected that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be confirmed as joint hosts of the tournament. When England hosted the Women's European Championship in 2022, the final was played at Wembley, as the Lionesses beat Germany 2-1.",
      "Should United get their way, however, the 2035 final will be take place in Manchester. The Daily Mail report that club chiefs are now ramping up their lobbying efforts amid concerns that Wembley could get the nod once again, with the stadium also hosting the 2028 men's Euro final.",
      "United's view is understood to be that, by 2035, a new Old Trafford would be better-suited to hosting a major event than Wembley, while they argue that not every final should be played in London. These are arguments that United, who declined to comment, will reportedly put to both FIFA and the FA during talks.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has, on multiple occasions, made clear his desire for the club's new stadium to serve as the 'Wembley of the North'. \"There's a very good case, in my view, for having a stadium of the North, which would serve the northern part of the country in that arena of football,\" Ratcliffe told Sky News in 2024.",
      "\"If you look at the number of Champions League the North West has won, it's 10. London has won two. And yet everybody from the North has to get down to London to watch a big football match. And there should be one [a large stadium] in the North, in my view.",
      "\"But it's also important for the southern side of Manchester, you know, to regenerate. It's the sort of second capital of the country where the Industrial Revolution began. But if you have a regeneration project, you need a nucleus or a regeneration project and having that world-class stadium there, I think would provide the impetus to regenerate that region.\"",
      "United's Chief Operating Officer, Collette Roche, also confirmed the club's ambition to host matches at the 2035 tournament after Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham announced the region's 'Growth Plan'. The project includes 15,000 homes and redeveloping Old Trafford.",
      "\"We are delighted to see the Old Trafford Regeneration project at the heart of Greater Manchester's wider growth plan for the next decade,\" Roche said. \"We want to build the world’s best football stadium as a new home for Manchester United and a venue fit for the biggest international events, including the 2035 FIFA Women's World Cup, surrounded by a vibrant business, leisure and residential district served by excellent transport links.",
      "\"We are determined to play our part, together with other stakeholders, in making this vision a reality, and unlocking the huge benefits it can deliver for the surrounding community and wider region.\"",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford was notably absent from Barcelona's training session on Thursday, despite his Manchester United team-mates returning from international duty to gear up for Saturday's showdown with Athletic Club.",

      "It seems that Rashford's absence is not cause for alarm, with the on-loan United star still expected to feature this weekend in La Liga. Barcelona are gearing up to take on Athletic Club at Camp Nou this Saturday, aiming to close the three-point gap currently held by Xabi Alonso's Real Madrid at the top of the La Liga table.",
      "Rashford's dream of playing at Barcelona's iconic home ground is set to come true this weekend. The club has been unable to host matches at Camp Nou since 2023 due to a whopping £1.3billion refurbishment, instead playing their home games at the Lluis Company's Olympic Stadium.",
      "However, this weekend marks a change as Flick's side return to their newly revamped stadium. The club announced that they've been granted a license to return, with over 45,000 fans expected to witness the action.",
      "A statement read: \"FC Barcelona informs that the match corresponding to matchday 13 of the League, against Athletic Club, scheduled for Saturday, November 22 at 16:15 hours, will finally be played at Spotify Camp Nou.",
      "\"This decision comes after obtaining the first occupancy license corresponding to Phase 1B, which allows increasing the capacity up to 45,401 spectators. This authorization includes the entire Lateral area and adds to the license already granted for Phase 1A, which covers the Tribune and South Goal.",

      "Manchester United reportedly believe that Harry Amass and Radek Vitek could become valuable members of Ruben Amorim’s squad next season. The two youngsters are currently away from United on loan in the Championship, but their progress is being keenly monitored.",
      "Left-back Amass is playing regularly for Sheffield Wednesday, while goalkeeper Vitek is getting game time for Bristol City. Amass has seven first-team appearances to his name with United, while Vitek is yet to make his debut.",
      "United have already decided that they are happy to leave Amass with Wednesday until the end of the season. He has started all 11 of their matches since joining the crisis-hit club on deadline day and there is no rush to recall the England under-19 international.",
      "Vitek, meanwhile, has started all 15 of Bristol City’s games this season and has been impressive between the posts. The 22-year-old is joint-third in the Championship’s clean sheet table and it is hoped that he will continue to develop during the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Nevertheless, The Sun says that both Amass and Vitek could find themselves in United’s squad next season. Amorim is ready to integrate academy graduates into his squad and the duo are top of the list.",
      "Amass has plenty of competition at left-back, with Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw, Noussair Mazroaoui and Diogo Dalot playing in the position. Vitek has a more favourable outlook, with United’s goalkeeping department looking wide-open.",
      "Andre Onana has been shipped out on loan to Trabzonspor and United will try to sell him permanently in the summer. Altay Bayindir has not impressed in his opportunities and could also be offloaded, while third-choice Tom Heaton is 39 years old and surely approaching the end of his career.",
      "Vitek could, in theory, become the number two goalkeeper behind summer signing Senne Lammens. He has been with United since 2020 and is currently on his third loan spell, after spending time with Accrington Stanley and Austrian side Linz.",
      "Bristol City boss Gerhard Struber has been blown away by his performances. “He is very clear; he’s so young, but super clear. He’s so focused, his decision-making is, I would say, 99 per cent always in the right way and in on-ball moments as well,” he said recently.",
      "“Also, Manchester United are super interested in how he plays every week. I’m always in exchange with them, so I would say he has a bright future for his chest. My trust, my belief in him, is at a very high level. I’ve worked also with very many good goalkeepers in the last few years, also in the Champions League, but Radek Vitek, his profile has a big future.",
      "“He’s a Premier League goalkeeper in the future. For me, it’s not a second opinion. Of course, he has to grow and also he has to develop, but the profile shows me clearly that he can be a goalkeeper in the highest league in England.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sadio Mane has revealed that Jurgen Klopp apologised to him for failing to sign him for Borussia Dortmund ahead of his move from Southampton to Liverpool. The Senegalese forward enjoyed an illustrious eight-year stint at Anfield after Klopp signed him from the Saints in 2016 in a £34million move.",
      "However, the two seemed destined to link up in the Bundesliga years sooner. Klopp was at the reins of Dortmund in 2014 when he spotted the suitability of Mane, who was thriving with Red Bull Salzburg, for his high-pressure style of play.",
      "A deal ultimately failed to come to fruition at the time, however, with Mane instead joining Southampton before Klopp made his way to Liverpool the following year as Brendan Rodgers' successor. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast on Thursday, Mane explained: \"I met Klopp. He wanted to bring me to Dortmund, but it didn't work out.\"",
      "The two crossed paths two years later in the Premier League, with Klopp still insistent on working with Mane - albeit on English soil rather than German. Mane added: \"So when he was in Liverpool, and I was also making my way, I go to Southampton. And that was, 'OK, we meet again.'",
      "\"He called me. He said, 'Listen, it didn't work out. It was my fault. So what do you think? We work again or?' And then I go to meet [Mauricio] Pochettino [at Tottenham]. I say, 'OK, so make sure you agree with my agent, everything. I will come to Tottenham.' And I come back home, three days after, Klopp called me. I say, 'This is my Klopp. This is the right...this is what I want.'",
      "\"I say, 'I give you my word. Make sure, some clubs want me, but no, I’m coming there.' And at the time Liverpool was not even [in the] Champions League; Tottenham was playing Champions League.\"",
      "He also claimed that Klopp apologised for not signing him for Dortmund in 2014. He added: \"Klopp called me. First of all, I say, 'Coach...' He said, 'How are you? It was my fault, you didn’t come to Dortmund. Because, you know, I wanted to come there. I met him first. I was not happy.'",
      "\"And he apologised for this. And he said, 'We will build the team no one wants to play against. And then, if we grow up together, you will play every game.'\"",
      "After securing his move to Liverpool in the summer of 2016, Mane managed 120 goals and 46 assists for the Reds from 269 appearances across all competitions, clinching a Premier League title, an FA Cup, a League Cup and a coveted Champions League at Anfield.",
      "However, his career could have taken a different turn altogether had he signed for Manchester United. Explaining why a move to United fell through, he added: \"Manchester United called me that time, the same time. I was talking to [Louis] Van Gaal.",
      "\"When they failed to get me, they bought [Anthony] Martial. Because he called me - Van Gaal called me. He said, 'Mane, how are you? What are you doing? How is…?' I said, 'I’m good.' He said, 'I want you to come to Manchester United.'",
      "\"I said, 'Really?' He said, 'Yeah.' I said, 'OK. Now I'm talking to my agent. We’ll see what is the best, because I know you're a good player and you can help the team, and we can help you also to become better players.'\"",
      "However, Mane explained that a wealth of talent in his position and van Gaal's answer to one question ultimately put him off the idea of signing for the Red Devils. He continued: \"And then I said, 'OK, so my question: you have [Memphis] Depay, you have [Wayne] Rooney, you have [Angel] Di Maria, you have [Robin] Van Persie, I think the same. So where am I going to play?' That was my question, because me, I want to play.",
      "\"He said, 'I know your talent, you’re good. But if you do good training, good impression, you will play. But we have another player which is also good.' I was not convinced about his explanation. And a few days after, the club called me. So I was waiting with my agent and my family.",
      "\"I talked to the coach, but he told me that I will play if I'm good; if not...But at the time, me, I was not ready, I can say. I was young. I still needed someone to help me more. And one or two more years to become what I want to be. Because I was still in Southampton; I was not consistent.",
      "\"And then we said, 'OK, we’ll see.' Because maybe Tottenham, I have a meeting with Tottenham. At the same time, Pochettino called him. He said, 'I want to have Sadio to come to Tottenham training ground.' And then I go to Tottenham training ground one week after.",
      "\"And I was... I see the facility, I meet the coach, I talk to him. And I was more convinced than the Man United project. Because Man U was too many... the problem was too many big players.\"",
      "Mane parted ways with Liverpool in 2022 to sign for Bayern Munich. However, after just one season with the Bavarians, he made the move to Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, where he still plays today.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has joked that he made a costly mistake by never hiring an agent. Neville, 50, enjoyed a glittering career playing for his boyhood club, making 600 appearances over 19 years and lifting 25 trophies.",
      "Devoted to United, the right-back wasn't represented by an agent and was instead joined by his dad whenever it was time to renew his contract. In 2007, Neville even called for the removal of agents in football.",
      "But after hearing how much ex-team-mate Wayne Rooney earned at his peak, Neville appears to be regretting his stance. \"What would your biggest contract have been at United?\" Neville asked Rooney on the Stick to Football podcast. \"I was your team-mate in 2010-11 on £1.75million, I'm captain.\"",
      "\"The biggest I've been on is about £17million a year,\" Rooney revealed, having signed a bumper £300,000-a-week deal in 2014.",
      "Stunned by the amount, Neville replied: \"I think I should've got paid a little bit more (laughs). That's amazing, well done, congratulations... Well done, Paul (Stretford, Rooney's agent).",
      "\"Paul, let's have a chat after. I think I need an agent! All that stuff I said over the years about not needing an agent - you need a f***ing agent! £17m a year - that's unbelievable, Wazza. Wow!\"",
      "Neville wasn't a fan of agents during his playing days, telling the Guardian in 2007: \"I'd like to see the removal of agents in the game. There is a concern for me and there always has been, 'How a guy can go in and ask for [a player's] wage and expect to be given hundreds of thousands of pounds and sometimes millions?'",
      "\"In this day and age I can't personally see it. That money is going out of the game and the clubs should keep that money; if the player's due it, he should keep that money.\"",
      "Neville was United's PFA representative and warned young players of the dangers of working with agents. \"When we have a union as strong as we have, the PFA could help with the correct education of young players and make those players not so reliant on people who want to take money from you,\" the ex-United captain added.",

United boss Ruben Amorim now regards Sanne Lammens as his long-term No.1 goalkeeper. And former United favourite Strachan believes there is no way back for Onana, even when his loan deal expires.",

      "It is suggested that all clubs interested are keeping a close eye on his recovery ahead of any potential swoop. Ter Stegen was signed from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2014 and he has gone on to make 422 Barcelona appearances, winning six league titles, six Spanish cups and the Champions League.",

      "The Ghanaian winger chose to remain with the Cherries in the summer whilst a number of their top stars headed for pastures new. Semenyo has gone on to become a leading light for Bournemouth this term and has come up with six goals and three assists in his first 11 appearances, fuelling further interest in his services.",
      "Two of those goals came on the opening night of the campaign at Liverpool as Bournemouth levelled the contest for a period. Semenyo ran the length of the pitch before firing past Alisson for one of his goals.",
      "There is talk of him taking on a new challenge come the New Year with Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham among those keen. But Shearer insists those eyeing Semenyo's signature must consider the environment he will be coming into, claiming he's been at a \"tiny\" club in comparison.",
      "Liverpool have seen such dangers first hand with Shearer referencing the struggles experienced by Milos Kerkez, who was a hugely impressive performer for Bournemouth last term. He moved to Anfield for £40million but has been in and out of the starting XI such have been his struggles.",
      "The Premier League great told Betfair: \"Antoine Semenyo has been linked with a move to Anfield, now, I don't know what Liverpool's plans will be for next season but there'll be a huge list of Premier League clubs that have already enquired about him and would love him in the team because of the ability that he has.",
      "\"As we've seen with Kerkez, it's alright playing well at Bournemouth where it's a great football club, but in terms of size it's tiny compared to someone like Liverpool. I guess you can say that with most players. These clubs invest a lot of money into players, so they'll know everything they need to about the player already.\"",
      "Liverpool invested heavily in their frontline over the summer, bringing in Alexander Isak, Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. They've failed to click however and with Mohamed Salah experiencing a sharp dip in form there is talk of life beyond the Egyptian.",
      "The Bournemouth ace claimed recently that he's attempting to keep the noise about his future at bay. He said: \"I don't think about it too much. I try to stay present as much as I can. You see the news all the time, I see it as well, I'm not oblivious, but I try to keep focused.\"",

      "\"The past three months it's another step forward for me from last year and there are players with more quality and different solutions in front of goal, so I need to make more quick decisions and be ready.\"",
      "While Vitek does not want to return to Old Trafford in the immediate future, he has signalled his desire to become the Red Devils’ starting goalkeeper in the long-term. He added: \"That's my plan but I will do my maximum for that and we will see - let's take game by game and now I'm focussing to play for Bristol City and do my best.",
      "\"One day it would be a dream to play for Manchester United but I take game by game and I know there's a big challenge in front of me but I want to improve every week.\"",
      "Vitek’s admission comes after a mass overhaul of United’s goalkeeping department this summer. Regular number one Andre Onana was loaned out to Turkish side Trabzonspor after a tricky couple of seasons at United.",
      "He was replaced as number one by reserve goalkeeper Atlay Bayindir, albeit the Turkish stopper had a number of error-strewn appearances. He too was then usurped in the pecking order by £18m summer signing Senne Lammens. The Belgian has impressed since arriving from Royal Antwerp. He has made five appearances for United so far, keeping one clean sheet and will likely start once again this weekend vs Everton.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Germany star has been a long-term target of the Red Devils as they attempt to add to their attacking options under Ruben Amorim. So far, a deal for Adeyemi has eluded them but that could soon be about to change with the January transfer window set to open in just a matter of weeks - particularly as the 23-year-old has seemingly already made his decision to leave Dortmund.",
      "As per Bild, Adeyemi wants to depart the club at the end of the season, with talks over a new deal having ground to a halt.",
      "The attacker's current deal runs until 2027 and he will only pen a new contract should a release clause be included - something that the German giants are not willing to compromise on.",
      "That could lead to Dortmund cashing in on Adeyemi instead of losing him for free in 18 months’ time. It is further suggested that the striker has penned a deal with super agent Jorge Mendes, with talks already underway with United and Inter Milan over a move.",
      "Adeyemi joined Dortmund from Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg in 2022 and has scored 29 goals in 121 appearances. Whether United manage to get a deal for Adeyemi over the line remains to be seen, albeit the Red Devils appear keen to bolster their midfield first.",
      "A number of high-profile options have already been identified including Brighton star Carlos Baleba, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher.",

      "Former Arsenal forward Paul Dickov believes Danny Welbeck should consider staying at Brighton and snubbing a return to Manchester United.",
      "Welbeck, 34, has been linked with a surprise move back to Old Trafford after an impressive start to the season. Indeed, the England international has scored six goals in 11 top-flight appearances this term.",
      "He is the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League, with Burnley's Jaidon Anthony second on four and a number of players, including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and West Ham's Jarrod Bowen, on three.",
      "Welbeck's form has seen speculation increase that he could be poised for a shock return to the England squad for next summer's World Cup, with Thomas Tuchel not having an obvious deputy for Harry Kane.",
      "As well as that, Welbeck has been tipped to re-join United in the January transfer window, almost 12 years since he left the Reds to sign for Arsenal in a £16million transfer. The ex-Watford man came through the youth system at Carrington and scored 29 times in 142 matches for his boyhood club before joining the Gunners.",
      "But with Benjamin Sesko suffering a knee injury in United's 2-2 draw at Tottenham before the international break, the Reds could dip into the market for another No.9 in January - and Welbeck's name has been mentioned as a potential target. However, Dickov doesn't think Welbeck should rush back to United.",
      "Speaking to Best Betting Bonuses, former Manchester City and Leicester ace Dickov said: \"It would be a big shout, actually, wouldn't it? Danny's been excellent. He seems to get better as he gets older. I think he's the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"Danny's obviously a Manchester boy, came through the academy. But it'll be interesting to see what United do and for how long Sesko is actually out for.",
      "\"Because they spent big on him. He was the one that they wanted in the summer. But with strikers, and I know that myself, we're very selfish.",
      "\"Any striker joining United in the winter will know that Sesko will be coming back, and almost certainly play ahead of him. Are United going to go and spend big and get a centre-forward that's going to come in and then have two centre-forwards that have got a big price tag? Is one going to sit on the bench?",
      "\"Especially in the January market, it's really difficult to go out there and get the players that you want. Then I know with Danny Welbeck, if United come in, it’s not even certain he will want to leave Brighton or if Brighton would let him leave.",
      "\"At the back of his mind, he's going to be thinking ‘How many games am I going to play?’ Because when Sesko comes back, he's probably going to be the main No. 9 that they've got in their squad. So it's a really difficult one for him.\"",
      "Welbeck has a solid record while playing for England, netting 16 goals in 42 caps. However, he hasn't made an appearance for the Three Lions since 2018, when he was at Arsenal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Just 18 months after being told to RETIRE by Jamie Carragher, Manchester United's veteran star Casemiro has been hailed as a “complete player” by a Premier League rival.",
      "The Brazilian has endured a rollercoaster spell at Old Trafford since his £60m move from Real Madrid. He impressed in his debut campaign but struggled in the following seasons, with reports at the time suggesting that the Red Devils were keen to cut their losses. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher suggested that he should start considering retiring with his infamous “leave the football before the football leaves you\" comment.",
      "Despite it appearing as though his career was winding down, Casemiro seems back to his best this season. The 33-year-old has been a consistent figure under Ruben Amorim, already scoring three goals throughout the campaign. And he has now earned praise from compatriot and Newcastle star Bruno Guimaraes. Speaking while on international duty, he said: “Look at his experience, his titles… he’s a complete player.",
      "“His career speaks for itself. In one of my first interviews with the national team, in 2020, when I arrived they asked if I was inspired by anyone in midfield, and I said his name, Casemiro.",
      "“He’s also an idol there for everything he’s done, especially at Real Madrid, the five Champions League titles. A guy that everyone who plays in Brazilian midfield talks about, Casemiro is the guy we have to follow.",
      "“So I think it’s a bit of everything, he’s a leader, certainly playing there as a number 8 is a position where I feel more comfortable, it’s a position I also play at Newcastle. I think it’s a perfect match and things are starting to go well.”",
      "Casemiro’s form and Guimaraes’ comments have certainly seen Liverpool icon Carragher eat his words. Speaking in May 2024, he said: \"I am nowhere near on a level of what that man has achieved, [winning] Champions League's, playing for Brazil and Real Madrid.",
      "\"But I always remember something when I retired myself, and there was a saying I always remember as a footballer: 'Leave the football, before the football leaves you'.",
      "\"The football has left him - at this top level. He needs to call it a day at this level of football and move.\"",

      "Scott McTominay has come a long way since he made his Manchester United debut under Jose Mourinho. And it was 'The Special One' who helped put McTominay on the path to becoming a Scotland hero during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "McTominay - whose latest act of heroism in a Scotland shirt inspired them to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998 - may no longer be a United player, but he has flourished at Napoli and was even named the best player in Serie A last season after moving overseas. It was evident during his Premier League days, though, that McTominay had bags of talent.",
      "Mourinho could see that and even felt, from a national team perspective, that England were taking far too long to give him an international call-up. And when Gareth Southgate didn't immediately act, Mourinho instead made sure that Scotland knew the door was open for them.",
      "McTominay qualified to play for them by virtue of his Helensburgh-born father and Alex McLeish was the Scotland manager at the time. When he sniffed an opportunity he didn't waste any time in heading south of the border to deliver his pitch - even if the weather almost cost him.",
      "He told the Telegraph: “Looking back now I suppose all of us Scots should say a little thank you to Jose Mourinho. Jose had given an interview in which he let it be known that England were in danger of missing out on Scott and that I should be getting in touch with him at the first opportunity!",
      "“So I arranged to go down to United’s training ground to see him and Scott. There was only one problem – the ‘Beast from the East’ was raging at the time and I almost didn’t make it!",
      "“I didn’t arrive into York until 3am and, at that point, I was seriously thinking about turning back, the weather was that bad. I eventually got to my hotel in Manchester Piccadilly, but I was so late they’d put me down as a no-show! So it’s gone 4am and I’m fearing I’ll be roomless. Luckily they found me one!”",
      "Mourinho appeared a man determined to give Scotland every chance to press their case to McTominay with the midfielder more than paying back that faith. He scored the opening goal on Tuesday night - one of 14 in his international career - and can now prepare for a World Cup campaign for the first time.",
      "McLeish added: “I rang Jose later that morning. ‘Come here for 12, let’s have lunch and a chat about Scott and then we’ll get him in the room'. He couldn’t have been more accommodating. I’d sensed Scott was keen, but I thought he’d still take a lot of persuading. He came in and was pretty clear in his own mind that he wanted to represent Scotland. I think he appreciated me going to see him, but it’s definitely fair to say it was one of the more worthwhile trips I’ve taken.”",

Greater Manchester's economic growth continues to outstrip the rest of the country with an annual rate of 3.1 per cent, and the mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham, has stated every borough should benefit.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London. Burnham had said that no public funding would be granted for the stadium itself, but conversations had been ongoing about the regeneration project surrounding the stadium.",
      "Now, an initial commitment of £26m for 382 new homes as part of the Trafford Wharf development has been promised – the first major investment in the Old Trafford regeneration area.",
      "The investment for the area around Old Trafford is part of the Greater Manchester growth plan.",
      "Collette Roche, United chief operating officer, said: “We are delighted to see the Old Trafford regeneration project at the heart of Greater Manchester’s wider growth plan for the next decade.",
      "“We want to build the world’s best football stadium as a new home for Manchester United and a venue fit for the biggest international events, including the 2035 FIFA Women’s World Cup, surrounded by a vibrant business, leisure and residential district served by excellent transport links.",
      "“We are determined to play our part, together with other stakeholders, in making this vision a reality, and unlocking the huge benefits it can deliver for the surrounding community and wider region.”",
      "Burnham has hailed the Old Trafford regeneration project as the United Kingdom's largest sports-led scheme since the London 2012 Olympics, with around 15,000 homes set to be built alongside the new 100,000-seat football stadium, as well as areas for leisure and business.",
      "The Mayoral Development Corporation was recently established for the regeneration project, and Burnham confirmed Lord Sebastian Coe has been appointed as its chair designate.",
      "Burnham has outlined his vision for Greater Manchester to become “a second city to rival any other on the planet by 2050\" and every district to benefit from “regeneration at a pace and on a scale not seen before this century”.",
      "United must reach a deal to purchase the rail yard surrounding Old Trafford before they can push ahead with stadium plans. The land is owned by Freightliner, and the parties are yet to reach an agreement.",
      "Burnham has suggested compulsory purchase powers could be used to acquire the space if a deal can not be agreed, but sources confirmed last month United were \"optimistic\" of reaching a breakthrough.",

      "Nick Cox helped raise £100million from academy sales during his six-year stint as head of the youth system, but United's director of football Jason Wilcox has identified that as an area where improvement can be made.",
      "Cox joined Everton to become their technical director in September. Former Manchester City academy chief Stephen Torpey was hired from Brentford to succeed Cox, and Torpey has been tasked with increasing revenue from academy sales, while also producing players for the first team at Old Trafford.",
      "United have a proud history of giving opportunities to young players, but some believe Amorim has not given enough chances to talented youngsters from the academy system.",
      "Speaking to Stan Sports, Amorim admitted that he found it difficult to prioritise academy players when he was first appointed. He also discussed why selling academy players has become increasingly important in the era of PSR rules.",
      "\"First thing, when I arrived last year, it was really tough,\" Amorim said. \"We had so many games but no time to prepare everything, to look around, to understand the game and the kids that are here, what is the plan for them and talk with all the coaches to try to arrange the perfect space to play.",
      "\"Under-18, Under-21, who is going to play where, so we are doing that now. I'm enjoying that part. I think it's going to be, like any club in the world, but especially here in England with the fair play. The players that you can put in the first team to feel the badge, but also the players that are maybe not good enough to play for Manchester United, but can give us some money when you sell them to try to compensate for the financial fair play to buy different players.",
      "\"So I think the future of our club is going to be the academy because, like you said, if you look at the biggest years with the most success was with the academy players.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"In the current moment, we also have that part if you sell a player from our academy, all the money you can use it to buy another. So I think we need to be really focused on that.",
      "\"Our sporting director has a background with the academies and young kids, so we are doing everything to put these kids in the first team for us to be competitive in any way in the Premier League.\"",
      "United banked £40m from the sale of Alejandro Garnacho in the summer transfer window. The sale represented 'pure profit' in the books and was the highest-ever sale of a United academy graduate.",
      "United received a fixed fee of €30.5million (£25.7m) from Napoli for the sale of Scott McTominay in the summer of 2024. Amorim was asked to explain what he looks for in a young player, and he said: \"It's an honour to play for Manchester United. Sometimes, some kids take that for granted. That is the first thing.",

Then you need to help the kids to cope with the media attention. That is something that we need to work and be really careful when one kid makes one game, not to make a big deal of that.",

The former United midfielder was sold in 2024 to Napoli - five months prior to Dorgu's United arrival - and since then he has been impressing in Serie A.",
      "This week the midfielder helped Scotland beat Dorgu's Denmark 4-2 at Hampden Park to secure the home nation's qualification to the World Cup in USA, Mexico and Canada. McTominay opened the scoring after less than five minutes with a tremendous overhead kick.",
      "United loanee Rasmus Hojlund scored from the penalty spot to level the game before Lawrence Shankland guided in a corner to give the Scots the advantage. Denmark only needed a point to qualify automatically and Dorgu's late strike looked to have earned them just that but two late goals saw them settle for a place in the play-offs.",
      "When asked post-match if he would like to be playing alongside McTominay at United, Dorgu said: \"It was a good goal but we also have enough good players at United as well. I am happy for him winning the league in Napoli.\"",
      "The next international break is not until March at which point Denmark will need to beat North Macedonia and then either Czechia or the Republic of Ireland to progress to the World Cup. Dorgu insists his focus is now on succeeding with the Reds until then.",
      "He said: \"100% we just need to look forward. We are in a really good position at United.",
      "\"We will go back with confidence to help the team to get more wins. Denmark is now March. It is a long time and we just need to concentrate on club matters until then.\"",
      "Dorgu is expected to be back in the United squad on Monday night when they host Everton in the Premier League. A win for the Reds could move them into the top four.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog.",
      "With the January transfer window fast approaching, United are at the centre of several rumours. Antoine Semenyo is currently the trending name ahead of the winter trading period with several Premier League teams keen to sign him from Bournemouth.",
      "United are reported to be part of that race, with the Cherries' front-man impressing so far this season. But he's not the only forward to be linked with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Karim Adeyemi of Borussia Dortmund is a different attacker to be linked with an Old Trafford switch. There are also some reports of United showing an interest in teammate Serhou Guirassy, raising the possibility of a double deal.",
      "Versatile Ajax star Jorthy Mokio is the latest midfield option to appear of interest to those at United with the almost certainly more expensive trio of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson also wanted.",
      "There is also talk around a possible replacement for the injured Benjamin Sesko. The United striker is set to be out of action for around a month due to injury.",
      "With all of that being said, MEN Sport has you covered with all of the latest transfer talk in our live blog below!",
      "Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke has backed youngster Chido Obi to step up and replace the injured Benjamin Sesko over the next few weeks.",
      "Sesko is set for around a month on the sidelines after suffering a knee injury in the draw against Tottenham before the international break.",
      "Speaking to Snabbare, Yorke said:",
      "\"I think Amorim has got to invest in the young players and bring some fresh talent through to give a little bit of a chance if Sesko is out injured.",
      "\"If you’re gonna bring in a makeshift option as cover, we’ve seen United do that in the past and it hasn’t worked.",
      "\"It’s just too big of a club for bringing in a player that’s not the right fit to improve the team.",
      "\"I’d understand if they were flying on all cylinders to get someone else in there but when things are not going so great, it’s a difficult fit.",
      "\"If United are going to go and sign someone else, I think they have to go out there like Liverpool and bring in someone who would have a really big presence at the football club.",
      "\"Otherwise, the [development side is] there for a reason. What about Chido Obi?",
      "\"I know the first team squads are big but you’ve got to get these young players around the team for when situations like this happen.",
      "\"When I was at United, the youngsters could train with us and then we’d let them play to get game time and train with us more.",
      "\"It’s so that when they come, they are already up to speed. That’s something I would look at.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly one of the clubs monitoring Borussia Dortmund striker Serhou Guirassy ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, United along with Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain are all keeping an eye on the striker.",
      "It's added that Guirassy will have a £44 million (€50m) release clause in his contract, but that will only be available to a select group of elite clubs.",
      "The 29-year-old has scored 45 goals in 65 games for Dortmund and is the teammate of reported United target Karim Adeyemi.",
      "Marcus Rashford missed training for Barcelona on Thursday as his team-mates returned from international duty to prepare for Saturday's clash with Athletic Club.",
      "That's despite the Manchester United loanee being at the Ciutat Esportiva a day earlier. According to Diaro AS, Rashford did not attend training on Thursday for \"personal reasons\" after receiving permission from the La Liga giants, although it is reported that he will regroup with Hansi Flick's squad for preparations on Friday.",
      "The news that Rashford's absence isn't a cause for concern will be welcomed by Barcelona fans. The club are set to return to the fold to face Athletic Club at the Camp Nou on Saturday, with hopes of closing the three-point gap Xabi Alonso's Real Madrid currently hold on them at the peak of the La Liga standings.",

      "Patrick Dorgu outlined his grand ambitions for the season when he spoke to Manchester-based correspondents in August, revealing he wanted to win the Premier League and play for Denmark at the 2026 World Cup. The reality is United are a world away from winning the title, but the club staff member who sat in on the interview felt that specific quote reflected Dorgu's ambition and determination.",
      "Unfortunately for Dorgu, his ambition to play at the World Cup next summer may not be realised because Denmark were defeated 4-2 by Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night. If Denmark are to book their place at the tournament they will have to qualify via the play-offs. They played at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and Dorgu will be hoping to help his nation reach a third successive tournament.",
      "Dorgu was on the losing side in Scotland, but he notched his third international goal for Denmark when he made it 2-2 with 10 minutes remaining. It was a decent finish in the box, which should give him some much-needed confidence ahead of the return of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that academy players who are \"maybe not good enough\" to play for Manchester United could be sold to raise funds to work within the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Nick Cox helped raise £100million from academy sales during his six-year stint as head of the youth system, but United's director of football Jason Wilcox has identified that as an area where improvement can be made.",
      "Cox joined Everton to become their technical director in September. Former Manchester City academy chief Stephen Torpey was hired from Brentford to succeed Cox, and Torpey has been tasked with increasing revenue from academy sales, while also producing players for the first team at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United do not meet a traditional big-six side across their next 10 Premier League matches in a huge boost to Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Reds will be feeling much better about themselves after a poor start to the campaign - which had seen head coach Amorim come under increasing pressure. United are currently on a five-match unbeaten run, though, and sit seventh in the top-flight table after 11 games.",
      "Amorim's squad have secured wins over in-form Sunderland, reigning Premier League champions Liverpool and a Brighton side who have caused them major problems in recent seasons. Amorim's men have earned draws in their last two fixtures - at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United centre-back Lisandro Martinez has shown encouraging signs in training after being pictured with Joshua Zirkzee during the November international break.",
      "The Argentine has been out of action since sustaining a serious knee injury in February. However, the 27-year-old has since returned to training at Carrington as he works his way back to full fitness.",
      "Reports suggest that Martinez was granted permission to train with Argentina during the international break to build match fitness. It is currently unclear whether the former Ajax star will be fit enough to be included in United's squad for Monday night's clash against Everton, however.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United's summer transfer window went well, but heading towards January the Reds know there is work to be done as their squad still feels light in certain areas. Even with the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, the Reds still feel short in attack. Sesko's injury has shown that to be the case.",
      "Should Sesko miss any upcoming games, United seem destined to play Cunha as the false nine with Mbeumo and one of Mason Mount or Amad behind him. But when Mbeumo and Amad leave for AFCON, United suddenly look very short. Ruben Amorim did hint after the Tottenham draw that he could delve into the January market, especially if Sesko's injury is serious.",
      "Even if Sesko doesn't miss a game for United it must be clear to Amorim that another forward addition is needed. Fortunately, the green light has just been given to repeat a trick United used in the summer.",
      "Lisandro Martinez's absence from the Manchester United first team has been painstakingly long. The Argentine suffered an ACL injury against Crystal Palace in February and since then he has missed 35 United matches over 291 days.",
      "Much has changed for United since Martinez left the pitch at Old Trafford on a stretcher against the Eagles. Perhaps most notably, there is optimism that the club have turned a corner under Ruben Amorim. United are on a five-game unbeaten run and are good value for their position just a point outside the top four.",
      "Something else that has changed during Martinez's absence from the first-team squad is Casemiro's role in the team. The Brazilian has become an undroppable for Amorim having previously been written off by some.",
      "However, an impending problem will be concerning the Reds.",
      "Manchester United's chances of signing Borussia Dortmund star Karim Adeyemi have received a significant boost, with reports indicating the forward is actively planning his departure. The German sensation has been on the Reds' radar for some time as they look to enhance their attacking options under Ruben Amorim.",
      "While securing Adeyemi has proven elusive so far, the tide may be about to change with the January transfer window just around the corner - particularly as the 23-year-old appears set on leaving Dortmund. Bild reports that Adeyemi is eager to depart the club at the season's end, with contract renewal talks having hit a deadlock.",
      "However, Dortmund have reportedly slapped a £70 million price tag on him.",
      "Garnacho's future was cast into doubt at the end of last season following his comments about United's season which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League. The Argentine later secured a £40million move to Stamford Bridge, which Chelsea are understood to have offered Lavia as part of the deal for Garnacho at the time..",
      "The club were heavily linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba, though a move did not materialise due to his £100million price tag. The Daily Mail claims that it was Wilcox, who previously worked at Manchester City and Southampton, Lavia's two clubs before Chelsea, who asked about the 21-year-old's availability. However, United rejected the proposal due to fitness concerns.",
      "Patrick Dorgu outlined his grand ambitions for the season when he spoke to Manchester-based correspondents in August, revealing he wanted to win the Premier League and play for Denmark at the 2026 World Cup. The reality is United are a world away from winning the title, but the club staff member who sat in on the interview felt that specific quote reflected Dorgu's ambition and determination.",
      "Unfortunately for Dorgu, his ambition to play at the World Cup next summer may not be realised because Denmark were defeated 4-2 by Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night. If Denmark are to book their place at the tournament they will have to qualify via the play-offs.",
      "They played at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and Dorgu will be hoping to help his nation reach a third successive tournament. Dorgu was on the losing side in Scotland, but he notched his third international goal for Denmark when he made it 2-2 with 10 minutes remaining.",
      "It was a decent finish in the box, which should give him some much-needed confidence ahead of the return of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "Former Arsenal and Manchester City striker Paul Dickov has suggested that Danny Welbeck should think twice before leaving Brighton for a potential return to Manchester United. Welbeck, 34, has been linked with an unexpected move back to Old Trafford following his strong start to the season.",
      "The England international has netted six goals in just 11 top-flight appearances this campaign. He currently stands as the top-scoring Englishman in the Premier League, with Burnley's Jaidon Anthony trailing behind on four and several players, including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and West Ham's Jarrod Bowen, on three.",
      "Welbeck's impressive form has fuelled rumours that he could be in line for a surprise recall to the England squad for next summer's World Cup, especially given Thomas Tuchel's lack of clear alternatives to Harry Kane. In addition to this, Welbeck has been tipped to make a return to United in the January transfer window, nearly 12 years after he left the Reds to join Arsenal in a £16million deal.",
      "Alan Shearer has joined Jamie Carragher in delivering an Antoine Semenyo transfer verdict.",
      "The Bournemouth star could be on the move in the January transfer window if a team make it clear they will activate his £65million release clause by a certain date. Liverpool are the latest team to be linked while Manchester United and Tottenham made enquiries this past summer.",
      "Shearer has warned against Liverpool signing him however, with Milos Kerkez's early struggles at Anfield as his reference point.",
      "Speaking to Betfair, he said: \"Antoine Semenyo has been linked with a move to Anfield, now, I don't know what Liverpool's plans will be for next season but there'll be a huge list of Premier League clubs that have already enquired about him and would love him in the team because of the ability that he has.",
      "\"As we've seen with Kerkez, it's alright playing well at Bournemouth where it's a great football club, but in terms of size it's tiny compared to someone like Liverpool. I guess you can say that with most players.",
      "\"These clubs invest a lot of money into players, so they'll know everything they need to about the player already.\"",
      "Manchester United duo Harry Amass and Radek Vitek could find themselves as part of the senior squad next season, according to The Sun.",
      "Amass and Vitek are currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday and Bristol City, respectively, with the two academy graduates impressing thus far.",
      "It has been added in the report that there is a real chance for Championship loannees to break into the first-team picture the following year. Amass is highly-regarded at United and by Amorim with the 18-year-old making his competitive debut during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Vitek meanwhile, has only appeared in friendlies but could quite easily come into the fold with Altay Bayindir seeming destined to leave. However, if he does not make the step up, United will likely try to cash in while his stock is high.",
      "Alan Shearer, via Betfair, has told Ruben Amorim the absence of Benjamin Sesko because of a knee injury is not a disaster for Manchester United.",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s injury won’t impact Man United too much. Ruben Amorim has already shown that if you're not up to it then he won't play you.",
      "He's already made enough big decisions not to be phased by what the outside noise is. I don't suspect that bothers him at all.",
      "He'd love Sesko to be fit, come off the bench and have an impact but he won't have that option.",
      "Given how well the likes of Cunha and Mbuemo have been since joining, it's not as if Sesko's injury is a disaster. Results are improving at Man United.",
      "Karim Adeyemi wants to leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the 2025/26 season, it has been claimed in Germany.",
      "As per Bild, the Germany international wants to leave next summer, with discussions over a new contract stopping as a result. Given his stance, a January exit cannot be ruled out.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for the versatile attacker. The 23-year-old has grabbed eight goal contributions from 19 appearances in this campaign.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo continues to be linked with a January loan move to Napoli.",
      "The Manchester United midfielder wanted to depart the club temporarily on deadline day in search of more minutes, but was told he would not be leaving Old Trafford. He has since played just 93 minutes of Premier League football.",
      "That has resulted in links to Napoli remaining with a mid-season switch now a seeming a real possibility, especially as he and Billy Gilmour share the same agent. CAA Stellar represent both midfielders and that could prove key in getting Mainoo to join.",
      "Manchester United are firmly in the market to sign a new midfielder with a dream transfer option appearing to have now emerged.",
      "According to The Daily Briefing. Ruben Neves is keen on a return to the Premier League when his contract at Al Hilal next summer.",
      "It’s also claimed that contact is already being made with Premier League sides with a deal that would see him join United 'on'. Tottenham have also been credited with an interest in the former Wolves star.",
      "If the 28-year-old does want to play in the Premier League next season, United could sign him on a free transfer, but there is likely to be serious competition if that scenario plays out.",
      "Matheus Cunha could help Manchester United sign Wolves' Joao Gomes if he is the midfielder they actively pursue.",
      "Cunha has spoken very highly of his fellow Brazilian. When he was asked who Gomes reminds him of, the forward made an exciting admission.",
      "\"Maybe Casemiro,\" he explained. \"He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro’s name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive. I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.\"",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has instructed his former club to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth in the January transfer window.",
      "Manchester United and Tottenham have been linked with a move for the Ghana international but Carragher has explained why Arne Slot desperately needs him.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast,he said: \"I think they'll [Liverpool] have to recruit more physical players and maybe even in January.",
      "\"I’ve just seen the Semenyo [January release clause] come up and obviously he’s got the link with [sporting director] Richard Hughes. When you actually look at him as a player, lightening quick, big and powerful.\"",
      "Manchester United are the latest club to be linked with a move for Ajax teenager Jorthy Mokio.",
      "According to Sacha Tavolieri, there is transfer interest from Old Trafford in the 17-year-old, who can play in both midfield and defence, with Newcastle United and Eintracht Frankfurt also keen.",
      "He has added that Mokio is currently uncertain about Ajax's long-term project and is thus yet to sign a new contract despite the club's wishes. That hesitation could result in one of the three teams linked taking advantage.",
      "Manchester United are expected to be involved in the Antoine Semenyo transfer battle during the January transfer window.",
      "The winger is likely to depart Bournemouth given the £65million release clause in his contract and with United, Tottenham and Liverpool all interested.",
      "The latter appear to have the best chance of signing him with the Daily Mail (subscription required) describing Arne Slot's side as the frontrunners for his signature. It has been claimed however, that United are ones to watch in the battle to acquire his services.",
      "Karim Adeyemi appears unlikely to join Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Links to the Germany international had ramped up over the last few weeks but as things stand there is no active moves being made for him with transfer guru Fabrizio Romano revealing no approach or negotiations have started.",
      "United could certainly look to bring in an attacker in the January transfer window especially if one more injury strikes with Benjamin Sesko currently out while Bryan Mbeumo and Amad will be at AFCON.",
      "Hello and welcome back to our Manchester United transfer live blog!",
      "For the latest updates on Karim Adeyemi, Antoine Semenyo, Jorthy Mokio, Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba!",
      "Manchester United's Shea Lacey has long been touted as a star of the future - and it might not just be at club level. The 18-year-old has caught England's eye in recent weeks and months and again played a starring role on the international stage this week.",
      "The United prospect came off the bench to score for England Under-20s in their 1-1 friendly draw with Japan on Friday night, having only made his debut at that level last month.",
      "That outing came after the teenager was called up to train with the Under-21s - who beat Ireland 1-0 on Friday - where he received glowing praise from boss Lee Carsley.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund's transfer value has increased yet again as he continues to enjoy his loan spell away from Manchester United. Hojlund left United to join Napoli on a season-long loan deal, which also includes an obligation to buy.",
      "The reigning Serie A champions will have to pay United €44million (£38.8million) next summer provided certain conditions are met. The Reds have already received a €6million (£5.3million) loan fee from Napoli, which could mean the total fee for the transfer would reach €50million (£44.1million) if the permanent transfer is completed.",
      "Hojlund left Old Trafford in the summer after scoring 26 goals across two seasons at United, and managed 10 across the entirety of the previous campaign. Since signing for Napoli, the Denmark international has four goals to his name across his first 10 appearances.",
      "Manchester United are already being tipped to have a busy January transfer window, but Benjamin Sesko's injury could have the opposite effect. United have just over a month to go until they are allowed to go into the market for new signings once again.",
      "Sesko was one of five new additions to the United squad in the summer, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon all moving to Old Trafford. Despite making big moves in the transfer market a few months ago, United are still being linked with making further additions in the New Year.",
      "However, the recent injury to Sesko could prompt a change in strategy from United. The Slovenia international suffered a knee injury during United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, with reports suggesting that he is expected to be sidelined for up to a month.",
      "As a result, Ruben Amorim could be forced to turn to other members of his squad to fill the void left by Sesko's absence for the next few weeks.",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Gordon Strachan believes letting Marcus Rashford depart has proven to be the right decision by the club, as he has rediscovered his best form at Barcelona.",
      "The 28-year-old winger joined the Spanish giants on a season-long loan in the summer, with the option to complete a permanent move to the Camp Nou. United included an option-to-buy clause in the deal worth around £28million.",
      "Under manager Hansi Flick, the winger has scored six goals and provided nine assists in 16 appearances across all competitions. Strachan believes the move has worked out in favour of both player and club, having saved Ruben Amorim an extra headache in the dressing room.",
      "Matheus Cunha labelled Ruben Amorim \"a winner\" when asked about the Manchester United boss while on international duty. The Reds signed Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves in the summer.",
      "The early part of the campaign was particularly challenging for the club, increasing the pressure on Amorim. However, recent weeks have brought some relief and Cunha has expressed his admiration for the Portuguese coach and teammate Bryan Mbeumo."

      "Former PSV Eindhoven midfielder Ibrahim Sangare had to be convinced to return to the club's training ground after discovering that manager Ruud van Nistelrooy had left his role.",
      "The Manchester United legend took charge of the Dutch club between July 2022 and May 2023. In that time, he led them to a second-place finish in the Eredivisie, with the team also winning the Dutch Cup.",
      "Despite the relative success, the ex-Netherlands striker stepped down from his role after just one season following a fall-out with the club's hierarchy.",
      "While that decision reportedly went down well with some players, others didn't take it quite so well. Speaking just after Van Nistelrooy's decision to walk away, ESPN journalist Milan von Dongen highlighted Sangare's eye-catching reaction in particular.",
      "\"They had to get him out of there to get him back,\" he said. \"He was furious about van Nistelrooy's departure. So there will also be talk within the group of players.\"",
      "Not long after showing that reaction, Sangare completed a move away from PSV. The Ivory Coast midfielder was transferred to Premier League side Nottingham Forest, where he remains.",
      "Just over a year after leaving PSV, van Nistelrooy returned to a coaching role with United, joining as Erik ten Hag's assistant manager. The sacking of Ten Hag just over three months later led to the one-time striker taking charge of four United games on an interim basis.",
      "United went unbeaten in those four matches; winning three and drawing one.",
      "Despite that, Ruben Amorim decided not to make van Nistelrooy part of his own backroom staff, with the coach leaving the club following the appointment of the Portuguese.",
      "Van Nistelrooy wasn't out of work for long, joining Leicester City as manager just weeks later. He was tasked with saving the club from relegation to the Championship.",
      "However, in his 27 games in charge, the Foxes managed just five wins and three draws. They finished the season in 18th position in the table, with the Dutchman sacked this summer.",
      "He has since been criticised by striker Odsonne Edouard - who was on loan with Leicester from Crystal Palace - but failed to make an appearance under Van Nistelrooy.",
      "He told L'Equipe: \"Being a great striker doesn't necessarily mean being a great coach. At the beginning, I played a little [under Steve Cooper], then things didn't work out with Ruud van Nistelrooy. I didn't get along well with van Nistelrooy. I found myself blocked for seven months without playing.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy has been out of work since leaving Leicester. He was briefly linked with the FC Twente job back in September, but that vacancy has since then been filled by John van den Brom.",

      "Just for once, Manchester United couldn't be criticised too much for how the summer transfer window played out. Considering the lack of Champions League football this season, it always seemed like it would be difficult to attract players to the club and, yet, they managed to address the major concerns.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko were brought in to bolster an attack which stuttered badly last season. Senne Lammens was signed to improve the goalkeeping ranks and he has managed to do that well. The only area of the pitch seemingly neglected was midfield, but it was agreed that was further down the priority list at that juncture.",
      "It's only as the season has progressed though that United's attack has shown signs of needing further investment. Many assumed Joshua Zirkzee would have more involvement than he has considering Rasmus Hojlund left, but he does not seem to be trusted by Ruben Amorim.",
      "It has left United with a lack of options in the centre-forward role. Sesko is the only out-and-out No.9 in the first-team squad, but he is still adapting to the Premier League. Chido Obi is an option but, at 17, his short-term career plan is best served in the academy set-up.",
      "When Amorim wants to bring in a replacement for Sesko, the Reds currently have to adopt a striker-less system - which has worked against the likes of Liverpool - but isn't necessarily ideal for matches where a focal point up top is needed. That is why the availability of Antoine Semenyo should be appealing to the recruitment department.",
      "Semenyo fits the same mould as Mbeumo and Cunha. He's a player who has proven he can do it in the Premier League and has a goal-scoring record to match that.",
      "In a recent interview with Jason Wilcox, the United sporting director explained how the club made a decision to sign players in attack who they could 'plug in and play' in the Premier League. This does not mean signing players who solely fit the system, but also ones who know the division and can settle immediately.",
      "Were they to sign Semenyo, then he would be another player who could do just that. Another similarity between Mbeumo and the Bournemouth attacker is the concerns surrounding whether he can feature as a No.10, or centre-forward, considering he plays as a right winger for his club.",
      "However, speaking back in January, the Ghana international told the Reds exactly what they wanted to hear. \"I feel like I'm comfortable playing in any role across the forward positions,\" he said.",
      "\"This comes with the ability to use both feet, I think. I'm comfortable playing whether on the left, right or in the middle.",
      "\"However, in my head the end goal is to be a No.9. Maybe in the years to come when I've built the experience I'll eventually transition into that, but I'm not too hung up on that.\"",
      "If United are to spend a vast amount of money on a player, they need to know he can feature in a role suitable for Amorim's system. With those comments, Semenyo has offered reassurances that he can.",
      "It will be a huge surprise if Semenyo is still at Bournemouth by the end of the January transfer window. If he stays injury free, and continues the sort of form he has been showing so far, there will be Premier League clubs queuing up for him.",
      "Semenyo is understood to have a £65million release clause which will be active in the early stages of the January window. It's said it will expire shortly after the window opens to allow Bournemouth time to sign a replacement if necessary.",
      "As such, we can expect any potential suitors to swarm on him as soon as the window begins and United need to be ready for that. If Semenyo now proves to be a serious target for the Reds in the transfer market, Zirkzee will undoubtedly need to leave and we understand a request from the Dutchman is likely to be lodged in January if his game time doesn't increase.",
      "Should that happen, it's a no brainer for United. They must look to rake in as much as they can for Zirkzee and then use that money to attempt to sign Semenyo.",
      "He has told the Reds exactly what they needed to hear so now is the time to start planning their approach.",

      "Manchester United do not meet a traditional big-six side across their next 10 Premier League matches in a huge boost to Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Reds will be feeling much better about themselves after a poor start to the campaign - which had seen head coach Amorim come under increasing pressure. United are currently on a five-match unbeaten run, though, and sit seventh in the top-flight table after 11 games.",
      "Amorim's squad have secured wins over in-form Sunderland, reigning Premier League champions Liverpool and a Brighton side who have caused them major problems in recent seasons. Amorim's men have earned draws in their last two fixtures - at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "United return to action on Monday night at home to Everton (8pm) before a trip to Crystal Palace six days later. Below is a closer look at their next 10 league fixtures - with no big-six sides until they take on Manchester City in mid-January;",
      "Everton (H) - Monday, November 24 (8pm)",
      "Crystal Palace (A) - Sunday, November 30 (12pm)",
      "West Ham United (H) - Thursday, December 4 (8pm)",

      "Wolves (H) - Tuesday, December 30 (8.15pm)",
      "Leeds United (A) - Sunday, January 4 (12:30pm)",
      "Burnley (A) - Wednesday, January 7 (8.15pm)",
      "The kinder fixture list, on paper, will be a welcome relief to United and Amorim, with several key players jetting off to the Africa Cup of Nations, which begins in late December. Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are set to play in the tournament, which is being held in Morocco and runs until January 18.",
      "Amorim has already offered his thoughts on the scenario United face in the next few months. In that, he insisted it represents an opportunity for other players to step up.",
      "Speaking recently, he said: \"When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training, in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United's recent improvement is down to playing with greater confidence and intensity. Amorim picked up the Premier League's manager of the month award for October after wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which were followed by draws with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "United made a disastrous start to the campaign, suffering an embarrassing defeat against Grimsby Town before a thumping at local rivals Manchester City, but Amorim has overseen an impressive turnaround at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim officially began work in Manchester during the November 2024 international break, following the announcement of his appointment from Sporting Lisbon that month.",
      "The 40-year-old reflected on his time at the club when he spoke to Stan Sports, saying: \"It's been a journey. The most important thing is that I've learned a lot.",
      "\"Sometimes you think when you are too young and you've come with just winning, and you face different results and a different way of people seeing your job, what you are doing... sometimes this is hard, but you learn a lot. I think I'm a better manager now.",
      "\"I'm ready for the future, I'm ready for the present. It was a really tough journey, but now I can see it as necessary and I think we are in a better place because of that.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"We are playing better because we have more confidence and that starts with the good results. For example, against Liverpool, but if you look at the game, we had some luck.",
      "\"And that changed the momentum for us. We did a very good pre-season, we started the season really well against Arsenal, and then we had our ups and downs until this point.",
      "\"That's what I was expecting. It's not a surprise for me that we are improving, we are getting better, but I can share my feeling when we finish the game against Tottenham. I came here at Carrington, watched the game [again] and my feeling was of frustration that we are far from perfection.",
      "\"We are far from the team that can win every game, so I think we have a lot to do, but I also have the feeling what I have been saying for many months is the formation is not the problem.",
      "\"The formation is the start of something, then it's the dynamic, the confidence, the way we play the game, how competitive we are. And if you look at the games we struggle this season, it's not about the formation for me, it's about the lack of intensity, and we need to be perfect in this league to win a lot of games.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe made an appearance on The Business podcast during the October break, discussing Amorim's future and the alleged decline of the academy.",
      "The United co-owner said of Amorim: \"He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "Asked if the Glazers had told him to sack the head coach, Ratcliffe replied: “It’s not going to happen.”",
      "Amorim reiterated that he appreciated Ratcliffe's backing. \"It's always really important,\" he said. \"But it's more important for the fans to understand we have a clear path and we're going to do everything.",
      "\"And no matter what, we are going to continue that path. For me, and I'm going to be really honest, doesn't change much because I'm not worried about losing my job. I always had that feeling. It's a good thing to hear, but it changes nothing in the way of how I behave. I know clearly what path I have to follow.",
      "\"If you remember when Jim gave that interview, it settled down the noise around the club, it changed completely. So that was really important for the team and me. So those words had a huge impact on not how I do things, but the way people see what we are doing, so it was massive for us.\"",

      "Alan Shearer has claimed Benjamin Sesko's injury will not have too much of an impact on Manchester United's progress in the Premier League.",
      "The Slovenia international picked up a knee injury during United's last match ahead of November's break, in which, the Reds were held to a 2-2 draw by Tottenham Hotspur. As a result, Sesko missed his nation's final two World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Sweden, while it is estimated that he could miss a month's worth of football.",
      "Despite United being left without a striker they paid £74million to RB Leipzig for this summer, Newcastle United hero Shearer doesn't think that Ruben Amorim will struggle during his absence. Speaking via Betfair, Shearer said: \"Benjamin Sesko's injury won't impact Man Utd too much.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has already shown that, if you're not up to it, he won't play you. He's already made enough big decisions not to be phased by what the outside noise is.",
      "\"I don't suspect that bothers him at all. He'd love Sesko to be fit, come off the bench and have an impact, but he won't have that option.\"",
      "Sesko was one of a number of big-money arrivals at Old Trafford this summer, as Amorim worked to overhaul the squad that he inherited from Erik ten Hag last November, with United also welcoming the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens to the ranks.",
      "And Shearer also believes Amorim is well-equipped in terms of squad depth to continue to thrive in the Premier League. He added: \"Given how well the likes of Cunha and Mbuemo have been [doing] since joining, it's not as if Sesko's injury is a disaster. Results are improving at Man Utd.\"",
      "After a lacklustre 15th-place finish in the top-flight standings last campaign, the United board will have expected improved performances from Amorim and his squad after allowing him a sizable transfer budget this summer - as well as a full pre-season tour to fine tune his squad.",
      "And despite a mixed-bag of results early doors, it appears as though the club's Portuguese tactician has finally started to find his stride. As it stands, United sit seventh in the Premier League standings - with five wins, three draws and three losses to show for their efforts this term.",
      "Meanwhile, they are also unbeaten in their last five outings, courtesy of wins over Sunderland, rivals Liverpool and Brighton, plus draws with Nottingham Forest and Spurs. Fans will be expecting to see their side pick up where they left off earlier this month when top flight action resumes for the Reds on Monday night.",
      "Amorim has the honour of welcoming a revitalised Everton side under the tutelage of David Moyes to Old Trafford next week. The club then take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday, November 30, before a hectic schedule gets underway in the lead up to the New Year.",
      "During which, United face away journeys to the Midlands to take on Wolves and Aston Villa, as well as home encounters against West Ham United and Bournemouth, on top of a Boxing Day bash with Newcastle United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes the mindset of his Manchester United players needs to change when they hold the lead in games. The Reds were leading 1-0 at Tottenham before the international break but had to settle for a point after a disappointing second half display.",
      "The same thing happened at Nottingham Forest a week earlier, where United struggled in the second half after dominating the first. In the victory over Brighton, the Reds were almost punished when they were pegged back to 3-2 having been cruising earlier in the contest.",
      "In an interview with the Premier League, Amorim was asked why there has been such drop-offs from his team of late. He replied: \"I think we lose intensity. I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.",
      "\"I think when we are in advantage, we lose that thing of wanting to continue to press in the same way. We had that against Brighton until we suffered the first goal. So it’s a lot of things together. We think about 'let’s not suffer a goal' and our mindset should be 'we have one goal, we must get another and have the opportunity to kill the game'. So it is mental but it is also physical, we need to improve in that aspect also.\"",
      "Amorim's thoughts are shared by his United players. Speaking after the Spurs draw, Matthijs de Ligt explained how fatigue played a role in the result. He said: \"Luckily we got a point, I think we deserved more the way we played, I felt the second half we were a little tired. We didn't get the chance to get out of our half.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu outlined his grand ambitions for the season when he spoke to Manchester-based correspondents in August, revealing he wanted to win the Premier League and play for Denmark at the 2026 World Cup. The reality is United are a world away from winning the title, but the club staff member who sat in on the interview felt that specific quote reflected Dorgu's ambition and determination.",
      "Unfortunately for Dorgu, his ambition to play at the World Cup next summer may not be realised because Denmark were defeated 4-2 by Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night. If Denmark are to book their place at the tournament they will have to qualify via the play-offs. They played at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and Dorgu will be hoping to help his nation reach a third successive tournament.",
      "Dorgu was on the losing side in Scotland, but he notched his third international goal for Denmark when he made it 2-2 with 10 minutes remaining. It was a decent finish in the box, which should give him some much-needed confidence ahead of the return of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "The defender started in United's opening two games of the Premier League season, however, he was dropped to the bench against Burnley before starting the next three games. Ruben Amorim dropped Dorgu again in a recent run of matches against Sunderland, Liverpool, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, preferring Diogo Dalot to start at left wing-back. Dalot struggled at the City Ground and Dorgu was recalled to face Tottenham before the international break.",
      "When fans have watched Dorgu this season, they have wanted Dalot to start at left wing-back. When Dalot has come into the team, they have wanted Dorgu to return to the side. The biggest criticism of Dorgu is his lack of end product. The 21-year-old often finds himself in promising positions down the left wing, but his crosses into the box leave a lot to be desired.",
      "Dorgu has recorded just a single assist this season, which isn't good enough considering the areas he roams into. The ball must have fallen to him in promising positions half a dozen times during the Manchester derby in September, and he wasn't able to carve out a goalscoring opportunity for a teammate.",
      "Although Dorgu was naturally disappointed after Denmark's defeat to Scotland, it was at least a reminder that he can provide value in the final third after an unconvincing spell in a United shirt. Dorgu is likely to start when United welcome Everton to Old Trafford on Monday night. Dalot needs to be taken out of the firing line, but he could be quickly recalled if Dorgu doesn't perform.",
      "There has been no perfect option for Amorim on the left side of the team, but Dorgu now has an opportunity to kick on following his goal for Denmark during the international break.",
      "While the Danish press were complimentary of Dorgu's goal against Scotland, they picked up on what every United fan has been saying: his crosses into the box weren't good enough.",
      "That is the area of Dorgu's game that must improve if he wants to establish himself as a consistent starter. Amorim's system relies on the wing-backs contributing in the final third.",
      "It must be factored in that Dorgu only arrived at Old Trafford from Lecce a little over nine months ago, but a new signing in his position may be considered if he doesn't start to perform.",
      "The good news is that Dorgu seems like a confidence player, someone who will perform better after scoring a goal. During his interview at Carrington in August, he admitted he took a shot from distance on the opening day of the season against Arsenal purely because his confidence levels had increased.",
      "Dorgu looked sharp throughout pre-season in the United States and approached the campaign full of confidence, but he hasn't played like someone brimming with self-belief in recent weeks.",
      "Perhaps regaining that confidence will be the key to Dorgu improving when domestic football returns.",

      "The loan spell to Catalonia was the last throw of the dice for Rashford. His bridges were burnt with Ruben Amorim and, for all involved, the best thing to do was to let him leave.",
      "Rashford wanted Barca in January but an approach was not deemed viable by the La Liga giants. Fortunately for the United academy graduate, they returned in the summer and the deal was done.",
      "He joined the Camp Nou club on a season-long loan with the option to purchase him in the summer. If all goes according to plan for United, Rashford will impress, Barca will trigger that option and the winger's time in Spain continues.",
      "Six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances suggests Barca will want to keep Rashford. Whether they have the finances to do it is another issue. Barca can sign the England international for £28m in the summer but the financial pressures Barcelona face are well documented.",
      "No matter how well Rashford does at Barca or for England, he will not have a place to come back to at Old Trafford. Amorim has made his mind up and therefore the task would be to find him a new club.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "With that in mind, United know what they can't do. Sell Rashford to a Premier League rival. In Spain, El Nacional has reported that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have both made early contact with Rashford's agent to try and persuade him to move to the Premier League. United can't let that happen.",
      "If he was to impress in the Premier League, suddenly Rashford becomes a more prominent issue for the United head coach. So ideally United must find a way of making things work with Barca. The alternative of him returning to England with Chelsea or Spurs is not worth thinking about.",

      "There were several players from the academy sent on loan to gain experience. Some of those youngsters are excelling, while others have not made the impact they might have hoped. United loaned 18 players in total - and here is how they are faring this season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been hit with a 12-point deduction due to their ownership situation, but they were able to promise regular game time to Amass, who has made 11 starts. The youngster scored his first senior goal against Southampton and United are delighted with his stint so far.",
      "Collyer was limited to seven substitute appearances after his arrival. He broke into the starting team against Millwall last month and retained his role in the next game, but he picked up a muscle injury.",
      "Ennis spent the second half of last season with promotion-winning Doncaster Rovers. The youngster joined Fleetwood on a season-long deal for this campaign and he has started eight league games. Has contributed two goals and an assist during his positive loan spell in League Two.",
      "Gore picked up an injury shortly after signing for Rotherham last January, but he made a strong impression in the time he was available, so he was re-signed for this season. Gore has been crucial for Rotherham in midfield. Has started in 15 games in League One and has been one of their best players.",
      "Onana has received praise in the Turkish media since his move to Trabzonspor, who have lost just once in the league from a possible eight games since he signed. The 29-year-old has recorded three clean sheets and helped Trabzonspor to third in the table.",
      "After missing the opening two games of the League Two campaign due to a minor injury, Harrison started the next four games for Shrewsbury Town before reporting for England Under-20 duty in September. In his absence, another young goalkeeper came into the side and has earned first-choice status over Harrison.",

      "Moorhouse has made 15 appearances for League One side Leyton Orient, but just four of those have been league starts. The youngster has shown glimpses of quality from the bench.",
      "Dave Hughes, who coached Ogunneye in United's academy, has just departed Newport County. That might impact Ogunneye's role in the squad, but the youngster has made 13 league starts in League Two so far and gained valuable experience, albeit in a struggling dressing room.",
      "Barcelona seemed a great fit for Rashford to rediscover his form. The United academy graduate has contributed six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances this season, and has looked back to his best.",

      "Zidane Iqbal is used to making history.",
      "The midfielder became the first British-born South Asian to represent Manchester United and the first to play in the Champions League. Iqbal came off the bench against Young Boys in December 2021 and at that stage in his career it looked only a matter of time until he was handed more regular opportunities.",
      "Chances may not have materialised at Old Trafford but Iqbal and his Iraq team-mates have a significant one tonight. A win against the United Arab Emirates in the home leg of their World Cup qualifying play-off will keep alive the dream of qualifying for the tournament next summer.",
      "Iqbal, who was the first Iraqi to play for United, came off the bench in last week's first leg, which ended 1-1 and leaves Iraq as marginal favourites to progress. Should they prevail they will enter a six team inter-continental play-off in March. Their world ranking is likely to see them go straight into one of the two finals and thus one win away from the World Cup.",
      "For Iraq that would be a first appearance since their sole qualification in 1986. For Iqbal it would be the latest piece of history and perhaps vindication for opting to leave United and move to Utrecht in the Netherlands.",
      "The tipping point for the now 22-year-old was a lack of opportunities and a seeming lack of trust from then manager Erik ten Hag in granting him a first team chance during the 2022-23 campaign.",
      "\"I thought I would get a chance and unfortunately I didn’t,\" said Iqbal in an interview last summer. \"I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",
      "\"I spoke to my dad and agent and said: 'I can't do this for another year'. From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team. For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the Under-23s. I thought to myself, 'I'm just like a number'.",
      "\"I was supposed to start a cup game against Charlton. I was in all the shapes and patterns in pre-match training. I was starting as a 10 and Lisandro Martinez came up to me and said: 'Now's your chance'. He talked to me and said, 'all of us are supporting you. Just show yourself, you're a good player. We're going to fight for you, make sure you're ready to fight'. It motivated me and it was nice from him, an aggressive leader in the team, a big player. I got tickets for family and friends to see me. Finally, my chance.",
      "\"Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn't see my name. I was gutted. Then I thought I'd come off the bench. Nothing. That was the turning point for me. I didn't feel the manager respected me enough to play me.\"",
      "Iqbal turned down the chance to play at the Under-19 World Cup in April 2023 after Ten Hag told him he wanted to retain him as part of the United senior squad, but no club minutes followed and that summer he left for the Netherlands for a fee in the region of £1million.",
      "Injury has hampered his opportunity for regular minutes in Holland but he is closing in on 50 senior opportunities for the club and is a regular for the national team, scoring a crucial goal in a victory over Indonesia earlier this season. He'd love another against the UAE this afternoon (4pm), it would be the latest chapter of a history-making career.",

Mount has sent a video message to Lewis Rimmer's wife, Sarah, and two daughters, Amelia and Maddison, in the aftermath of a Range Rover hitting him and causing 'life-changing' injuries.",
      "He remains 'critically ill' in hospital after being put in an induced coma, his close friend Andy Tonge has told the MEN. Tonge described the message as 'lovely' for the family. The Bolton News quotes him as saying: \"They're big Manchester United supporters, so this was lovely to receive, what a guy.\"",
      "Mount is said to have shared his condolences and expressed his sorrow at hearing what happened to Rimmer. He also relayed that \"everyone at Manchester United is thinking of them and sending all their love.\" A fundraiser set up by friends to raise money for the family has received over £100,000 in donations.",
      "Tonge has said: \"The incident seems to have really struck a chord with people. It happened during half term, and it’s shocked so many because it could so easily have been a child who might not have been as strong as Lewis is proving to be.",
      "\"Many feel that Lewis’ strength and fight over the last few weeks is nothing short of remarkable.",
      "\"The fact that it took place at a local supermarket, used by so many of us, has created an even stronger sense of, 'This could have happened to anyone of us.'\"",
      "Tonge added: \"Lewis, unfortunately, is still critically ill and remains in an induced coma, three weeks on. Sarah and the family have been by his side every single day, and the fundraiser has genuinely lifted them.",

      "Modern football is often a reflection of the world surrounding it.",
      "When the older generations were watching the sport in the 1960s and 1970s, discussions surrounding the mental stability of a player or the squad was rarely aired. However, as the world became more aware of the challenges of mental health, football has accepted it and now each Premier League club takes into account the psychological fortitude of a player during every aspect of their career - all the way from scouting to the day they depart.",
      "Manchester United are no exception and within their current squad there are two players who are facing mental challenges which shall be putting them to the test. First, is Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Little more than a year after suffering a severe foot injury, the Argentine damaged his ACL and has been sidelined since February. He is now back with the United camp as he continues his recovery and his return to the pitch is expected before the festive period.",
      "But managing to navigate past the mental barrier of returning to professional football will be the crucial step in Martinez's recovery. Specialist in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University Dr Martin Turner, who has worked with The FA and Scarlets Rugby, believes the 27-year-old could come back a stronger athlete.",
      "\"I imagine he [Martinez] will be worrying that it [his injury] would happen again,\" Dr Turner told MEN Sport. \"That is just sensible. That is just the reality.",
      "\"What you wouldn’t want a player like that to do is delude themselves that this will never happen again and everything is always going to be hunky-dory because sport is so unpredictable, and there is so much uncertainty that you can never really predict what is going to happen.",
      "\"But having gone through two quite difficult injuries, he will have learnt quite a lot and his personality and character would have had some shifts. From my experience of working with athletes who have especially had these back-to-back injuries and even sometimes surgeries, they do develop a shift in their personality.",
      "\"I wouldn’t say it is necessarily more resilience, but there is clarity there of what this means to them. They suddenly have a gratitude and thinking of: ‘Well, this could go away at any minute, so I am going to apply myself doubly compared to what I was doing before. I am going to really take care of this and do all the right things.'\"",
      "\"You can’t put it to one side and say that is done now because there will be monitoring that takes place after training and after performances around that injury and around recovery to make sure that everything is going well.",
      "\"There will be physical limitations because it will have been a long time since they have played to the intensity of a proper game.",
      "\"So it is not just a case of putting it to the back of your mind but about trusting the medical professionals you are working with to know that they would not let you step on this pitch, if you wasn’t physically right. Players have to take confidence from that and trust the people they are working with and then they can trust their bodies.\"",
      "Martinez's teammate Bryan Mbeumo is currently negotiating a different type of mental challenge heading out of the international break. Last week, Cameroon lost to DR Congo in World Cup qualifying meaning Mbeumo's national team will not be competing in the USA, Mexico and Canada next summer.",
      "Missing out on the World Cup, arguably the pinnacle of football, will have been a bitter blow for Mbeumo to take but Dr Turner believes that United do not have to fear the forward's confidence dropping upon his return to England.",
      "\"I am not sure they would have to do, or do anything special there,\" he explained. \"Experienced players are able to lift themselves, really, and move on quite quickly. One of the good things about football in particular is how quickly things move from game-to-game.",
      "\"Say you play badly and then you play well in the next game, it is sort of completely forgotten. Things move on so quickly so he would be expected to come back and hit the ground running and get his club mentality on.",
      "\"I think the direction of football, particularly in this country, is more of a club mentality and it is realised that is your bread and butter. I wouldn’t foresee any issues there and I wouldn’t expect staff to do anything in particular for that player.",
      "\"I might be wrong and I have no idea what is going on behind the scenes, but from my experience of being in environments like that, it would be an expectation to get back on your feet and go again.",
      "\"The more that you make a big deal of something that has happened or bring it into the room, the more that is going to affect other players so you have got to get him back moving, playing and within the mentality of the squad.\"",

      "Earlier this month, Manchester United fans were left scratching their heads as one of their best players this season was snubbed again.",
      "Luke Shaw endured a tough start to the season, following on from a campaign ruined by injuries. The 2024/25 season did not go according to plan for anyone in red, but Shaw in particular was being doubted after another season spent mainly on the sidelines.",
      "However, full credit must go to Shaw for the manner in which he has bounced back.",
      "Following the disaster at Manchester City, Shaw has been dependable for the Reds this campaign in a back three. He had to deal with plenty of criticism following that derby day defeat - notably from Roy Keane - and after addressing it, he set about making amends.",
      "Ever since that game, Shaw has got better and better for United and you can see him settling into his new role on the left side of defence. That's why it was surprising when England head coach Thomas Tuchel overlooked him for the final World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "While being overlooked for selection will have been a blow to Shaw, Ruben Amorim will have taken the positives from the decision. He admitted himself, from a selfish perspective, he wanted all his players to be training and recovering at United during the international break. But he would still be delighted to see Shaw competing with England.",
      "\"For me, I want him to go to the national team, but I also want Luke Shaw to train with me, recover with me, and be prepared for my game, so I'm a little bit selfish on that, so if he's not going to the national team, for me it's fine, because I can control better what he's doing,\" Amorim said earlier this season.",
      "While missing out on the November camp was a big blow for Shaw, Tuchel has admitted it is not necessarily the end of his World Cup dream. \"First of all, it's my job now to make contact with everyone,\" the England head coach said at the end of the Three Lions' final international break this year.",
      "\"Players like Trent [Alexander-Arnold], players that are on our long list, 55, 60 players, to reach out to them, be in touch with them, explain to them why they were not here. Explain to them what they have to do, where they can improve.",
      "\"Can they even do something or is it just a choice, so this is my job in the next weeks and months.\"",
      "Shaw and Harry Maguire will be on Tuchel's list of 55-60 players who he is in contact with to discuss their spots in the England squad.",
      "That phone call should work to United's benefit. Shaw will know exactly what he needs to do over the next few months to put himself in contention and that can only help United.",
      "Shaw will be eager to show Tuchel that he was wrong to overlook him. The best way to do that will be to impress for Amorim and the Reds.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt has admitted he is finding the five-at-the-back system under Ruben Amorim easier as time progresses.",
      "Amorim has been heavily criticised for his decision to stick with the five-at-the-back defence, with three centre-backs playing alongside two wing-backs. Some argued the Portuguese head coach needed to be pragmatic and revert to a traditional four-at-the-back system in order to secure results.",
      "Prior to the Burnley victory and with scrutiny mounting, the United boss told reporters: \"Guys, if I feel that it's best to change... I played all my life in the 4-4-2, 4-3-3. The only system that I didn't play one minute: 3-4-3.",
      "\"I just have one idea that we need to be so good in this way of playing, then we are going to adapt. It's like some coaches have a mentality that I'm going to put this system, and then I'm going to change.",
      "\"What I'm thinking is that we have one system that is going to adapt to different systems, and then when everyone is doing this with his eyes shut, I'm going to change a lot of things.\"",
      "United are on a five-game unbeaten run and sit a point outside the top four. Integral to this recent form has been De Ligt, who has started every Premier League match for Amorim this season.",
      "On Monday night, he played the full 90 minutes alongside Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk in a back four as the Netherlands beat Lithuania in their final World Cup qualifier to top their group. After the game, De Ligt was quizzed on his preference and the 26-year-old insisted that he does not have one.",
      "\"No, I don't really have a preference,\" he told Flashscore. \"We play with a five-man defence at Manchester United, but on paper, we defend with four.",
      "\"It didn't feel awkward today; it felt the same as always. I can play in both systems. I'm more experienced with a five-man defence now; the more experience you have, the easier it gets.\"",
      "In the last match before the November international break, you could see De Ligt's point in practice. United would often drop to a back four with Luke Shaw moving into central midfield.",
      "The Netherlands have now qualified for the World Cup and De Ligt expressed his delight post-match to have made his first start for his country since last November. \"Whether it's a comeback? Yeah, a bit,\" he admitted.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",

      "But first we start with some really massive news…",
      "",
      "Mediawatch mostly just wants to watch Ian Wright calling out the racist media over their treatment of Jude Bellingham on repeat, but we accept that we must deal in trivialities.",
      "So we start with The Sun‘s exclusive story which is apparently the biggest thing in football right now:",
      "Nicolas Jackson determined to NOT return to Chelsea as he fights for permanent Bayern transfer amid shock friendship",
      "So, a man who pushed through a loan move to one of the biggest clubs in the world is – and this is going to blow your mind – really quite keen on staying there.",
      "SunSport has been told by a source close to the player that the striker is very happy in Munich.",
      "That really is quite the scoop; we assumed he would be sodding miserable while competing for literally all of the trophies.",
      "But what of this ‘shock friendship’?",
      "SunSport has also been told that Jackson has struck up a brilliant relationship with Luis Diaz – who also joined Bayern Munich from Liverpool last summer – and is doing incredibly well with the Bavarians.",
      "Yes. Reel in shock that two men who have moved to Munich from the same country at the same time and speak the same language have become friends.",
      "",
      "Over at the Mirror, they are pretending the biggest story in football is that Jose Mourinho told Scotland to call up Scott McTominay, a story which first emerged over a year ago.",
      "But a close second is this:",
      "Ruben Amorim’s ban on 11 Manchester United stars after bringing in new rule",
      "And what is this ‘ban’? It’s a ‘prohibition on holidays during international breaks’, apparently. And it’s been in place for the last year (‘new rule’, our hairy arse) but now it’s apparently hot news that ‘Manchester United stars’ like Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Chido Obi have all been ‘banned’ from jetting off abroad on holiday.",
      "We bet Tom Heaton really f***ing kicked off.",
      "",
      "Curiously, the Daily Mail are not continuing their obsession with Jude Bellingham – oddly, they have been uncharacteristically slow in transcribing those Ian Wright quotes – but are instead focusing on Jamie Carragher.",
      "Jamie Carragher warns Liverpool could MISS OUT on Champions League qualification without January signings in one key area – despite £450m summer spend",
      "The capital letters have amused us; they are eighth in the Premier League and technically on course to MISS OUT.",
      "",
      "The propaganda has begun in the Liverpool Echo, who would like it to be known that actually, Liverpool do need to strengthen their squad despite spending over £400m in the summer.",
      "Liverpool can sign Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi in January – but transfer critics miss point",
      "And what point are they/we missing exactly?",
      "Liverpool oversaw a record-breaking summer transfer window as they brought in 10 new faces, including eight senior players, as part of a £450m spending spree. They had never spent or signed more in a single window.",
      "Nobody had ever spent more in a single window, fella.",
      "Of course, such business came against the caveat of the Reds also banking roughly £200m from player sales as 10 members of Arne Slot’s Premier League title-winning squad moved on.",
      "Ten members? Really?",
      "Eight players who featured for even a single minute or more in the Premier League last season left Liverpool in the summer, and that included third-choice goalkeeper Vitezslav Jaros. Who are these other two? Tyler Morton because he sat on the bench a few times? Ben Gannon-Doak, who spent the season on loan at Middlesbrough?",
      "Is that really the point that ‘transfer critics’ miss?",
      "It seems the actual point that the ‘critics’ miss is that ‘both Semenyo and Guehi could be added to their ranks without the need to remove any senior players’ from their Premier League squad. Well that will surely silence all the ‘transfer critics’ who thought that spending over £400m in one window really should be enough.",
      "Set-pieces and long throws may be trendy but who really gets into football for those? We have the five best open-play Premier League goals of the season.",
      "The brilliance of Barnes. The bend of Beckham. The blood of Butcher. Behold the England B-Team. And yes, there’s room for Bellingham.",
      "Jude Bellingham is one of the best footballers in the world and some England fans are plain weird for wanting him nowhere near the team.",
      "We are sick to the back teeth of Premier League footballers being given underserved dues and so we’ve exposed the most overrated stars of every club.",
      "Sunderland could be scuppered by AFCON, and Man Utd might suffer, but Arsenal are unaffected and may actually profit. Leeds too…",

      "Whether by fans, managers, sporting directors, pundits, us journos or even themselves, these are the most overrated players at each Premier League club.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: William Saliba\nWe may be about to see just how good Saliba really is as superior centre-back partner Gabriel faces up to a couple of months on the sidelines, but also probably not because Christhian Mosquera or Piero Hincapie will be the perfectly capable replacements now charged with making the champion coat-tail rider look a whole lot better than he actually is.",
      "And if it’s not them successfully helping Saliba pull the wool over our eyes then it could be one of the dozen or so full-back-cum-centre-backs Mikel Arteta has to choose from. Facetiousness aside, Arsenal really should take £100m from Real Madrid. Any drop-off without Saliba, if indeed there was one, would be negligible.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins\nAlways be wary of a striker praised for “stretching defences” as the subtext is almost always that they’re a bit sh*t at putting the ball in the back of the net. Watkins is very, very good at stretching defences.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Justin Kluivert\nWe can’t quite believe he didn’t join Tottenham before experiencing what would be seen as a dip in form from the high of last season, but on the basis of his six previous seasons of senior football, is much more likely the mediocre standard we can continue to expect from Kluivert.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Jordan Henderson\nWe concede that Henderson has been better than we expected (and hoped) on his return to the Premier League. But perhaps clouded by our great lily-livered lefty dislike of a man who moved to Saudi Arabia having been such a supposedly staunch supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, we don’t hold pointing, shouting and playing a couple of long balls in quite such high regard as those who worship at the altar of the midfielder with an entirely broken moral compass.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Carlos Baleba\nJust imagine the fun we would currently be having if Baleba was putting in these almost comically poor performances compared to last season for a Manchester United side that had panicked into his £100m transfer.",
      "The downturn could be down to his head being turned, but if he turned it a little more often he may not get caught in possession quite as much, amirite? Crikey Moses he’s no Moises [Caicedo].",
      "",
      "Burnley: Marcus Edwards\nAt one stage linked fairly heavily with a return to Tottenham or to Manchester United in one of the clearest examples of football clubs confusing ‘looking at who happens to be playing quite a lot for Sporting’ with actual scouting. Edwards has made three substitute appearances totalling 21 minutes this season.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Liam Delap\nAdmittedly a very small sample size thanks to the injury and absurd red card, but on a scale from useless lump to world-class striker he’s currently closer to Chris Sutton than Didier Drogba.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Eddie Nketiah\n“I’m astounded they let Nketiah join Palace,” Teddy Sheringham said in February. “I think he is a young Ian Wright.”",
      "Wright scored 113 Premier League goals in 213 games. Nketiah has scored 23 in 150.",
      "",
      "Everton: Jack Grealish\nWe were among those banging the Grealish for England drum, irked by his snub as the Premier League’s runaway assist leader with four by the time the September internationals rolled around. But two of those assists came against Wolves, and should thus be stricken from the record, and he hasn’t managed another in his seven games since, scoring just one goal.",
      "In the cold light of day, having put down our ‘We heart Jack’ placards, we’ve come to accept that England are probably better off with a bit of speed on the left wing and our ‘top lads’ agenda may be clouding our view with regard to him playing in a No.10 position he’s taken up roughly thrice in the last five seasons.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Emile Smith Rowe\nWe can’t quite work out if he’s suffered or benefited from that 18 months or so when he was paired with Bukayo Saka as the future of Arsenal. The reputation built partly through that briefly inextricable link will have played a role in his move to Fulham, but also means we may always have expected too much.",
      "While one Hale End pin-up is now widely regarded as one of the best footballers on the planet, the other tends to watch Harry Wilson play football from the bench.",
      "",
      "Leeds: Dominic Calvert-Lewin\n58 goals in 248 Premier League games raises one big question: How has a striker who’s only scored 58 goals in 248 Premier League games played 248 Premier League games? Take out a two-season glut and he’s scored 25 goals in 163.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Florian Wirtz\nWe’re currently at the anger stage in the Premier League flop process, barraged by Wirtz advocates, mainly hailing from his homeland, insisting Gary Neville and his other critics will soon be eating their words.",
      "If it’s anything like the stages of grief, and we suspect it is as Bundesliga voices have already had great difficulty accepting the reality of the loss of Wirtz in that initial period of denial, we can expect Alexander Isak and others to be put forward as bigger flops in a bargaining bid, before depression and finally acceptance that a) Wirtz was hugely overrated, and b) the Premier League is indeed, without question, The Best League In The World.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Tijjani Reijnders\nIt turns out a game against Wolves on the opening day of the season, after which Reijnders was hailed as Manchester City’s answer to Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and David Silva in one neat little 82kg bundle, isn’t quite the harbinger of success many thought it was.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Senne Lammens\nWe very much enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek “are you Schmeichel in disguise?” chants from Manchester United fans as Lammens claimed simple crosses that his recent predecessors often contrived to make a mess of on his debut against Sunderland.",
      "But those tongues are now conspicuously absent from cheeks as genuine claims are being made about the 23-year-old being the undisputed answer to the Red Devils’ goalkeeping woes after literally five games of simple competency.",
      "",
      "Newcastle: Sandro Tonali\n“I would probably choose Tonali at this point,” said Paul Scholes when asked who’s currently the Premier League’s best midfielder. Not even the best midfielder at his club, mate.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Omari Hutchinson\nWe wonder if the fourth manager Evangelos Marinakis picks to manage Forest this season might fancy the £37m club-record signing.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Simon Adingra\nNot easy – they’re fourth, FFS – but of the 13 players Sunderland signed in the summer we were perhaps most excited by what Adingra might do having impressed in fits and starts at Brighton; it’s not really happened for him.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Rodrigo Bentancur\nNever has a footballer been more highly regarded on the basis of having some poise in possession. Bentancur is frequently seen as a key cog in the Tottenham midfield, and we wholeheartedly agree, but only because the other members of said midfield have as much poise as someone three sheets to the wind attempting to fumble their key into a lock.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Lucas Paqueta\nWe are very intrigued by what might happen if Paqueta extricates himself from West Ham in 2026, as is suggested will be the case, because for every game in which he does something entirely out of keeping with the quality of the football club he currently plays for, there are half a dozen more where he looks as though he might have found his level.",

      "The reality was that a team facing the prospect of relegation for roughly 94 of the 95 minutes played, not far off half of which they had to play away from home against the best team in the league with 10 men because of Barton’s implosion, was simply exhausted.",
      "As with any decent conspiracy theory, there are salient points among the ruins of absurdity: the kick-off thing was weird; Djibril Cisse did celebrate with Samir Nasri – an old friend from their time together at Marseille – at the final whistle; and there were a handful of Manchester City alumni in the QPR side.",
      "Three, to be exact. The precise same number of former Manchester United players in the Sunderland team which dozed to a 1-0 defeat at the Stadium of Light 140 miles away, failing to muster a single shot from the 65th minute onwards.",
      "And Sir Alex Ferguson had an inside agent working for him in the QPR ranks. When Anton Ferdinand feels the need to reiterate four times in one sentence how he “was p*ssed off” at having cost his brother a Premier League title eight years after the fact, the idea that Manchester City benefited from a light dose of match-fixing starts to collapse in on itself.",
      "Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion, really ought to move on from the inability to make it a half-dozen. Not least because Manchester United lost the title on goal difference to a team which beat them 7-1 on aggregate that season, instigating one of the biggest yet most under-the-radar bottlings in history.",
      "But mainly because Rooney has unforgivably forced us into The Worst Person You Know Just Made a Great Point territory with his incessant cry-arsing about actual Manchester United being screwed by a team rolling over for one of their rivals.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b*llocks,” Barton said in October. With Rooney seemingly dangerously close to labelling each of the above lizard people Illuminati members who sleep with 5G masts, it is a line he would do well to retire.",
      "Set-pieces and long throws may be trendy but who really gets into football for those? We have the five best open-play Premier League goals of the season.",
      "We are pulling ourselves away from Jude Bellingham to look at an 11-man Manchester United ban and Liverpool transfer critics.",
      "We don’t know if Wayne Rooney just forgot about 14-goal Erling Haaland but there’s no explaining why he picked an Arsenal summer signing in his top three Premier League players.",
      "The brilliance of Barnes. The bend of Beckham. The blood of Butcher. Behold the England B-Team. And yes, there’s room for Bellingham.",
      "Jude Bellingham is one of the best footballers in the world and some England fans are plain weird for wanting him nowhere near the team.",

      "A former Premier League star who was on the radar of Manchester United has put off top cubs given his wages, with two options now available to him.",
      "United are known to want to improve their midfield in January. While Casemiro has turned around a period of inconsistency, he’s due to be out of contract in the summer, while Bruno Fernandes is being played in a deeper role than he’d like.",
      "Other options Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo have struggled to convince Ruben Amorim they should be playing.",
      "Premier League stars such as Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are all being linked, but of late it has been suggested United don’t feel a move for any of them is likely in the winter.",
      "The option of Ruben Neves – who played 177 times in the Premier League for Wolves – could be an intriguing one, as Amorim is known to be a fan of his, and United have been credited with interest in him.",
      "Neves is out of contract with Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in the summer, and therefore Caught Offside reports he’ll be available for €20million (£17.7m) in the winter.",
      "But there is a key issue in that his £410,000-per-week wages have put off top European clubs, with the suggestion that if a move to United or another interested club such as Newcastle is to happen, the midfielder will have to drop his demands.",
      "The report suggests that at the moment, a move to Turkey looks most likely for Neves, with Galatasaray and Fenerbahce in the mix.",
      "However, it is also suggested that if other top clubs don’t secure their favoured targets, there could be a lot of interest in Neves.",
      "A £17.1million price tag for a 28-year-old who starred during his time in England and has remained a fixture of the Portugal side since his move to Saudi would be a steal, though it’s not a surprise that the massive wages aren’t rousing many clubs.",
      "If United don’t see paying a big fee for any of the three Premier League midfielders they are tracking as plausible in the winter window, then they’re very unlikely to splash out on a huge contract instead.",
      "Neves would be a great signing in January if his wages were less of a strain, but they’d surely have to be significantly reduced, given the Red Devils’ highest wage is £350,000 per week, and that’s one of only two players who earn over £200,000 per week.",
      "Man Utd could still sign Ruben Neves from Al-Hilal in the January transfer window but there’s one main stumbling block, according to reports.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has told Spurs they have “got to” land a former Premier League star on £410,000 per week, as a separate report has revealed his desire ...",
      "According to reports, a Manchester United ‘midfielder transfer’ is ‘gaining momentum’ ahead of the winter transfer window for four reasons.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly identified former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves as their new ‘priority’ target in midfield ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘preparing’ a record ‘offer’ for Brighton star Carlos Baleba as they look to make an ‘historic signing’."

      "United’s attack has been improved by some good signings of late. In the summer, they added Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo to their attack.",
      "Each look as if they are coming into their own, having all scored, and Mbeumo has become the star of the show, earning the Premier League player of the month award for October.",
      "While the signings from within the Premier League look to have been best for United so far, they’ve been linked with a shock move for Neymar, who headed back to boyhood club Santos this season.",
      "Fichajes reports the Brazilian is considering a change of scenery, as he’s aware remaining in Brazil could jeopardise his place with the national team, and United are linked.",
      "Neymar, having spent around a year out injured, has not represented Brazil since 2023, and having played for Al-Hilal and now Santos, is not at the level he once was.",
      "He’s scored three times in 16 Brazilian Serie A games this term and his contract is up at the end of the season, in December.",
      "It is known that he could be on the move, with Fabrizio Romano recently stating: “Neymar is trying to help, but don’t forget that Neymar could eventually be available as a free agent from the beginning of January.",
      "“So an interesting situation to follow because Neymar could consider a move in the January transfer window. Now Neymar wants to be 100 per cent focused on his priority, so to help Santos avoid relegation and to do his best for his club.",
      "“In this moment Neymar is not having any advanced negotiation, but some calls have started to understand the situation of Neymar.",
      "“When there is a player of his level available on the market, it is obviously an opportunity. Okay, maybe Neymar is not in the best physical condition now, Neymar is coming from an injury, he had several injuries recently.",
      "“But now he’s back, he’s fit, he’s trying to help Santos.",
      "“He’s trying to find his best condition, and so keep an eye on Neymar because he could be one of the names to watch for the January transfer window on a free transfer, and so that could be an interesting situation to follow.”",
      "Fichajes suggests a move to United is ‘viable’ but a lack of European competition – with global exposure said to be needed for Neymar to return to the fold with Brazil – is a drawback.",
      "But after three years away from an elite league, Neymar is in no position to be demanding anything of the sort, and United should steer well clear.",
      "They seem to have gotten themselves back into a good spot, challenging towards the top of the Premier League, and signing a past-it Neymar is not going to help them.",
      "Should he join and fail to have an impact – which is likely given he’s not played at a good level for years now – it may only breed discontent within the club, and they’ll have wasted a transfer trying to grant somebody his wish of returning to the Brazilian side.",
      "Further to that, they wouldn’t dream of signing a player with just three league goals in his last season were it anybody else, so signing Neymar would essentially be just for his name.",
      "It’s also a bad look for Neymar if he is to leave. After his emotional homecoming for the swansong of his career, to decide actually, these lot aren’t great and I’m better off going and playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world, perhaps isn’t the best call.",

      "United’s attack has been more impactful this season than it was last. Indeed, they have scored 19 Premier League goals this term, only bettered by the league’s top three.",
      "They are also in reach of the top three, just two points from Chelsea in third, and four points from Manchester City, in second.",
      "Last term, when United finished 15th in the league, none of their players reached double figures for goals, and in 32 games, then-new signing Joshua Zirkzee scored just three goals.",

      "If he is not used, or only used sparingly, then ‘alarm bells’ are expected to start ringing. It would be an opportunity for United to test out what their attack could be like during AFCON.",

      "He said: “But the expectation is for three, maximum four weeks, out for Sesko. So the hope is to have him available at the beginning of December. This could be important to understand also the future of Joshua Zirkzee because Zirkzee would be open to leaving Man Utd in the January transfer window.",

      "Antoine Semenyo and Joao Gomes have been linked with Arsenal and Manchester United respectively but they share one really quite obvious thing in common.",
      "Is it that they are breaking their silence? It might be…",
      "",
      "Perhaps it is ultimately on Mediawatch for seeing a headline of ‘How depleted Arsenal could line up in the derby against Tottenham after Mikel Arteta suffers crushing injury blow in defence’ atop the Daily Mirror website – after a genuinely brilliant and newsworthy round of international games, no less – and expecting a little more than ‘the same ten players and then one of a few eminently viable replacements for Gabriel’.",
      "But yeah, when the biggest story in all of football is apparently not Scott McBallon d’Orminay, Curacao forcing Steve McClaren to seek unemployment or Andy Robertson making everyone cry, and is instead ‘Arsenal might play the really good Cristhian Mosquera or £45m Piero Hincapie for a bit because one of their defenders is injured’, you do have to wonder what the point of this all is.",
      "",
      "It is also a bit weird to see scaremongering stories about how Gabriel could be sidelined until JANUARY (the Daily Mirror and Star both go all caps).",
      "That does incorporate a fairly large number of games in a condensed part of the fixture schedule so is certainly not ideal, but it is also late November so not sure the panicked shouting about JANUARY is really necessary.",
      "",
      "Actually, sticking with Arsenal…",
      "‘Arsenal discover true extent of major injury blow amid Liverpool title race’",
      "",
      "There is some better news for Arsenal in the form of this Daily Mirror website story:",
      "‘Antoine Semenyo has already hinted at transfer preference ahead of potential £65m move’",
      "And that is indeed Arsenal, who definitely have the need for a forward who can play across the frontline because Bukayo Saka, Noni Madueke, Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Eberechi Eze, Kai Havertz, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri and Max Dowman really doesn’t cut it in terms of depth.",
      "Looking beyond boring specifics like whether Arsenal actually need to or can even spend £65m on another attacker, what precisely was this ‘hint’ that Semenyo himself dropped about his ‘transfer preference’?",
      "“I am an Arsenal fan.”",
      "Fair enough. Deal done.",
      "“I don’t conflict the two with my job.”",

      "“It is great to play against Arsenal, a team I have watched all my life and I want to play for the top clubs as well. In order for that to happen, I need to prove it.”",
      "Starting to sound a little less like a ‘hint’ and more like a really good footballer whose ‘transfer preference’ is just generally to reach the highest level possible and play for one of the unnamed ‘top clubs’. Because obviously.",
      "Semenyo was even asked specifically in that October 2024 Athletic interview whether joining Arsenal would be a “dream”, his response to which was simply: “Yeah, any team that plays Champions League, Europa (League) – that’s the aim.” So the idea that something said more than a year ago constitutes an Arsenal boost of any kind is nonsense.",
      "Breaking news: footballer’s transfer preference is to join a Champions League team. It’s also believed he might want a decent wage. More as we get it.",

      "You’d think a ‘clear message to Man United’ would actually reference Man United or at least talk about a competition they’re in, but no.",
      "It does reference Liverpool, however; Gomes called them “a team I would play for”. And the big, grown-up, mature MEN write that ‘while his support for rivals Liverpool might be hard for United fans to hear, football moves on quickly’.",
      "If there are Manchester United fans out there struggling to come to terms with the idea that a potential transfer target once talked up the idea of playing for Liverpool over three years ago, just know that there are people you can talk to and support networks to reach out to for help.",
      "Wait until they find out who Semenyo supports.",
      "But that is not all from Gomes. He has also ‘broken his silence on social media since emerging as a potential target for Manchester United’ to send a ‘clear ‘excited’ message’.",
      "His positively monastic ‘silence’ lasted about eight days, which might sound a lot but his most recent posts before then were on October 31, October 26 and October 9; the bloke is not exactly permanently online.",
      "And how did Gomes ‘break his silence’ in a ‘clear ‘excited’ message’ which is apparently relevant to Manchester United? By posting very specifically about Wolves and being ‘excited to do what no one believes, for us and for our city,’ in terms of helping them avoid relegation.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United are highly unlikely to be drawn into the transfer chase for Antoine Semenyo in January after two top sources outlined where Ruben Amorim’s priorities lie and with the Red Devils putting all their energies into another target instead.",
      "The Red Devils invested heavily into strengthening their attack this summer, spending well over £200m on the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. And while the triple coup is starting to pay dividends, Manchester United could have added a different dimension to their attack had they instead opted to pursue Semenyo.",
      "Indeed, it has since emerged that United had a very serious interest in the 25-year-old Bournemouth star, with Amorim even meeting the player for dinner to discuss a prospective move.",
      "That’s according to transfer journalist, Duncan Castles, who claims Amorim met with the player to assess his personality and with the United boss ultimately informing club bosses he felt the player had what it takes to become a success at Old Trafford.",
      "That comes after David Ornstein had previously described the Portuguese as being “very fond” of the Bournemouth star.",
      "However, United’s unwillingness to pay more than £55m saw the deal collapse and ultimately saw the winger sign a new five-year deal with the Cherries.",
      "This week, though, it has emerged that Semenyo‘s deal contains a release clause worth just £60m, plus £5m in add-ons to prise him away from the Vitality Stadium and sparking something of a mad scramble for the Ghana international.",
      "And while sources have revealed it is Liverpool “ahead in the race”, the player continues to be linked with other sides, most notably Tottenham Hotspur and Man Utd.",
      "Despite that, both The Athletic and our own, Fraser Fletcher, are playing down the prospects of United rekindling a move for Semenyo in January, with the former describing a potential move to Old Trafford as ‘difficult’.",
      "Fletcher, meanwhile, insists while United still very much admire the player, their priorities in the January window and beyond lie elsewhere, with the club’s entire focus now shifted on upgrading their midfield and with three major targets the priority over the next two to three transfer windows…",
      "READ MORE 🔴⚫ Ruthless Man Utd planning £250m TRIPLE signing, with Bruno Fernandes at risk in midfield rebuild – Sources",
      "According to Castles, Amorim met Semenyo for dinner in a London restaurant to discuss a potential move north over the summer and prior to the player inking his extension at the Vitality Stadium.",
      "Castles told The Transfers Podcast: “They used the same strategy with Cunha and Mbeumo in that they agreed personal terms with Semenyo before attempting to agree a fee with Bournemouth.",
      "“They even had Amorim take him for a meal in London at the end of the season so Amorim could judge his character – again a similar process to Cunha and Mbeumo.”",
      "United’s prospects of signing Semenyo ultimately failed when he committed instead to the Cherries, though Castles also explains that United’s willingness to only pay the player 70% of the salaries offered to Mbeumo and Cunha also derailed the prospective deal.",
      "Furthermore, rival interest from Tottenham, coupled with United’s willingness to spend £62.5m to meet Cunha’s exit clause, meant the Cherries felt in a strong position to reject United’s approach and amid a suggestion they were not prepared to spend more than £55m on a player they rated at nearer the £70m bracket.",
      "While Semenyo was a player who ultimately slipped through their net, Castles is adamant he was a player they could have signed in addition to both Cunha and Mbeumo, if the price was right.",
      "And while the interest in the player remains, he is unlikely to be a priority for United, leaving his other suitors free to battle it out.",
      "Meanwhile, Paul Scholes has endorsed United’s pursuit of Elliot Anderson, but the Old Trafford legend wants Amorim to play the Nottingham Forest midfielder in a different role from what he is used to.",
      "On that new midfielder hunt, our transfer correspondent, Dean Jones, has revealed Crystal Palace’s stance around a mid-season sale of Adam Wharton, amid speculation that the Red Devils have already ‘submitted’ a ‘bid’ for the midfielder that Amorim ‘loves’.",
      "Elsewhere,  United have been confirmed as one of the clubs to have held talks with super-agent Jorge Mendes over a move to sign Borussia Dortmund attacker Karim Adeyemi next year, though sources have confirmed why the Germany star currently favours a move to Arsenal."

      "Enter the new guard: a trio of promising midfielders earmarked as the vanguard of this overhaul.",
      "Adam Wharton, the 21-year-old Crystal Palace anchor with his composed passing and prowess, embodies the Ratcliffe-backed British talent pipeline. The Eagles are believed to value Wharton at roughly £70m and that figure may well rise if he continues to impress at Selhurst Park.",
      "Carlos Baleba, Brighton’s 21-year-old Cameroonian dynamo, brings tenacity and box-to-box verve, having dazzled in the Premier League’s cutthroat mid-table battles. The Seagulls don’t intend to sell for a penny less than £100m.",
      "Rounding out the trio of ideal targets is Elliot Anderson, Nottingham Forests 23-year-old creative spark, whose silky dribbling and set-piece wizardry could unlock United’s stagnant attack. Man Utd would like to seal a deal for £60m but sources insist £80m would be required to get Forest’s reluctant green light.",
      "This isn’t mere tinkering; it’s a philosophical reset.",
      "Amorim, fresh from Sporting CP triumphs, inherited a squad bloated by past excesses under the Glazer era. Ratcliffe’s INEOS consortium, with its data-driven ethos, has already slashed non-essential spending, signalling a cultural pivot. “We’re building for eras, not seasons,” a club source confided.",
      "The midfield revamp extends beyond recruitment – expect tactical drills emphasising positional rotation and youth integration, with academy gems like Kobbie Mainoo moulded into a player more befitting Amorim’s demands.",
      "Challenges loom: navigating FFP constraints while commanding premium fees for outgoing stars, and ensuring harmony in a dressing room scarred by turbulence.",
      "Yet, if executed deftly, this youth surge could propel United back into Champions League contention by 2027, blending Amorim’s tactical acumen with Ratcliffe’s fiscal prudence.",
      "As Old Trafford braces for change, one truth endures: in football’s relentless cycle, the bold thrive. United’s midfield metamorphosis might just be the spark to reignite the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "In other news, Sir Alex Ferguson heaped special praise on one of Manchester United’s four major signings from the summer, and while two others were hailed too, one was conspicuously ignored.",
      "Fabrizio Romano as well as our own insider, Dean Jones, have both confirmed Carlos Baleba is Man Utd’s true No 1 target in central midfield above all others including Wharton and Anderson.",
      "What’s more, the Brighton man’s head has been turned and he’ll now gladly jump ship to Old Trafford if offered the opportunity.",
      "The full details in Man Utd’s potential move for Baleba – including when it could occur and for how much – can be found here.",
      "Elsewhere, TEAMtalk’s writers have delivered their verdicts on whether Man Utd or Liverpool are the best fit for Adam Wharton, who is being courted by both clubs. In one writer’s mind, Wharton’s choice is a “no-brainer.”"

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee could still be asked to stay at Old Trafford despite “good” injury news on Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Red Devils have been in good form in recent weeks with Ruben Amorim’s first back-to-back Premier League wins turning into a five-match unbeaten run.",
      "Man Utd spent big money on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko in the summer transfer window after only four clubs scored fewer goals than the Red Devils last term.",
      "That has knocked Zirkzee down the pecking order at Old Trafford and there have been rumours that he could leave on loan in the January transfer window.",
      "An injury to Sesko appeared to rule that out but, with confirmation the Slovenian will be back in time for Christmas, it was thought that there could be hope if Zirkzee chose to leave Man Utd for more playing time ahead of the World Cup.",
      "But Romano is less sure that Zirkzee – who is yet to start a Premier League match this season – will be allowed to depart in January as Amorim “wants” him to stay.",
      "READ: Antoine Semenyo to Man Utd makes no sense until Amorim addresses biggest problem position",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “There was some fear at the very beginning after the [Tottenham] game about a potential serious injury. This is why Ruben Amorim, after the match, goes to the press conference and says, ‘Let’s see what happens with Sesko because maybe his injury could affect our plans for the January transfer window.’",
      "“Why? Because if it was going to be a very long injury, maybe three months, maybe four months, maybe six months, maybe an ACL. In that case, Man Utd had to sign a new striker in the January transfer window.",
      "“But I told you right after that my information was an injury – yes, a knee injury – but not a super serious injury, not a very long injury. And so good news for Man Utd.",
      "“But what I can tell you is that Sesko is expected to be out around three weeks. So the hope of the Man Utd staff is to have Sesko ready at the beginning of December. Then, it can take a few more days, also based on how he will recover, his physical condition, United will not take any risk.",
      "“But the expectation is for three, maximum four weeks, out for Sesko. So the hope is to have him available at the beginning of December. This could be important to understand also the future of Joshua Zirkzee because Zirkzee would be open to leaving Man Utd in the January transfer window.",
      "“Maybe go on loan, maybe have the opportunity to play on a regular basis, but at the same time, he remains an important player for Man Utd. Look, now there is the AFCON, and so some players are going, there is the injury of Sesko.",
      "“If you have injuries, if you have problems, whatever happens, you need another striker, and Zirkzee can be used as a No.9, as a N0.10 behind the strikers. So for Amorim, he’s an important player. Amorim wants Zirkzee to stay.”",
      "There were rumours that Chelsea midfielder Romeo Lavia was discussed as a potential makeweight during talks that saw Alejandro Garnacho leave Man Utd for Stamford Bridge in the summer.",
      "On those claims, Romano added: “My information is that Chelsea and Man Utd never ever discussed Romeo Lavia. According to my sources, Chelsea trust Lavia. Obviously, the boy is having several injuries, so Chelsea staff are doing their best to try to improve his physical condition.",
      "“They already did a fantastic job with Reece James, so the mission is to do the same now also with Lavia. But in terms of skills, in terms of development, in terms of potential, Chelsea believe in Lavia. Chelsea invested in Romeo Lavia because they are convinced he can be something special in the future.",
      "“And so Chelsea deny all this information of offering Lavia to Man Utd. The negotiation was only for Garnacho. I can reveal to you that at the beginning of the conversation, there was a possibility for Tyrique George to be involved in the deal with Man Utd.",
      "“But I’m talking about the beginning of June. That was a very early idea in the transfer window. Nothing happened with that one. And so it was a straight transfer for Garnacho to Chelsea, but Labia, not part of this swap deal conversation.”",
      "A Manchester United attacker is felt to have a ‘crucial opportunity’ coming soon, but there will be a point prior to that in which ‘alarm bells’ could begin to ring.",
      "Man Utd summer signing Benjamin Sesko has been likened to “an academy player” by Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler after his poor start to the season.",

      "The Red Devils allowed McTominay to leave Old Trafford for around £25m in August 2024 with Erik ten Hag looking to reshape his squad at Man Utd.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked a few months later and replaced by Ruben Amorim, with Man Utd ending up with egg on their faces as McTominay helped Antonio Conte’s side win the Scudetto in his first season at the club.",
      "McTominay contributed 12 goals and four assists in 34 appearances in Serie A last term as he took the league by storm – but he has not quite reached the same levels as last season this campaign.",
      "The Scotland international has two goals and one assist in ten appearances in the league as Napoli’s recent form has seen them drop down to fourth in Serie A.",
      "And now Spanish website Fichajes, which doesn’t have the best hit rate when it comes to transfer news, claims that Everton are ‘preparing’ a €70m (£62m) offer to break their transfer record and sign McTominay from Napoli.",
      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "The report adds: ‘At Goodison Park, McTominay is seen as a strategic figure. Moyes values ​​his ability to burst into the box from deep, comparing him to the powerful Marouane Fellaini of old. This quality would give Everton a dangerous option in their attacking transitions, capable of creating havoc in the opposition’s defense.",
      "‘The club is considering a significant investment to bring him back to the Premier League. The estimated sum of 70 million demonstrates their ambition. Recent reports suggest that Everton understands the Scot could be a game-changer for their midfield, both in the short and long term, should Garner leave or lose his place in the starting lineup.’",
      "Naples journalist Vincenzo Credendino explained earlier this year why McTominay has flourished under Antonio Conte, he told the BBC: “Conte changed his system to put him in the best conditions to play.",

      "“It’s not a coincidence. McTominay is perfect for Conte as Conte is perfect for McTominay.”",
      "Speaking in December on why he chose to join Napoli, McTominay told BBC Scotland: “I saw the passionate fans, I saw the coach, I saw the players and I saw an opportunity.",
      "“I took it, I didn’t look back. It didn’t take me long to make the decision because I knew that was what I wanted and I’ll never have any regrets in my life. As soon as I put my mind to something I want to do it, that’s it. There’s no holding me back.",

      "Man Utd have made bids for Real Madrid’s Aurelien Tchouameni and AZ Alkmaar’s Kees Smit ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils are looking to sign at least one new midfielder over the next couple of transfer windows as they continue to build a head of steam under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man Utd are currently five unbeaten in the Premier League as they can look up, instead of behind them, for a change under Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils could be set for years if they get their midfield recruitment right and transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has insisted that Amorim wants to bring in players in January if they can contribute in the long term as he avoids short-term fixes.",
      "Romano told his YouTube channel: “The conversations have started between Ruben Amorim, the board, the management of Manchester United ahead of the January window.",
      "“I told you about the midfielder. I told you that Manchester United are looking for that position. But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man United are talking about the January window, the opportunities and what to do with the players who want to play more.”",
      "READ: Ex-ref Dean backs Rooney’s Man Utd conspiracy theory over Man City’s 2012 title win",
      "Romano added: “Ruben Amorim is not in for bringing in a player for just few months. A player will join Manchester United if they believe the player could be an option for the long term.",
      "“If someone joins in January it is a player who Man United can trust for the present but also for the future. This is the message of Ruben Amorim. Let’s not add players who can help for a few games and then they go back to their club.",
      "“Let’s add someone who can help us today and tomorrow. So this is the message of the coach and this will be the idea also for the January transfer window.”",
      "And now a report from Spanish website Fichajes, which can usually be taken with a pinch of salt, insists that Man Utd have made an ‘offer’ of €25m (£22m) for AZ Alkmaar midfielder Smit with Ronald Koeman recently dubbing him ‘the new Pedri’.",
      "The report adds: ‘The sporting management wants to focus on young profiles that can consolidate and grow at Old Trafford, avoiding exorbitant outlays for established footballers.",
      "‘In Manchester, they believe that its price, relatively low for the current market, could make it one of the most profitable moves of next summer.’",
      "Netherlands boss Koeman recently said of Dutch international Smit: “I almost regret mentioning his name again [Pedri], but he’s a guy who plays in the same position.",
      "“The way he turns away from his opponent, the way he scans the area, his two-footedness… I saw that in Pedri too. If he gets half his career, we’ll be very happy in the Netherlands.”",
      "Smit is not the only midfielder Man Utd have in their sights with other reports in Spain claiming that the Red Devils want to sign Real Madrid’s Tchouameni.",
      "Man Utd have ‘put forward an offer of €70 million (£62m) plus €20 million (£17m) in add-ons to try and lure him away from the Santiago Bernabéu’ but Real Madrid president Florentino Perez ‘hasn’t even considered opening negotiations’.",
      "The report adds: ‘For the Real Madrid president, Tchouaméni is completely untouchable , someone who fits perfectly into the new backbone designed to dominate Europe for the next decade. And no offer, however large, can change that view.’",
      "Real Madrid have made a decision ‘in the last few hours’ over Aurelien Tchouameni’s future after Arsenal launched a bid, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have made a huge offer to sign Real Madrid midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni as they look to strengthen Ruben Amorim’s squad, according to reports."

      "Former referee Mike Dean has backed claims from Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney conspiracy theory around Man City’s dramatic Premier League title win in 2012.",
      "The Red Devils were beaten to the Premier League title on the final day of the 2012 season despite their 1-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Man City were losing 2-1 at home to relegation-threatened QPR going into second-half stoppage time before Roberto Mancini’s side scored two goals in two minutes and five seconds to take the victory and the title.",
      "Man Utd legend Rooney has since voiced skepticism around Sergio Aguero’s late winner, while he criticised QPR’s players for “celebrating after the game with the City players”.",
      "Djibril Cisse hit back at those accusations from Rooney last month and insisted it was understandable that he celebrated with compatriot Samir Nasri as both teams had achieved something with QPR staying up.",
      "And now former Premier League referee Dean has questioned why the QPR players kicked the ball back to Man City after Edin Dzeko’s equaliser on 92 minutes.",
      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "Dean told The Overlap Fan Debate: “They [City] make it 2-2, and they [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them. And we were like, ‘what’s going on, why are they giving the ball back straightaway?’ I said [that] in the ear piece.",
      "“To kick off and give the ball straight back to them. Neil Swarbrick, the fourth official, said, ‘keep switched on, something is going to happen.’ You just knew something was going to happen. You could just tell.",
      "“What was strange about it, once QPR found out they were safe, Jamie Mackie was on the pitch celebrating while the game was still going on.”",
      "Rooney chipped in: “They had loads of ex-City players in there as well.”",
      "The Man Utd legend’s claims have previously stirred something in former Man City and QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who didn’t hold back the swears for Rooney.",
      "On Rooney’s theory, Barton said: “At the time, we were fighting for our own survival, so we had to better other people’s results on that day to stay up. As it was, we all got beat.",
      "“I have to disagree with Wayne. Wayne is trying to say that this game is some kind of bent fixture, that the lads had given up. He does say Paddy Kenny has basically thrown the two goals in that lead to City winning the league. I don’t think Paddy knew.",
      "“You might say Paddy should have done better with the goals, but I don’t think Paddy Kenny is the type of lad to throw a game to help Man City win the league.",
      "“So Wayne, and the other Man United fans – and I know loads of Man United fans have come up and asked me – no. I got told by Bobby Zamora to get someone sent off, so I tried. That’s where the book stops with me.",

      "“It might be the same fellas who were saying that if you get one more hair transplant it might come back. This might be the time you get a fringe. As you found out, that is complete nonsense.",
      "“Stop wasting your time on nonsense. The game at Man City was not thrown. Man City won the league, Man United never. Am I happy about that? Abso-f***ing-lutely, because I hate Man United. But I didn’t go out my way to make City win the league.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b****cks.",
      "“You should have got yourselves in a better position. You didn’t. Man City had to beat QPR on the last day of the season at home, who were in the bottom four. That’s your fault.",
      "“The fact he’s even had a sniff of winning the league is a testament to the lads at QPR and the battle they put up, because that was an easy f***ing win for City.’",
      "Barton added: “QPR stayed up, happy days. City won the league, happy days. And you ****s were all crying on the pitch at the f***ing Stadium of f***ing Light or Middlesborough or wherever you was, which is f***ing triple whammy. Get f***ed.”",

      "Wayne Rooney is getting awfully comfortable with basically accusing QPR of colluding with Manchester City to deny Manchester United of the title in 2012.",
      "Jack Grealish “may as well book his holiday” as there is little chance England boss Thomas Tuchel selects him for the World Cup, according to Wayne Rooney.",

      "Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo may be a luxury signing, not a necessity, for Manchester United, but he can take them “to the next level”, says Bacary Sagna.",
      "Reports emerged on Monday that Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, sparking rumours of a departure in the January transfer window.",
      "Manchester United and Liverpool are among those being linked with the Ghanaian international, with the latter eyeing a long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly leading the race for Semenyo, with a January transfer not being ruled out.",
      "Manchester United are among the clubs being linked with the Bournemouth star, and former Arsenal, Manchester City and France right-back Sagna thinks he could take Ruben Amorim’s team to another level.",
      "“Looking forward, if he was to leave Bournemouth and stay in the Premier League, I think Manchester United would be a suitable option for him,” he told Oddspedia.",
      "“He could definitely help the club get back to the top end of the league and if he did join them, he’d be regarded as the player which made the difference and take United to the next level.",
      "“He’s young, fresh and has proven he can shine in big games this season – so I think Old Trafford could be a good destination for him.”",
      "Sagna added: “If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season.",
      "“As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it’s much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly – rather than joining midway through a campaign.”",
      "Semenyo is a fantastic player, but it’s probably worth seeing if Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha can continue to improve United before they spend big on another Premier League forward.",
      "Amorim’s frontline was completely revamped in the summer transfer window with the signings of Cunha, Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for over £200million.",
      "Not only are those three players shiny new investments, but the Red Devils have bigger priorities in the transfer market, namely a new central midfielder.",
      "Suppose United are convinced that recruiting from lesser Premier League clubs like Wolves, Brentford and Bournemouth is the way to go, they won’t look further than Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton in their pursuit of a new midfielder.",
      "Sure, Semenyo would improve the United squad, but Amorim also has Amad Diallo, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount. Obviously, £65m should be invested elsewhere.",
      "While we aren’t convinced by the financial practicality of United signing Semenyo, we are convinced that Semenyo to Liverpool is a transfer that makes perfect sense.",
      "The Premier League champions also spent big on their attack in the summer, signing Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak for over £200m, while attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz joined for £100m.",
      "However, there is an alarming lack of depth behind Mohamed Salah on the right, with right-back Jeremie Frimpong seemingly second in Arne Slot’s pecking order.",
      "Not only is there no serious competition for Salah, but Liverpool need a long-term replacement for the 33-year-old.",
      "No matter how you look at it, the odds are stacked in favour of Liverpool recruiting a serious downgrade on Salah, because he’s played at an all-time level for the Reds.",
      "The best option is arguably Michael Olise, Bayern Munich’s world-class winger, but even he would be a downgrade on the Salah we saw last season. Unfortunately for Liverpool, they can’t replace the best Premier League winger of all time with someone capable of making the same impact.",
      "So, Semenyo shouldn’t be viewed as an underwhelming replacement, and he probably isn’t, having scored six goals in 12 Premier League matches this term.",
      "Despite record-breaking summer expenditure from Liverpool, they still have money to spend, and they’d be wise to invest their funds into the signing of Semenyo, but only if they sign a centre-back first, in what would likely be a £100m total investment, unlike Man United’s £165m spend on the Bournemouth man and a midfielder like Anderson or Baleba.",

      "Manchester United are highly unlikely to be drawn into the transfer chase for Antoine Semenyo in January, despite genuine interest.",
      "Man Utd are keeping a close eye on Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo and Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi ahead of January, according to reports.",

      "The recruitment team at Man Utd were criticised over the summer transfer window for not bringing in a new midfielder despite spending over £200m on five new signings.",
      "It was one of the weakest areas in Ruben Amorim’s side last year and early on this season it was once again an issue as Man Utd remained inconsistent.",
      "The Red Devils have been much better in recent weeks with Man Utd currently five unbeaten after Amorim’s side won their first back-to-back Premier League matches under the Portuguese head coach.",

      "Yorke told Snabbare: “I’m not sure Adam Wharton is the answer. He’s still not quite there for me yet and that’s an area of concern we have to look to improve.",
      "“It is a gap in this Manchester United team. You look at the history behind the football club in its most successful years and they always had a fantastic number six in that position.”",

      "He added: “Casemiro has been hit and miss at times and it’s a key part of your team. You listen to all the great managers, that central area of your midfield is always so important.",
      "“It’s a tough gig that one to find the right players and I think that’s why they’re struggling. They haven’t got that player who can set the floor of the game, as I always call it, and dictate the pace, who defends but passes the ball forwards, and can see the pass.",
      "“These types of players are rare which surprises me as on the face of it it’s not the most difficult job in the world but it’s the most crucial.”",
      "Yorke continued: “Who I would like to see in that position more? I can’t think, honestly, because there’s too much hype around some of these players,’ he continued.",

      "When asked if he’d been impacted by the links to Man Utd and other teams, Wharton recently told The Athletic: “Not really, to be honest. I don’t really look into it or think too much about it.",
      "“There’s always rumours floating about on social media and things like this. Is it true? Is it not true? You tell me!”",
      "“Honestly, I get my friends all messaging me or my family, my brothers. Everyone will message me and they’ll be like, “Oh, is this true? This club is interested.”",
      "“I’m like, “Thanks for telling me because I didn’t know before you told me!” and I don’t really take an interest to it too much. I don’t really think about it.",
      "“If something is going to be serious, then I can maybe think about it. But if it’s not very serious, if there’s interest, I’m not interested in knowing because interest… you can be interested in anything and nothing can come from it… I don’t really read into it too much.",

      "Thursday 20 November 2025 22:22, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and makes a case for Tottenham to win at Arsenal.",
      "There is a trend developing in Chelsea's matches against relegation threatened teams in that they are making very slow, stodgy starts in games. When assessing their last 11 Premier League matches against promoted teams or Wolves, they have only been winning at half-time on three of those occasions.",
      "Sometimes these trends have little substance but I think it makes sense here as Enzo Maresca is a notoriously control-focused manager who doesn't overly like taking risks even against the lesser teams. So that can lead to low scoring first halves - under Maresca, seven Premier League teams have scored more first half goals than Chelsea.",
      "Teams can also struggle to find their rhythm in the first fixture back after this break which is something that can be used to our advantage here to get against Chelsea in the first half.",
      "The half-time/full-time market looks a market to get involved with the Draw/Chelsea paying 7/2 with Sky Bet in a game where Chelsea should improve their attacking output as the game goes on.",
      "The betting guru derby always is a fixture with a nice edge as Tony Bloom and Matthew Benham's algorithms go at it.",
      "All the data shouts loud that Brighton are a top team waiting to happen in terms of their style of play but they are a team that come with risks when fancied by the market. They can struggle against low blocks and when enjoying the share of possession owing to a lack of killer instinct in the final third.",
      "In their last 21 games where they've enjoyed more possession than their opponents, they have won just four of those games. So if you are backing their opposition in these spots on the double chance you are making a very high return on investment based on the prices. Brentford, who have beaten Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle this season, in that market at 5/6 with Sky Bet are the obvious play here.",
      "When these two managers meet, history tells us: there's goals.",
      "Andoni Iraola has faced Nuno Espirito Santo four times and there's been 14 goals scored - that's an average of 3.5 goals per game and both teams to score has copped in each meeting.",
      "Iraola obviously knows how to exploit the transitional moments in Nuno's defensive setup but West Ham, who have scored six goals in their last three games and have found a winning formula, have the quality to punish mistakes.",
      "This should be another game where both sides push hard early on and leave nothing behind, which makes the 11/10 with Sky Bet on both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals a very appealing play to consider.",
      "If Fulham are to be dragged into a relegation scrap this season, there have to be worries about this team coping with the sustained stress and physical pressure that comes with fighting the drop.",
      "Marco Silva's men want rhythm, control and the ball zipping around in pretty triangles. What they don't want is a team who arrive, roll their sleeves up and ask them to defend the ugly stuff. And that's exactly what Sunderland will bring - just ask Arsenal.",
      "Dan Ballard, who scored against the Gunners and is 14/1 to score anytime here, looks seriously overpriced.",
      "Ballard has become Sunderland's biggest set piece threat: he times his runs superbly, attacks the ball like a centre-forward and doesn't need volume - just one clean delivery to cause panic. Against a Fulham defence that struggles to pick up powerful movers in the box, he should get that moment in what looks a great opportunity for Sunderland to bag another three points.",
      "Sean Dyche's teams are notoriously comfortable soaking up pressure. They don't always invite high-quality chances, but they will concede a lot of low-probability shots. In 28 Premier League matches playing away at either Liverpool, Manchester City or Arsenal, Dyche's teams have conceded 20.1 shots per 90.",
      "That tendency to soak it up plays right into Liverpool's hands: the Reds are more than happy to take lots of shots, even from distance or awkward positions. I'm fully expecting Arne Slot's men to dominate possession, apply sustained pressure and force plenty of attempts - even if Forest don't give up many clear-cut chances which may lead them to staying competitive in the game.",
      "This looks a great opportunity to back the overall Liverpool shots line of 20 or more at 5/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Football clubs love a reset button. New manager, new message, new mood music, new hope.",
      "But sometimes a reset is just a rebrand, not a rebirth - and Wolves hiring Rob Edwards feels dangerously close to a case of putting lipstick on a pig.",
      "Not because Edwards isn't a capable coach, far from it. His work at Luton, Forest Green and his early games at Middlesbrough showcase his ability. But this Wolves squad, in its current state, has deeper issues that stem from the hierarchy that changing the face in the dugout won't magically fix.",
      "Crystal Palace, by contrast, are a team who know who they are. Compact without the ball, efficient with it and blessed with final third quality who don't need 10 chances to make one count.",
      "They're physically stronger, better organised and operate with a clarity Wolves simply can't match at the moment. The away win at 19/20 with Sky Bet should land.",
      "When it comes to Eddie Howe vs Manchester City, the stats don't lie: Pep Guardiola has his number in a big way. Howe has never won in 18 Premier League meetings with City, losing 16 times.",
      "That kind of dominance from Guardiola's side is not just a quirk, it's a pattern that we can put lots of trust in when it comes to making betting decisions.",
      "Despite City's dominance in the head to heads, Howe is unlikely to change the way he sets his team in matches of this nature. He knows he's likely to be overrun, so instead he tries to limit the damage with a focus on being defensively secure. In big matches like this, Newcastle have shown they can be a bit cagey: they'll absorb, cut down the spaces and make it hard for City to feed Erling Haaland.",
      "This means backing a City victory alongside the under 3.5 goals line at 15/8 with Sky Bet rates as the smart way to boost the odds on an away win.",
      "The offside trap is back at Aston Villa.",
      "It's not just a quirk, not just a tactical flourish, it's become the heartbeat of the defensive identity under Unai Emery. And crucially, there's a genuine correlation between Villa getting that line right and Villa winning football matches.",
      "Whenever Villa's back four snap into line as one, they suffocate opponents. Attacks stall, runners misfire and dangerous moments dissolve into a raised flag and a reset.",
      "Villa are catching the opposition offside 4.5 times per game across their last 12 games. And, in the last seven Premier League games they've caught 28 players offside - the most of any team by 10.",
      "It's no-coincidence then they've managed to win five of their last six Premier League matches. And Leeds do like to commit bodies forward in direct fashion. That tactical philosophy is tailor-made for Emery's razor-precise trap to flourish once again.",
      "All roads lead to backing Aston Villa to win at 6/4 with Sky Bet. If the flags are flying, Villa should be too.",
      "Gabriel is the lynchpin of this Arsenal defence - their high line, their aerial insurance policy and their most physical presence in the back four. Without him, Arsenal may have a problem in the next few weeks if his abductor injury is as bad as early reports suggest. Starting here.",
      "Tottenham under Thomas Frank will enjoy this derby day assignment.",
      "Few managers in the league coach 'underdog football' as effectively as the former Brentford boss.",
      "Frank's Brentford side made a habit of punishing big teams. The smart money says he'll try to copy-paste that blueprint here: frustrate, pounce, exploit the absence of Arsenal's defensive enforcer from both open play and set pieces. Spurs have the quality to make a big move in the game - like they did away at Manchester City and in the Super Cup vs PSG.",
      "The betting is obviously trending towards Arsenal at 2/5 with Sky Bet but that doesn't fully account for the defensive reshuffle forced by Gabriel's absence. Arsenal can and still probably will win, of course, but Tottenham suddenly have a real foothold in the match-up, and the market doesn't quite reflect it.",
      "Tottenham double chance it is then at 2/1 with Sky Bet. And, the 7/1 on an away win needs a good look, too.",
      "Manchester United should come with a disclaimer: 'entertaining but structurally unstable.'",
      "Ruben Amorim has a team overflowing with attacking talent, energy and moments of genuine quality yet one that carries enough defensive looseness to turn every 90 minutes into a wild ride. There have been 37 goals in their Premier League games - working to an average of 3.36 per 90. No team averages higher.",
      "They are the must-watch team in the Premier League because of it.",
      "Amorim has realised that they are a team built for moments - not for consistency - and he's embracing it.",
      "And, goals at both ends are becoming the smartest angle in United's games.",
      "This looks a clash where both teams will fancy themselves going forward and neither will fully trust themselves without the ball. Sky Bet go 10/11 on both teams to score and over 2.5 goals, and that looks very backable considering the direction of travel in United games.",

      "Which Premier League teams are overachieving and underachieving this season? And will Arsenal be caught?",
      "Eleven games in, the season's main narratives have already emerged.",
      "Arsenal are the team to catch following their strong start to the campaign. Manchester City, rather than faltering champions Liverpool, are seen as their most likely title rivals. At the other end of table, bottom side Wolves are already at risk of getting cut off.",
      "But what's your team's true performance level this season?",
      "Our expected table measures underlying performance data rather than results and the standings might surprise you.",
      "Crystal Palace are rated as the third-best performing team in the division behind Arsenal and Manchester City, while struggling Liverpool should be four places better off in fourth.",
      "Newcastle and newly-promoted Leeds are also underperforming significantly. They sit sixth and seventh in the expected table, eight and nine places better off respectively.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side face Everton on Monday Night Football on a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League but the expected table has them three places worse off in 10th, suggesting their performances haven't been as good as recent results suggest.",
      "One team conspicuous by its absence from the top half of the expected table is Sunderland.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side are flying high in fourth having amassed 19 points from their first 11 games following promotion but the expected table has them a whopping 14 places lower, as the third-worst performers in the Premier League so far, based on xG, with an expected points total of eight.",
      "Burnley and Fulham should also be in the relegation zone, with bottom side Wolves placing 17th. Wolves have only taken two points from their first 11 games but their expected points total is nine.",
      "Nottingham Forest, like Wolves, should be in a much better position, according to xG, but the expected table is grim reading for Spurs and Aston Villa, who should be nine and 10 places worse off respectively according to underlying performance data.",
      "But how will it look at the end of the season?",
      "Liverpool are predicted to come third despite sitting eighth as things stand, with Chelsea completing the top four and Manchester United in fifth, a position that could clinch Champions League qualification, depending on this season's coefficient.",

      "Relegation could become a reality for West Ham, according to our predicted table. The Hammers won back to back games before the international break but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are tipped to go down in 18th, along with Burnley and Wolves.",
      "That means Leeds, as well as Sunderland, are predicted to survive, with Burnley the only promoted team expected to go straight down.",
      "Nottingham Forest, currently second from bottom having appointed their third manager of the season in Sean Dyche, are expected to fight their way out of trouble and finish 16th.",

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",

      "Thursday 13 November 2025 16:35, UK",
      "A number of Premier League stars have entered the final year of their contracts, meaning they can negotiate a free transfer with clubs outside of England from January.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side have prioritised extending the deals of players at risk of leaving in the near future and the contract situation for the team is in a strong position as a result.",
      "Nothing to report for next summer and with no potential exits on a free, Arsenal can now concentrate on more important matters on the pitch.",
      "Ross Barkley",
      "A seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",
      "Whether that warrants a fresh deal at Villa Park remains to be seen.",
      "Marcos Senesi",
      "In the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.",
      "Talks are reportedly under way regarding a new deal but like the future of his boss Andoni Iraola, there has been no news as of yet.",
      "Adam Smith",
      "The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.",
      "Injuries have hindered his involvement for the first team this season but 11 years into his career at the Vitality Stadium, Smith still has a role to play.",
      "Vitaly Janelt",
      "Talks over a new deal are yet to reach an agreement and the Bees want a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around.",
      "Rico Henry",
      "Brentford hold the option to extend Henry's stay in west London by an additional year so are in no danger of losing the left-back.",
      "Knee injuries and other fitness issues have blighted his time at the Bees but Henry has played a role in cup competitions for Keith Andrews' side, providing crucial depth and experience at left-back.",
      "Mathias Jensen",
      "Another future at Brentford that the club are in control of. Jensen is one of three players with an option of an additional year in his current contract.",
      "The 29-year-old, who will be turning 30 when the transfer window opens, has been used prominently in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Josh Dasilva",
      "Dasilva signed a deal in October to remain at the club until the end of the season after seeing his previous contract expire in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old is yet to return from a serious knee injury suffered in February but head coach Andrews has stressed his importance to the team. Brentford hold an option to keep him for a further 12 months if his return from injury goes to plan.",
      "Myles Peart-Harris",
      "The attacking midfielder is yet to make an appearance for Brentford this season after previously impressing on loan with Swansea in the Championship last season.",
      "He was last included in the match-day squad for the Bees first team on August 26 against Bournemouth.",
      "Adam Webster",
      "A severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Webster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Lewis Dunk",
      "The Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.",
      "Solly March",
      "With game time limited for the 31-year-old in wide areas, it is unclear whether the club will trigger the option to extend his stay by another year.",
      "Danny Welbeck",
      "The forward is ageing like a fine wine in the Premier League and his form for the club warrants a new deal.",
      "The 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.",
      "Joel Veltman",
      "Veltman triggered an option to extend his stay at the club for an additional year last season but is now approaching the end of his contract.",
      "He missed five games with a calf injury but returned in the derby against Crystal Palace, outlining his role to play in Hurzeler's squad.",
      "James Milner",
      "The Premier League veteran will turn 40 when the window to negotiate with foreign clubs opens in January.",
      "Hurzeler said his experience was \"invaluable\" when he signed a one-year extension in June. The likelihood of a similar deal remains unclear.",
      "Martin Dubravka",
      "Dubravka signed a one-year deal with the Clarets upon their return to the Premier League and ranks amongst the best in shot-stopping in the division.",
      "His future at Turf Moor will likely be determined when - and if - Burnley manage to avoid the drop.",
      "Josh Laurent",
      "Laurent has been a useful member of the squad since joining from Stoke City in 2024. He signed a two-year deal when he first arrived at the club, with the option for a third.",
      "Vaclav Hladky",
      "The Czech Republic shot-stopper has only been included in two match-day squads this season - both in the Carabao Cup - and is yet to make an appearance in the 2025/26 campaign after featuring in pre-season.",
      "With 21-year-old Max Weiss currently ahead of him as Dubravka's understudy, an exit feels inevitable.",
      "Ashley Barnes",
      "Barnes signed a deal running until the end of the season after terminating his contract at Norwich City in January, returning to Turf Moor almost 11 years after he first joined the club.",
      "He then put pen to paper on a new one-year deal in the summer but has failed to make an impact in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are known for offering long-term deals to their players and have no one approaching the end of their respective deals ahead of next summer.",
      "Marc Guehi",
      "Arguably one of the most talked-about contract sagas ahead of next summer. Palace stopped Guehi from joining Liverpool on Deadline Day and with no fresh contract in sight, his exit from Selhurst Park feels like a matter of when, not if.",
      "Rumours linking him with a move to Anfield continue to swirl but clubs in Europe, who will be free to open negotiations for pre-contract agreements in the New Year, are also on alert.",
      "Daichi Kamada",
      "Informal conversations have taken place regarding a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.",
      "Naouirou Ahamada",
      "The 23-year-old has spent the vast majority of his time with the U21s side. Ahamada spent last season on loan at Rennes, making five appearances.",
      "Nathaniel Clyne",
      "In his second spell with the Eagles, Clyne signed a one-year contract extension with the club in the summer. However, his role has been reduced this season, making two appearances without a start.",
      "Clyne will be 35 when his current contract expires and an exit in search of more frequent game time in the latter stages of his career could be on the horizon.",
      "Jefferson Lerma",

      "Vitaliy Mykolenko",
      "Mykolenko has confirmed his agent will soon enter talks with Everton regarding a new contract at the Toffees. The 26-year-old remains a key part of the squad with summer signing Adam Aznou yet to break into the first team.",

      "Garner is a regular for Everton under David Moyes. Jordan Pickford and James Tarkowski have both been rewarded with new deals in recent months and Garner will likely follow suit to reflect his new status within the team.",
      "Michael Keane",
      "Another mainstay in Moyes' squad. Keane reportedly had offers to leave the Toffees in the summer but chose to remain on Merseyside by signing a new deal and is now benefiting from that decision.",

      "Idrissa Gueye",
      "Gueye signed a new deal in July, running until the end of the season, but the club hold an option for an additional year.",
      "The Senegal international, in his second stint with the Toffees after leaving in 2019 to join PSG for £26m, has been a regular for Moyes in the league so far this season.",
      "Triggering the extension seems like a suitable option for all parties.",
      "Seamus Coleman",
      "The 36-year-old club legend signed a new deal just before the new campaign began to commit to a 17th season with the Blues.",
      "He has been used sparingly but would likely jump at the chance to end his career at Everton with another deal, if he wishes to continue past the 2025/26 season.",
      "Harry Tyrer",
      "Tyrer impressed while on loan at Blackpool last season, making 38 appearances in League One and keeping 12 clean sheets.",
      "Despite showing promise, the 23-year-old is behind Mark Travers in the pecking order for Jordan Pickford's understudy and will likely need to pursue first-team opportunities elsewhere if he wants game time.",
      "Ryan Sessegnon",
      "The Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.",
      "His importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.",
      "Harry Wilson",
      "Fulham pulled the plug on Wilson's move to Elland Road, reiterating he was not for sale, and head coach Marco Silva has since confirmed that he is set for talks regarding an extension.",
      "Adama Traore",
      "Fulham triggered an option to extend Traore's contract until 2026 last season but the winger has found minutes hard to come by in the current campaign.",
      "Raul Jimenez",
      "Jimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.",
      "Tom Cairney",
      "Club captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.",
      "Illan Meslier",
      "The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.",
      "Meslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.",
      "An exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.",
      "Sam Byram",
      "Signed on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.",
      "Karl Darlow",
      "Darlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.",
      "Alex Cairns",
      "Academy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.",
      "Ibrahima Konate",
      "An exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.",
      "Andy Robertson",
      "The veteran defender has insisted he is relaxed about his future at Anfield with his contract coming to an end this season.",
      "Atletico Madrid were interested in signing the Scotland international in the summer ahead of Milos Kerkez's arrival but given the struggles of their new left-back, conversations may be revisited with the 31-year-old, after he confirmed discussions had taken place during the summer to extend his stay.",
      "Freddie Woodman",
      "Woodman joined on a free transfer in the summer following the expiration of his contract at Preston North End.",
      "In the absence of Alisson due to injury, Woodman has operated as Giorgi Mamardashvili's back-up and started in the 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup in October. The club hold an option to extend his contract for a further year.",
      "Rhys Williams",
      "Even with numbers at centre back low at Liverpool following Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury at the beginning of the campaign, Liverpool have not handed Williams an appearance in any of the three competitions they have competed in so far.",
      "Bernardo Silva",
      "Silva spoke openly about his future during the summer, outlining he is focused on the season but is aware he can leave the Etihad Stadium next summer.",
      "He continues to play a crucial role for Pep Guardiola's side and had options to leave but remained at the club.",
      "John Stones",
      "The future of John Stones is yet to be decided, with the England centre-back also approaching the end of his current deal.",
      "Stefan Ortega",

      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "Report as stoppage-time goals from Matthijs de Ligt and Richarlison cancel each other out in a frantic finale between Man Utd and Spurs; Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header had the visitors in front before Mathys Tel's equaliser sparked comeback for Spurs, now unbeaten in eight against United",
      "Saturday 8 November 2025 22:31, UK",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's last-gasp header rescued a 2-2 draw for Manchester United at Tottenham after Richarlison thought he had scored a stoppage-time winner in a chaotic finale.",
      "United led through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header until the 84th minute when substitute Mathys Tel's impressive equaliser kick-started a late comeback for Spurs, who led through Richarlison seven minutes later only to let a second home league win of the season slip away.",
      "A knee injury to substitute Benjamin Sesko - after he wasted a glorious chance immediately following Spurs' equaliser - left United down to 10, but they somehow clawed their way back as De Ligt headed in from a corner in the sixth and final minute of stoppage time.",
      "Benjamin Sesko suffered a knee injury at Tottenham and could miss Slovenia's upcoming World Cup qualifiers. The striker will be assessed in the coming days.",
      "Spurs had never taken the lead after the regulation 90 minutes in a Premier League game and not won, while United became the first team in the competition since August 2012 to score the opening goal, go behind and not lose in successive games.",
      "Victory would have taken either side up to second in the table, but neither showed enough to be worthy of that position in a low-quality game reminiscent of last season's Europa League final. Spurs end Saturday fifth, while United are eighth.",
      "Spurs won all four meetings between the sides last season, including the Europa League final in Bilbao, and continue to be a bogey team for United, whose winless run against this opposition now extends to eight games.",
      "Although Spurs avoided defeat showing spirit to fight back, their wretched home form in the league remains a concern, having claimed just one victory from six against Burnley this season. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "Despite United extending their unbeaten league run to five games, head coach Ruben Amorim delivered a reality check after the game as he said \"we have a lot of problems\".",
      "Tottenham: Vicario (5), Porro (4), Romero (6), Van de Ven (7), Spence (6), Sarr (6), Palhinha (7), Johnson (5), Simons (7), Richarlison (7), Kolo Muani (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Odobert (7), Udogie (7),  Bentancur (5), Tel (7).\n\n\nMan Utd Lammens (6), Maguire (6), De Ligt (7) Shaw (5), Mazraoui (5), Casemiro (5), Fernandes (5), Dorgu (5), Amad (7), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (4). \n\n\nSubs:  Sesko (3), Mount (5), Ugarte (5), Dalot (5) Yoro (5).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Spurs fans booed head coach Thomas Frank's decision to remove Xavi Simons when United were leading, only for his replacement, Tel, to bring them level four minutes and 45 seconds after coming on.",
      "\"Sometimes you're lucky,\" said Frank of his substitution. \"Every single time I take a decision to sub a player, it is only with one aim: to win the game.\"",
      "It was another toothless performance from Tottenham for most of the game, as they failed to register a shot on target until the 54th minute, but Frank remained upbeat with United held to a season-low five shots.",
      "\"To play against a Man Utd team that play with confidence with Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko coming on, and we kept them down to five shots,\" he said.",
      "\"It's not that easy just to create in the Premier League, even when they had all their big boys out there. That said, our second-half response I was extremely happy with.\"",
      "\"We're playing home, of course, we all want to win and don't talk too much about home form,\" added Frank, whose side have taken five points from their six league matches at home.",
      "\"I know we need to win before we don't talk about it. But the way we turned around to stay in the game, kept doing the right thing throughout the second half, very, very happy with that. So close to winning it and on any other day, we win it.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was disappointed not to take all three points despite his team being on a five-game unbeaten run, the longest since he has taken charge.",
      "Nottingham Forest scored twice in two minutes to overturn United's advantage in the second half last Saturday before Amad Diallo's stunning volley clawed back a point late on in a 2-2 draw.",
      "It was a case of deja vu at Spurs and Amorim's response delivered a reality check for United, who once again struggled after Casemiro was taken off.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",
      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
