      "Former Arsenal forward Paul Dickov believes Danny Welbeck should consider staying at Brighton and snubbing a return to Manchester United.",
      "Welbeck, 34, has been linked with a surprise move back to Old Trafford after an impressive start to the season. Indeed, the England international has scored six goals in 11 top-flight appearances this term.",
      "He is the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League, with Burnley's Jaidon Anthony second on four and a number of players, including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and West Ham's Jarrod Bowen, on three.",
      "Welbeck's form has seen speculation increase that he could be poised for a shock return to the England squad for next summer's World Cup, with Thomas Tuchel not having an obvious deputy for Harry Kane.",
      "As well as that, Welbeck has been tipped to re-join United in the January transfer window, almost 12 years since he left the Reds to sign for Arsenal in a £16million transfer. The ex-Watford man came through the youth system at Carrington and scored 29 times in 142 matches for his boyhood club before joining the Gunners.",
      "But with Benjamin Sesko suffering a knee injury in United's 2-2 draw at Tottenham before the international break, the Reds could dip into the market for another No.9 in January - and Welbeck's name has been mentioned as a potential target. However, Dickov doesn't think Welbeck should rush back to United.",
      "Speaking to Best Betting Bonuses, former Manchester City and Leicester ace Dickov said: \"It would be a big shout, actually, wouldn't it? Danny's been excellent. He seems to get better as he gets older. I think he's the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"Danny's obviously a Manchester boy, came through the academy. But it'll be interesting to see what United do and for how long Sesko is actually out for.",
      "\"Because they spent big on him. He was the one that they wanted in the summer. But with strikers, and I know that myself, we're very selfish.",
      "\"Any striker joining United in the winter will know that Sesko will be coming back, and almost certainly play ahead of him. Are United going to go and spend big and get a centre-forward that's going to come in and then have two centre-forwards that have got a big price tag? Is one going to sit on the bench?",
      "\"Especially in the January market, it's really difficult to go out there and get the players that you want. Then I know with Danny Welbeck, if United come in, it’s not even certain he will want to leave Brighton or if Brighton would let him leave.",
      "\"At the back of his mind, he's going to be thinking ‘How many games am I going to play?’ Because when Sesko comes back, he's probably going to be the main No. 9 that they've got in their squad. So it's a really difficult one for him.\"",
      "Welbeck has a solid record while playing for England, netting 16 goals in 42 caps. However, he hasn't made an appearance for the Three Lions since 2018, when he was at Arsenal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Just 18 months after being told to RETIRE by Jamie Carragher, Manchester United's veteran star Casemiro has been hailed as a “complete player” by a Premier League rival.",
      "The Brazilian has endured a rollercoaster spell at Old Trafford since his £60m move from Real Madrid. He impressed in his debut campaign but struggled in the following seasons, with reports at the time suggesting that the Red Devils were keen to cut their losses. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher suggested that he should start considering retiring with his infamous “leave the football before the football leaves you\" comment.",
      "Despite it appearing as though his career was winding down, Casemiro seems back to his best this season. The 33-year-old has been a consistent figure under Ruben Amorim, already scoring three goals throughout the campaign. And he has now earned praise from compatriot and Newcastle star Bruno Guimaraes. Speaking while on international duty, he said: “Look at his experience, his titles… he’s a complete player.",
      "“His career speaks for itself. In one of my first interviews with the national team, in 2020, when I arrived they asked if I was inspired by anyone in midfield, and I said his name, Casemiro.",
      "“He’s also an idol there for everything he’s done, especially at Real Madrid, the five Champions League titles. A guy that everyone who plays in Brazilian midfield talks about, Casemiro is the guy we have to follow.",
      "“So I think it’s a bit of everything, he’s a leader, certainly playing there as a number 8 is a position where I feel more comfortable, it’s a position I also play at Newcastle. I think it’s a perfect match and things are starting to go well.”",
      "Casemiro’s form and Guimaraes’ comments have certainly seen Liverpool icon Carragher eat his words. Speaking in May 2024, he said: \"I am nowhere near on a level of what that man has achieved, [winning] Champions League's, playing for Brazil and Real Madrid.",
      "\"But I always remember something when I retired myself, and there was a saying I always remember as a footballer: 'Leave the football, before the football leaves you'.",
      "\"The football has left him - at this top level. He needs to call it a day at this level of football and move.\"",

      "Scott McTominay has come a long way since he made his Manchester United debut under Jose Mourinho. And it was 'The Special One' who helped put McTominay on the path to becoming a Scotland hero during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "McTominay - whose latest act of heroism in a Scotland shirt inspired them to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998 - may no longer be a United player, but he has flourished at Napoli and was even named the best player in Serie A last season after moving overseas. It was evident during his Premier League days, though, that McTominay had bags of talent.",
      "Mourinho could see that and even felt, from a national team perspective, that England were taking far too long to give him an international call-up. And when Gareth Southgate didn't immediately act, Mourinho instead made sure that Scotland knew the door was open for them.",
      "McTominay qualified to play for them by virtue of his Helensburgh-born father and Alex McLeish was the Scotland manager at the time. When he sniffed an opportunity he didn't waste any time in heading south of the border to deliver his pitch - even if the weather almost cost him.",
      "He told the Telegraph: “Looking back now I suppose all of us Scots should say a little thank you to Jose Mourinho. Jose had given an interview in which he let it be known that England were in danger of missing out on Scott and that I should be getting in touch with him at the first opportunity!",
      "“So I arranged to go down to United’s training ground to see him and Scott. There was only one problem – the ‘Beast from the East’ was raging at the time and I almost didn’t make it!",
      "“I didn’t arrive into York until 3am and, at that point, I was seriously thinking about turning back, the weather was that bad. I eventually got to my hotel in Manchester Piccadilly, but I was so late they’d put me down as a no-show! So it’s gone 4am and I’m fearing I’ll be roomless. Luckily they found me one!”",
      "Mourinho appeared a man determined to give Scotland every chance to press their case to McTominay with the midfielder more than paying back that faith. He scored the opening goal on Tuesday night - one of 14 in his international career - and can now prepare for a World Cup campaign for the first time.",
      "McLeish added: “I rang Jose later that morning. ‘Come here for 12, let’s have lunch and a chat about Scott and then we’ll get him in the room'. He couldn’t have been more accommodating. I’d sensed Scott was keen, but I thought he’d still take a lot of persuading. He came in and was pretty clear in his own mind that he wanted to represent Scotland. I think he appreciated me going to see him, but it’s definitely fair to say it was one of the more worthwhile trips I’ve taken.”",

      "Rasmus Hojlund was criticised by his own fans after issuing his congratulations to Scott McTominay on social media in the aftermath of Denmark's qualifying failure.",
      "Scotland were able to leapfrog them to top their group, owing to two goals in stoppage time at Hampden Park. The hosts scored twice late on, the first coming from Kieran Tierney before Kenny McLean fired home from his own half. It lead to huge celebrations from the Scots, who made it to a World Cup for the first time since 1998. McTominay has been their talisman and scored the opening goal of the night on Tuesday.",
      "The midfielder has gone to another level since leaving Manchester United and heading to Naples. He was recently joined by Hojlund, who has made an initial loan move to Napoli. The Dane was on hand to wish his team-mate congratulations on Instagram, he commented on McTominay's post which read: “USA BABY. SCOTLAND ARE COMING!”",
      "Hojlund's response saw him cop it from fans immediately after as his competitive spirit appeared to be called one. One person wrote: “This guy ain’t serious.” Another added: “Bro you lost.” It must be said that a number of fans also praised his humility and sportsmanship.",
      "Several of his Danish team-mates didn't take the defeat well, which leaves them needing to negotiate the play-offs if they do want to make it to the World Cup. Joachim Andersen was particularly angered by how the evening played out, bemoaning some of Scotland's goals.",
      "\"I'm incredibly sad,\" Andersen told TV2 Sport. \"The results we've delivered in the last two games are laughable. I'm just disappointed. I'm disappointed. I think we played a good game. They score a freak goal. He'll never score a goal like that again in his career.\"",
      "\"Of course it's difficult when we get the red card,\" he added. \"And we fall behind and come back. And then we make such stupid mistakes. That should never happen. I don't know what to say. It's just disappointing and f****** ridiculous.\"",
      "Denmark boss Brian Riemer also delivered a put down to Scotland, despite just seeing his side lose out to them. \"I take responsibility 100 percent on my shoulders,\" he said. \"There is nothing to argue about. We met a team that is worse than ourselves today, and we have to beat them.\"",

      "Manchester United will be itching for a return to club football in order to extend the longest unbeaten run of Ruben Amorim's Old Trafford career. The Red Devils are without a loss in their last five Premier League games, which has marked a turnaround in the Portuguese's year-long tenure in England.",
      "Victories against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton sent United shooting up the table from 14th to sixth before settling in seventh after 2-2 draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "For the first time in a while at United, there seems to finally be an air of positivity surrounding Amorim and his squad. A victory on Monday against Everton would not only continue their unbeaten streak but could see them enter the Champions League places, albeit depending on other results, for the first time in over a year.",
      "Amorim has said that there has been a notable improvement in his side's performances, which, of course, leads to more positive results. However, the 40-year-old is still very much insistent that United are in the infancy of their long-term progression.",
      "The suitability of his much-criticised philosophy looks to grow stronger each week but he warned his players that the formation will not be enough to drag them to victory. Speaking to Stan Sport, he said: \"We are playing better, but we are playing better because we have more confidence, and that starts with good results, for example, against Liverpool.",
      "\"We are getting better, but I can share my feeling: when we finished the game against Tottenham and I was coming back to Carrington, I was watching the game and my feeling was frustration, that we are far from perfection.\"",
      "He told his players that desire, confidence and competitiveness are the attributes they must ingrain in themselves in order to become a winning machine. He added: \"We are far from being that team that can win every game.",
      "\"So I think we have a lot to do, but I also have the feeling, and I've been saying this for many months, that the formation is not the problem. The formation is the start of something, then it's the dynamic, the confidence, the way we play, how competitive we are.",
      "\"If you look at the games we struggled in this season, it was not about the formation for me. It was the lack of intensity. We need to be perfect in this league to win a lot of games.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously spoken positively of Amorim's character but its results that define your job status in football. Aware of the time it would taken to transform the once dominant form in English football, the Manchester United co-owner revealed last month he'd grant Amorim three years in the job to do just that.",
      "\"I remember the clamouring for Alex Ferguson to be fired in his first two years\"’ the billionaire said on The Times’ The Business podcast. \"You look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time for the first couple of years.",
      "\"We’re results-driven at the end of the day, but we have to be patient and we have to see through the results. I think there’s lots of good things at Manchester United. We have to be patient and we have a long-term plan. It isn’t a light switch. Ruben needs to demonstrate that he’s a great coach over three years.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Openly promising a certain amount of time to any manager is a bold move but it's a decision that paid off, according to Amorim. Continuing in his conversation with Stan Sport, he said Ratcliffe's comments had a \"huge\" influence on the team as he said: \"But if you remember when Jim gave that interview, that settled down a lot around the club.",
      "\"The noise around the club changed completely. So that was really important for the team and if it’s really important for the team, its really important for me. Those words had a huge impact. Not the way I do things but the way people see what we are doing so it was massive for us.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's £71million transfer this past summer came off the back of a career-best season where he scored 20 league goals for Brentford. After a slow start this season, Mbeumo, 26, has returned to form and has six goals to his name with four of them coming in his last four league games.",
      "As a left-sided goal-scoring winger, comparisons to Liverpool's Mohamed Salah have been made before but it's one Owen Hargreaves believes is accurate because of the Cameroonian's decision-making ability.",
      "\"I think his biggest attribute is that he gives real quality,\" the former United star said of Mbeumo. \"He reminds me of Mohamed Salah in and around the box. When he gets the ball, he has a clear picture of exactly what he wants to do. Whether the finish is near post or back post, he almost shows no emotion.",
      "\"It’s just business in and around the box, and I love that. You can play it into his feet, he can dribble. [Peter] Crouch mentioned his touch and how sharp he is but technically, I don’t think he gets enough credit. People talk about his goal-scoring and rightly so, but he is an exceptional football player.\"",

      "Former Arsenal midfielder Stefan Schwarz has explained why he thinks a move to North London would be a good opportunity for Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo. Mainoo enjoyed a breakthrough season for United during the 2023/24 campaign, having progressed through the academy ranks at Old Trafford to become a first-team regular.",
      "Despite such a promising beginning to his footballing career, the 20-year-old reportedly indicated his intention to leave Old Trafford over the summer.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim has opted for a midfield duo this season, with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes more often than not steering the side. This has resulted in Mainoo accumulating just 138 minutes on the pitch so far this season.",
      "Chelsea were reportedly interested in the young midfielder over the summer, though Arsenal have subsequently surfaced as a possible future destination. Schwarz believes it could prove a worthwhile switch for Mainoo.",
      "“Kobbie Mainoo’s links to Arsenal? Arsenal have the best conditions for young players,\" said Schwarz in an interview with Hajper. \"And they have a manager in Mikel Arteta that is not afraid to give responsibility to them and give them opportunities when he feels they are ready.",
      "“It's just about preparing them in the best way and that's what Arsenal have done very well the last couple of years.”",
      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has often been praised for his ability to nurture young talent from the academy to the first team. Bukayo Saka has blossomed into a star player under Arteta's guidance, with the Gunners boss honing the England international's wing play and making him the focal point of the attack.",
      "Ethan Nwaneri, at just 18 years old, has become an important squad rotation player for Arteta. Although he's not yet a regular starter, the faith shown in Nwaneri by the Arsenal boss paid dividends last season when the youngster netted nine goals and provided two assists in his breakthrough year.",
      "Max Dowman, aged only 15, made history as the youngest player ever to feature in a Champions League match when Arteta introduced him during the club's 3-0 triumph over Slavia Prague.",
      "One of Mainoo's standout attributes is his composed and mature presence in midfield. However, it seems that the young player has lost much of the responsibility that was once entrusted to him by Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim appears to favour a more experienced pairing with seasoned players Casemiro and Fernandes. However, should Mainoo make the switch to Arsenal this winter, it's possible that Arteta could restore that level of responsibility to the 20-year-old.",
      "Mainoo's impressive performances at United earned him a place in Gareth Southgate's England squad. Once again, the England boss showed enough trust in Mainoo to start him in the 2024 Euros final against Spain.",
      "Mainoo's contract with United runs until 2027. The midfielder is reportedly open to a loan move this season and has currently put any new contract discussions on hold.",

However, question marks remain in some quarters over whether the Sweden international is the man to fire Arsenal to the title this season after three consecutive near misses under Mikel Arteta.",

      "It hass emerged that Pep Guardiola's side are by no means as far along as others in their efforts to land the Premier League ace, who has bagged six goals and recorded three assists in 11 outings, with Mail Online claiming they are simply watching the situation as it unfolds for the moment.",
      "Speaking last year, Semenyo outlined his ambitions for European football. \"Any team that plays Champions League, Europa (League) - that's the aim,\" he said. \"I know that's not going to come with a click of my fingers, it's going to take some time.",
      "\"It's going to take goals. It's going to take a lot of consistent performances. But I've worked all my life for that and I'm just going to continue working hard. That's my mentality.\"",
      "Semenyo has started to deliver on that front and is seeing mounting calls for him to make a step up. Former striker Darren Bent sees him as an ideal Mo Salah successor at Anfield.",
      "He said on talkSport: \"He has exploded out of the traps this season and he just looks really comfortable in himself. Every game you see him do something and you go, 'Oh my goodness'… he’s one of those rare players and I call players like this unstoppable. Gareth Bale was like that.",
      "\"When I talk about unstoppable, I’m talking about their attributes. When Bale started to move, you just couldn’t stop him and Semenyo is the same. Once he gets going, he’s going past people and he’s gliding. What’s good about him is that he can go both ways. I think he’s got the full package.",
      "\"For so long now, Liverpool have been able to depend on Salah on that right-hand side, season upon season, and don’t get me wrong, he’s been one of the best players we’ve ever seen in this country. But the signs are that he potentially maybe is slowing down a fraction. Now, all of a sudden, you have to start addressing both sides.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Gordon Strachan reckons allowing Marcus Rashford to leave Old Trafford has proved to be the correct call by the club. The forward has rediscovered his finest form at Barcelona, with Rashford joining the La Liga giants on a season-long loan during the summer, with the possibility to secure a permanent switch to the Camp Nou.",
      "United inserted a buy-option clause in the agreement valued at approximately £28million. Under manager Hansi Flick, Rashford has scored six goals and registered nine assists across 16 outings in all competitions.",
      "Strachan believes that the transfer has benefited both player and club, claiming it has also spared Ruben Amorim an additional dilemma in the changing room.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford was very good for England last week, but I maintain that Manchester United were right to part way with him,\" Strachan told ESports News. \"The time was right for both parties to move on, and it's been proven to have been the right decision.",
      "\"Rashford was struggling at United and it seemed as if he didn’t have Ruben Amorim's full confidence; he wasn't getting a lot of game time, but in the minutes that he did play, I think it's fair to say he didn’t prove the doubters wrong.",
      "\"I'm glad to see him finding success at Barcelona. Everyone has said all along that he's a talented player - that’s never been in doubt.",
      "\"The move has benefitted his career and also allowed United to move forward, rather than be stuck with a dilemma in the dressing room.\"",
      "Rashford found himself on the sidelines under Amorim's management after the head coach's arrival at United in November last year, before the forward completed a loan move to Aston Villa in February.",
      "Flick, who has previously spoken about Rashford's importance to the squad, stated: \"When you see the chances he has, one or two goals more will be good, also for him.",
      "\"But we can be happy with him, of course. I am very happy with him. He can play on this level and I am happy he shows it, for the fans and for the club, and also for the teammates he is a very important player.\"",
      "Rashford has already expressed his desire for a permanent move to Catalonia, but whether Barcelona will cough up the required funds to secure him permanently next year remains to be seen.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's transfer value has soared once again as he continues to impress during his loan stint away from Manchester United. The Denmark international left the Red Devils to join Napoli on a season-long loan deal, which includes an obligation to buy.",
      "The current Serie A champions have agreed to pay €44million (£38.8million) next summer to United, provided certain conditions are met.",
      "United have already pocketed a €6million (£5.3million) loan fee from Napoli, meaning the total transfer fee could hit €50million (£44.1million) if the permanent move goes through.",
      "Hojlund bid farewell to Old Trafford in the summer after netting 26 goals over two seasons with United, including 10 in the previous campaign. Since wearing the Napoli shirt for the first time, the striker has found the back of the net four times in his first 10 outings.",
      "Whether Hojlund will make a permanent switch to Napoli next summer or return to United remains to be seen.",
      "However, with the forward relishing his time in Italy, his market value seems to have increased in recent months.",
      "The CIES Football Observatory have crunched the numbers and estimated Hojlund's current market value to be between €79million (£69.7m) and €92million (£81.1m).",
      "This represents a significant hike in Hojlund's value since the close of last season. In June, the same website placed the striker's transfer market value at between €59million (£52m) and €76million (£67m).",
      "Napoli are yet to confirm whether they'll make Rasmus Hojlund's loan move permanent next summer, leaving his future uncertain. The forward will still have the opportunity to battle for the Serie A title and Champions League glory this season.",
      "Speculation has been rife that United could recall Hojlund in the January transfer window following Benjamin Sesko's knee injury.",
      "The Slovenia international sustained the injury prior to the international break, with subsequent reports suggesting he could be out of action for up to a month.",
      "At the time of the injury, there were concerns that Sesko could face an even lengthier spell on the sidelines.",
      "This sparked rumours about a potential early return for Hojlund to Old Trafford in January, but this won't be possible as no such clause was included in the transfer agreement made earlier this year.",

      "Manchester United are bracing themselves for a hectic January transfer window, but an injury to Benjamin Sesko could throw a spanner in the works. The Red Devils have just over a month to go until they can go into the market for potential new signings.",
      "Sesko was one of five new faces at Old Trafford this summer, joining Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon. Despite their summer spending spree, United are still rumoured to be eyeing more additions when the New Year rolls around.",
      "However, Sesko's injury set-back could force United to rethink their plans. The Slovenia international suffered a knee injury during United's 2-2 stalemate with Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, with rumours suggesting he could be out of action for up to a month.",
      "That could see Ruben Amorim having to re-shuffle his pack and rely on other squad members to step up in Sesko's absence over the coming weeks. One such player is Joshua Zirkzee, who has been heavily linked with a move away from United since the summer.",
      "Zirkzee has found game-time hard to come by at United this campaign and he's yet to be given a single start by Amorim - in any competition. In fact, the Netherlands international has made just four cameo appearances in the Premier League this term, totalling a mere 82 minutes on the pitch.",
      "Since his £37.4million switch to United in the summer of 2024, Zirkzee has only managed to net seven goals and rumours have been swirling about a potential exit from Old Trafford. With Sesko currently side-lined due to injury, this could provide Zirkzee with more opportunities to prove himself on the pitch in the coming weeks.",
      "Moreover, the Red Devils will need to put a plan into place for the squad changes that are expected in December and January. The Africa Cup of Nations is set to take place in the New Year, as well, which will see Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui representing their respective countries.",
      "This will leave United's forward line somewhat depleted, potentially leading to more game time for Zirkzee.",
      "Given the circumstances, it would not be a shock if United were to prevent Zirkzee from leaving Old Trafford, even if he expressed a desire to do so and an offer was on the table. Recent reports indicate United will indeed block any potential exit for Zirkzee due to the lack of senior forward options in the squad.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The Argentina centre-back has been side-lined since February due to a severe knee injury, but has recently returned to Carrington to regain full fitness.",
      "It was reported that Martinez was handed the green light to train with Argentina during their latest international break to boost his match fitness. However, it remains uncertain whether the ex-Ajax star will be fit enough to join United's squad for Monday night's showdown against Everton.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim is expected to provide an update during his pre-match press conference on Friday. And, if Zirkzee's latest Instagram story post is anything to go by, things are looking up for Martinez.",
      "The Netherlands international shared a picture of him with Martinez and several youth team players, hinting they won a practice match, with the Argentine coming through unscathed. He posted: \"Young lads made it easy for us @lisandromartinezzz.\"",
      "Amorim has previously confessed he doesn't want to pin down a date for Martinez's comeback to the matchday squad. But when probed about him in late October, the Portuguese boss expressed satisfaction with the progress being made.",
      "\"He's feeling well,\" the ex-Sporting head coach said. \"The knee is responding really well, so I don't want to say one specific day or one week.",
      "\"I don't know, but it's near to start the training with the team. Then it depends on the rhythm of Licha, if he wins the place or not, that will depend on him, but he's closer to return to training.\"",
      "The United boss has previously made clear just how much Martinez has been missed during his lengthy absence. Amorim's current centre-back options have struggled to play out from the back - a quality the World Cup winner possesses in abundance.",
      "\"We miss a lot, Licha, especially in this moment,\" he said. \"We miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him.\"",
      "It's little wonder, then, that United have increasingly opted to go more direct from defence; a tactic highlighted by Liverpool manager Arne Slot following his side's shock home defeat to Amorim's men last month.",
      "However, Martinez perhaps won't simply walk back into the Reds' defensive unit. Luke Shaw has featured in every Premier League match this campaign, operating as the left-sided centre-half, and looks set to retain his position for Monday's clash with the Toffees.",

      "Despite being cleared to play, Pogba has yet to feature for Monaco this campaign whilst working to regain match sharpness. His comeback was initially scheduled for after the October international window.",
      "That target was subsequently delayed due to a minor setback in his fitness A fresh target date for the Paris FC fixture at the beginning of the month was then set.",
      "But those plans were once more thrown into disarray when the midfielder picked up an ankle problem during training. The injury further delayed the midfielder's debut.",
      "According to L'Equipe, Monaco are preparing to name Pogba in their matchday squad for Saturday evening's Ligue 1 clash with Rennes. If he takes to the field, it will mark the player's first appearance since 3 September 2023, when Juventus defeated Empoli 2-0 in Serie A.",
      "Discussing the ankle knock that ruled him out of the Paris FC encounter, Monaco manager Sebastien Pocognoli said: \"We are awaiting confirmation of the severity of the injury.",

      "Both squads have managed to secure five points from their initial four tournament games and are in 19th and 20th place in the league stage. Pogba's most recent Champions League outing was for United in the Last 16 showdown against Atletico Madrid back in March 2023.",
      "The midfielder enjoyed two stints at United, initially rising through the youth ranks between 2009 and 2012, prior to his transfer to Juventus.",

However, reports surfaced last week suggesting that 24-year-old Greenwood is instead 'obsessed' with donning the England shirt once more, over five years since his debut against Iceland.",

      "Now, Greenwood's choice to decline a call-up to the Jamaica squad has now been justified, following their failure to automatically qualify for the upcoming World Cup in North America.",

      "However, Dorgu's potential absence might not be too major a setback for United. Amorim has an action plan in place as he has favoured Amad at times at right wing-back, resulting in Diogo Dalot being shifted to the opposite flank. When the Denmark international is selected, Noussair Mazraoui or Dalot can fill the other side.",

      "Former Manchester United star Nemanja Matic slammed their decision to sell Scott McTominay - and ex-boss Erik ten Hag was on his side. McTominay was sold by United in August 2024 after they accepted a bid from Napoli worth €30million (£25.4m).",
      "The midfielder, 28, made an instant impact in Italy, helping Napoli clinch the Serie A title and winning the league's Player of the Year award. Given a more advanced role by Antonio Conte, McTominay has scored 17 goals in 50 appearances for Napoli and continues to show the Red Devils what they're missing.",
      "It's not only at club level where the United academy graduate has impressed either. McTominay is a talismanic presence for Scotland, as demonstrated by his marvellous bicycle kick to give them the lead in Tuesday's winner-takes-all World Cup qualifier against Denmark on Tuesday night.",
      "The dramatic 4-2 win at Hampden Park raised yet more questions as to why United sold him. If it were up to Matic, who played alongside McTominay for five years, he'd still be at Old Trafford.",
      "\"My opinion is that #manutd made a mistake by selling Scott McTominay, today it is difficult to replace a player like him,\" the Serbian posted on X when the transfer was completed. \"Conte is smart man.\"",
      "Soon after Matic's claim, Ten Hag admitted that he didn't want McTominay to leave. The Red Devils manager, who was sacked two months after the 28-year-old's sale, pointed to the Premier League's rules on academy products.",
      "\"Selling a graduate is considered 100 per cent profit under current PSR rules and United sorely needed the cash. Unfortunately, it's the rules,\" Ten Hag bemoaned. \"You have to discuss the rules to do sales and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It's not the right thing to do but for everyone, for all parts, it's a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it. Of course, for Napoli, a very good player but also for us.\"",
      "The Dutchman added: \"I'm very happy for him and for us, but it's mixed [feelings] because I would have preferred not to lose him. He has Manchester United in his veins... He was so important for our team, he was at Manchester United for over 22 years.\"",
      "McTominay felt that it was right time for a new challenge and said: \"It was a mutual decision. It was a case of - there's an opportunity there, do you want to go?",
      "\"Obviously I know from their side FFP is difficult. It's not easy for clubs to make a decision in regards to homegrown players, but that was never in my thought process. My thought process was coming here, seeing the fans, the coach and hopefully doing really good things.\"",
      "He added: \"On my last day, I had to go and see everyone and it was not easy to say goodbye. But that's football. That's the life. I spoke to him [Ten Hag]. He expressed his thoughts on the situation. I said, 'Listen it's my career, I am here to push myself on'.",
      "\"In this situation, I have to look out for number one and go with my gut feeling of what I want to do in my career and not be held back by any other external factors.",
      "\"It was amicable. I love that football club to bits, they have been my life for 22 years, but I have moved on now. I am thoroughly enjoying myself here.\"",

      "McTominay, who has flourished since departing Old Trafford for Napoli, fired Scotland ahead after three minutes, with Kieran Tierney, Kenny McLean and Lawrence Shankland also finding the net for Steve Clarke's team. The former United ace posted an image of his stunning overhead kick on Instagram, with Garnacho and numerous other United legends expressing their admiration in the replies.",

      "Manchester United could take advantage of 'market opportunities' in the January transfer window, but are unlikely to land their long-term midfield targets. It has been said that Ruben Amorim will be more likely to turn to the club's academy and wait until the summer to splash the cash on a new central midfielder.",
      "But the Portuguese boss has already hinted that the Africa Cup of Nations could spark a small foray into the market. United will be without Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui for a period over the winter.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON],\" Amorim said. \"But we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "And United could yet keep their eyes on four opportunities in particular, according to Mail Online. Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are unlikely to be available but a 'low-cost' move for Wolves star Joao Gomes could be considered.",
      "United will also keep an eye on Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, despite Liverpool being favourites for his signature. Semenyo has a release clause that stands at £60million plus £5m in add-ons, which becomes active in the January transfer window.",
      "Marc Guehi could be another opportunity United consider, even if Liverpool remain favourites for his signature after a £35m deadline day move collapsed. The defender will enter the final six months of his Crystal Palace contract in January, and the Red Devils could be interested in a central defender, given the limited progress in extending Harry Maguire’s deal, which also expires in the summer.",
      "It has also not been ruled out that United could bring forward a summer deal to January if a chance arises. Yet the report states that midfielder Baleba remains their 'top target'.",
      "United made a late move for the star over the summer but could not tempt Brighton into a deal with a fee in excess of £100m said to be required to bring his services to Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United will have to convince Joao Gomes to scrap his ambition of playing for Liverpool if they want to sign him from Wolves. Gomes, 24, has been linked with a move to Old Trafford, as the Red Devils target a midfielder in 2026.",
      "United are looking at Premier League-proven stars for the next step of Ruben Amorim's rebuild, having tried to sign Carlos Baleba in the final weeks of the summer transfer window. Alongside Brighton ace Baleba on their shortlist is Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace playmaker Adam Wharton and Gomes.",
      "The Wolves midfielder is in his third full season at Molineux, having joined from Flamengo in January 2023 for around £15million. Gomes signed a new five-year contract with Wolves back in April, but amid their disastrous start to the season - losing nine and drawing two of their opening 11 games - he's been tipped to leave the Premier League's last-placed side.",
      "\"Liverpool is a team I would play for,\" Gomes told ESPN Brazil at the time. \"I have the greatest desire to play. Playing in the Champions League is my biggest dream and that of my family, my biggest dream in football.\"",
      "United returning to the Champions League for the first time in three seasons could go a long way in convincing the Brazilian to make the move to Old Trafford. Amorim also already has an advocate for Gomes inside his dressing room.",
      "Matheus Cunha played alongside the 24-year-old for both Wolves and Brazil, likening him to United team-mate Casemiro. \"He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive,\" Cunha said.",
      "How much should Manchester United pay for Joao Gomes? Let us know your price in the comments section.",

      "\"He is unbelievable on the pitch. I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "Gomes wasn't called up to the latest Brazil squad by Carlo Ancelotti after making his debut last year. He'll be hoping to become a driving the force behind Wolves' survival push and boost his chances of playing at the World Cup - and open doors to a big summer move.",

      "Patrick Dorgu outlined his grand ambitions for the season when he spoke to Manchester-based correspondents in August, revealing he wanted to win the Premier League and play for Denmark at the 2026 World Cup. The reality is United are a world away from winning the title, but the club staff member who sat in on the interview felt that specific quote reflected Dorgu's ambition and determination.",
      "Unfortunately for Dorgu, his ambition to play at the World Cup next summer may not be realised because Denmark were defeated 4-2 by Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night. If Denmark are to book their place at the tournament they will have to qualify via the play-offs. They played at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and Dorgu will be hoping to help his nation reach a third successive tournament.",
      "Dorgu was on the losing side in Scotland, but he notched his third international goal for Denmark when he made it 2-2 with 10 minutes remaining. It was a decent finish in the box, which should give him some much-needed confidence ahead of the return of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "The defender started in United's opening two games of the Premier League season, however, he was dropped to the bench against Burnley before starting the next three games. Ruben Amorim dropped Dorgu again in a recent run of matches against Sunderland, Liverpool, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, preferring Diogo Dalot to start at left wing-back. Dalot struggled at the City Ground and Dorgu was recalled to face Tottenham before the international break.",
      "When fans have watched Dorgu this season, they have wanted Dalot to start at left wing-back. When Dalot has come into the team, they have wanted Dorgu to return to the side. The biggest criticism of Dorgu is his lack of end product. The 21-year-old often finds himself in promising positions down the left wing, but his crosses into the box leave a lot to be desired.",
      "Dorgu has recorded just a single assist this season, which isn't good enough considering the areas he roams into. The ball must have fallen to him in promising positions half a dozen times during the Manchester derby in September, and he wasn't able to carve out a goalscoring opportunity for a teammate.",
      "Although Dorgu was naturally disappointed after Denmark's defeat to Scotland, it was at least a reminder that he can provide value in the final third after an unconvincing spell in a United shirt. Dorgu is likely to start when United welcome Everton to Old Trafford on Monday night. Dalot needs to be taken out of the firing line, but he could be quickly recalled if Dorgu doesn't perform.",
      "There has been no perfect option for Amorim on the left side of the team, but Dorgu now has an opportunity to kick on following his goal for Denmark during the international break.",
      "While the Danish press were complimentary of Dorgu's goal against Scotland, they picked up on what every United fan has been saying: his crosses into the box weren't good enough.",
      "That is the area of Dorgu's game that must improve if he wants to establish himself as a consistent starter. Amorim's system relies on the wing-backs contributing in the final third.",
      "It must be factored in that Dorgu only arrived at Old Trafford from Lecce a little over nine months ago, but a new signing in his position may be considered if he doesn't start to perform.",
      "The good news is that Dorgu seems like a confidence player, someone who will perform better after scoring a goal. During his interview at Carrington in August, he admitted he took a shot from distance on the opening day of the season against Arsenal purely because his confidence levels had increased.",
      "Dorgu looked sharp throughout pre-season in the United States and approached the campaign full of confidence, but he hasn't played like someone brimming with self-belief in recent weeks.",
      "Perhaps regaining that confidence will be the key to Dorgu improving when domestic football returns.",

      "It was a sight for sore eyes this week as images from Carrington were released. Front and centre in the Manchester United training photos was Lisandro Martinez, celebrating another milestone since his ACL injury picked up vs Crystal Palace in February.",
      "It was a measure of Martinez's character that he has been pushing for a return to the first-team squad for weeks. Ruben Amorim admitted he told the defender he could not travel for the trip to Nottingham Forest last month.",
      "He was not risked a week later either for the draw at Tottenham Hotspur and his absence was understandable. Martinez has been out since February and rushing the defender back, potentially aggravating the injury further would have been a foolish decision having come this far on his recovery.",
      "Missing out on the Spurs game almost guaranteed we would see Martinez back among the first-team when they returned to Carrington post-international break and that is how it shaped up. However, his role at the club has changed beyond what anyone was expecting.",
      "When he left the field against Palace, United were losing more than just a member of their leadership group. Martinez was the leading defender at the club and a guaranteed starter in the back five, considering the lack of options available to Amorim.",
      "But when he returns this weekend, he will find that his once guaranteed starting spot in the United team now belongs to Luke Shaw. When Martinez joined the injury room at Carrington, Shaw was there waiting for him as he continued his recovery from a muscular injury.",
      "That was his third major injury of the 2024/25 season and it was looking unlikely Shaw would ever be in a position again to challenge for a regular starting XI position. Fast forward to November, and Shaw has featured in 11 straight Premier League matches for the first time since 2023.",
      "The Englishman is there on merit too. Barring the much-publicised disappointing performance against Manchester City, Shaw has been one of the top performers on the left of the back three, and it was surprising not to see him called up for England.",
      "Coming back into the fold at United, Martinez now faces the prospect of being forced to wait for his chance in the starting XI. The Argentine will have expected to be eased back into the first-team but even when fully fit, he is waiting for Shaw to slip up to take his chance.",
      "This will be a challenge that Martinez will undoubtedly relish but it is a big 18 months ahead for the 27-year-old. He is out of contract in the summer of 2027 and if he doesn't manage to replace Shaw, there's a chance his time at the club could be coming to an end.",

      "Scott McTominay and his international teammates can proudly sit alongside the likes of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce on the list of Scotland's national heroes. The pubs and bars of Scotland toasted McTominay on Tuesday as the midfielder played a crucial role in securing World Cup qualification for the first time since 1998.",
      "Scotland won 4-2 against Denmark to seal their place at next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. McTominay was born in England and qualifies for Scotland through his father, but there is no English blood in McTominay's veins as far as the Scots are concerned.",
      "The adulation McTominay receives with Napoli and Scotland is something he didn't get during his time at Manchester United, the club that moulded him into a man from the academy.",
      "The 28-year-old departed United to join Napoli last year and won the Scudetto in his first season. He was nominated for the Ballon d'Or and ranked as the 18th best player in the world.",
      "McTominay's breathtaking acrobatic goal against Denmark wasn't even a shock because that kind of strike has become his level now - his story since leaving United has been phenomenal.",
      "The execution was outstanding and it will be remembered as one of the great goals in Scotland's history. It was so good that it will be compared to Gareth Bale's bicycle kick in the Champions League final against Liverpool in 2018, and Wayne Rooney's effort against Manchester City in 2011.",
      "McTominay was a good player during his time at United, had achieved his dream of playing for his boyhood club and had played in the Champions League, but he has moved onto another level since moving to Naples.",
      "When McTominay signed for Napoli, there was a conversation about whether United were right to sell him, and the chatter has started again following a hugely successful 18 months.",
      "A few months after McTominay's departure, he admitted that it was a \"huge decision\" to leave United, but he said he had no regrets. McTominay needed to leave the club to progress and United were ultimately right to sell him, despite the level he is performing at now.",
      "McTominay scored 10 goals in all competitions in his last United season. He tended to produce when United needed a goal, scoring a brace against Brentford in October's 2-1 win, twice against Chelsea in December in another 2-1 victory and netting the winner against Aston Villa in February.",
      "However, he was not a regular starter and contributed mostly from the bench, which led Scotland manager Steve Clarke to suggest that he looked unhappy. \"I thought: Maybe he's right,\" he said last year.",
      "United received a fixed fee of €30.5million (£25.7m) for McTominay and inserted a 10 per cent sell-on clause into the deal. The transfer represented 'total profit', which helped United operate within Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR), and it helped to offset incomings that summer.",
      "The club needed to raise cash to alleviate PSR pressure and McTominay wanted to leave. The second point is that McTominay wouldn't have reached his current level if he had stayed in Manchester.",
      "McTominay needed a fresh start. He needed to play somewhere where he would be a key player. He has grown with that responsibility for club and country, but McTominay was never going to be the 'main man' at United, who theoretically should have more naturally 'talented' players.",
      "The final point is that even if McTominay had stayed at United in the summer of 2024, he likely would have felt compelled to leave the club following Ruben Amorim's appointment.",
      "McTominay wouldn't have fitted into Amorim's system and would have been limited to substitute appearances. Just look at Kobbie Mainoo, who can't get a kick because Amorim doesn't believe he is a player of the right profile. Mainoo has been given something to think about watching McTominay.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were signed in the summer to start in the No.10 roles. McTominay would have been behind that pair in the pecking order, and he would have also been down the pecking order if he had been regarded as a deeper midfielder, like Mainoo has this season.",
      "It's understandable that some fans have said United should have kept McTominay on the back of his success, but logic dictates it was right for both parties to go their separate ways.",
      "United still miss McTominay in some ways. Different sources who have been present at Carrington over the last few years all praised McTominay's character and his behaviour around the training ground with staff members and young players. He was a leader and understood the club.",
      "There were some brilliant moments during McTominay's time at United, like his performance against PSG in the Champions League in 2019, his goal against Manchester City in the last game at Old Trafford before the pandemic and, of course, his brace against Brentford during his final season.",
      "But McTominay had to leave Old Trafford to really spread his wings.",

      "Furthermore, United will be in FA Cup third round action on the weekend of January 10, another fixture those players could be ruled out of.",
      "Ruben Amorim was asked about AFCON at a recent press conference and said: “We have time to suffer with that. We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew [that].",
      "\"It is going to be an opportunity because when I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it is hard with one game to take some players from the team because they are going well also, during training and the games.",
      "“Other players are going to have the opportunity to help us, they are understanding the way we want to play. The change of characteristics are not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team, but let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and then we will see in January.”",
      "Amorim will have the option of promoting young players in the absence of Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui, but which academy players have a chance of contributing to the first team?",
      "We've taken a closer look at three young players who could be handed a chance to impress.",
      "Shea Lacey",
      "Lacey is pushing towards making a senior debut this season. The youngster has always been one of the most highly regarded talents in his age group and he has consistently performed in this campaign.",
      "The 18-year-old missed some time on the pitch last term because staff were carefully handling him to prevent injury. Lacey is making up for lost time, though, and recently trained with England's first team, joining a session led by Thomas Tuchel to supplement the numbers at St. George's Park.",
      "\"Everybody in the world knows about Shea Lacey,\" said United Under-21 manager Travis Binnion in September. The forward has huge potential and could play in the No.10 role when Mbeumo travels to AFCON.",
      "Lacey featured during the post-season tour, coming on from the bench against ASEAN All-Stars and starting against Hong Kong. He's been in excellent form in academy matches and scored for England Under-20s last week, so he's becoming increasingly difficult for Amorim to ignore.",
      "Jack Fletcher",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was ruled out of facing Tottenham before the international break due to a knock, which opened the door for Jack Fletcher to come into the first-team squad in London.",
      "Fletcher’s inclusion continued United's 88-year record of naming an academy graduate in every matchday squad, but it was deserved, and he would have been able to contribute had he been called upon.",
      "Darren Fletcher's son has made great progress since joining from Manchester City's academy two years ago. Fletcher has acquitted himself well against senior opposition in the EFL Trophy and National League Cup, which indicates he could make the step up at United when AFCON takes place.",
      "Fletcher is a versatile midfielder and could operate in one of the No.10 roles. He was named on the bench on seven occasions last season and will be hopeful of making his senior bow.",
      "Bendito Mantato",
      "Mantato's chances of breaking into the first team increased when Amorim was appointed because he would fit into the United head coach's system seamlessly.",
      "The youngster used to play at left-back in academy fixtures, but he gradually progressed to predominantly play on the right wing and his style has already led to comparisons with Bukayo Saka, who also started his career as a defender before developing into an attacking player.",
      "Mantato came on from the bench against Leeds in the opening pre-season friendly of the summer in Stockholm. He has participated in first-team training sessions and could potentially slot into Amad's role.",
      "His versatility is a strength, and he would not look out of place at right wing-back. Diogo Dalot is the favourite to start in that role while AFCON is ongoing, but Mantato may make an appearance from the bench.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog on Thursday, November 20.",
      "With the January transfer window fast approaching, United are at the centre of several rumours. Antoine Semenyo is currently the trending name ahead of the winter trading period with several Premier League teams keen to sign him from Bournemouth.",
      "Karim Adeyemi of Borussia Dortmund is a different attacker to be linked with an Old Trafford switch, though the chances of that actually happening seem low.",
      "Versatile Ajax star Jorthy Mokio is the latest midfield option to appear of interest to those at United with the almost certainly more expensive trio of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson also wanted.",
      "With all of that being said, MEN Sport has you covered with all of the latest transfer talk in our live blog below!",
      "Kobbie Mainoo continues to be linked with a January loan move to Napoli.",
      "The Manchester United midfielder wanted to depart the club temporarily on deadline day in search of more minutes, but was told he would not be leaving Old Trafford. He has since played just 93 minutes of Premier League football.",
      "That has resulted in links to Napoli remaining with a mid-season switch now a seeming a real possibility, especially as he and Billy Gilmour share the same agent. CAA Stellar represent both midfielders and that could prove key in getting Mainoo to join.",
      "Manchester United are firmly in the market to sign a new midfielder with a dream transfer option appearing to have now emerged.",
      "According to The Daily Briefing. Ruben Neves is keen on a return to the Premier League when his contract at Al Hilal next summer.",
      "It’s also claimed that contact is already being made with Premier League sides with a deal that would see him join United 'on'. Tottenham have also been credited with an interest in the former Wolves star.",
      "If the 28-year-old does want to play in the Premier League next season, United could sign him on a free transfer, but there is likely to be serious competition if that scenario plays out.",
      "Matheus Cunha could help Manchester United sign Wolves' Joao Gomes if he is the midfielder they actively pursue.",
      "Cunha has spoken very highly of his fellow Brazilian. When he was asked who Gomes reminds him of, the forward made an exciting admission.",
      "\"Maybe Casemiro,\" he explained. \"He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro’s name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive. I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.\"",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has instructed his former club to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth in the January transfer window.",
      "Manchester United and Tottenham have been linked with a move for the Ghana international but Carragher has explained why Arne Slot desperately needs him.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast,he said: \"I think they'll [Liverpool] have to recruit more physical players and maybe even in January.",
      "\"I’ve just seen the Semenyo [January release clause] come up and obviously he’s got the link with [sporting director] Richard Hughes. When you actually look at him as a player, lightening quick, big and powerful.\"",
      "Manchester United are the latest club to be linked with a move for Ajax teenager Jorthy Mokio.",
      "According to Sacha Tavolieri, there is transfer interest from Old Trafford in the 17-year-old, who can play in both midfield and defence, with Newcastle United and Eintracht Frankfurt also keen.",
      "He has added that Mokio is currently uncertain about Ajax's long-term project and is thus yet to sign a new contract despite the club's wishes. That hesitation could result in one of the three teams linked taking advantage.",
      "Manchester United are expected to be involved in the Antoine Semenyo transfer battle during the January transfer window.",
      "The winger is likely to depart Bournemouth given the £65million release clause in his contract and with United, Tottenham and Liverpool all interested.",
      "The latter appear to have the best chance of signing him with the Daily Mail (subscription required) describing Arne Slot's side as the frontrunners for his signature. It has been claimed however, that United are ones to watch in the battle to acquire his services.",
      "Karim Adeyemi appears unlikely to join Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Links to the Germany international had ramped up over the last few weeks but as things stand there is no active moves being made for him with transfer guru Fabrizio Romano revealing no approach or negotiations have started.",
      "United could certainly look to bring in an attacker in the January transfer window especially if one more injury strikes with Benjamin Sesko currently out while Bryan Mbeumo and Amad will be at AFCON.",
      "Hello and welcome back to our Manchester United transfer live blog!",
      "For the latest updates on Karim Adeyemi, Antoine Semenyo, Jorthy Mokio, Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba!",
      "Manchester United's Shea Lacey has long been touted as a star of the future - and it might not just be at club level. The 18-year-old has caught England's eye in recent weeks and months and again played a starring role on the international stage this week.",
      "The United prospect came off the bench to score for England Under-20s in their 1-1 friendly draw with Japan on Friday night, having only made his debut at that level last month.",
      "That outing came after the teenager was called up to train with the Under-21s - who beat Ireland 1-0 on Friday - where he received glowing praise from boss Lee Carsley.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund's transfer value has increased yet again as he continues to enjoy his loan spell away from Manchester United. Hojlund left United to join Napoli on a season-long loan deal, which also includes an obligation to buy.",
      "The reigning Serie A champions will have to pay United €44million (£38.8million) next summer provided certain conditions are met. The Reds have already received a €6million (£5.3million) loan fee from Napoli, which could mean the total fee for the transfer would reach €50million (£44.1million) if the permanent transfer is completed.",
      "Hojlund left Old Trafford in the summer after scoring 26 goals across two seasons at United, and managed 10 across the entirety of the previous campaign. Since signing for Napoli, the Denmark international has four goals to his name across his first 10 appearances.",
      "Manchester United are already being tipped to have a busy January transfer window, but Benjamin Sesko's injury could have the opposite effect. United have just over a month to go until they are allowed to go into the market for new signings once again.",
      "Sesko was one of five new additions to the United squad in the summer, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon all moving to Old Trafford. Despite making big moves in the transfer market a few months ago, United are still being linked with making further additions in the New Year.",
      "However, the recent injury to Sesko could prompt a change in strategy from United. The Slovenia international suffered a knee injury during United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, with reports suggesting that he is expected to be sidelined for up to a month.",
      "As a result, Ruben Amorim could be forced to turn to other members of his squad to fill the void left by Sesko's absence for the next few weeks.",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Gordon Strachan believes letting Marcus Rashford depart has proven to be the right decision by the club, as he has rediscovered his best form at Barcelona.",
      "The 28-year-old winger joined the Spanish giants on a season-long loan in the summer, with the option to complete a permanent move to the Camp Nou. United included an option-to-buy clause in the deal worth around £28million.",
      "Under manager Hansi Flick, the winger has scored six goals and provided nine assists in 16 appearances across all competitions. Strachan believes the move has worked out in favour of both player and club, having saved Ruben Amorim an extra headache in the dressing room.",
      "Matheus Cunha labelled Ruben Amorim \"a winner\" when asked about the Manchester United boss while on international duty. The Reds signed Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves in the summer.",
      "The early part of the campaign was particularly challenging for the club, increasing the pressure on Amorim. However, recent weeks have brought some relief and Cunha has expressed his admiration for the Portuguese coach and teammate Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Manchester United centre-back Lisandro Martinez has shown encouraging signs in training after being pictured with Joshua Zirkzee during the November international break. The Argentine has been out of action since sustaining a serious knee injury in February.",
      "However, the 27-year-old has since returned to training at Carrington as he works his way back to full fitness. Reports suggest that Martinez was granted permission to train with Argentina during the international break to build match fitness.",
      "It is currently unclear whether the former Ajax star will be fit enough to be included in United's squad for Monday night's clash against Everton, however. Reds boss Ruben Amorim is expected to provide an update during his pre-match press conference on Friday. And the latest signs are looking good for Martinez if Zirkzee's latest Instagram story post is anything to go by...",
      "The January transfer window may be a notoriously difficult month for clubs to do business, but for Manchester United and other top teams it can present an opportunity. Players who are out of contract in the summer can speak to overseas clubs as early as January.",
      "If you are club like United where there are a number of players out of contract at the end of the campaign, you need to decide what the plan is for them before January rolls around. If you don't, you risk losing players who you may wish to keep. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at five players United must make decisions on before the January window opens.",
      "Furthermore, United will be in FA Cup third round action on the weekend of January 10, another fixture those players could be ruled out of. Ruben Amorim was asked about AFCON at a recent press conference and said: “We have time to suffer with that. We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew [that].",
      "\"It is going to be an opportunity because when I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it is hard with one game to take some players from the team because they are going well also, during training and the games. Other players are going to have the opportunity to help us, they are understanding the way we want to play. The change of characteristics are not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team, but let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and then we will see in January.”",
      "Amorim will have the option of promoting young players in the absence of Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui, but which academy players have a chance of contributing to the first team?",
      "Bruno Guimaraes has described Manchester United midfielder Casemiro as a \"complete player\". Casemiro has become an important player for club and country again, starting nine games in the Premier League and forcing his way back into Brazil's starting team under Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "The 33-year-old has scored against Chelsea, Brighton and Nottingham Forest this season, and a conversation about whether he merits a contract extension has started among supporters. Casemiro has been representing Brazil during the international break. Newcastle captain Guimaraes sat down for a chat with Globo Esporte and he said he had been \"inspired\" by Casemiro.",
      "When asked why he rates Casemiro so highly, Guimaraes said: \"Experience, titles... he's a complete player. His career speaks for itself. In one of my first interviews with the national team, in 2020, when I arrived they asked if I was inspired by anyone in midfield, and I said his name, Casemiro.",
      "Read more here",
      "Casemiro has easily been one of Manchester United's best players this season. The 33-year-old impressed in the Europa League last term but in the Premier League, where the pace is so fast, he faltered. And yet, this season he has looked a different player in the English top flight.",
      "He has anchored the midfield and given Bruno Fernandes the freedom to push forward. However, he has also been a threat in the opposition box. Only Bryan Mbeumo has scored more than Casemiro for United this season, but with his contract expiring next summer, the Reds have a decision to make.",
      "United could still extend his stay by a further year. It is believed the Reds would be happy to extend his contract, but only if he was willing to agree to a pay cut. If that agreement cannot be reached, United will lose their defensive midfielder and suddenly the search for his replacement becomes a priority. So far, the likes of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba have been mentioned as options to replace Casemiro.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Joachim Andersen was visibly upset during a live TV interview after Denmark's guaranteed World Cup spot was dramatically taken by Scotland, with Scott McTominay's overhead kick leaving him in complete shock. Late goals from Kieran Tierney and Kenny Maclean secured the win for Scotland, despite Denmark twice equalising.",
      "Former Manchester United star McTominay eased the tension at Hampden Park just three minutes into the game when he instinctively responded to a Ben Gannon Doak cross with an audacious overhead kick. Denmark later equalised through Reds loanee Rasmus Hojlund, whose penalty followed a foul by Andy Robertson, before Lawrence Shankland put the hosts back in the lead.",
      "Rasmus Kristensen was shown a red card 15 minutes prior, but Denmark rallied once more with Patrick Dorgu netting a loose ball to level the score again. However, Steve Clarke's team ultimately triumphed when Kieran Tierney scored from distance in stoppage time, and Kenny McLean stylishly confirmed their place at next summer's tournament by lobbing Kasper Schmeichel from inside his own half.",
      "Read more here",
      "Mason Greenwood's decision to snub a call-up to the Jamaica national team has been all but justified, after the Reggae Boyz missed out on automatic qualification for the World Cup.",
      "Steve McClaren had hoped that former Manchester United forward Greenwood would represent Jamaica after it was announced that he had filed papers to request a switch in his international allegiance.",
      "Reports last week, however, emerged that Greenwood, 24, is instead 'obsessed' with representing England again, more than five years since he made his Three Lions debut against Iceland. Although England head coach Thomas Tuchel has made it clear he is not in his thinking, Greenwood is still determined to return to international football with the Three Lions.",
      "Manchester United approached Chelsea to enquire about the availability of Romeo Lavia in the summer transfer window, but at no point did higher-ups at Stamford Bridge put the 21-year-old midfielder on the table.",
      "Meanwhile, the Blues pushed to sign Alejandro Garnacho from United, and Enzo Maresca eventually secured his signature at the end of August as part of a deal worth just £40m.",
      "Manchester United have been issued with a stark reminder of what could have been at Old Trafford with Rasmus Hojlund and Scott McTominay on target in Scotland's thrilling win over Denmark last night.",
      "The latter scored a stunning overhead kick to put Scotland in front, but it was Hojlund that cancelled it out from the penalty spot.",
      "United star Patrick Dorgu was also on target to put Denmark on the brink of qualification for the World Cup, however late goals from Kieran Tierney and Kenny Maclean means Scotland have sealed a guaranteed spot at next summer's tournament.",
      "The Napoli duo have been in impressive goal-scoring form since departing United with that continuing on international duty. In the last two-week domestic pause, Hojlund scored three goals while McTominay grabbed one assist.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has received a welcome fitness boost in attack after losing Benjamin Sesko to injury.",
      "The summer signing suffered a knee issue before the international break and is expected to miss the next few weeks at least. Bryan Mbeumo will also be unavailable for a similar period which makes Matheus Cunha that much more important.",
      "He has already suffered an injury this season but any worries over him returning from Brazil with an issue or fatigue have been eased. That is because he played just 45 minutes of their friendly against Tunisia after featuring for 65 minutes against Senegal this past weekend.",
      "Manchester United are still keeping tabs on Adam Wharton despite fresh links to Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Joao Gomes.",
      "The Crystal Palace midfielder has continued his superb form into the new campaign which has prompted fresh links. Wharton himself recently responded to United rumours directly with those behind-the-scenes at Old Trafford forced into a summer plan.",
      "According to ESPN, United will not make a move for a central midfielder in the winter window with the likes of Anderson and Wharton almost certainly not for sale. Gomes was an option given Wolves' struggles but that switch now seems off the table from both sides.",
      "Manchester United have already been turned down by Antoine Semenyo as a number of Premier League clubs circle the Bournemouth star.",
      "It has been widely reported there is a £65mllion release clause in his new contract that can be activated in the January transfer window.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham have all been linked with Semenyo in recent months with the latter also rejected by Semenyo with the Telegraph claiming that Ruben Amorim's side and Spurs saw £50million moves turned down by Semenyo, before he agreed fresh terms at Bournemouth.",
      "Manchester United will likely struggle to sign Joao Gomes if they decide to make a move for the Wolves midfielder in the January transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been monitoring the Brazil international over the last few months with a £44million price tag mooted.",
      "However, folowing the appointment of Rob Edwards as the club's new head coach, it has been claimed there is gentleman's agreement in place not to sell the club's best players in January to give them the best possible chance of staying in the Premier League.",
      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog.",
      "For all the latest news, updates and rumours on Antoine Semenyo, Adam Wharton, Joao Gomes, Carlos Baleba, Marcus Rashford and much more, stay right here throughout the day!",
      "Manchester United are reportedly setting their sights on Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes as a potential January acquisition, in a deal that could save them £60million compared to signing Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Reds have been linked with the Brighton and Hove Albion star, but it's suggested that the Seagulls would demand around £104million (€120m) for the Cameroon international.",
      "Portuguese media outlet Record reports that Gomes is open to a move to Old Trafford and could be signed for just £44m ahead of the January window.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been told that Antoine Semenyo would take his Manchester United side to the 'next level' Semenyo, 25, has scored six goals and registered three assists in 12 Premier League games this season, helping Bournemouth make an impressive start.",
      "Since Jason Wilcox took over as sporting director, United have prioritised signing players with Premier League experience, as demonstrated by the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. The club have also shortlisted players such as on Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba, Joao Gomes and Adam Wharton, further evidence of their new mandate.",
      "Semenyo was on United's radar this summer, with reports claiming that Amorim met him for a meal in London. The forward's stock has increased since then, sparking interest from Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "Read more here",
      "Forest are reportedly likely to demand a huge fee for Elliot Anderson amid interest from Manchester United, according to the Telegraph.",
      "It is suggested that the 23-year-old midfielder, who is valued at at least £100m, has no release, buy-back or sell-on clauses in his current Forest deal.",
      "The report also suggests there is no chance of a winter sale, however, Forest are braced for bids in the summer with Newcastle also interested."

      "Manchester United loanee Radek Vitek wants to spend the full season with Bristol City and challenge for the No.1 goalkeeper position at Old Trafford when he returns to the club. Vitek spent last season on loan with Austrian club FC Blau-Weiß Linz. He started every league game except three due to injury, and his time playing in Europe was a resounding success.",
      "The 22-year-old was sent to Bristol City on a season-long loan for 2025/2026. Vitek has made a great impression in the Championship and has been tipped to make an impact at United after his loan stint. Senne Lammens was signed for £18.2million from Royal Antwerp in the summer transfer window, but Vitek could potentially challenge Lammens for his starting position when he returns.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol, Vitek said: \"At the moment, the main goal is probably to stay here the whole season and play as many matches as possible. Every game brings different challenges and that's how you get as a young keeper the most experience, because you can be third goalkeeper on the training pitch when you're at Manchester United or big clubs like that but it will never give you the experience from the field.",
      "\"The past three months it's another step forward for me from last year and there are players with more quality and different solutions in front of goal, so I need to make more quick decisions and be ready.\"",
      "Almost every academy player who leaves on loan has a recall break clause that can be activated after six months, which gives United a chance to assess whether it's best for the youngster to stay at their temporary club. Vitek is expected to see out the full season at Bristol City, and he discussed his ambition to play at Old Trafford after his loan.",
      "\"That's my plan, but I will do my maximum for that and we will see,\" he said. \"Let's take game by game and now I'm focussing to play for Bristol City and doing my best. One day it would be a dream to play for Manchester United, but I will take it game by game, and I know there's a big challenge in front of me, but I want to improve every week.\"",
      "Vitek delivered a man-of-the-match performance in United's opening pre-season friendly against Rosenborg in 2024, but he didn't join this summer's tour of the United States because he was due to leave on loan",
      "The goalkeeper signed a new United contract until 2028 before joining Bristol City on loan.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window went well, but heading towards January the Reds know there is work to be done as their squad still feels light in certain areas. Even with the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, the Reds still feel short in attack. Sesko's injury has shown that to be the case.",
      "Should Sesko miss any upcoming games, United seem destined to play Cunha as the false nine with Mbeumo and one of Mason Mount or Amad behind him. But when Mbeumo and Amad leave for AFCON, United suddenly look very short. Ruben Amorim did hint after the Tottenham draw that he could delve into the January market, especially if Sesko's injury is serious.",
      "Even if Sesko doesn't miss a game for United it must be clear to Amorim that another forward addition is needed. Fortunately, the green light has just been given to repeat a trick United used in the summer. The Reds targeted attackers who, as Jason Wilcox put it, can 'plug in and play'. Mbeumo in particular looks to be a very good piece of business as he settles into his new surroundings and continues to score goals.",
      "There is clearly something to be said for signing players who have Premier League experience and so United should be on the lookout for any players at fellow Premier League clubs who could be on the move. According to The Athletic, Bournemouth's top scorer Antoine Semenyo has a release clause of just £65m this winter.",
      "United would need to act quickly to activate it though as it is claimed to expire early in the January window. But, if they did want to make a move, why would United hesitate? Semenyo is a proven goalscorer at this level, with six in 11 for Bournemouth so far this season.",
      "While he has been utilised as a winger this season, he has more than enough experience as a centre-forward to provide decent competition for Sesko at the top end of the pitch. The only issue is whether United would have the funds to activate his release clause. The obvious candidate if United were to sell before they can buy is Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "It is hard to envisage a scenario where Zirkzee gets game time ahead of Sesko, or any of United's other attacking players for that matter. It is believed the striker is set to hand in a transfer request in January and any funds raised from his sale could help a swoop for Semenyo.",
      "It is a deal that would make a lot of sense for United but there will be other teams wanting to snap him up. Liverpool and Tottenham are among the other clubs thought to be keen on him so the Reds would need to act quickly.",

      "During Cox's nine-year stint as academy boss he played a pivotal role in the United academy renaissance, secured top youth signings and oversaw an FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022. Torpey relocated to Manchester from Brentford. He was previously at Manchester City, where he spent nine-and-a-half years working in different positions alongside Jason Wilcox.",
      "The 44-year-old has been spotted at academy fixtures alongside Wilcox, and he recently gave his first interview since his arrival from Brentford in a lengthy conversation with club media. Torpey said: “I know this is Manchester United, we've done amazing things in youth, but I feel it's my duty now to continue that. You know, I've heard my predecessor, Nick [Cox], talk about carrying on the baton, and I believe in that.",
      "“I've been very fortunate to have the tours around Old Trafford and Littleton Road and The Cliff and realise the heritage, you know, and I got to thank [club historian] Jason Leach for taking me around and showing me the ropes on that. “What it made me realise was this club's been built on innovation and a real belief in youth and a bravery to implement youth and look after the club really by utilising the youth that we had and that privilege that I feel I've got now.",
      "“That pressure just comes with that sustainability of that and creating young players that are ready for the first team. You know, we don't want it to be a token gesture, that we have players in our first team because we want to keep a tradition going. We want to have players that are ready, that can make an impact, that can make our first team better, and most importantly, our fans can be proud of.",
      "“You know, I genuinely believe that. I've been very fortunate now to watch players I've worked with over the years go on and represent their country, represent the club, win the best trophies. And there's no greater feeling than one of your own stepping out.”",
      "Torpey was asked how the academy would change under his leadership and said: “It's still early days for me, but ultimately we've got to sustain everything that's happened in the past and sustain the high level of delivery and development of our young players.",
      "\"And this is an institution. This is world renowned. It's almost that privilege and that pinch yourself moment to be here, sat here talking about this. “But at the same time, we've got to take all these things from the historic upbringing and the way that Manchester United is and what it represents, take all those amazing things, enhance them further if we can, and do more of them in terms of our welcoming nature for the young players.",
      "\"But also looking at things that are going to make us even better, you know, and how can we make them better? It goes back to that critical thinking again and asking the right questions and developing certain areas.",
      "“The most important thing is we've got a first-team environment right now that is world class. And we've got to do the same. It's very good where we are right now.",
      "\"And it's served us well, but we've also got to make something that is world class, innovative and gives us the spaces and the technology that's going to allow us to do an even better job in the modern era.\"",
      "He continued: “Then just looking at our processes from a development point of view and trying to take all that experience that we talked about before, those years of different places.",
      "“The innovation for us right now is in facilities, first and foremost. But we've got to understand what it is we want to do in the future, why we want to do it. We've got some fantastic staff. We've got to make sure that they're not operating with their hands tied behind their backs in the modern development landscape. “So that's important for us now, to look at that, to evaluate and then execute on a fantastic new facility that's going to help us sustain our work for the long term and for the next 10, 15, 20 years’ worth of youth development at this football club. Hopefully that will help us support more players into the Manchester United first team.”",
      "Last month, United announced the academy building at Carrington will be redeveloped. United unveiled a £50million makeover to the main building in August and announced plans to bring academy facilities in line with the 'leading standards' they have for the first team.",
      "There will be upheaval while the academy building is redeveloped, meaning the Under-21s and Under-18s will use the modular building, a two-storey block behind the main building. The women's team used the same set-up during the £10m redevelopment of their facilities at Carrington.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo could be poised to boost his earnings by an additional $100m (£76.5m) in the United States following his appearance at the White House.",
      "The Portuguese superstar has built an extraordinary reputation through a remarkable footballing journey spanning Sporting CP, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus and most recently, Al-Nassr. Yet according to Professor Rob Wilson, Director of Executive Education at University Campus of Football Business, the 40-year-old's activities away from the pitch may enable him to develop a more substantial brand than the likes of David Beckham and long-standing rival, Lionel Messi.",
      "Speaking to Vegas Insider after Ronaldo was seen at the White House State Banquet, the specialist said: \"Ronaldo already operates as a billion-dollar global asset. But that White House moment will add political relevance and some hugely important US visibility which are powerful brand signals.",
      "\"When Donald Trump frames Ronaldo as a family favourite of his son, it humanises his image and broadens sponsor appeal. The earned media impact from such exposure would likely sit in the mid eight-figure range, with a small uplift to endorsement pricing in a portfolio already producing well over $60m (£45.9m) a year.",
      "\"We can expect CR7 to press on toward $100m (£76.5m) endorsements in the US as a result of his invitation and appearance at the banquet.\"",
      "Professor Wilson also drew comparisons between Ronaldo's American presence and Messi, who has taken comparable measures recently to feature alongside the US president. He continued: \"Messi's shift into high-level business forums, such as his appearance at the America Business Forum alongside Donald Trump, helps reframe him from elite athlete to national economic ambassador.",
      "\"Messi's brand is already approaching $1bn (£765m) in value with demonstrable commercial impact as shown by Inter Miami's revenue doubling and valuation jumping past $1bn (£765m) itself. His presence signals reliability to investors and governments. It positions him for equity stakes, long-term partnerships and sovereign-level ventures rather than conventional sponsorships.",
      "\"Beckham still sets the standard for turning fame into a lifestyle empire, backed by a half-billion-pound image rights business and a stake in a billion-dollar club. But Messi and Ronaldo now sit on larger global platforms with bigger fan ecosystems and deeper earning power.",
      "\"Each has the scale to become a long-term institutional brand, Ronaldo as a luxury fitness, Gulf-backed platform with Messi acting as a soft-power bridge across the Americas and the global football economy. Both have the potential to surpass Beckham's long-term commercial footprint with carefully curated activations and appearances.\"",
      "This year, Ronaldo made history by becoming the first active footballer to reach billionaire status. This is in part due to his lucrative contract with Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, which is reportedly worth over $400m (£306m).",
      "Currently, it's estimated that Ronaldo's net worth stands at around $1.4billion (£1bn).",
      "To put this into perspective, Ronaldo's wealth far surpasses that of David and Victoria Beckham, who have a combined net worth of £500m, as well as Lionel Messi, whose fortune is reported to be around $850m (£650m).",

      "Manchester United have been urged to give minutes to Chido Obi while Benjamin Sesko is ruled out through injury. Sesko is currently recovering from a knee injury that he suffered before the international break.",
      "The Slovenia international picked up the injury during United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur earlier this month. Reports this week have claimed that Sesko is expected to be on the sidelines for up to a month.",
      "Sesko has scored two goals for United since his £74million move from RB Leipzig during the summer transfer window. Ruben Amorim will now be tasked with managing the United squad for the next few weeks with Sesko on the sidelines, which will include Premier League matches against Everton, Crystal Palace and West Ham.",
      "It remains to be seen what Amorim will have planned to cope with Sesko's absence, and former United striker Dwight Yorke believes that Obi should be given an opportunity. Yorke, who scored 66 goals during his time at Old Trafford, has argued why Amorim should turn to United's academy starlets during Sesko's time on the sidelines.",
      "“I think Amorim has got to invest in the young players and bring some fresh talent through to give a little bit of a chance if Sesko is out injured,” Yorke said in an interview with Snabbare.",
      "“If you're going to bring in a makeshift option as cover, we’ve seen United do that in the past and it hasn't worked. It's too big of a club for bringing in a player that’s not the right fit to improve the team. I’d understand if they were firing on all cylinders to get someone else in there but when things are not going so great, it’s a difficult fit.",
      "“If United are going to go and sign someone else, I think they have to go out there like Liverpool and bring in someone who would have a really big presence at the football club. Otherwise, the under-23s are there for a reason.”",
      "Yorke went on to argue why Obi deserves an opportunity for the United first team over the next few weeks.",
      "“What about Chido Obi? I know the first-team squads are big but you’ve got to get these young players around the team for when situations like this happen,\" said Yorke.",
      "\"When I was at United, the youngsters could train with us and then we’d let them play to get game time and train with us more. It’s so that when they come, they are already up to speed. That’s something I would look at.",
      "“I would like to see Obi put in if Sesko is out. If you're good enough to be at United, you've got to give them a chance.",
      "\"History has shown that this is a club where young players get that chance to stand in and step up and we’ve seen that time and time again.",
      "“If they're going down the road of just trying to bring in somebody who's just okay, United will find themselves going back down the other way again, and I wouldn't go down that road. We’ve seen where that goes.”",

      "Former Arsenal midfielder Stefan Schwarz reckons the Emirates would prove an ideal destination for Kobbie Mainoo should the England international opt to depart Manchester United. Mainoo emerged as a breakthrough star for United throughout the 2023/24 campaign. Having progressed through the academy ranks, the Reds appeared to have nurtured another triumphant homegrown prospect.",
      "Despite such an encouraging beginning to his professional journey, the 20-year-old indicated his wish to exit Old Trafford during the summer window, with his squad status remaining uncertain.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim has preferred a two-man midfield setup this term, with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes steering the side. This has resulted in Mainoo accumulating just 138 minutes of action in the current season.",
      "Chelsea were reportedly interested in the promising midfielder during the summer transfer window, though Arsenal have subsequently surfaced as a prospective future destination. Schwarz reckons such a switch could prove advantageous for Mainoo.",
      "He told Hajper: \"Kobbie Mainoo's links to Arsenal? Arsenal have the best conditions for young players. And they have a manager in Mikel Arteta that is not afraid to give responsibility to them and give them opportunities when he feels they are ready. It's just about preparing them in the best way and that's what Arsenal have done very well the last couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta is often lauded for his knack of promoting young academy players to the first team. Under Arteta's guidance, Bukayo Saka has blossomed into a star player for the Gunners, with the Spanish manager honing Saka's wing role and structuring the attack around him.",
      "One of Mainoo's standout attributes is his composed and mature presence in midfield. Regrettably, it seems the youngster has lost much of the responsibility once bestowed upon him by Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim appears to favour a 'safer' pairing with seasoned players Casemiro and Fernandes. However, should Mainoo transfer to Arsenal this winter, it's likely that Arteta would restore that level of responsibility to the 20-year-old.",
      "His performances at United secured him a place in Gareth Southgate's England squad. The England manager showed enough faith in Mainoo to start him in the 2024 Euros final against Spain.",
      "Mainoo's contract with United runs until 2027. The midfielder is reportedly open to a loan move this season and has currently put new contract discussions on hold.",

      "The reigning Serie A champions will have to pay United €44million (£38.8million) next summer provided certain conditions are met. The Reds have already received a €6million (£5.3million) loan fee from Napoli, which could mean the total fee for the transfer would reach €50million (£44.1million) if the permanent transfer is completed.",
      "Hojlund left Old Trafford in the summer after scoring 26 goals across two seasons at United, and managed 10 across the entirety of the previous campaign. Since signing for Napoli, the Denmark international has four goals to his name across his first 10 appearances.",
      "Only time will tell if Hojlund will complete a permanent move to Napoli next summer or return to United. With the striker enjoying his time in Italy, his market value appears to have increased over the last few months.",
      "The CIES Football Observatory have crunched the numbers and put Hojlund's current market value at between €79million (£69.7m) and €92million (£81.1m).",
      "This marks quite a significant increase in Hojlund's value since the end of last season.",
      "Back in June, the same website listed the striker's value on the transfer market as between €59million (£52m) and €76million (£67m).",
      "Napoli are yet to confirm that they will sign Hojlund on a permanent deal next summer, so it's still unclear if all of the conditions of the loan move have been met.",

      "The Slovenian international suffered the injury before the international break, with further updates since claiming that the striker will be on the sidelines for up to a month.",
      "At the time of the injury, there were fears that Sesko could be ruled out for an even longer spell.",
      "This led to rumours about whether or not United could recall Hojlund in January, but this will not be the case due to there being no such clause included in the transfer, which was agreed earlier this year.",

      "Rashford wanted Barca in January but an approach was not deemed viable by the La Liga giants. Fortunately for the United academy graduate, they returned in the summer and the deal was done.",

      "Six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances suggests Barca will want to keep Rashford. Whether they have the finances to do it is another issue. Barca can sign the England international for £28m in the summer but the financial pressures Barcelona face are well documented.",
      "No matter how well Rashford does at Barca or for England, he will not have a place to come back to at Old Trafford. Amorim has made his mind up and therefore the task would be to find him a new club.",

In Spain, El Nacional has reported that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have both made early contact with Rashford's agent to try and persuade him to move to the Premier League. United can't let that happen.",

      "There were several players from the academy sent on loan to gain experience. Some of those youngsters are excelling, while others have not made the impact they might have hoped. United loaned 18 players in total - and here is how they are faring this season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been hit with a 12-point deduction due to their ownership situation, but they were able to promise regular game time to Amass, who has made 11 starts. The youngster scored his first senior goal against Southampton and United are delighted with his stint so far.",

      "Gore picked up an injury shortly after signing for Rotherham last January, but he made a strong impression in the time he was available, so he was re-signed for this season. Gore has been crucial for Rotherham in midfield. Has started in 15 games in League One and has been one of their best players.",
      "Onana has received praise in the Turkish media since his move to Trabzonspor, who have lost just once in the league from a possible eight games since he signed. The 29-year-old has recorded three clean sheets and helped Trabzonspor to third in the table.",

      "Hojlund made an excellent first impression in Naples, scoring twice against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League shortly after his arrival, but he has scored just four goals in total. Hojlund has copped some flak from the Italian media for his recent performances. Napoli won Serie A last season but sit fourth.",
      "Kana-Biyik recently scored his first senior goal. He salvaged a point for Lausanne in a local derby and was called up to France's Under-20 squad for the November international break.",
      "Moorhouse has made 15 appearances for League One side Leyton Orient, but just four of those have been league starts. The youngster has shown glimpses of quality from the bench.",
      "Dave Hughes, who coached Ogunneye in United's academy, has just departed Newport County. That might impact Ogunneye's role in the squad, but the youngster has made 13 league starts in League Two so far and gained valuable experience, albeit in a struggling dressing room.",

      "Vitek has started every league game for Bristol City in the Championship, keeping five clean sheets. The 22-year-old has made some great saves. Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber recently said of Vitek to the Bristol Post: “He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "Wheatley needed to leave on loan after outgrowing academy football. The young striker has made 13 starts in League Two for Northampton and has found the back of the net twice, as well as recording two assists.",

      "For Iraq that would be a first appearance since their sole qualification in 1986. For Iqbal it would be the latest piece of history and perhaps vindication for opting to leave United and move to Utrecht in the Netherlands.",
      "The tipping point for the now 22-year-old was a lack of opportunities and a seeming lack of trust from then manager Erik ten Hag in granting him a first team chance during the 2022-23 campaign.",
      "\"I thought I would get a chance and unfortunately I didn’t,\" said Iqbal in an interview last summer. \"I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",
      "\"I spoke to my dad and agent and said: 'I can't do this for another year'. From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team. For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the Under-23s. I thought to myself, 'I'm just like a number'.",
      "\"I was supposed to start a cup game against Charlton. I was in all the shapes and patterns in pre-match training. I was starting as a 10 and Lisandro Martinez came up to me and said: 'Now's your chance'. He talked to me and said, 'all of us are supporting you. Just show yourself, you're a good player. We're going to fight for you, make sure you're ready to fight'. It motivated me and it was nice from him, an aggressive leader in the team, a big player. I got tickets for family and friends to see me. Finally, my chance.",
      "\"Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn't see my name. I was gutted. Then I thought I'd come off the bench. Nothing. That was the turning point for me. I didn't feel the manager respected me enough to play me.\"",
      "Iqbal turned down the chance to play at the Under-19 World Cup in April 2023 after Ten Hag told him he wanted to retain him as part of the United senior squad, but no club minutes followed and that summer he left for the Netherlands for a fee in the region of £1million.",
      "Injury has hampered his opportunity for regular minutes in Holland but he is closing in on 50 senior opportunities for the club and is a regular for the national team, scoring a crucial goal in a victory over Indonesia earlier this season. He'd love another against the UAE this afternoon (4pm), it would be the latest chapter of a history-making career.",

Mount has sent a video message to Lewis Rimmer's wife, Sarah, and two daughters, Amelia and Maddison, in the aftermath of a Range Rover hitting him and causing 'life-changing' injuries.",
      "He remains 'critically ill' in hospital after being put in an induced coma, his close friend Andy Tonge has told the MEN. Tonge described the message as 'lovely' for the family. The Bolton News quotes him as saying: \"They're big Manchester United supporters, so this was lovely to receive, what a guy.\"",
      "Mount is said to have shared his condolences and expressed his sorrow at hearing what happened to Rimmer. He also relayed that \"everyone at Manchester United is thinking of them and sending all their love.\" A fundraiser set up by friends to raise money for the family has received over £100,000 in donations.",
      "Tonge has said: \"The incident seems to have really struck a chord with people. It happened during half term, and it’s shocked so many because it could so easily have been a child who might not have been as strong as Lewis is proving to be.",
      "\"Many feel that Lewis’ strength and fight over the last few weeks is nothing short of remarkable.",
      "\"The fact that it took place at a local supermarket, used by so many of us, has created an even stronger sense of, 'This could have happened to anyone of us.'\"",
      "Tonge added: \"Lewis, unfortunately, is still critically ill and remains in an induced coma, three weeks on. Sarah and the family have been by his side every single day, and the fundraiser has genuinely lifted them.",

      "Modern football is often a reflection of the world surrounding it.",
      "When the older generations were watching the sport in the 1960s and 1970s, discussions surrounding the mental stability of a player or the squad was rarely aired. However, as the world became more aware of the challenges of mental health, football has accepted it and now each Premier League club takes into account the psychological fortitude of a player during every aspect of their career - all the way from scouting to the day they depart.",
      "Manchester United are no exception and within their current squad there are two players who are facing mental challenges which shall be putting them to the test. First, is Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Little more than a year after suffering a severe foot injury, the Argentine damaged his ACL and has been sidelined since February. He is now back with the United camp as he continues his recovery and his return to the pitch is expected before the festive period.",
      "But managing to navigate past the mental barrier of returning to professional football will be the crucial step in Martinez's recovery. Specialist in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University Dr Martin Turner, who has worked with The FA and Scarlets Rugby, believes the 27-year-old could come back a stronger athlete.",
      "\"I imagine he [Martinez] will be worrying that it [his injury] would happen again,\" Dr Turner told MEN Sport. \"That is just sensible. That is just the reality.",
      "\"What you wouldn’t want a player like that to do is delude themselves that this will never happen again and everything is always going to be hunky-dory because sport is so unpredictable, and there is so much uncertainty that you can never really predict what is going to happen.",
      "\"But having gone through two quite difficult injuries, he will have learnt quite a lot and his personality and character would have had some shifts. From my experience of working with athletes who have especially had these back-to-back injuries and even sometimes surgeries, they do develop a shift in their personality.",
      "\"I wouldn’t say it is necessarily more resilience, but there is clarity there of what this means to them. They suddenly have a gratitude and thinking of: ‘Well, this could go away at any minute, so I am going to apply myself doubly compared to what I was doing before. I am going to really take care of this and do all the right things.'\"",
      "\"You can’t put it to one side and say that is done now because there will be monitoring that takes place after training and after performances around that injury and around recovery to make sure that everything is going well.",
      "\"There will be physical limitations because it will have been a long time since they have played to the intensity of a proper game.",
      "\"So it is not just a case of putting it to the back of your mind but about trusting the medical professionals you are working with to know that they would not let you step on this pitch, if you wasn’t physically right. Players have to take confidence from that and trust the people they are working with and then they can trust their bodies.\"",
      "Martinez's teammate Bryan Mbeumo is currently negotiating a different type of mental challenge heading out of the international break. Last week, Cameroon lost to DR Congo in World Cup qualifying meaning Mbeumo's national team will not be competing in the USA, Mexico and Canada next summer.",
      "Missing out on the World Cup, arguably the pinnacle of football, will have been a bitter blow for Mbeumo to take but Dr Turner believes that United do not have to fear the forward's confidence dropping upon his return to England.",
      "\"I am not sure they would have to do, or do anything special there,\" he explained. \"Experienced players are able to lift themselves, really, and move on quite quickly. One of the good things about football in particular is how quickly things move from game-to-game.",
      "\"Say you play badly and then you play well in the next game, it is sort of completely forgotten. Things move on so quickly so he would be expected to come back and hit the ground running and get his club mentality on.",
      "\"I think the direction of football, particularly in this country, is more of a club mentality and it is realised that is your bread and butter. I wouldn’t foresee any issues there and I wouldn’t expect staff to do anything in particular for that player.",
      "\"I might be wrong and I have no idea what is going on behind the scenes, but from my experience of being in environments like that, it would be an expectation to get back on your feet and go again.",
      "\"The more that you make a big deal of something that has happened or bring it into the room, the more that is going to affect other players so you have got to get him back moving, playing and within the mentality of the squad.\"",

      "Earlier this month, Manchester United fans were left scratching their heads as one of their best players this season was snubbed again.",
      "Luke Shaw endured a tough start to the season, following on from a campaign ruined by injuries. The 2024/25 season did not go according to plan for anyone in red, but Shaw in particular was being doubted after another season spent mainly on the sidelines.",
      "However, full credit must go to Shaw for the manner in which he has bounced back.",
      "Following the disaster at Manchester City, Shaw has been dependable for the Reds this campaign in a back three. He had to deal with plenty of criticism following that derby day defeat - notably from Roy Keane - and after addressing it, he set about making amends.",
      "Ever since that game, Shaw has got better and better for United and you can see him settling into his new role on the left side of defence. That's why it was surprising when England head coach Thomas Tuchel overlooked him for the final World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "While being overlooked for selection will have been a blow to Shaw, Ruben Amorim will have taken the positives from the decision. He admitted himself, from a selfish perspective, he wanted all his players to be training and recovering at United during the international break. But he would still be delighted to see Shaw competing with England.",
      "\"For me, I want him to go to the national team, but I also want Luke Shaw to train with me, recover with me, and be prepared for my game, so I'm a little bit selfish on that, so if he's not going to the national team, for me it's fine, because I can control better what he's doing,\" Amorim said earlier this season.",
      "While missing out on the November camp was a big blow for Shaw, Tuchel has admitted it is not necessarily the end of his World Cup dream. \"First of all, it's my job now to make contact with everyone,\" the England head coach said at the end of the Three Lions' final international break this year.",
      "\"Players like Trent [Alexander-Arnold], players that are on our long list, 55, 60 players, to reach out to them, be in touch with them, explain to them why they were not here. Explain to them what they have to do, where they can improve.",
      "\"Can they even do something or is it just a choice, so this is my job in the next weeks and months.\"",
      "Shaw and Harry Maguire will be on Tuchel's list of 55-60 players who he is in contact with to discuss their spots in the England squad.",
      "That phone call should work to United's benefit. Shaw will know exactly what he needs to do over the next few months to put himself in contention and that can only help United.",
      "Shaw will be eager to show Tuchel that he was wrong to overlook him. The best way to do that will be to impress for Amorim and the Reds.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt has admitted he is finding the five-at-the-back system under Ruben Amorim easier as time progresses.",
      "Amorim has been heavily criticised for his decision to stick with the five-at-the-back defence, with three centre-backs playing alongside two wing-backs. Some argued the Portuguese head coach needed to be pragmatic and revert to a traditional four-at-the-back system in order to secure results.",
      "Prior to the Burnley victory and with scrutiny mounting, the United boss told reporters: \"Guys, if I feel that it's best to change... I played all my life in the 4-4-2, 4-3-3. The only system that I didn't play one minute: 3-4-3.",
      "\"I just have one idea that we need to be so good in this way of playing, then we are going to adapt. It's like some coaches have a mentality that I'm going to put this system, and then I'm going to change.",
      "\"What I'm thinking is that we have one system that is going to adapt to different systems, and then when everyone is doing this with his eyes shut, I'm going to change a lot of things.\"",
      "United are on a five-game unbeaten run and sit a point outside the top four. Integral to this recent form has been De Ligt, who has started every Premier League match for Amorim this season.",
      "On Monday night, he played the full 90 minutes alongside Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk in a back four as the Netherlands beat Lithuania in their final World Cup qualifier to top their group. After the game, De Ligt was quizzed on his preference and the 26-year-old insisted that he does not have one.",
      "\"No, I don't really have a preference,\" he told Flashscore. \"We play with a five-man defence at Manchester United, but on paper, we defend with four.",
      "\"It didn't feel awkward today; it felt the same as always. I can play in both systems. I'm more experienced with a five-man defence now; the more experience you have, the easier it gets.\"",
      "In the last match before the November international break, you could see De Ligt's point in practice. United would often drop to a back four with Luke Shaw moving into central midfield.",
      "The Netherlands have now qualified for the World Cup and De Ligt expressed his delight post-match to have made his first start for his country since last November. \"Whether it's a comeback? Yeah, a bit,\" he admitted.",
      "\"I wasn't here last time, I haven't started for a long time, so I'm delighted with today. The season is going well so far.",
      "\"I'm not sure if you call it a comeback season, but I'm feeling well, and it's going better with the club, and now I'm rewarded with a start, so that's great.\"",
      "\"It's [the World Cup] still far away,\" De Ligt added. \"It'll be about being fit a lot, that's the most important thing to everyone.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Wayne Rooney doesn’t immediately strike as the tinfoil hat-type, but it feels like the mere mention of QPR might at any point lead him off on a tangent which eventually ends in vehemence about how jet fuel doesn’t melt Taye Taiwo and Clint Hill.",
      "The Manchester United legend has a niche and it is carved out in cast-iron nonsense. And Mike Dean poured petrol on that particular dumpster fire earlier this week.",
      "“What was strange about it,” the former referee said on The Overlap, “is that once QPR found out they were safe, the game restarted and I think Jamie Mackie’s on the pitch, he’s going like that and celebrating while the game’s going on because they know they’re safe. They [Manchester City] make it 2-2 and they [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them.”",
      "And that much is true. Shaun Derry, who wore the captain’s armband for the final 40 minutes at the Etihad after a bout of generational headloss from Joey Barton, once said as such years later:",
      "“We kicked off and immediately knocked the ball into the far corner, as you would in rugby, trying to play for territory. Joe Hart came out and took a throw-in. I thought, ‘Why have we done that?’. It could have come back into me or into whoever in midfield and then back to defenders and into Paddy Kenny, and then you’ve taken 30 seconds off the clock.”",
      "But as chief kick-off culprit Jay Bothroyd added in the same Athletic article: “When I came on the pitch, Mark Bowen, Mark Hughes’ assistant, just said to me to try to hold it up, try and help us get up the pitch, and then once they scored, he was saying to me just kick the ball into the corner. Literally, kick the ball into the corner, get behind, get back to the halfway line and stay compact again.”",
      "If it was a grand scheme devised to undermine Manchester United then of course former Shimizu S-Pulse midfielder and Wales international Bowen was the mastermind.",
      "The reality was that a team facing the prospect of relegation for roughly 94 of the 95 minutes played, not far off half of which they had to play away from home against the best team in the league with 10 men because of Barton’s implosion, was simply exhausted.",
      "As with any decent conspiracy theory, there are salient points among the ruins of absurdity: the kick-off thing was weird; Djibril Cisse did celebrate with Samir Nasri – an old friend from their time together at Marseille – at the final whistle; and there were a handful of Manchester City alumni in the QPR side.",
      "Three, to be exact. The precise same number of former Manchester United players in the Sunderland team which dozed to a 1-0 defeat at the Stadium of Light 140 miles away, failing to muster a single shot from the 65th minute onwards.",
      "And Sir Alex Ferguson had an inside agent working for him in the QPR ranks. When Anton Ferdinand feels the need to reiterate four times in one sentence how he “was p*ssed off” at having cost his brother a Premier League title eight years after the fact, the idea that Manchester City benefited from a light dose of match-fixing starts to collapse in on itself.",
      "Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion, really ought to move on from the inability to make it a half-dozen. Not least because Manchester United lost the title on goal difference to a team which beat them 7-1 on aggregate that season, instigating one of the biggest yet most under-the-radar bottlings in history.",
      "But mainly because Rooney has unforgivably forced us into The Worst Person You Know Just Made a Great Point territory with his incessant cry-arsing about actual Manchester United being screwed by a team rolling over for one of their rivals.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b*llocks,” Barton said in October. With Rooney seemingly dangerously close to labelling each of the above lizard people Illuminati members who sleep with 5G masts, it is a line he would do well to retire.",

      "Premier League stars such as Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are all being linked, but of late it has been suggested United don’t feel a move for any of them is likely in the winter.",
      "The option of Ruben Neves – who played 177 times in the Premier League for Wolves – could be an intriguing one, as Amorim is known to be a fan of his, and United have been credited with interest in him.",
      "Neves is out of contract with Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in the summer, and therefore Caught Offside reports he’ll be available for €20million (£17.7m) in the winter.",
      "But there is a key issue in that his £410,000-per-week wages have put off top European clubs, with the suggestion that if a move to United or another interested club such as Newcastle is to happen, the midfielder will have to drop his demands.",
      "The report suggests that at the moment, a move to Turkey looks most likely for Neves, with Galatasaray and Fenerbahce in the mix.",
      "However, it is also suggested that if other top clubs don’t secure their favoured targets, there could be a lot of interest in Neves.",
      "A £17.1million price tag for a 28-year-old who starred during his time in England and has remained a fixture of the Portugal side since his move to Saudi would be a steal, though it’s not a surprise that the massive wages aren’t rousing many clubs.",
      "If United don’t see paying a big fee for any of the three Premier League midfielders they are tracking as plausible in the winter window, then they’re very unlikely to splash out on a huge contract instead.",
      "Neves would be a great signing in January if his wages were less of a strain, but they’d surely have to be significantly reduced, given the Red Devils’ highest wage is £350,000 per week, and that’s one of only two players who earn over £200,000 per week.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly interested in signing Brazilian superstar Neymar, in what’s been labelled ‘viable’ but for one issue – and certainly a few more.",
      "United’s attack has been improved by some good signings of late. In the summer, they added Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo to their attack.",
      "Each look as if they are coming into their own, having all scored, and Mbeumo has become the star of the show, earning the Premier League player of the month award for October.",
      "While the signings from within the Premier League look to have been best for United so far, they’ve been linked with a shock move for Neymar, who headed back to boyhood club Santos this season.",
      "Fichajes reports the Brazilian is considering a change of scenery, as he’s aware remaining in Brazil could jeopardise his place with the national team, and United are linked.",
      "Neymar, having spent around a year out injured, has not represented Brazil since 2023, and having played for Al-Hilal and now Santos, is not at the level he once was.",
      "He’s scored three times in 16 Brazilian Serie A games this term and his contract is up at the end of the season, in December.",
      "It is known that he could be on the move, with Fabrizio Romano recently stating: “Neymar is trying to help, but don’t forget that Neymar could eventually be available as a free agent from the beginning of January.",
      "“So an interesting situation to follow because Neymar could consider a move in the January transfer window. Now Neymar wants to be 100 per cent focused on his priority, so to help Santos avoid relegation and to do his best for his club.",
      "“In this moment Neymar is not having any advanced negotiation, but some calls have started to understand the situation of Neymar.",
      "“When there is a player of his level available on the market, it is obviously an opportunity. Okay, maybe Neymar is not in the best physical condition now, Neymar is coming from an injury, he had several injuries recently.",
      "“But now he’s back, he’s fit, he’s trying to help Santos.",
      "“He’s trying to find his best condition, and so keep an eye on Neymar because he could be one of the names to watch for the January transfer window on a free transfer, and so that could be an interesting situation to follow.”",
      "Fichajes suggests a move to United is ‘viable’ but a lack of European competition – with global exposure said to be needed for Neymar to return to the fold with Brazil – is a drawback.",
      "But after three years away from an elite league, Neymar is in no position to be demanding anything of the sort, and United should steer well clear.",
      "They seem to have gotten themselves back into a good spot, challenging towards the top of the Premier League, and signing a past-it Neymar is not going to help them.",
      "Should he join and fail to have an impact – which is likely given he’s not played at a good level for years now – it may only breed discontent within the club, and they’ll have wasted a transfer trying to grant somebody his wish of returning to the Brazilian side.",
      "Further to that, they wouldn’t dream of signing a player with just three league goals in his last season were it anybody else, so signing Neymar would essentially be just for his name.",
      "It’s also a bad look for Neymar if he is to leave. After his emotional homecoming for the swansong of his career, to decide actually, these lot aren’t great and I’m better off going and playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world, perhaps isn’t the best call.",
      "Man Utd flop Antony is now being likened to Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar just months after Ruben Amorim sold him to Real Betis for £22m.",
      "Manchester City are prominent in a list of the 20 most expensive forwards in transfer history. Cunha and Mbeumo are in but No 1) will never be shifted",

      "A Manchester United attacker is felt to have a ‘crucial opportunity’ coming soon, but there will be a point prior to that in which ‘alarm bells’ could begin to ring.",
      "United’s attack has been more impactful this season than it was last. Indeed, they have scored 19 Premier League goals this term, only bettered by the league’s top three.",
      "They are also in reach of the top three, just two points from Chelsea in third, and four points from Manchester City, in second.",
      "Last term, when United finished 15th in the league, none of their players reached double figures for goals, and in 32 games, then-new signing Joshua Zirkzee scored just three goals.",

      "Some close to him reportedly feel, per the Daily Mail, that a ‘crucial opportunity’ is opening up for him.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is injured – having started six league games up top this season – and though Matheus Cunha is the preferred No.9 deputy, doing so against Tottenham in the last game, Zirkzee is another option.",
      "The upcoming game against Everton is seen as a significant one, with a view of what could be to come in January.",
      "If he is not used, or only used sparingly, then ‘alarm bells’ are expected to start ringing. It would be an opportunity for United to test out what their attack could be like during AFCON.",
      "Indeed, Bryan Mbeumo will be gone then, and Zirkzee represents an option to replace who has clearly been United’s best player so far this term.",
      "As such, if he can show he can deputise for Sesko, the Zirkzee might be given more minutes to bed himself in and get up to speed so that the loss of Mbeumo for weeks does not feel quite as impactful as it might.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has stated the desire is for Zirkzee to stay as an option across the attack.",
      "He said: “But the expectation is for three, maximum four weeks, out for Sesko. So the hope is to have him available at the beginning of December. This could be important to understand also the future of Joshua Zirkzee because Zirkzee would be open to leaving Man Utd in the January transfer window.",
      "“Maybe go on loan, maybe have the opportunity to play on a regular basis, but at the same time, he remains an important player for Man Utd. Look, now there is the AFCON, and so some players are going, there is the injury of Sesko.",
      "“If you have injuries, if you have problems, whatever happens, you need another striker, and Zirkzee can be used as a No.9, as a N0.10 behind the strikers. So for Amorim, he’s an important player. Amorim wants Zirkzee to stay.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano insists that Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee could still be asked to stay at Old Trafford despite “good” injury news on Benjamin Sesko.",
      "A Manchester United attacker has reportedly been told there is ‘no chance’ that he’ll be allowed to leave in January, with the club to ‘block requests’ in the winter.",

      "Indeed, it has since emerged that United had a very serious interest in the 25-year-old Bournemouth star, with Amorim even meeting the player for dinner to discuss a prospective move.",
      "That’s according to transfer journalist, Duncan Castles, who claims Amorim met with the player to assess his personality and with the United boss ultimately informing club bosses he felt the player had what it takes to become a success at Old Trafford.",
      "That comes after David Ornstein had previously described the Portuguese as being “very fond” of the Bournemouth star.",
      "However, United’s unwillingness to pay more than £55m saw the deal collapse and ultimately saw the winger sign a new five-year deal with the Cherries.",
      "This week, though, it has emerged that Semenyo‘s deal contains a release clause worth just £60m, plus £5m in add-ons to prise him away from the Vitality Stadium and sparking something of a mad scramble for the Ghana international.",
      "And while sources have revealed it is Liverpool “ahead in the race”, the player continues to be linked with other sides, most notably Tottenham Hotspur and Man Utd.",
      "Despite that, both The Athletic and our own, Fraser Fletcher, are playing down the prospects of United rekindling a move for Semenyo in January, with the former describing a potential move to Old Trafford as ‘difficult’.",
      "Fletcher, meanwhile, insists while United still very much admire the player, their priorities in the January window and beyond lie elsewhere, with the club’s entire focus now shifted on upgrading their midfield and with three major targets the priority over the next two to three transfer windows…",
      "READ MORE 🔴⚫ Ruthless Man Utd planning £250m TRIPLE signing, with Bruno Fernandes at risk in midfield rebuild – Sources",
      "According to Castles, Amorim met Semenyo for dinner in a London restaurant to discuss a potential move north over the summer and prior to the player inking his extension at the Vitality Stadium.",
      "Castles told The Transfers Podcast: “They used the same strategy with Cunha and Mbeumo in that they agreed personal terms with Semenyo before attempting to agree a fee with Bournemouth.",
      "“They even had Amorim take him for a meal in London at the end of the season so Amorim could judge his character – again a similar process to Cunha and Mbeumo.”",
      "United’s prospects of signing Semenyo ultimately failed when he committed instead to the Cherries, though Castles also explains that United’s willingness to only pay the player 70% of the salaries offered to Mbeumo and Cunha also derailed the prospective deal.",
      "Furthermore, rival interest from Tottenham, coupled with United’s willingness to spend £62.5m to meet Cunha’s exit clause, meant the Cherries felt in a strong position to reject United’s approach and amid a suggestion they were not prepared to spend more than £55m on a player they rated at nearer the £70m bracket.",
      "While Semenyo was a player who ultimately slipped through their net, Castles is adamant he was a player they could have signed in addition to both Cunha and Mbeumo, if the price was right.",
      "And while the interest in the player remains, he is unlikely to be a priority for United, leaving his other suitors free to battle it out.",
      "Meanwhile, Paul Scholes has endorsed United’s pursuit of Elliot Anderson, but the Old Trafford legend wants Amorim to play the Nottingham Forest midfielder in a different role from what he is used to.",
      "On that new midfielder hunt, our transfer correspondent, Dean Jones, has revealed Crystal Palace’s stance around a mid-season sale of Adam Wharton, amid speculation that the Red Devils have already ‘submitted’ a ‘bid’ for the midfielder that Amorim ‘loves’.",
      "Elsewhere,  United have been confirmed as one of the clubs to have held talks with super-agent Jorge Mendes over a move to sign Borussia Dortmund attacker Karim Adeyemi next year, though sources have confirmed why the Germany star currently favours a move to Arsenal."

      "“It’s just business in and around the box, and I love that. You can play it into his feet, he can dribble. [Peter] Crouch mentioned his touch and how sharp he is but technically, I don’t think he gets enough credit.",

      "“If he can show that sort of drive, the skills, the vision and score those sorts of goals in a United shirt then I will say wow, that’s the guy we bought from Wolves.",
      "“From what I’ve seen of him so far, it’s potentially there. We know what he’s capable of doing. He just needs to do it more consistently. We’ve only seen little spells.",
      "“Mbeumo on the other hand, I think he’s overperformed on what I thought he would produce in all honesty.",
      "“I wasn’t quite sure about him coming to United but you’ve got to give people the benefit of the doubt, and I did.",

      "Man Utd declined to a new low under Amorim last season as his squad struggled to adapt to his favoured 3-4-3 formation, but they recruited well in the summer to build a well-equipped team.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has had his critics as he gets up to speed with life in the Premier League, but Sanne Lammens, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have made a great impact in recent weeks.",
      "However, Man Utd still have improvements to make if they are to win the Premier League and/or Champions League in the next couple of years, with their priority to sign a centre-midfielder.",
      "Former Liverpool star Don Hutchinson thinks Man Utd are on track, but he has encouraged them to replace Amad Diallo and Diogo Dalot.",
      "“I think the win at Anfield has helped them massively. Because you can’t underestimate when you’re losing games and you’re getting done by Grimsby, and you’re getting beat by Brentford, it’s not great,” Hutchinson said in an interview with sportscasting.com.",
      "READ: Antoine Semenyo to Man Utd makes no sense until Amorim addresses biggest problem position",
      "“It’s a bit doom and gloom and it’s like win two, lose one. The league table, because it’s early, helps.",
      "“Last weekend against Tottenham, if they won, they went second, which is psychologically huge. You’re in a decent little space because you’re playing quite well.",
      "“The job’s not done yet, but the league position would say, if we win we’re marching towards Champions League football, into second.",
      "“Then you go to Anfield and beat Liverpool. That puts him in a good frame of mind. I’m still not sold on his system in terms of personnel. I don’t think Dalot’s a left wing-back. I don’t think Amad’s a right wing-back.”",
      "However, Hutchinson thinks five players have been “positives” for Man Utd this season.",
      "“There’s a lot of questions that I ask from a tactical point of view,” Hutchinson added.",
      "“I’m a little bit baffled but what you’ve got to say is with the likes of Mason Mount’s form, Cunha, Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes, and Casemiro’s upturn.",
      "“I still think there’s a group of players now where if you go back towards last season, I couldn’t name you one Man United player apart from Bruno that’s improved under Amorim.",
      "“Now I’m starting to see three or four or five. So that’s a positive.”",
      "A Man Utd star has been blasted for not being good enough in attack or defence by a man who really, really hates “high fives”.",
      "Manchester United are one of the clubs reportedly tracking an Ivorian wing-back, with offers ‘expected’ in January, but Amad Diallo should not worry about his compatriot.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been tipped to replace two players in January, while Matheus Cunha’s impact on the team has been “exaggerated”.",
      "Former Man Utd winger Lee Sharpe insists that the Red Devils should look to upgrade Diogo Dalot with the defender “sloppy in his decision-making”.",

      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match."

      "The Red Devils allowed McTominay to leave Old Trafford for around £25m in August 2024 with Erik ten Hag looking to reshape his squad at Man Utd.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked a few months later and replaced by Ruben Amorim, with Man Utd ending up with egg on their faces as McTominay helped Antonio Conte’s side win the Scudetto in his first season at the club.",
      "McTominay contributed 12 goals and four assists in 34 appearances in Serie A last term as he took the league by storm – but he has not quite reached the same levels as last season this campaign.",
      "The Scotland international has two goals and one assist in ten appearances in the league as Napoli’s recent form has seen them drop down to fourth in Serie A.",
      "And now Spanish website Fichajes, which doesn’t have the best hit rate when it comes to transfer news, claims that Everton are ‘preparing’ a €70m (£62m) offer to break their transfer record and sign McTominay from Napoli.",
      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "The report adds: ‘At Goodison Park, McTominay is seen as a strategic figure. Moyes values ​​his ability to burst into the box from deep, comparing him to the powerful Marouane Fellaini of old. This quality would give Everton a dangerous option in their attacking transitions, capable of creating havoc in the opposition’s defense.",
      "‘The club is considering a significant investment to bring him back to the Premier League. The estimated sum of 70 million demonstrates their ambition. Recent reports suggest that Everton understands the Scot could be a game-changer for their midfield, both in the short and long term, should Garner leave or lose his place in the starting lineup.’",

      "“It’s not a coincidence. McTominay is perfect for Conte as Conte is perfect for McTominay.”",

      "Former referee Mike Dean has backed claims from Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney conspiracy theory around Man City’s dramatic Premier League title win in 2012.",
      "The Red Devils were beaten to the Premier League title on the final day of the 2012 season despite their 1-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Man City were losing 2-1 at home to relegation-threatened QPR going into second-half stoppage time before Roberto Mancini’s side scored two goals in two minutes and five seconds to take the victory and the title.",
      "Man Utd legend Rooney has since voiced skepticism around Sergio Aguero’s late winner, while he criticised QPR’s players for “celebrating after the game with the City players”.",
      "Djibril Cisse hit back at those accusations from Rooney last month and insisted it was understandable that he celebrated with compatriot Samir Nasri as both teams had achieved something with QPR staying up.",
      "And now former Premier League referee Dean has questioned why the QPR players kicked the ball back to Man City after Edin Dzeko’s equaliser on 92 minutes.",
      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "Dean told The Overlap Fan Debate: “They [City] make it 2-2, and they [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them. And we were like, ‘what’s going on, why are they giving the ball back straightaway?’ I said [that] in the ear piece.",
      "“To kick off and give the ball straight back to them. Neil Swarbrick, the fourth official, said, ‘keep switched on, something is going to happen.’ You just knew something was going to happen. You could just tell.",
      "“What was strange about it, once QPR found out they were safe, Jamie Mackie was on the pitch celebrating while the game was still going on.”",
      "Rooney chipped in: “They had loads of ex-City players in there as well.”",
      "The Man Utd legend’s claims have previously stirred something in former Man City and QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who didn’t hold back the swears for Rooney.",
      "On Rooney’s theory, Barton said: “At the time, we were fighting for our own survival, so we had to better other people’s results on that day to stay up. As it was, we all got beat.",
      "“I have to disagree with Wayne. Wayne is trying to say that this game is some kind of bent fixture, that the lads had given up. He does say Paddy Kenny has basically thrown the two goals in that lead to City winning the league. I don’t think Paddy knew.",
      "“You might say Paddy should have done better with the goals, but I don’t think Paddy Kenny is the type of lad to throw a game to help Man City win the league.",
      "“So Wayne, and the other Man United fans – and I know loads of Man United fans have come up and asked me – no. I got told by Bobby Zamora to get someone sent off, so I tried. That’s where the book stops with me.",

      "“Stop wasting your time on nonsense. The game at Man City was not thrown. Man City won the league, Man United never. Am I happy about that? Abso-f***ing-lutely, because I hate Man United. But I didn’t go out my way to make City win the league.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b****cks.",
      "“You should have got yourselves in a better position. You didn’t. Man City had to beat QPR on the last day of the season at home, who were in the bottom four. That’s your fault.",
      "“The fact he’s even had a sniff of winning the league is a testament to the lads at QPR and the battle they put up, because that was an easy f***ing win for City.’",

      "Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo may be a luxury signing, not a necessity, for Manchester United, but he can take them “to the next level”, says Bacary Sagna.",
      "Reports emerged on Monday that Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, sparking rumours of a departure in the January transfer window.",
      "Manchester United and Liverpool are among those being linked with the Ghanaian international, with the latter eyeing a long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly leading the race for Semenyo, with a January transfer not being ruled out.",
      "Manchester United are among the clubs being linked with the Bournemouth star, and former Arsenal, Manchester City and France right-back Sagna thinks he could take Ruben Amorim’s team to another level.",
      "“Looking forward, if he was to leave Bournemouth and stay in the Premier League, I think Manchester United would be a suitable option for him,” he told Oddspedia.",
      "“He could definitely help the club get back to the top end of the league and if he did join them, he’d be regarded as the player which made the difference and take United to the next level.",
      "“He’s young, fresh and has proven he can shine in big games this season – so I think Old Trafford could be a good destination for him.”",
      "Sagna added: “If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season.",
      "“As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it’s much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly – rather than joining midway through a campaign.”",
      "Semenyo is a fantastic player, but it’s probably worth seeing if Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha can continue to improve United before they spend big on another Premier League forward.",
      "Amorim’s frontline was completely revamped in the summer transfer window with the signings of Cunha, Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for over £200million.",
      "Not only are those three players shiny new investments, but the Red Devils have bigger priorities in the transfer market, namely a new central midfielder.",
      "Suppose United are convinced that recruiting from lesser Premier League clubs like Wolves, Brentford and Bournemouth is the way to go, they won’t look further than Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton in their pursuit of a new midfielder.",
      "Sure, Semenyo would improve the United squad, but Amorim also has Amad Diallo, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount. Obviously, £65m should be invested elsewhere.",
      "While we aren’t convinced by the financial practicality of United signing Semenyo, we are convinced that Semenyo to Liverpool is a transfer that makes perfect sense.",
      "The Premier League champions also spent big on their attack in the summer, signing Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak for over £200m, while attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz joined for £100m.",
      "However, there is an alarming lack of depth behind Mohamed Salah on the right, with right-back Jeremie Frimpong seemingly second in Arne Slot’s pecking order.",
      "Not only is there no serious competition for Salah, but Liverpool need a long-term replacement for the 33-year-old.",
      "No matter how you look at it, the odds are stacked in favour of Liverpool recruiting a serious downgrade on Salah, because he’s played at an all-time level for the Reds.",
      "The best option is arguably Michael Olise, Bayern Munich’s world-class winger, but even he would be a downgrade on the Salah we saw last season. Unfortunately for Liverpool, they can’t replace the best Premier League winger of all time with someone capable of making the same impact.",
      "So, Semenyo shouldn’t be viewed as an underwhelming replacement, and he probably isn’t, having scored six goals in 12 Premier League matches this term.",
      "Despite record-breaking summer expenditure from Liverpool, they still have money to spend, and they’d be wise to invest their funds into the signing of Semenyo, but only if they sign a centre-back first, in what would likely be a £100m total investment, unlike Man United’s £165m spend on the Bournemouth man and a midfielder like Anderson or Baleba.",

      "Man Utd have been warned by Red Devils legend Dwight Yorke not to sign Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton as they look for a new midfielder.",
      "The recruitment team at Man Utd were criticised over the summer transfer window for not bringing in a new midfielder despite spending over £200m on five new signings.",
      "It was one of the weakest areas in Ruben Amorim’s side last year and early on this season it was once again an issue as Man Utd remained inconsistent.",
      "The Red Devils have been much better in recent weeks with Man Utd currently five unbeaten after Amorim’s side won their first back-to-back Premier League matches under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Man Utd are still looking for midfield reinforcements, though, with rumours that they could make a new signing in that position over the January transfer window.",
      "Crystal Palace’s Wharton is one of many players linked with a move to Man Utd but Yorke doesn’t think that the England international would be the answer for the Red Devils currently.",
      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "Yorke told Snabbare: “I’m not sure Adam Wharton is the answer. He’s still not quite there for me yet and that’s an area of concern we have to look to improve.",
      "“It is a gap in this Manchester United team. You look at the history behind the football club in its most successful years and they always had a fantastic number six in that position.”",
      "Yorke insists that their new midfield sign must be capable of dictating the pace of a game but it will be “a tough gig” to find the right players.",
      "He added: “Casemiro has been hit and miss at times and it’s a key part of your team. You listen to all the great managers, that central area of your midfield is always so important.",
      "“It’s a tough gig that one to find the right players and I think that’s why they’re struggling. They haven’t got that player who can set the floor of the game, as I always call it, and dictate the pace, who defends but passes the ball forwards, and can see the pass.",
      "“These types of players are rare which surprises me as on the face of it it’s not the most difficult job in the world but it’s the most crucial.”",
      "Yorke continued: “Who I would like to see in that position more? I can’t think, honestly, because there’s too much hype around some of these players,’ he continued.",
      "“Bring back Michael Carrick, maybe? There we go. He’d have done a job in this team!”",
      "When asked if he’d been impacted by the links to Man Utd and other teams, Wharton recently told The Athletic: “Not really, to be honest. I don’t really look into it or think too much about it.",
      "“There’s always rumours floating about on social media and things like this. Is it true? Is it not true? You tell me!”",
      "“Honestly, I get my friends all messaging me or my family, my brothers. Everyone will message me and they’ll be like, “Oh, is this true? This club is interested.”",
      "“I’m like, “Thanks for telling me because I didn’t know before you told me!” and I don’t really take an interest to it too much. I don’t really think about it.",
      "“If something is going to be serious, then I can maybe think about it. But if it’s not very serious, if there’s interest, I’m not interested in knowing because interest… you can be interested in anything and nothing can come from it… I don’t really read into it too much.",
      "“I see it and I’m like, ‘Okay,’ and just carry on with my day. United, the big teams, they’re all linked to 10-20 players. If I’m one in 20, it’s nothing special. It doesn’t really mean too much.",

      "Worst: Cristhian Mosquera (+1)\nIt really was an exceptional signing but Mosquera has suffered for his craft as third-choice centre-half, even if none of the three goals Arsenal have conceded with him on the pitch could be at all attributed to him. Gabriel ended up on the floor for two of them (Nick Woltemade and Brian Brobbey).",
      "",
      "Best: Lucas Digne (+6)\nThe one Premier League game Digne didn’t start this season resulted in a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Villa Park. He remains really quite crucial to Unai Emery.",
      "Worst: Tyrone Mings (-5)\nThe former captain did not miss a minute of Villa’s five-game winless start, then was forced off through injury shortly before Ollie Watkins equalised against Fulham in their first win of the season.",
      "",
      "Best: Alex Scott (+4)\nIt was enough to catch the eye of Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Worst: Marcos Senesi (-4)\nThe Italian has played all but 12 minutes of Bournemouth’s Premier League campaign so far; the Cherries just so happened to mount their stirring comeback against Fulham in October immediately after Senesi came off.",
      "",
      "Best: Kevin Schade (+5)\nBrentford haven’t scored a single goal without Schade on the pitch this season. If Spurs want him they will have to pay.",
      "Worst: Keane Lewis-Potter (-4)\nKeith Andrews has spoken about his delight at having “options” at left-back, but Lewis-Potter – rather understandably as a natural forward playing out of position – seems to struggle bringing that balance to the team.",
      "",
      "Best: Georginio Rutter (+6)\nIt does seem to make Brighton tick when Rutter plays – even if the £40m record signing forward has scored precisely none of their 17 goals.",

      "",
      "Best: Alisson (+5)\nFair play to Federico Chiesa, who can match that personal goal difference despite being given a fraction of the playing time because Arne Slot seemingly fundamentally dislikes him.",
      "Worst: Florian Wirtz (-4)\nIt is only by virtue of having played more minutes that Wirtz edges ahead of Conor Bradley and Giorgio Mamardashvili, which neatly underlines how Liverpool have struggled to replace key players in net and at right-back. But those numbers are particularly stark for nine-figure signing Wirtz, who still awaits his first Premier League goal or assist.",
      "",
      "Best: Jeremy Doku (+16)\nManchester City have not lost a Premier League game Doku has started since March. Liverpool felt the Belgian’s entire wrath and the only players in Europe’s top five leagues with a better personal goal difference all turn out for Bayern Munich.",

      "Best: Casemiro (+8)\nThe football undeniably left him but has emphatically returned. The only defeat Manchester United have suffered with Casemiro starting this season was on the opening weekend against Arsenal.",
      "Worst: Manuel Ugarte (-7)\nThat is a remarkable swing which emphasises the significant drop-off in quality between the club’s two foremost holding midfielders. Ugarte – and more specifically Ruben Amorim’s insistence on leaning on the Uruguayan as a perennial substitute – has become one of Manchester United’s biggest problems.",
      "",
      "Best: Jacob Murphy (+2)\nThere might be no better, more effective or important Newcastle player than the one Rafael Benitez signed from the Championship eight years ago. And that is damning, no less so because…",

      "Best: Dan Ballard (+6)\nThat just feels right for 2025’s Radhi Jaidi.",
      "Worst: Jenson Seelt (-2)\nThat’s a fairly harsh reflection of a player who went off through injury at 0-0 of a 3-0 thrashing of West Ham, then played the majority of a 2-0 defeat to Burnley before leaving for Wolfsburg on loan.",

      "Best: Guglielmo Vicario (+9)\nSome doubts remain but Gary Neville reckons “the goalkeeper looks a lot better” and “more solid than he has been” recently.",

      "",
      "Best: Fer Lopez (-3)\nPerhaps Rob Edwards will find a use for £19.6m summer signing Lopez; Vitor Pereira rarely seemed enamoured with the idea.",
      "Worst: Joao Gomes (-15)\nIt is, along with Heidenheim pair Diant Ramaj and Patrick Mainka, the worst personal goal difference in Europe’s top five leagues so far this season. Perhaps Gomes isn’t the answer to Manchester United’s Ugarte problem.",
      "The brilliance of Barnes. The bend of Beckham. The blood of Butcher. Behold the England B-Team. And yes, there’s room for Bellingham.",
      "Jude Bellingham is one of the best footballers in the world and some England fans are plain weird for wanting him nowhere near the team.",
      "We are sick to the back teeth of Premier League footballers being given underserved dues and so we’ve exposed the most overrated stars of every club.",
      "Sunderland could be scuppered by AFCON, and Man Utd might suffer, but Arsenal are unaffected and may actually profit. Leeds too…",
      "Wayne Rooney is getting awfully comfortable with basically accusing QPR of colluding with Manchester City to deny Manchester United of the title in 2012.",

      "Thursday 20 November 2025 09:47, UK",
      "Which Premier League teams are overachieving and underachieving this season? And will Arsenal be caught?",
      "Eleven games in, the season's main narratives have already emerged.",
      "Arsenal are the team to catch following their strong start to the campaign. Manchester City, rather than faltering champions Liverpool, are seen as their most likely title rivals. At the other end of table, bottom side Wolves are already at risk of getting cut off.",
      "But what's your team's true performance level this season?",
      "Our expected table measures underlying performance data rather than results and the standings might surprise you.",
      "Crystal Palace are rated as the third-best performing team in the division behind Arsenal and Manchester City, while struggling Liverpool should be four places better off in fourth.",
      "Newcastle and newly-promoted Leeds are also underperforming significantly. They sit sixth and seventh in the expected table, eight and nine places better off respectively.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side face Everton on Monday Night Football on a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League but the expected table has them three places worse off in 10th, suggesting their performances haven't been as good as recent results suggest.",
      "One team conspicuous by its absence from the top half of the expected table is Sunderland.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side are flying high in fourth having amassed 19 points from their first 11 games following promotion but the expected table has them a whopping 14 places lower, as the third-worst performers in the Premier League so far, based on xG, with an expected points total of eight.",
      "Burnley and Fulham should also be in the relegation zone, with bottom side Wolves placing 17th. Wolves have only taken two points from their first 11 games but their expected points total is nine.",
      "Nottingham Forest, like Wolves, should be in a much better position, according to xG, but the expected table is grim reading for Spurs and Aston Villa, who should be nine and 10 places worse off respectively according to underlying performance data.",
      "But how will it look at the end of the season?",
      "Liverpool are predicted to come third despite sitting eighth as things stand, with Chelsea completing the top four and Manchester United in fifth, a position that could clinch Champions League qualification, depending on this season's coefficient.",
      "Crystal Palace are also predicted to clinch a European finish in sixth, along with Spurs, who sit a place below the Eagles in seventh. Sunderland are ninth, with Aston Villa only just squeezing into the top half in 10th.",
      "While Newcastle fans are hopeful their team's form will recover following a poor start, the predicted table has them 14th, which would be their lowest finish since being relegated in 2015/16.",
      "Relegation could become a reality for West Ham, according to our predicted table. The Hammers won back to back games before the international break but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are tipped to go down in 18th, along with Burnley and Wolves.",

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "A number of Premier League stars have entered the final year of their contracts, meaning they can negotiate a free transfer with clubs outside of England from January.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side have prioritised extending the deals of players at risk of leaving in the near future and the contract situation for the team is in a strong position as a result.",
      "Nothing to report for next summer and with no potential exits on a free, Arsenal can now concentrate on more important matters on the pitch.",
      "Ross Barkley",
      "A seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",
      "Whether that warrants a fresh deal at Villa Park remains to be seen.",
      "Marcos Senesi",
      "In the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.",
      "Talks are reportedly under way regarding a new deal but like the future of his boss Andoni Iraola, there has been no news as of yet.",
      "Adam Smith",
      "The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.",
      "Injuries have hindered his involvement for the first team this season but 11 years into his career at the Vitality Stadium, Smith still has a role to play.",
      "Vitaly Janelt",
      "Talks over a new deal are yet to reach an agreement and the Bees want a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around.",
      "Rico Henry",
      "Brentford hold the option to extend Henry's stay in west London by an additional year so are in no danger of losing the left-back.",
      "Knee injuries and other fitness issues have blighted his time at the Bees but Henry has played a role in cup competitions for Keith Andrews' side, providing crucial depth and experience at left-back.",
      "Mathias Jensen",
      "Another future at Brentford that the club are in control of. Jensen is one of three players with an option of an additional year in his current contract.",
      "The 29-year-old, who will be turning 30 when the transfer window opens, has been used prominently in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Josh Dasilva",
      "Dasilva signed a deal in October to remain at the club until the end of the season after seeing his previous contract expire in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old is yet to return from a serious knee injury suffered in February but head coach Andrews has stressed his importance to the team. Brentford hold an option to keep him for a further 12 months if his return from injury goes to plan.",
      "Myles Peart-Harris",
      "The attacking midfielder is yet to make an appearance for Brentford this season after previously impressing on loan with Swansea in the Championship last season.",
      "He was last included in the match-day squad for the Bees first team on August 26 against Bournemouth.",
      "Adam Webster",
      "A severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Webster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Lewis Dunk",
      "The Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.",
      "Solly March",
      "With game time limited for the 31-year-old in wide areas, it is unclear whether the club will trigger the option to extend his stay by another year.",
      "Danny Welbeck",
      "The forward is ageing like a fine wine in the Premier League and his form for the club warrants a new deal.",
      "The 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.",
      "Joel Veltman",
      "Veltman triggered an option to extend his stay at the club for an additional year last season but is now approaching the end of his contract.",
      "He missed five games with a calf injury but returned in the derby against Crystal Palace, outlining his role to play in Hurzeler's squad.",
      "James Milner",
      "The Premier League veteran will turn 40 when the window to negotiate with foreign clubs opens in January.",
      "Hurzeler said his experience was \"invaluable\" when he signed a one-year extension in June. The likelihood of a similar deal remains unclear.",
      "Martin Dubravka",
      "Dubravka signed a one-year deal with the Clarets upon their return to the Premier League and ranks amongst the best in shot-stopping in the division.",
      "His future at Turf Moor will likely be determined when - and if - Burnley manage to avoid the drop.",
      "Josh Laurent",
      "Laurent has been a useful member of the squad since joining from Stoke City in 2024. He signed a two-year deal when he first arrived at the club, with the option for a third.",
      "Vaclav Hladky",
      "The Czech Republic shot-stopper has only been included in two match-day squads this season - both in the Carabao Cup - and is yet to make an appearance in the 2025/26 campaign after featuring in pre-season.",
      "With 21-year-old Max Weiss currently ahead of him as Dubravka's understudy, an exit feels inevitable.",
      "Ashley Barnes",
      "Barnes signed a deal running until the end of the season after terminating his contract at Norwich City in January, returning to Turf Moor almost 11 years after he first joined the club.",
      "He then put pen to paper on a new one-year deal in the summer but has failed to make an impact in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are known for offering long-term deals to their players and have no one approaching the end of their respective deals ahead of next summer.",
      "Marc Guehi",
      "Arguably one of the most talked-about contract sagas ahead of next summer. Palace stopped Guehi from joining Liverpool on Deadline Day and with no fresh contract in sight, his exit from Selhurst Park feels like a matter of when, not if.",
      "Rumours linking him with a move to Anfield continue to swirl but clubs in Europe, who will be free to open negotiations for pre-contract agreements in the New Year, are also on alert.",
      "Daichi Kamada",
      "Informal conversations have taken place regarding a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.",
      "Naouirou Ahamada",
      "The 23-year-old has spent the vast majority of his time with the U21s side. Ahamada spent last season on loan at Rennes, making five appearances.",
      "Nathaniel Clyne",
      "In his second spell with the Eagles, Clyne signed a one-year contract extension with the club in the summer. However, his role has been reduced this season, making two appearances without a start.",
      "Clyne will be 35 when his current contract expires and an exit in search of more frequent game time in the latter stages of his career could be on the horizon.",
      "Jefferson Lerma",
      "Lerma is a useful and reliable option for Oliver Glasner to turn to, especially as he looks to balance fixture congestion in domestic cup competitions and Europe.",
      "The Eagles hold an option to extend his stay at Selhurst Park for an additional year.",
      "Vitaliy Mykolenko",
      "Mykolenko has confirmed his agent will soon enter talks with Everton regarding a new contract at the Toffees. The 26-year-old remains a key part of the squad with summer signing Adam Aznou yet to break into the first team.",
      "James Garner",
      "Garner is a regular for Everton under David Moyes. Jordan Pickford and James Tarkowski have both been rewarded with new deals in recent months and Garner will likely follow suit to reflect his new status within the team.",
      "Michael Keane",
      "Another mainstay in Moyes' squad. Keane reportedly had offers to leave the Toffees in the summer but chose to remain on Merseyside by signing a new deal and is now benefiting from that decision.",
      "Keane, 32, reportedly has an option to extend his stay for an additional 12 months.",
      "Idrissa Gueye",
      "Gueye signed a new deal in July, running until the end of the season, but the club hold an option for an additional year.",
      "The Senegal international, in his second stint with the Toffees after leaving in 2019 to join PSG for £26m, has been a regular for Moyes in the league so far this season.",
      "Triggering the extension seems like a suitable option for all parties.",
      "Seamus Coleman",
      "The 36-year-old club legend signed a new deal just before the new campaign began to commit to a 17th season with the Blues.",
      "He has been used sparingly but would likely jump at the chance to end his career at Everton with another deal, if he wishes to continue past the 2025/26 season.",
      "Harry Tyrer",
      "Tyrer impressed while on loan at Blackpool last season, making 38 appearances in League One and keeping 12 clean sheets.",
      "Despite showing promise, the 23-year-old is behind Mark Travers in the pecking order for Jordan Pickford's understudy and will likely need to pursue first-team opportunities elsewhere if he wants game time.",
      "Ryan Sessegnon",
      "The Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.",
      "His importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.",
      "Harry Wilson",
      "Fulham pulled the plug on Wilson's move to Elland Road, reiterating he was not for sale, and head coach Marco Silva has since confirmed that he is set for talks regarding an extension.",
      "Adama Traore",
      "Fulham triggered an option to extend Traore's contract until 2026 last season but the winger has found minutes hard to come by in the current campaign.",
      "Raul Jimenez",
      "Jimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.",
      "Tom Cairney",
      "Club captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.",
      "Illan Meslier",
      "The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.",
      "Meslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.",
      "An exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.",
      "Sam Byram",
      "Signed on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.",
      "Karl Darlow",
      "Darlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.",
      "Alex Cairns",
      "Academy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.",
      "Ibrahima Konate",
      "An exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.",
      "Andy Robertson",
      "The veteran defender has insisted he is relaxed about his future at Anfield with his contract coming to an end this season.",
      "Atletico Madrid were interested in signing the Scotland international in the summer ahead of Milos Kerkez's arrival but given the struggles of their new left-back, conversations may be revisited with the 31-year-old, after he confirmed discussions had taken place during the summer to extend his stay.",
      "Freddie Woodman",
      "Woodman joined on a free transfer in the summer following the expiration of his contract at Preston North End.",
      "In the absence of Alisson due to injury, Woodman has operated as Giorgi Mamardashvili's back-up and started in the 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup in October. The club hold an option to extend his contract for a further year.",
      "Rhys Williams",
      "Even with numbers at centre back low at Liverpool following Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury at the beginning of the campaign, Liverpool have not handed Williams an appearance in any of the three competitions they have competed in so far.",
      "Bernardo Silva",
      "Silva spoke openly about his future during the summer, outlining he is focused on the season but is aware he can leave the Etihad Stadium next summer.",
      "He continues to play a crucial role for Pep Guardiola's side and had options to leave but remained at the club.",
      "John Stones",
      "The future of John Stones is yet to be decided, with the England centre-back also approaching the end of his current deal.",
      "Stefan Ortega",
      "Ortega is now third-choice at the club following the arrivals of Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford. The German shot-stopper was linked as a potential target for Burnley in the summer.",
      "Marcus Bettinelli",
      "Signed in the summer before Trafford and Donnarumma arrived at the Etihad, Bettinelli is yet to make his debut for the club.",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "One of the more notable names approaching free agency. Maguire has enjoyed an upturn in his career at Old Trafford over the last two seasons.",
      "Maguire is not a regular starter under Ruben Amorim but adds crucial depth and experience. A one-year extension in his deal was triggered in January.",
      "Casemiro",
      "The club hold an option to extend Casemiro's stay by an additional year but there is a real possibility his contract is not renewed to free up space on the wage bill to strengthen the midfield area next season.",
      "Tom Heaton",
      "Third-choice goalkeeper behind Senne Lammens and Altay Bayindir at the club. Heaton has not featured for United since the 2022/23 season and will be 40 when his contract expires.",
      "Fabian Schar",
      "Schar extended his contract at the club in April and has admitted he would be open to discussing a new deal with the Magpies, while speaking to The Chronicle in October.",
      "Kieran Trippier",
      "Following an injury to Tino Livramento, Trippier has once again emerged as a key part of Eddie Howe's plans this season.",
      "Jamaal Lascelles",
      "The club captain saw his contract extended late into last season and his future will likely be addressed further down the line.",
      "Emil Krafth",
      "Krafth signed an extension in February to keep him at the club until the end of the 2025/26 season. The Sweden international right-back has been rotated into the squad for domestic cup competitions and his agent has downplayed suggestions he could leave in January.",
      "Max Thompson",
      "The 21-year-old goalkeeper is yet to make his senior debut for the club but did impress on loan at Chesterfield last season, keeping five clean sheets in 18 League Two outings.",
      "Mark Gillespie",
      "Local-born goalkeeper Gillespie has not featured for Newcastle since the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "Angus Gunn",

      "Portugal can qualify for 2026 World Cup if they beat Republic of Ireland on Thursday; captain Cristiano Ronaldo admits next summer's tournament will be his last major tournament before retiring - and he is set to stop completely within \"one [or] two years\"",
      "Tuesday 11 November 2025 18:11, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says next summer's World Cup will be his last major tournament before he retires.",
      "The 40-year-old forward - who has won five Ballon d'Or trophies - also says he will stop playing in the next one or two years.",
      "Ronaldo has admitted though that he wants to score 1,000 goals before he retires - he is currently on 953.",

      "Asked at the Tourise World Tourism Summit when he would retire, he said: \"When I mean soon, it's: I'm going back in the days and tell you - I'm really enjoying the moment right now.",
      "\"As you know in football when you reach some age you count the months very quick. So, the moment is good.",
      "\"As I tell you before I feel very good in this moment, I score goals I still feel quick and sharp, I'm enjoying my game in the national team and Al Nassr, but of course, let's be honest when I mean soon it's probably one, two years [where] I'll still be at the game.\"",
      "When asked if this will be his last major international tournament, Ronaldo replied: \"Definitely, yes.\"",
      "That then puts a major doubt on whether Ronaldo will still be playing by the 2028 European Championships which are set to be held in the UK and Ireland.",
      "Ronaldo says Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",

      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\""

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "The resolute nature of Sunderland's rearguard performance began to irritate the Gunners, and by the time they conceded they were just playing into the hands of the hosts. Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",
      "The fact they were able to do this against a side that could have gone nine points clear at the top of the Premier League had they won, speaks volumes about what the newly promoted side have been able to do. Both tonight and through the season to date.",
      "When people say there are no easy games in the Premier League, Sunderland are the evidence they will continue to point towards.Callum Bishop",
      "Booed off at half-time, given a standing ovation at the final whistle. There was a big mood-shift at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea eventually broken down and then tore apart Wolves.",
      "The Chelsea supporters had been celebrating before kick-off, too, watching Arsenal get pegged back by Sunderland on the TV screens inside the stadium. Those two results, leave Chelsea second in the Premier League title race and just six points off the Gunners.",
      "Are the world champions now Premier League contenders?",
      "That could be the day Chelsea establish serious momentum. Or the day their shortcomings are underlined.",
      "In moments, this is a team so slick and brimming with potential. In others, they look stuck and short of ideas. The return to fitness of Cole Palmer should at least help with their final-third quality but issues at No 9 persist, with Liam Delap and Marc Guiu off the pace right now.",
      "After this third international break of the season, the hard and decisive winter months begin. Chelsea are well placed - just as they were at this stage last season. Can they kick on and go for the crown?Peter Smith",
      "Former Wolves boss Gary O'Neil says the club needs a \"reset\". To stay in the Premier League they'll need a miracle.",
      "Every single top-flight side with two or fewer points at this stage have then been relegated - Man City in 1995-96 (2), Sunderland in 2016-17 (2), Sheffield United in 2020-21 (1) and 2023-24 (1), and Norwich in 2021-22 (2).",
      "The last time Wolves failed to win any of their opening 11 games, in 1983, they were relegated from the top flight. It is near impossible to see how that won't happen again.",
      "Rob Edwards needs to consider very carefully whether it is worth leaving his high-flying Middlesbrough for a side that they could pass on the way up.",
      "Wolves look doomed with their best players sold in the summer and striker Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for service and form. It won't just be a long winter, but a long season.David Richardson",
      "Even in 20 years time, Tomas Soucek will be scoring goals for West Ham in the Premier League. Probably.",
      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role. From his last 44 minutes on the pitch as a striker, the battering ram Czech has scored twice and played a huge role in another goal. You just can't keep him down.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton’s midfield set the tone from the first whistle, with Idrissa Gana Gueye driving the team forward and capping a dominant first half with the opener. His energy and control allowed the Toffees to dictate the tempo and keep Fulham penned in for long spells.",
      "Michael Keane’s late header sealed the points and reflected Everton’s growing confidence under David Moyes. The defender looked assured at the back and dangerous from set-pieces, delivering one of his most complete performances of the season.",
      "For Everton, this felt like a statement of control and composure, a reminder of their growing maturity under Moyes.",
      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",

      "Ruben Amorim was downbeat after Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Man Utd at Spurs and extended their unbeaten run in the league to five games, their longest under him, after throwing away another lead and seeing Benjamin Sesko forced off with a knee injury",
      "Saturday 8 November 2025 22:53, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his team \"have a lot of problems\" as he delivered a reality check after the 2-2 draw at Tottenham.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a point for United to extend their unbeaten league run to five games, their longest under the Portuguese, but Amorim was frustrated to see his side repeat the mistakes of last Saturday's draw at Nottingham Forest.",
      "United led for nearly an hour through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header, but late goals from Spurs substitute Mathys Tel and Richarlison, seven minutes apart, turned the game before De Ligt rescued a draw with his side a player down after Benjamin Sesko's injury.",
      "Amorim said United, who would have gone second had they held on to win, struggled to cope when he took Casemiro and Harry Maguire off with less than 20 minutes to go as he struck a downbeat tone ahead of the international break.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",
      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",
