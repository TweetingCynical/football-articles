      "Manchester United remain keen on signing Matthijs de Ligt from Bayern Munich this summer, despite paying £52million for Lille defender Leny Yoro less than a week ago",
      "Bayern Munich's honorary president, Uli Hoeness, has suggested that Matthijs de Ligt will leave Bayern Munich this summer as Manchester United continue their transfer pursuit.",
      "Despite stumping up £52million less than a week ago to sign wonderkid defender Leny Yoro from Lille, United still want to recruit Dutch centre-back De Ligt, who worked with Erik ten Hag at Ajax. Currently, though, the Red Devils are unwilling to pay the German giants' supposed £42m asking price after getting the green light from De Ligt and agreeing personal terms.",
      "Negotiations are therefore at an impasse but Hoeness has echoed his fellow Bayern chiefs by admitting that the 24-year-old could depart for Old Trafford before deadline day.",
      "\"It's possible that a defender will leave,\" the Bayern chief told Sky Germany. \"I would have no problem if [De Ligt] stays.\" Hoeness, however, then expressed his desire for De Ligt's team-mate, Dayot Upamecano, to stay. \"Personally, I would not sell Upamecano.\"",
      "Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund said similar to Hoeness at a recent press conference. \"We've got a very good squad,\" Freund began in response to a question about players such as De Ligt leaving. \"We can't rule anything out, including that players leave. There's no new update, although there’s a lot of speculation.\"",
      "Ten Hag has since confirmed United's plans to sign De Ligt, claiming that the idea didn't come from him, having worked together at Ajax. \"It remains to be seen whether De Ligt will come. I know Matthijs well and I will not deny that,\" the Red Devils boss admitted to Dutch outlet AD Sportwereld.",
      "\"I wanted to sign him two years ago but at that time he was already very far along to join Bayern Munich but believe it or not, his name did not come from me in the process [at United].\"",
      "Your turn! How much should Manchester United pay for Matthijs de Ligt? Give us valuation in the comments section",
      "De Ligt isn't the only centre-back on United's wish-list, as Everton starlet Jarrad Branthwaite remains a top target. Old Trafford chiefs have already had two bids rejected, with Everton holding out for around £80m and preparing a bumper new contract for the one-time England international.",
      "Two centre-backs have already left United this summer, with the experienced Raphael Varane leaving as a free agent and youngster Willy Kambwala joining Villarreal in a £9.6m deal. The Red Devils are also trying to sell Victor Lindelof after the Sweden captain, 30, entered the final year of his contract without the option of a further 12 months like Harry Maguire.",

      "Jurgen Klopp left Liverpool this summer after confirming he'd end his contract 12 months early, and one former Red believes one major factor in that decision has become apparent",
      "Former Liverpool star Don Hutchison has shed light on what he believes could be a major factor in why Jurgen Klopp left Anfield.",
      "Klopp departed Merseyside this summer after an illustrious nine-year stint that saw him hoover up silverware on Liverpool's behalf. That included ending a 30-year wait for the Premier League title, clinching the Champions League, winning both the FA Cup and League Cup (twice), as well as sealing the FIFA Club World Cup before leaving behind a squad equipped to sustain that success.",
      "Despite having one year left on his contract, Klopp cited exhaustion as his reason to bow out ahead of schedule. The 57-year-old is lauded for bringing Liverpool back to the pinnacle of European football, but Hutchison - who played for Liverpool between 1991 and 1994 - reckons the Germans' achievements are even more remarkable given the financial firepower of their rivals.",
      "The ESPN analyst delved into the spending spree conducted by the Premier League's aristocracy in years gone by. And that led to him developing a newfound respect for Klopp's decision to step down in the face of such relentless adversity.",
      "\"Don't underestimate the job that [Jurgen] Klopp done at Liverpool winning every single trophy,\" he wrote on X. \"While Man [United] and Chelsea are spending a BILLION and Man City and Arsenal (I think [Mikel] Arteta £500million) spending outrageous amounts. No wonder Klopp thought I can't keep doing this. It's nearly impossible.\"",
      "Hutchison offers a fresh perspective on precisely why Klopp decided to call it quits at Anfield after nearly a decade. The strategic genius was always open about his reasons for leaving since he first made the announcement in January, but this new theory suggests another dimension to what contributed to his fatigue.",
      "\"It is that I am, how can I say it, running out of energy,\" said Klopp at the beginning of 2024. \"I have no problem now, obviously, I knew it already for longer that I will have to announce it at one point, but I am absolutely fine now. I know that I cannot do the job again and again and again and again.\"",
      "While new boss Slot hasn't made any moves in the transfer market this summer, his competitors have been largely far from idle. Chelsea and United have been particularly proactive, shelling out close to £80m and £90m respectively, though the Blues have managed a net profit so far thanks to their selling.",
      "However, Chelsea's net spend over the last five years tells a different tale, with the club's transfer deficit around £750m since 2020. United are next on that unenviable list having spent approximately £500m more on transfers than they've earned in the same timeframe, while Arsenal's own figure over that span isn't far off.",
      "In comparison, Liverpool and Manchester City's net spend between 2020 and 2024 is closer to negative £250m, though tt only tells half the story for Pep Guardiola's side. That's because City's net transfer loss between 2016 and 2021 is around £650m, while the Reds overspent by only £100m during those first five years of Klopp's reign.",
      "His tenure didn't come without its own hefty purchases, with the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Darwin Nunez and Alisson each costing big sums. But his time at Liverpool was also dotted with bargain buys like Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson, Sadio Mane and Joel Matip, often maximising player potential once they became part of his setup.",
      "Liverpool even managed to make a profit in multiple seasons while Klopp was attempting to rein the Citizens in at the top of the Premier League. The fact he managed to do so while beefing up the Reds' trophy cabinet is a testament not only to Klopp, however, but the work of those pulling the strings behind the scenes at Anfield.",
      "The new Liverpool home shirt for the 2024/2025 season features a Chrome Yellow pattern design sees a modernised take on the legendary 84 Home Shirt, a season which saw the Reds become European Champions for the 4th time in Rome and the first English Club to win a Treble of major honours. You can pre-order it now for Thursday, May 16.",
      "The dust is still settling on Klopp's Anfield departure, Slot under great pressure to fill the giant shoes of his predecessor. However, it's still becoming apparent just how valiantly Klopp fought to establish Liverpool once again as a continental powerhouse, with the club likely to feel the residual effects of his work for years to come.",

      "Liverpool target Takefusa Kubo overlooked a jaw-dropping offer from Manchester United to sign a new contract with Real Sociedad.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with the Japanese star midway through last season as they hunted a potential replacement for Antony, who has underwhelmed ever since arriving at Old Trafford and could soon be offloaded. United were ready to offer Kubo a whopping seven-fold salary increase as per the Express.",
      "However, it was not enough to tempt the 23-year-old, who promptly signed a new contract with Sociedad, tying him to the La Liga club until 2029. However, more than six months later, the landscape has changed, with Liverpool said to be keen on signing the former Mallorca and Getafe loanee for around £55million, reports Japanese outlet Sponichi.",
      "Kubo has previously spoken of his respect for Liverpool. He told GOAL in 2019: \"The team I find interesting in terms of football right now is Liverpool. When I watch them, I feel like, ‘What an amazing team’. This is a little different from 'liking' them, it's more like, 'they're amazing'.\"",
      "Kubo has developed impressively since then. Last season, he had 12 goal involvements in 41 appearances for Sociedad as they finished sixth and qualified for the Europa League. None other than Zinedine Zidane is a fan of the player, having hailed his performances during his loan spell at Mallorca while he was on the books at Real Madrid.",
      "It has been suggested that Kubo has been earmarked as Mohamed Salah's long-term successor. The Egyptian has entered the final year of his contract, along with Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold but  Mirror Football  understands Liverpool have ruled out selling him this summer even if he does not sign a new deal.",

      "Earps' move to the French capital comes after the shot-stopper demanded assurances from United's hierarchy of their ambitions for the women's team. United claimed their first major trophy since their 2018 relaunch with their FA Cup triumph over Tottenham Hotspur in May, but Marc Skinner's side also suffered their worst-ever top-flight finish during a volatile season.",
      "United were thrust into an unsavoury light in recent months after reports emerged that their women's team were being moved out of their state-of-the-art training centre to accommodate the men's senior team, whose Carrington training facilities are underdoing a £50million revamp. New United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe also admitted that plans for the women's team were \"to be confirmed\" as the \"first team\" took priority.",

I cannot wait to play for a top team and to be in a position to compete and win trophies over the next few years. That’s where I really want to be. Fighting at the top, I am really looking forward to that.\"",

      "\"But it will be a challenge I reckon. I was out there the other week to sign for them and the city was crazy. The director of the club was pointing everything out to me like ‘this is the new stadium for the Olympics, and this one and this one’.”",

      "She is one of a number of high-profile exits from United this summer, including former captain Katie Zelem, forward Lucia Garcia and midfielder Irene Guerrero.",

      "Jude Bellingham shut down talks of a Manchester United move before his Real Madrid transfer by saying “No, don’t be silly” - which sparked a U-turn by Red Devils manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "It’s hard now to imagine Bellingham having joined any club but Real Madrid when he left Borussia Dortmund last summer. Dazzling in the ethereal white strip, we have grown accustomed to the 21-year-old, arms outstretched, embracing the Santiago Bernabeu faithful.",
      "Bellingham’s 23 goals in all competitions propelled Real Madrid to a league and European double while cementing his own place as one of the sport’s preeminent stars. But rewind a year and his future was still very much undecided, with several of Europe’s elite clubs circling Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion in the hope they could get their clutches on England’s latest superstar.",
      "One of the sides interested was Manchester United - Ten Hag was keen to bring in a new central midfielder in order to fill the Paul Pogba-shaped hole left the previous year. In a move not often seen by top-level managers, the Dutchman openly expressed his interest in the highly-rated Bellingham in April 2023.",
      "He was asked by a fan outside of United’s training ground to bring in Kylian Mbappe and Bellingham, to which he smiled and replied: “Why not?” before driving away.",
      "That was despite Bellingham openly rubbishing any links to United just a month earlier. A viral video on social media showed the Euro 2024 star being quizzed on whether he could become a Red Devil amid interest from Premier League rivals Liverpool and Los Blancos.",
      "Asked “Are you gonna come Man U?” while posing for photos, the then-teenager chuckled and said: “No. Don’t be silly.”",
      "As it became clearer in the following months that Bellingham’s preference was the Spanish capital, United cooled their interest, much to the frustration of Ten Hag. Of course, it wasn’t the first time England’s most successful club had been rejected by Bellingham already in his fledgling career.",
      "He was earmarked for big things as early as his Birmingham City days, where at the time United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer formulated an elaborate plan to bring the youngster to Old Trafford. That included a face-to-face chat with legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson and a tour of the training facilities by ex-football director John Murtough, though Bellingham snubbed their offer in favour of more immediate first-team opportunities at Dortmund.",
      "It is clear now that he made the correct decision on both occasions. Four years later, Bellingham is hoping to edge other world beaters like Rodri and Vinicius Junior to the Ballon d’Or prize while United suffered their worst Premier League finish to date last season down in eighth place.",

      "The former Reds boss admitted his appreciation of the England international in 2020 whilst he was still at Borussia Dortmund. In what was a highly productive four-year stint in Germany where Sancho scored 53 goals and contributed 68 assists for the Bundesliga giants, the Camberwell-born winger was attracting interest across Europe, specifically in the Premier League.",
      "While links to United were consistent, there were rumours that ex-Manchester City youth Sancho would end up on Merseyside. These links were only fuelled stronger by Klopp's comments on the player, despite admitting he was doubtful the expensive purchase of the attacker would be possible.",
      "\"I don't think such a transfer will be possible this season,\" the German admitted in 2020 to German newspaper Bild. He also added: \"The red shirt [of Liverpool] would suit [him] very well.",
      "\"He [Sancho] is a very interesting player. If he's coming to Liverpool I would be the most surprised of all of us.\"",
      "It was only a year after Klopp's comments that Sancho made the anticipated transfer to United. And despite the lofty expectations placed on him thanks to his exploits in Germany, the Englishman never found consistent form in his first two seasons where he ultimately lost his place in the starting line-up.",
      "His third season in Manchester ended before it even got started after engaging in a public fallout with Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag, who accused him of showing poor application in training. That then caused Sancho to hit back at his manager in a statement on social media.",
      "His decision not to apologise to the Dutchman at the time saw him frozen out of all first-team activities and subsequently loaned out to Dortmund in January for the rest of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "A return to form in Germany saw Dortmund reach the Champions League final, albeit losing 2-0 to Real Madrid, but Sancho impressed nonetheless ahead of a return to his parent club this summer. The hatchet between manager and player has since been buried after Ten Hag confirmed Sancho's importance to United's success this past week.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

This club needs good players, and one thing is for sure: Jadon is a terribly good player. I hope that the click still comes, and that he will contribute to our success.\"",
      "Despite the new lease of life the 24-year-old has in Manchester, he's reportedly close to agreeing terms with Paris Saint-Germain, according to Foot Mercato. The French champions are apparently locked in talks with Sancho, who has two years left on his United contract.",

      "\"[My wife] picked it up and told me it was the gaffer. So I pick up the phone and ask him how he is. [Ferguson said] 'Listen, I'm in Colorado Springs on holiday, and I've been thinking, I don't want you to go now.",
      "\"I know we've got Nicky Butt coming through, but you're only 28, you're in your peak, I don't want you to go now'. [I replied] 'Sorry, gaffer, I've got Inter Milan in my kitchen'.",
      "\"The last thing I could do, in that moment, was turn around and say I was staying at United. They were the ones who had accepted the offer in the first place. They were the ones who wanted to use the money for the training ground. I'd set my heart on going to Inter.\"",
      "Ince held firm and his switch to the San Siro was confirmed a few days later. He ended up spending just two years in Italy, but established himself, just as he'd done at United, as one of Inter's most pivotal players, particularly during Roy Hodgson's reign.",
      "In 1997 he returned to England after signing for United's great rivals Liverpool. Red Devils fans didn't particularly appreciate his decision, and nor (we assume) did Fergie, but to Ince's surprise, the pair mended their damaged relationship soon after and now consider each other good friends.",
      "\"We've always spoken,\" Ince said. \"I've been to [Ferguson's] house, played snooker... we get on really, really well. He's always great to be with; he's always shared his advice whenever I've been in management.\"",

      "The French midfielder could be on his way to Manchester United two years on from almost sealing a transfer to Old Trafford after his mum made some telling comments",
      "Manchester United have been given a boost in their pursuit of Adrien Rabiot with the French star's mum claiming the player's camp are \"on excellent terms\" with Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "Rabiot's mum, Veronique, acts as his agent and in the aftermath of several failed moves to United, she revealed relations were still strong with the Red Devils despite Rabiot deciding against Old Trafford in the past. It now looks like a move for Rabiot could be back on with the player reportedly holding talks with United this week after finally calling time on his five-year stay with Juventus.",
      "The Frenchman, 29, became a free agent at the start of the month after running down his contract. Rabiot looked to be on the brink of a move to United while he was still a Paris-Saint Germain player only for then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to can the deal. A transfer then broke down in 2022, when allegations of huge wage demands saw Erik ten Hag opt for Casemiro instead.",
      "However, there is no ill will from Rabiot's camp with Veronique saying: \"We are on excellent terms with Manchester United.\" Talking to La Gazzetta dello Sport, she said that United expressed a desire to sign Rabiot in the past, although she claimed money was never discussed after the player had a change of heart.",
      "\"United wanted to meet me to illustrate their interest in Adrien, but we never talked about money in detail because he quickly decided to stay in Turin,\" she said in November 2023. \"There were never any real negotiations.\"",
      "The fact Rabiot's camp is still on positive terms with United will give fans hope he could finally line up at Old Trafford next season, however, there could yet be some jeopardy when it comes to securing their long-term midfield target with bitter rivals Liverpool also reportedly looking to speak with the ex-Juventus star. In a worrying turn of events for United, it also appears Rabiot is willing to speak to the Merseysiders as Arne Slot looks to make his first signing, as per Football Italia.",
      "Other clubs expected to be in for the 29-year-old include Newcastle, while AC Milan and Napoli have been mooted as two clubs looking to try and keep the ex-PSG star in Italy. One potential factor in the player moving to the Premier League is reports that Rabiot is seeking a contract worth £7.5m a year - a figure that could see Serie A clubs discouraged from taking a punt on the French international.Juventus offered a base salary of £5.8m in their final contract offer but it seems the player is now looking elsewhere to continue his career. The French midfielder has won more than 20 trophies during his career including five Ligue 1 titles, the Serie A title and the Nations League while also helping his country reach the World Cup final in 2022.",
      "If the transfer comes off, Rabiot could be Manchester United's third major signing for the summer after they landed Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna and Lille prodigy Leny Yoro after they persuaded the young star to join them ahead of Real Madrid.",

      "Everton are preparing a new contract for Jarrad Branthwaite but still fear Manchester United could bid again for the defender.",
      "The Toffees have told United they won’t entertain offers below their £70m valuation of the England centre-back. They have already rebuffed two bids from the Old Trafford club with the second worth up to £50m.",
      "United have since gone out and splashed the cash on French teenager Leny Yoro while they are also trying to secure a deal for Dutchman Matthijs de Ligt from Bayern Munich. But the Toffees are not totally confident there won’t be another move for Branthwaite.",
      "There is still concern at the club that the withdrawal of the Friedkin Group from buying out Farhad Moshiri could lead to financial trouble.",
      "One of the stumbling blocks for the Friedkin Group was the £200m that Everton owe 777 Partners and ACap.  There are fears that Everton won’t be able to be sold until the Miami-based 777 group’s own legal trouble is sorted.",
      "A claim of fraud has been brought by the London-based asset management group Leadenhall Capital Partners LLP. The Friedkin Group repaid a £158m loan owed to MSP Sports Capital and local businessmen Andy Bell and George Downing. It has no plans to call in that loan any time soon but the club remains in limbo.",
      "Everton director of football Kevin Thelwell still wants to secure the long-term future of Branthwaite within their resources available as well as sorting out other incomings which are close, including the signing of Leeds winger Wilfried Gnonto.  Branthwaite, 22, is contracted at the club until 2027 which has given Everton a strong footing when it comes to United’s interest.",
      "They want to extend that and also increase his salary to show their admiration to the player for not asking to leave so far. But if United do return with a third bid then there could be issues on both fronts.",
      "Everton have just sanctioned the sale of Amadou Onana for £50m, which will ease any financial fears had by the Merseyside outfit. The midfielder joined Everton from Lille for £33m in 2022 and his departure represents a healthy profit for the club - who did find themselves on the wrong end of PSR last term.",

      "Leny Yoro needed just 10 minutes on the phone with Rio Ferdinand to know his future lay at Manchester United.",
      "Yoro signed a five-year contract with the Red Devils after they successfully hijacked Real Madrid’s move for the 18-year-old Lille defender, in a huge sign of intent from United's new hierarchy.",
      "The Frenchman appeared determined to join the Spanish giants, who are in the market for a defender. But Real were only willing to fork out between £21m and £25m for his signature, as Yoro was in his final year of his contract - a fee that the French club were not happy with.",
      "Comparatively, United committed to paying an initial fee of £52million, with a further £6.7m in add-ons. Even so, the Red Devils still needed to convince Yoro that making the move to Manchester was the best step for his career.",
      "And while new chief executive Omar Berrada played a crucial role in getting the deal across the line, working with his new colleagues, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox, as well as director of player negotiations Matt Hargreaves, it was former centre-back Ferdinand who had the ultimate influence.",
      "On the role Ferdinand played in leading him to Old Trafford, Yoro said: \"This is Rio Ferdinand, this is a legend in Man United, so for me this is an honour. This is a big defender, a legend, so yeah, big honour for me.",
      "\"It was like two weeks ago. He called me, so first of all I was really impressed to speak with him and yeah , we spoke like 10 minutes about Man United, so he helped me a lot to make my choice. So yeah, it was really an honour to speak with him.",
      "\"Yeah, he spoke to me about the club, and [that] this is a historic club with a big story, and if I go there I need to fight for the club, to be ready, because this is the biggest club in the world. So, yeah, for me it was really good to speak about this.\"",
      "He added: \"When I was younger, Rio was one of the best defenders in the world. I think everyone watched United when he was young and, for me, it was a dream to play for this club.\"",
      "It's not unchartered territory for Ferdinand. The United legend helped his former club land defender Raphael Varane back in the summer of 2021. Fittingly, it is Yoro who has essentially replaced Varane in the United squad, after the 31-year-old left upon the expiry of his contract.",

      "The 24-year-old, who joined from Ajax for a hefty £86million fee two years ago, has been a divisive figure among fans and even his team-mates, including captain Bruno Fernandes. Their on-pitch spats were particularly evident during the 2022/23 season.",
      "Fernandes could be seen demanding more from Antony in multiple games, with the pair repeatedly exchanging verbals. Despite these tensions, manager Erik ten Hag downplayed any serious conflict between the pair.",
      "He said at the time: \"They are both players who play with the heart and, when they bring that in the game, they are on their best so it's always a kind of balance. And always between players, sometimes emotions flare up.",
      "\"But I think, in the second moment, they are already good with each other so that is not a problem. I think definitely the players are not frustrated with him.\"",
      "However, Antony's lacklustre performances in his second season did little to win over critics, with instances like his kick at Jeremy Doku in the Manchester Derby highlighting his apparent discontent. Arsenal icon Ian Wright reckoned Fernandes was sending the wrong message as his skipper, though, by playing on his own.",
      "\"For Bruno sometimes, he just goes off and they're not ready. It's not good for the team,\" Wright blasted. \"Watching Antony come on and his contribution was to kick out at Doku like that, but the example of the captain is seeping in. That's the captain doing it.\"",
      "Despite the previous tension, Fernandes praised Antony after their 4-3 FA Cup victory over Liverpool in March. \"In the last 15 minutes, no one's probably going to talk about it, but Antony made a great effort playing as a left-back to help us,\" he told MUTV.",
      "However, if a club agrees to cover his £70k-a-week salary, the Brazilian might find himself playing elsewhere next season. United need to offload players if they're to continue recruiting.",
      "Antony could be one of those sacrificed, despite Ten Hag always backing him. Just this week he told AD: \"I am still convinced that Antony has the potential to play at this club. He certainly showed that potential in the first month: he scored three times in his first three games. After that, it became more difficult, last season was not good.\"",

The former Brighton director now oversees his first summer in a senior role at United, working with chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox who are also newly-appointed by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "The 53-year-old chief's arrival has coincided with deals being agreed for forward Joshua Zirkzee and teenage central defender Leny Yoro. This summer has the potential for a significant overhaul on and off the pitch as United look to bounce back from their worst ever Premier League finish.",

      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive Academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas. Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",

Overall, my first impression is the scale of opportunity available to us at Manchester United as we review and refresh all areas of the club.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has emerged as a top target for Paris Saint-Germain this summer, with Manchester United now bracing themselves to receive a bid for their captain",
      "Bruno Fernandes issued Manchester United and ultimatum over his future in May as PSG eye a move for the midfielder.",
      "Fernandes has starred for the Red Devils ever since his arrival in January 2021 and was named captain by Erik ten Hag at the start of last season. But it turned out to be a miserable campaign for Ten Hag's side.",
      "New controlling co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ordered an overhaul throughout the club, with Fernandes not one of the players who was marked out as being off-limits for interested suitors this summer.",
      "PSG appear increasingly likely to test out United's stance on keeping hold of their skipper. And just two months ago, Fernandes set out what the Red Devils need to do to ensure he remains at Old Trafford.",
      "\"The club needs to want me,\" Fernandes said in May. \"I feel the club wants me to be a part of the future. As I said always, I don't want to be a player that the club doesn't want to have. If for some reason they don't want to have me, I will go. But if they want me, I will stay.‌",
      "\"I am no different from anyone just because I have the armband. I always try my best and we always do the best we can for the club - nobody hides that we play for a big club and we have to lift our standards every game.\"",
      "Fernandes' comments will be ringing in United's ears as they brace themselves to receive a bid from PSG. According to L'Equipe, the French giants 'really appreciate' Fernandes' talents as they seek to replace Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The midfielder has previously been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia, though expected interest from Al-Nassr has not come to pass. Now, PSG boss Luis Enrique has given his backing to a sensational move.",
      "Talks are expected to intensify between the two clubs over the future of the Portuguese international. United boss Ten Hag has been adamant that he wants his captain to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "\"No, absolutely, the club wants to keep Bruno,\" Ten Hag said immediately after Fernandes' interview, which came following United's final home game of last season.",
      "‌\"I have to see the interview, maybe it's your interpretation, but from everything I know from him he loves Manchester United, the fans of United and to play for United. He always gives his best and is an example, even with injuries.",
      "\"He loves football and wants to win. That is how I would describe his character. I'm very pleased with his performances. It's not easy when so many players are injured around him and he has to carry the team.\"",

A number of young players have received increased opportunities early in pre-season, with 11 United stars enjoying extended breaks after featuring at Euro 2024 or the Copa America.",

      "Hugill and Ethan Wheatley have featured up front for the Red Devils so far, although Rasmus Hojlund is set to report for duty in time for the trip to America. However, both Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho are expected to miss the tour, offering Hugill more chances to impress.",
      "The 20-year-old spent time at League One side Burton Albion last season and registered four goal contributions in 18 games \"It was a great loan, getting to a men's first-team changing room,\" Hugill said of his experiences at Burton after scoring against Rangers.",
      "\"Having to fight for three points constantly in the league [was great] and playing Saturday then Tuesday was tough, but that's what you're there for at a young age.\"",

      "However, the report states that both Hugill and Vitek will have loan moves 'confirmed after the tour ends', with United returning to the UK on August 4. Vitek in particular is said to be attracting 'significant' interest.",
      "\"It is really good that the young lads are getting the opportunity as when you step on the field you have to show yourself,\" Vitek told club media after his start against Rosenborg. \"It is a big opportunity in front of a lot of people that are watching you.",

      "Toby Savin ended up joining Shrewsbury Town after twice missing out on a dream move to Manchester United.",
      "Savin was playing for Accrington Stanley when the opportunity to move to United first presented itself in January. The 23-year-old goalkeeper had been lined up to become a back-up to Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, with Tom Heaton nearing retirement and Nathan Bishop leaving for Sunderland.",
      "But Savin, who had been scouted by Newcastle and Tottenham as well, ended up failing a medical to scupper his chances of a move in the middle of the 2023/24 season. Another chance presented itself in the summer after he was released by Accrington, but The Sun reports he once again couldn’t get past the medical checks.",
      "Savin has struggled with a shoulder injury of late and featured just nine times in League Two last season. The injury robbed him of a move to United, but Shrewsbury were not put off, signing him on a two-year deal this summer.",
      "“Toby attracted interest from clubs higher up the leagues,” Shrewsbury manager Paul Hurst said. “He is a player with plenty of potential and has all the attributes to be a really good goalkeeper. Our job is to make sure he fulfils that and becomes the best version of himself.”",
      "Savin has not been able to join his new team-mates in pre-season yet, with the injury still keeping him off the pitch. He missed Shrewsbury’s first two friendlies against Birmingham and Brackley Town.",
      "“Toby, nothing is amiss there, everything is how we expected,” Hurst said. “Toby is gradually getting fitter. We will see how he goes next week. He won’t be involved on Tuesday night, but as I said that was our understanding anyway.”",

      "Clubs in the Gulf State have spent huge sums to draw some of Europe’s standout stars to the Saudi Pro League. Millions and millions have been committed to growing the league.",
      "And that shows no signs of slowing down this summer. Aston Villa star Moussa Diaby has become the latest to put pen to paper on an eye-watering contract just a year after arriving in the Premier League.",
      "He could be followed by a host of colleagues. A number of stars from Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool have all been linked with their own big-money switches. Take a look at the latest here:",
      "The Brazilian’s move to Arsenal hasn’t quite worked out as intended due to a combination of injury and inconsistency. That could see the Gunners cash in on him.",
      "Jesus has been identified by Al-Ahli as a top target for the summer. Should he agree to a move, he would be reunited with former City team-mate Riyad Mahrez in Jeddah.",
      "The striker has three years left on his contract at the Emirates Stadium but could fall down the pecking order this summer should Arsenal move for a new striker as expected.",
      "Jesus is not the only Brazilian striker that Al-Ahli are interested in. They are also plotting a move for Tottenham star Richarlison.",
      "The former Everton and Watford star has struggled for form since his big-money move to North London. He has scored just 15 goals over the past two seasons.",
      "Richarlison has also been linked with Al-Hilal this summer but was forced to release a statement disputing that a move was imminent. Taking to Instagram, he said: “I left my vacation and came to work to come back better ahead of next season. Regarding what's been said in the media in the last few days, it's fake news. I will NOT leave England ahead of next season.”",
      "The latest to be linked with a move, De Bruyne’s future is certainly up in the air. The Belgian playmaker has just a year remaining on his contract and previously admitted he would be open to a Saudi move.",
      "And it appears that it has moved a step closer over recent days. Reports in Italy suggest that De Bruyne has agreed personal terms with Al-Ittihad.",
      "They now need to enter talks with Manchester City to agree a deal for his services. De Bruyne would join Karim Benzema, Houssem Aouar, Fabinho and N’Golo Kante should he complete a move to Al-Ittihad.",
      "De Bruyne is not the only Man City star who could be tempted to Saudi Arabia. Al-Ittihad have also targeted his teammate Ederson.",
      "The Brazilian is reportedly keen on a move but a deal seems some way off. A £25m offer was lodged to Man City but was instantly rebuffed by the Premier League champions.",
      "While Ederson is staying put for the time being, it appears that Pep Guardiola is planning for his exit. City have been linked with a move for PSG ’s Gianluigi Donnarumma as a possible replacement.",
      "From one Brazilian goalkeeper to another, Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker has regularly been linked with a big-money move to Saudi Arabia. Reports suggested that he was set to hold talks with Al-Nassr.",
      "They already boast former Liverpool forward Sadio Mane, who will likely be thrilled to be reunited with his former team-mate. Alisson, 31, has three years remaining on his contract.",
      "Any exit would leave new Reds boss Arne Slot with a huge decision to make between the sticks. Liverpool currently have Caoimhin Kelleher in reserve but he too has been linked with a move away.",
      "One of the most high-profile names linked with Saudi, reports suggesting Salah could move on refuse to go away. Liverpool have already been forced to intervene in the past to keep him.",
      "Al-Ittihad lodged a huge £150m bid for the Egyptian last summer and the Reds insisted that he was to stay. Salah has now entered the final year of his Anfield contract and his future remains up in the air.",
      "Saudi sides remain interested, while Salah has returned to Liverpool for pre-season training. There could well be further updates over the coming weeks.",
      "Despite an impressive first season at Old Trafford, Casemiro could not keep that up last term and could be cut adrift sooner rather than later. A host of Saudi clubs are interested in a deal for the former Real Madrid stars.",
      "Al-Nassr and Al-Ittihad are two of the clubs linked with him most recently. Al-Qadsiah, Al Ahli and Al Hilal could all potentially make a move.",
      "Man United have set a £30m price tag for the 32-year-old. Casemiro has just two years remaining on his deal with the Red Devils, while the club are keen to add to their midfield options which could see him fall down the pecking order even more.",
      "Still the most expensive goalkeeper in history, Kepa looks unlikely to have a future with Chelsea. He was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in a loan move to Real Madrid last term.",
      "Robert Sanchez is currently the Blues number one, while reports have suggested that they could move for another goalkeeper. Kepa has already courted interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Ittihad were linked but have since cooled their interest. That could be renewed should Kepa be made available by Chelsea towards the end of the transfer window.",
      "After being charged for alleged breaches of the FA’s betting rules, Brazilian midfielder Paqueta has been linked with a move away from West Ham. Flamengo have attempted to sign him but that deal looks tricky to do.",
      "Al-Nassr have been linked with him. Paqueta, 26, has made 84 appearances for West Ham since his arrival from Lyon two years ago.",
      "He helped the London club with the Europa Conference League under David Moyes - the Hammers’ first-ever European crown.",
      "Newcastle could be willing to cash-in on striker Callum Wilson this summer after a tricky campaign last term. The ex-Bournemouth star netted ten goals in all competitions last term after struggling with injury.",
      "He has just a year remaining on his contract and could be a player that Newcastle sell in a further effort to balance the books. Al-Fateh and Al-Ahli are among the Saudi clubs linked, while talks have been held.",
      "His team-mate Miguel Almiron has also been linked but has rebuffed a move in the past. It would not be a surprise to see that happen again.",

      "After helping Argentina win the Copa America earlier this month, Manchester United starlet Alejandro Garnacho has faced some stiff allegations about his relationship with Lionel Messi",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has hit back at accusations he ignored Lionel Messi during the Copa America final.",
      "Argentina clinched their third major trophy in four years after beating Colombia in the showpiece at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida, USA earlier this month. It initially looked as if the night would end in misery for Messi, who was hauled off with an ankle injury on 66 minutes.",
      "Seconds later, the Inter Miami superstar, 37, burst into tears on the bench, stricken by the pain both gushing through ankle and of bowing out of what's likely to be his last ever international final. But sadness turned to elation when Lautaro Martinez netted the winner with eight minutes left of extra time to seal Argentina's second successive Copa America title.",
      "After the game, videos emerged on social media appearing to show Garnacho, who spent all but 26 minutes of the tournament warming La Albiceleste's bench, continually snubbing Messi throughout the evening. The Manchester United star was closest to the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner when the tears started flowing, but failed to offer his team-mate any comfort.",
      "Several other clips showed the 20-year-old walking past Messi during the post-match celebrations, seemingly refusing to embrace the legendary forward. Accusations then began flying that Garnacho, who has declared an admiration for Messi's eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo more than once, was purposefully avoiding the ex-Barcelona man, but the player himself has now rubbished those claims.",
      "On Saturday, he responded to a post on X containing a video compilation of him 'ignoring' Messi during and after the final by uploading a photo of his own - one with his arm around Messi after the full-time whistle. He then captioned the post using the 'shrug' and 'facepalm' emojis.",
      "Garnacho is one of a select group of players to have played with both Messi and Ronaldo, having lined up alongside the latter during the Al-Nassr ace's brief return to Old Trafford. He's made no secret of his love for Ronaldo, having copied the Portugal international's goal celebration on a couple of occasions, but any suggestion this has caused a rift between him and Messi is evidently baseless.",
      "The youngster, who has six Argentina caps under his belt, broke into United's first team halfway through the 2022/23 season. He's since racked up 86 appearances for the Red Devils, scoring 15 goals.",
      "With the likes of Messi, Martinez, Julian Alvarez and Angel Di Maria ahead of him in the pecking order, breaking into Argentina's first team is proving a little harder, but plenty feel it's only a matter of time until he does, including Di Maria.",
      "\"[Garnacho] is a very fast player, he has incredible ability,\" the ex-Real Madrid man said earlier this year. \"He is going to gain it with experience and coming to the national team, it is a place where you learn a lot and continue to improve. It helped me a lot to grow technically in every way, it is spectacular.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "\"I think he will grow with experience as well. When I was young I wanted to make the play 30 times in the game. Over the years you realise that if you do it 10, but you do it better, it’s worth it. He has a lot of future, a very big future. It depends on him, on his head, to be able to handle it. I don’t have much to say, there’s a reason he’s playing for Manchester United.\"",

      "Mason Greenwood has joined Marseille on a five-year contract after Manchester United decided he couldn't continue with the club, but they have left the door open for a possible return",
      "Mason Greenwood’s Manchester United career might not be over after the club inserted a buyback clause into the deal which sent him to Marseille.",
      "Greenwood joined Marseille on a five-year contract on Thursday after the French side agreed to pay United £26.6million for his services. The 22-year-old striker has left his boyhood club permanently after spending last season on loan with Getafe.",
      "He left for Spain last summer after United conducted an internal investigation, which concluded Greenwood would play no further role for the club. Greenwood was charged with attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in October 2022.",
      "Those charges were dropped in February 2023 by the Crown Prosecution Service, who said “a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction”, but led to his departure from United by mutual agreement. United included a sizable sell-on clause in the transfer agreement with Marseille, but they have also left the door open for a potential return in the future.",
      "The Telegraph reports that such a clause being inserted is commonplace when selling academy graduates and it is very unlikely United will exercise it in the future. Yet they were not compelled to do so and its existence suggests United might go back on their original decision to expel Greenwood.",
      "In a statement last August, United said: United said: \"All those involved, including Mason, recognise the difficulties with him recommencing his career at Manchester United. It has therefore been mutually agreed that it would be most appropriate for him to do so away from Old Trafford, and we will now work with Mason to achieve that outcome.",
      "\"Based on the evidence available to us, we have concluded that the material posted online did not provide a full picture and that Mason did not commit the offences in respect of which he was originally charged. That said, as Mason publicly acknowledges today, he has made mistakes which he is taking responsibility for.\"",
      "At his first press conference as a Marseille player Greenwood stressed that he won’t speak about the past following a backlash from some fans and the city’s mayor. \"I understand the questions, I don't want to talk about it too much or get into debates and controversies,” he said.",
      "“I already spoke about it on Thursday with the supporters and I spoke about it last season. I want to move forward, I want to be part of Olympique de Marseille. My intention is really to concentrate on the football part. The staff and players told me about the foundation, associations and hospital visits and like the other players I will participate in these initiatives.",
      "\"This season I will try to play well for Marseille, at the Velodrome in front of fantastic fans. I have been waiting for this for a while and I can't wait to play in front of this crowd. For the moment I am focused on what I have to do with my club.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho became a key player for Erik ten Hag last season, but the Manchester United boss has been urged to manage the winger carefully by rival player Alexis Mac Allister",
      "Liverpool star Alexis Mac Allister has warned Erik ten Hag not to put too much pressure on Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Both Mac Allister and Garnacho were part of the squad that helped Argentina to win the Copa America this summer. But while the Liverpool man started all but one game, Garnacho only featured in the final group match.",
      "The Manchester United star entered the tournament off the back of a breakthrough season for his club. He scored 10 goals and notched five assists in all competitions for the Red Devils, making 50 appearances in total.",
      "The Argentine is set to play a key role again this campaign, with the right-wing spot now his to lose in Ten Hag's line-up. But international team-mate Mac Allister believes United need to be careful.",
      "The Liverpool midfielder has hailed both Garnacho and fellow Argentine youngster Valentin Carboni. Though he also insisted both club and country need to guard against placing too much expectation on them.",
      "\"He hasn't played much, but in training he has shown what he's worth, I think he has earned the respect of the team,\" Mac Allister told YouTube channel 'AFA Estudio' the week after Argentina's Copa win.",
      "\"He and Garnacho are two players who can give a lot to Argentina. They excite us a lot. We have a lot of hope for their future. We can't burden them with too many expectations at the moment, but in the future they will give us a lot.\"",
      "Garnacho caught the eye for United last season, memorably scoring an overhead kick away at Everton. In the reverse fixture he won both of his side's penalties in a 2-0 win, drawing praise from boss Ten Hag.",
      "“He is progressing very well. We’re very pleased with this. His contribution today was huge with his runs and dribbles. He’s effective for the audience as well. We want to show something - dribbles - well-deserved penalties,\" the Dutchman said.",
      "\"He is a player that needs a challenge and likes one. Our job is to push him to high levels. He has high potential and we have to get the potential out and therefore you have to work day by day.",
      "\"It is only about him, if he can keep the focus and if he puts the right effort in, he keeps the focus, sometimes for young players it is difficult. We have their job to do.\"",
      "It was not all smooth sailing though, with Garnacho forced to apologise to Ten Hag for 'liking' tweets criticising his management following a trip to Bournemouth, in which the winger was substituted.",

      "Jadon Sancho had been expected to quickly depart Manchester United this summer but has already been involved in pre-season under Erik ten Hag and now appears to be garnering interest",
      "It was just a matter of days ago that Erik ten Hag suggested that Manchester United need players at Jadon Sancho's level, and now his words will be put to the test.",
      "A public falling out last season saw Sancho banished from United's squad before moving on loan to Borussia Dortmund in January. A swift exit was expected this summer but showdown talks between the parties have seen Sancho return to training with the Red Devils.",
      "The 24-year-old winger even started United's friendly win over Rangers at Murrayfield. It appeared to reflect Ten Hag's assertion that peace talks had gone well.",
      "“We spoke well. Anyone can make a mistake. If the player reflects well on that, then you draw a line and move on again,\" Ten Hag said in an interview.",
      "“This club needs good players, and one thing is for sure: Jadon is a terribly good player. I hope that the click still comes, and that he will contribute to our success.’’",
      "Reports in France suggest that Paris Saint-Germain are willing to test the resolve of club and player. The Ligue 1 champions are aiming to strengthen their ranks following the departure of Kylian Mbappe.",
      "Earlier this summer it was suggested that Sancho had a £40million price-tag, well short of the £73m they paid in 2021. They may quickly need to decide whether that fee is worth more to them than the ex-Man City academy star's services.",
      "PSG are said to be nearing an agreement for personal terms with Sancho. Sporting director Luis Campos was impressed with the England international's outings for Dortmund as the German side reached the Champions League final.",
      "Sancho's future will unlikely be decided by Ten Hag alone however. New United sporting director Dan Ashworth will play a role and United's Dutch boss has made clear that he has never taken transfer decisions alone at the club.",
      "\"I have never made decisions about new players on my own, far from it,\" said Ten Hag. \"I never negotiate.",
      "\"So when people argue that I spent so much money at United: no, the club has done. They keep me broadly informed about the numbers. I only know what the player will earn, because I deal with the hierarchy in the locker room. As for transfer and agent fees, I’m not involved in any of that.”",

      "Erik ten Hag desperately wanted Frenkie de Jong in his first summer at Manchester United but the player's wage deferral with Barcelona proved to be a stumbling block in talks.",
      "United were eventually forced to abandon their pursuit of De Jong and alarm bells rang after defeats against Brighton and Brentford in the first two Premier League games.",
      "It seemed like nothing had changed after a trainwreck 2021/22 campaign, so United reacted by splashing £70million on Casemiro, who signed from Real Madrid on a four-year contract, but the length of the deal was questioned and another Bastian Schweinsteiger situation was feared.",
      "Thankfully, it didn't take long for Casemiro to silence the doubters and he was brilliant in his first season, helping United win the Carabao Cup and qualify for the Champions League.",
      "That's why his rapid decline last season was so surprising. He went from being a yard ahead of play to being behind it, his passing became sloppy in some matches and reckless and mistimed tackles crept into his game, which was another sign of his qualities diminishing.",
      "Casemiro was brilliant in his first year in Manchester and poor in his second. He is now 32 and it was always possible he would succumb to decline at Old Trafford.",
      "The decision to sign Casemiro for £70m was a high-risk, high-reward move. United gambled he could sustain his performance levels and he demonstrated his quality in Ten Hag's first season in charge, but they made a bet he wouldn't decline so quickly into his time at the club.",
      "Whether the gamble on Casemiro has paid off is up for debate. Without him, United wouldn't have enjoyed the success they achieved in 2022/23, although he's one of the highest earners in the squad and his performances last season far from merited that financial status.",
      "It would be foolish to completely write Casemiro off given his magnificent career and what he's achieved. He could prove fears he's over the hill wrong this season and bounce back to his previous levels, but the early signs haven't been great and United are looking at new midfielders in his position, which is an admission from the club that his performances were below the standard required.",
      "Unfortunately, it seems more likely that Casemiro's best days are behind him and he will be reluctantly added to the club's catalogue of mistakes if that proves to be true.",
      "Former football director John Murtough, who was hired by the Glazers and gradually promoted, was responsible for laying the groundwork to sign Casemiro in 2022 and signing an ageing player for an inflated fee and giving him huge wages was a Glazer speciality over the years.",
      "The Glazers always spent money, but how they spent it was the problem and their scattergun recruitment strategy is the reason for United's regression in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro might be remembered as the American family's last bad decision in the transfer market. Some may argue that Antony is a bigger mistake since he was signed a few weeks after Casemiro, however, he's younger and retains slightly more value, despite struggling himself.",
      "Spending £70m on a player and receiving just one excellent season in return isn't good business and United will be gambling again if they don't sign a quality No.6 this summer.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's new football structure understands the importance of signing a defensive midfielder and United are interested in Martin Zubimendi and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "United might have to get creative in the transfer market and attempt to negotiate a deal similar to their agreement for Sofyan Amrabat, who was signed on loan with a clause included for a potential permanent transfer, so they can afford a deal for a new midfielder.",

      "United will renew their rivalry with their neighbours in the Community Shield on August 10 after beating them in May's FA Cup final. Sometimes described as a glorified friendly, it will mark their final outing ahead of the Premier League opener against Fulham six days later.",
      "The Reds will step up their preparations for the forthcoming campaign this week, flying to the United States for their pre-season tour. They will face Arsenal this weekend before taking on Real Betis and Liverpool.",
      "United are yet to confirm their travelling squad for the tour, but it is highly likely Leny Yoro will be the only new signing Erik ten Hag will take with him. Fellow new recruit Joshua Zirkzee is entitled to three weeks off after representing the Netherlands at Euro 2024.",
      "United, of course, could add to their squad while in the US, just as they did last year when they swooped for Andre Onana. He was a late addition to the squad after signing two days before their opening game of the tour.",
      "Having signed a striker and a centre-back so far this summer, United's attention has now switched to bolstering their midfield. They want to bring in a new defensive operator that can sit at the base of the engine room, following Casemiro's sharp decline last season.",
      "United have expressed interest in Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi and are continuing to be heavily linked with Manuel Ugarte of Paris Saint-Germain. Elsewhere, AS Monaco's Youssouf Fofana has once again been mentioned as an option.",
      "With United still in need of fresh legs, both in midfield and elsewhere, MEN Sport has had a look at what United's ideal 20-man matchday squad could look like once the competitive action gets underway next month, provided they make further progress in the transfer market.",
      "Starting with the starting XI, Onana will continue as the club's first-choice goalkeeper. Ahead of him, Diogo Dalot is primed to remain at right-back and be joined in the back-four by Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw and Yoro.",
      "United consider Yoro to be a signing for the present and the future, meaning Ten Hag will be keen for him to develop an on-field partnership with Martinez. That combination currently represents United's strongest centre-back pairing on paper.",
      "Moving into midfield, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes are guaranteed starters, leaving just one position up for grabs. That, of course, is the defensive midfield berth.",
      "Ugarte is attracting plenty of attention and the prospect of him arriving at Old Trafford on loan has not been dismissed. United need to raise funds through player sales before committing to more big-money deals.",
      "As for the attack, competition for places in the wide areas is high. Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford occupied the two wide spots for the FA Cup final and it would not be a surprise to see them start 2024/25 in the same roles.",
      "Amad, however, will have ambitions of making the right-wing berth his own after ending last season strongly and impressing against Rangers at Murrayfield Stadium on Saturday. Garnacho is yet to report back for pre-season training after representing Argentina at the Copa America, meaning Amad has a golden opportunity to audition for a starting berth on the tour.",
      "In the centre of attack, Rasmus Hojlund is expected to remain Ten Hag's first-choice striker. He notched 16 goals in his debut season at Old Trafford and will have aspirations of building on that tally, meaning Zirkzee may have to settle for a place on the bench.",
      "As for the bench, Ten Hag will be allowed to name nine substitutes, meaning he will have plenty of scope to cram as much talent into each of his matchday squads as possible. Altay Bayindir should claim one of those places, providing cover for Onana as second-choice goalkeeper.",
      "United will be forced into recruiting a new right-back if Aaron Wan-Bissaka is sold and AS Monaco's Vanderson has reportedly been identified as a successor. The Reds remain keen on signing another centre-back and Matthijs de Ligt is still an active target with a £42m bid claimed to be enough to seal his signature.",
      "If Casemiro is sold, United, in addition to signing Ugarte, would still require another defensive midfield signing to give them two options for that role. The prospect of bringing Sofyan Amrabat has not yet been dismissed and he would be a good squad player.",
      "Mason Mount and Scott McTominay, should the latter be retained, would both be hoping to be regular fixtures in the matchday squad at the very least. Antony, Amad and Zirkzee would provide the attacking threat from the bench.",
      "Starting XI: Onana; Dalot, Yoro, Martinez, Shaw; Ugarte, Mainoo, Fernandes; Garnacho, Hojlund, Rashford.",
      "Substitutes: Bayindir, Vanderson, De Ligt, Amrabat, Mount, McTominay, Antony, Amad, Zirkzee.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Manchester United youngster Ethan Ennis has signed a new contract with the club.",
      "Ennis' previous deal with United expired in June 2025 and the Manchester Evening News understands he has signed fresh terms to extend his stay beyond next summer.",
      "The 19-year-old played the second half of the opening pre-season friendly against Rosenborg, testing their goalkeeper with a powerful shot, and was introduced at half-time again last weekend against Rangers. Ennis is also set to be included in the United squad for the USA tour.",
      "Ennis began his career with Liverpool, but he was signed by United in the summer of 2021 and was the standout signing for the academy in an otherwise quiet window.",
      "The youngster signed his first professional contract immediately after celebrating his 17th birthday and only the most highly regarded academy talents are given pro deals so quickly.",
      "However, disaster struck in August 2022 when it was confirmed he'd ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee. Ennis faced a long road to recovery after that injury and made his first appearance after a 14-month lay-off for the Under-21s against Fulham at the end of October.",
      "There were high hopes for Ennis when United signed him from rivals Liverpool and his minutes were carefully handled last season, which helped him return to full fitness.",
      "Ennis' physicality was noticeable in friendlies against Rosenborg and Rangers last week and his professionalism at Carrington is thought to have impressed academy staff.",
      "The Chesire-born lad scored 10 goals in 19 appearances for United's Under-18s in 2021/22, his first full season at the club, and his finishing ability is one of his finest qualities.",
      "Erik ten Hag named only a handful of academy youngsters on last summer's pre-season tour but more will be included this month due to international tournaments.",
      "United were represented by first-team players at the European Championship and Copa America and they have been given extra time off to enjoy a break.",

The former started on the right of United's front three and was their best player by some distance, laying down the gauntlet to United's other wingers to perform in the quest to bag a starting berth come the start of the season.",

      "Man United were likely sailing close to the wind with regards to PSR at the end of the last financial year",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Now into a new financial year, Manchester United have started their first summer under the operational control of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos by delving into the transfer market.",
      "In has come Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna for an initial £33.6m, potentially rising a further £3m, while Leny Yoro’s capture from Lille set the Reds back a cool £52.2m, with a further £6.7m in potential add-ons to come.",
      "Keen to make a return to Champions League football for 2025/26, United don’t appear to be finished yet, with a potential £42m move for Matthijs de Ligt mooted, while Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte is another on the wanted list, with his reported asking price sitting at around £59m.",
      "All this transfer business would mark a heavy outlay for a club that, while the lack of scrambling to sell players on the last day of the financial year should have been a clue as to their confidence over being compliant with the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, were sailing close to the wind.",
      "ALSO READ:'A legend' - Leny Yoro reveals surprise phone call that helped convince him to join Man United",
      "As a publicly traded company, United are required to update shareholders and the New York Stock Exchange as to the financial condition of the club every three months, with the most recent set of results showing a pre-tax loss of £89.2m for the third quarter of the financial year, ending March 31. The results were released to shareholders earlier this month.",
      "The club still has another three months to take into account for the 2023/24 financial year, up to the end of June. Heavy losses in the early part of the year were attributed by the club largely to costs associated with the share purchase by Ratcliffe and Ineos as well as nine fewer home games during the same time last year.",
      "The published financials have placed scrutiny on the club’s profit and sustainability rule (PSR) position, with the club sailing close to the wind as to what is permissible.",
      "For United, it appears as if they may have just managed to ensure compliance, although that will require one significant cost to be an allowed deduction.",
      "The 27.7% stake in the club acquired by Ratcliffe back in January carried with it a £34.4m cost related to the strategic review and share sale agreement, paid to the Raine Group merchant bank. It also included a sum of £5.5m in compensation for loss of office following the departure of Richard Arnold. If the total £39.9m was an allowable deduction, which United chiefs will certainly argue as an exceptional cost, then the club are likely just about over the line in terms of PSR compliance looking at the estimates for the financial year end.",
      "However, the £5.5m may be hard to get passed as an allowable deduction as loss of office isn’t usually permissible, as is the case when managers and backroom staff depart.",
      "Now into a new financial year, and with some assets to sell, United’s confidence in the market has returned somewhat, albeit requiring some smarter working.",
      "When a player is signed, the guaranteed transfer fee is divided over the length of the player’s contract (a maximum of five years) through a process called amortisation. This is done for accounting purposes, regardless of whether the sum has been paid in full or not.",
      "For the 2022/23 financial year, Manchester United had player amortisation costs of £170.2m, second only to free-spending Chelsea.",
      "In signing the likes of Yoro and Zirkzee, and adding in the potential for signing Ugarte and De Ligt for the fees mentioned previously, that would see United add around £37.3m to the club’s annual amortisation costs. That is a significant sum, and for a club that has to be mindful of its position, even with the Premier League moving away from PSR and toward a financial control system akin to UEFA’s squad cost ratio from 2025, it will need to be offset by sales, as well as the need to lighten the payroll, which was, at £331m, the fourth-highest in the Premier League for 2022/23.",
      "The sales of the likes of Mason Greenwood, Donny van de Beek, Willy Kambwala, and Alvaro Fernandez should be instructive as to United’s approach to the summer window, which will require money to be recouped before adding yet more transfer debt.",
      "With the sales of Greenwood (£27m to Olympique Marseille), Kambwala and Fernandez being sales of United graduates, they allow for the club to book pure profit to the tune of some £38.4m. As for Van de Beek, the Dutchman had one year left on his United deal, and a remaining book value of £7m, although loan fees recouped from his time elsewhere mean that has largely been accounted for. United have received a fee of £450,000, but it is a deal that has add-ons that could rise to as high as £5m, plus it removes some wage pressures on the payroll.",
      "Given that the transfer fees received can be booked as profit immediately, and not amortised in the same way as sales, United will have brought in the first year’s worth of amortisation costs for Zirkzee, Yoro, De Ligt and Ugarte, if they did move for the latter two, but would still be faced with the requirement to either sell further academy players, with the likes of Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay both pure profit, and big profit possibilities.",
      "Moving on players such as Casemiro would also be impactful. He has a remaining book value of £35m, meaning the club would need to recoup that or larger to see a profit. A sale at around that price would reduce amortisation costs by £17.5m per year and also take away a significant earner from the payroll.",
      "With Ratcliffe keen to see both things occur in the longer term, it is likely that there will be significant departures in order to facilitate greater spending. The Zirkzee and Yoro deals have been done with the current picture in mind, while if the club wanted to go all in on big deals for De Ligt and Ugarte they would likely want to reduce the risk and move on additional assets first so as to create headroom.",
      "United have a full financial year in which to make the maths work, but it will come down to moving on players for the right price that will facilitate the rebuild that Ratcliffe and Ineos have planned.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Uli Hoeness has suggested that Matthijs De Ligt could leave Bayern Munich this summer amid transfer links with Manchester United.",
      "De Ligt is one of serval defenders being linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer. United are open to signing three new centre-backs after the departures of Raphael Varane and Willy Kambwala.",
      "Leny Yoro has already joined from Lille in a £52million deal whilst the club have seen two bids rejected for Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite. De Ligt is another defender United are looking to sign after agreeing personal terms with the Dutchman, although their latest offer to Bayern has been rejected.",
      "But Bayern's honorary president Hoeness has offered encouragement to United's hopes of securing a deal for De Ligt. The Bavarians have multiple alternative options in the centre of defence, including French international Dayot Upamecano and former Tottenham star Eric Dier, amongst others.",
      "“It’s possible that a defender will leave,” Hoeness told Sky Sports Germany. “I would have no problem if he stays. Personally, I would not sell [Dayot] Upamecano.”",
      "Erik ten Hag has recently admitted that he is unsure whether the 24-year-old will end up at United, despite his former links with the defender. “It remains to be seen whether De Ligt will come. I know Matthijs well and I will not deny that,\" he told Dutch outlet AD Sportwereld,",
      "“I wanted to sign him two years ago but at that time he was already very far along to join Bayern Munich but believe it or not, his name did not come from me in the process [at United].”",
      "Centre-back is not the only position United are looking at with defensive midfield another area of the pitch they want to strengthen. Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte has agreed personal terms whilst the club are also said to be interested in Monaco's Youssouf Fofana.",
      "Manchester United made history 25 years ago by becoming the first English club to win the Treble.",

      "Man Utd have competition for places on the wing and a player who looked likely to leave in April could now be in the team at the start of the season.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "There were 886 days between Amad's third and fourth starts for Manchester United but three months after his Old Trafford career looked to be petering out, he could be about to secure one of the few places up for grabs in the starting XI at the start of this season.",
      "If Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund have two of the front three roles locked down come the start of competitive action, then the third is up for grabs. On the evidence of this summer, it is Amad who must be in prime position at the moment to complete that triumvirate.",
      "Jadon Sancho's return from exile has put his name into the equation, but this always looked to be a battle between Amad, Antony and Marcus Rashford. Despite being back at Carrington for the last two weeks Antony is yet to kick a ball in a friendly, while Rashford had a mundane opening against Rosenborg and then missed the trip to Edinburgh.",
      "Saturday's game was Amad's first of the summer and the Rangers support inside Murrayfield would have been perplexed at seeing the 22-year-old tear them apart in the first half. He looked like a young boy out of his depth in a six-month loan spell at Ibrox in 2022 but has suddenly found some momentum and confidence to resurrect his United career.",
      "The right-winger was bright in starting the final three Premier League games of last season and was excellent on Saturday, causing no end of problems and taking his goal well. He should have had an assist as well in creating good chances for Ethan Wheatley and Sancho.",
      "Ten Hag praised Amad's versatility post-match and he did well for Sunderland as a false nine and No.10, so he offers flexibility, but the spot on the right is available at Old Trafford after Antony lost the support of his manager towards the end of last season.",
      "\"As you say, he made a very good progression last season,\" Ten Hag said of Amad at the weekend.",
      "\"The past two seasons he was on loan and then he was planned to play a role but he had a very bad injury in pre-season that dropped him a little bit back. But in the last games of the season he showed his assets. This season has to become his season.\"",
      "That suggests his future is now guaranteed when it looked anything but back in April. Then he appeared a prime candidate to be sold, that £37m fee paid to Atalanta in 2020 looking ever more perplexing.",
      "Now, the decision to be made is over how much faith the club show in him. He has a year remaining on the contract he signed when moving to the club, while United also have the option to extend it by another year.",
      "Ineos have so far been reluctant to make calls on new contracts and Amad's situation is only likely to be reviewed towards the end of the window, or even after it has closed. If he continues to dazzle in pre-season then a new, long-term deal must surely be considered.",
      "That could spell bad news for at least one of Sancho, Antony or Rashford. Ten Hag has demanded depth to his squad this season but five senior wingers, as well as two central attacking options in Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee looks excessive.",
      "It's also the case that Antony and Rashford have something to prove. The Brazilian has never looked like justifying his £85m price tag and his second season at the club was a disaster. United would consider cutting their losses but interest in him is unlikely after last season.",
      "Rashford also had a disappointing campaign, going from 30 goals in 2022/23 to just eight amid a couple of off-pitch issues that attracted the wrath of Ten Hag. There is no expectation he will leave the club but his future is far from secure and another below-par season could become an issue, especially as the five-year deal he signed a year ago makes him one of the club's highest earners.",
      "That salary looked unjustified last season and in the wake of that renewal, you can understand the caution that now exists around contracts. Amad is one of several that will come under the microscope once this window comes to an end, but right now he looks like he is worth investing in.",

      "Mason Mount endured a difficult first season at Man United but there are hopes he can show is quality in his second year.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Mason Mount looked crestfallen when he left the Brentford Community Stadium in March.",
      "Mount scored on his return from a four-month lay-off due to a calf injury and thought he'd produced the matchwinner for Manchester United deep into injury time.",
      "Brentford dominated United that night, recording 31 shots, and scored a deserved equaliser in the ninth minute of added time. Kristoffer Ajer's goal denied Mount a watershed moment and he politely declined a request to speak to a reporter as he exited for the team bus.",
      "Raphael Varane was the only United player to speak as he walked through the mixed zone and the Frenchman provided a succinct update on his injury after his substitution.",
      "It wasn't a surprise that nobody wanted to speak. The points may have been shared, but United had been fortunate not to be losing 4-0 at half-time and they still found a way to throw away an unlikely win, despite Mount seeming to have stolen victory in the sixth minute of injury time.",
      "There were three minutes between United taking the lead and Brentford scoring with practically the last kick of the game and the dressing room was deflated, naturally.",
      "However, Mount had more reason than others to feel bitter disappointment. He'd just returned from a lengthy period on the sidelines and scoring the matchwinner could have put his United career back on track, but his brilliantly taken goal had been made redundant.",
      "Mount, who came on from the bench, did superbly to score and it made sense to start him against his former club Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the next match, however, he was overlooked and his hopes of building momentum and finally kicking on in a red shirt were shattered.",
      "The midfielder was substituted on in the 86th minute against Chelsea and was jeered from all corners of the ground bar the away section. Mount was once loved in West London, but he's yet to receive that sort of adulation since moving to Manchester and has a lot to prove in his second season.",
      "Mount being named on the bench at Stamford Bridge felt like a sliding doors moment for his time at United. After scoring against Brentford, he could have built on that display and perhaps he would have been given a more prominent role for the remainder of the season.",
      "Instead, he was given another two appearances from the bench, he was absent against Sheffield United due to a knock, briefly returned to fitness and then was absent again.",
      "Mount wasn't in the squad for the final three league games due to another injury and although he lifted the FA Cup at Wembley, that game signalled the end of the most challenging year of his career.",
      "United have no plans to sell Mount this summer, despite claims he could be offloaded, and he is set to fight for a starting role. United need to sell more players this summer to generate funds and operate within PSR rules, but it's understood Mount is among the least likely to leave.",
      "Mount has backing from key figures inside the club, who want him to stay and become the important member of the squad they envisaged he would become last summer, but he will be fighting a losing battle if which position he's meant to play hasn't been clarified.",
      "Although Mount was initially brought to United to play in a deeper midfield role, there are doubts about whether he is effective there and that's without mentioning Kobbie Mainoo has nailed down that spot.",
      "Mount made his name as a creative midfielder but Bruno Fernandes has the No.10 role locked down. The 25-year-old is versatile and can play on the left and right wings, yet there's even more competition in those wide areas and he would be further down the pecking order.",
      "A critic would suggest United paid £55million to sign Mount without a well-thought-out plan on how he'd be utilised last season and his identity crisis hasn't helped his form.",
      "Having a settled position next season would help Mount find his rhythm and if he must challenge Mainoo for a starting role, then those are the cards he's been dealt.",
      "It won't be easy for Mount to wrestle back minutes from Mainoo - but competition is healthy.",
      "Whether Mount can be more than 'competition' for a starter remains to be seen.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Erik ten Hag’s job at Manchester United was declared safe before Dan Ashworth arrived as new sporting director but four days later, the manager agreed a contract extension.",
      "Ashworth, as he was prised out of gardening leave at Newcastle United, would have at least been briefed about why Ineos felt it was appropriate to keep the Dutchman on and then offer an extra 12 months on his deal.",
      "The former Brighton and FA chief will oversee the manager role from here on in and reality says that the contract extension means little should Ten Hag perform poorly once more in the opening months of the season. Because this time there will be little excuse.",
      "United have a new board steeped in industry-acclaimed reputation, led by a billionaire who is a lifelong fan and already has experience of running a football club. Transfer objectives are being ticked off and United will almost certainly not have as injury-stricken a season again this time around as they did last.",
      "After a morbid campaign, the final three games of the season - namely the FA Cup final - proved vital in Ten Hag saving his job. A 3-2 win over Newcastle and a solid 2-0 triumph at Brighton in the league scraped together fragments of belief ahead of the trip to Wembley.",
      "The showpiece was effectively a free hit after recording their worst ever Premier League finish, with Manchester City coming in on the back of lifting a record straight fourth title. What followed was the shock of the season.",
      "Ashworth made reference to the Wembley win in his first open letter to United supporters this week, with the notion of ‘what could be’ strongly evident. “We are all clear that last season fell below the required standards in the Premier League and Champions League,” he wrote.",
      "“But, by winning the FA Cup in such impressive fashion, our players and staff showed what they are capable of when everyone pulls together and performs to their potential.”",
      "United do indeed have a lot of potential and Ten Hag managed to get the best out of a team containing Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo and substitute Rasmus Hojlund as a trio for perhaps the first time in a big contest.",
      "Although in truth, United have always done better when they have no expectations on them under Ten Hag. His first competitive win, against Liverpool, a Manchester derby snatch in January 2023 and that FA Cup final were all games where United were expected to be walloped.",
      "Ahead of the 7-0 reverse mauling at Anfield, the Europa League tie with Sevilla and last season’s trip to Copenhagen, United were expected to either challenge or win comfortably. Ten Hag’s next task is to produce performances when United most - and not least - expect it.",
      "He has proven that he has the ability to unlock the potential of the squad, which is something that was not guaranteed with a replacement despite the expectation to do so.",
      "It made him a safer bet to stick with than otherwise, albeit the club clearly sounded out if there were better options available. It seems there were not.",
      "All the while, the first few knockings of next season will show whether the result at Wembley was a flash in the pan or truly the start of something new.",
      "And, by next summer - which was the manager's original contract expiry date - Ashworth will know whether Ten Hag’s extension, which will contain sack compensation, was well-gambled or pointless.",

      "Man United officially appointed Dan Ashworth as sporting director at the start of this month after lengthy negotiations.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Dan Ashworth has described addressing Erik ten Hag's future as his 'first big decision' as Manchester United's sporting director.",
      "Ashworth joined United from Newcastle at the start of July after an agreement was struck between both clubs to release the 53-year-old from his contract in the North East.",
      "Newcastle hung tough in negotiations for Ashworth, who they were reluctant to lose, and he was placed on gardening leave after an approach from Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "After protracted talks, Newcastle were forced to release Ashworth due to PSR constraints and he immediately started work at United after swapping St. James' Park for Old Trafford, which has seen his name attached to each club announcement since his start date of July 1.",
      "Ashworth was Ratcliffe's priority target for United's inaugural sporting director role and his appointment from Newcastle is expected to overhaul the club's recruitment.",
      "United have made a strong start to the summer transfer window and Ashworth has written an open letter to supporters to discuss his first few weeks as sporting director.",
      "In the letter, Ashworth reflected on his upbringing, his memories of Old Trafford, how the new football structure will work, his ambitions and the importance of backing Ten Hag.",
      "“This is one of my first opportunities to address Manchester United fans since joining the club as sporting director on 1 July, so I want to start by saying how delighted I am to be here,\" he wrote.“Although I grew up in Norfolk, I’ve always had a strong attachment with Manchester because my mum and dad were born in Middleton and my grandparents lived their whole lives there. When I visited as a boy, my dad would take me to games across Greater Manchester and I remember the thrill of my first visit to Old Trafford in the late 1970s, watching the likes of Lou Macari, Jimmy Nicholl and Arthur Albiston.",
      "“I can’t claim to have been a partisan United fan – my dad enjoyed watching all the local teams – but I remember the special buzz that always seemed to surround games at Old Trafford, and it’s something I have experienced many times since during my career in football.",
      "“So it’s going to be an incredibly proud moment entering the directors’ box on the home side for the first time when the Premier League season gets under way against Fulham on August 16. The close season is always a reset moment for every club, but the sense of renewal has been particularly strong at Manchester United this summer as our new leadership structure takes shape.",
      "“Omar Berrada has started as chief executive, and Jason Wilcox as technical director, and I can assure you that we have lost no time in getting to work. Our first big decision of the summer was to extend Erik ten Hag’s contract as men’s first-team manager to June 2026, reflecting our strong belief in him as one of Europe’s top coaches, and the partner we want to continue working with to get the team back to the levels expected.",
      "“We are all clear that last season fell below the required standards in the Premier League and Champions League but, by winning the FA Cup in such impressive fashion, our players and staff showed what they are capable of when everyone pulls together and performs to their potential.",
      "“Our collective challenge is to reach those levels much more consistently. It’s my job, together with Jason, to create the right support structures and environment around Erik, the staff and players to make that possible. Already, I can feel a strong sense of energy and determination around the group, as the players and staff return fresh from their breaks, including some exciting new additions to the squad, and to the coaching team.",
      "“There are also changes to the physical environment at Carrington as work commences on our season-long £50 million redevelopment of the training ground – evidence of our commitment to improving the club’s infrastructure.",
      "“This will require some adaptation this season, but all our teams – men’s, women’s and academy – will maintain access to high-quality facilities, with the promise of a fully refreshed, world-class site once the project is completed.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas. Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",
      "“Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players. Youth development has also been a huge part of my career and I see it as a crucial element of success for any football club – but especially for Manchester United where homegrown players have such a rich history.",
      "“The success of our Under-18s during the 2023/24 campaign bodes well for the next generation of men’s talent coming through, and the same is true on the women’s side, with both our Under-21s and Under-16s finishing the season with trophies. Overall, my first impression is the scale of opportunity available to us at Manchester United as we review and refresh all areas of the club.",
      "“This remains one of the biggest football clubs in the world, but that is not our measure of success; the focus is on getting back to being among the best on the pitch. It won’t happen overnight, but, together with Omar and his new leadership team, we will not rest until we have achieved it.”",
      "United were delighted to appoint Ashworth sooner than expected and he began work immediately, which was a huge boost in this summer window. He possesses a unique skill set and has already helped get the signings of Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro over the line.",

      "The Merseyside club have so far rejected two offers of £43million and £50m from United for their defender this summer. Everton have valued Branthwaite at between £70-£80m and are determined to keep the 21-year-old, unless a huge bid is received.",
      "The defender's price tag has been justified by Everton, who flagged fees paid by United, Chelsea and Manchester City for Harry Maguire (£80m), Wesley Fofana (£75m) and Josko Gvardiol (£77.6m) in the past five years. While United are thought to have no intention of paying a fee in that region, they still went on to sign Leny Yoro for £52m plus add-ons from Lille.",
      "That fee is thought to have left Everton surprised. It suggests that United have plenty to spend following the departures of two of their highest earners in Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial.",
      "But unless they pay what Everton are demanding, United will not be able to sign Branthwaite with Fabrizio Romano claiming that a new proposal will be sent to him this summer. The 21-year-old is currently under contract until 2027 after signing a a new deal last year.",
      "After their proposed takeover by the Friedkin Group (TFG) collapsed, Everton were plunged into a precarious financial situation and there has been speculation over whether they would need to sell their prized assets. However, the club are said to view this as changing nothing in regard to Branthwaite.",
      "United want two centre backs after their worst defensive season since 1978/79 last term. Varane has been released and Jonny Evans has signed a new one-year contract, though there is still intention to sell Victor Lindelof as he is out of contract next year.",

      "United have until September 2 to complete any more transfers, as well as sanction the exits of existing members of the squad. Despite there being several more weeks remaining of the window, the next seven days could see the Reds dip into the market to ramp up their interest in possible targets.",
      "MEN Sport takes a look at some of the players to be linked with signing for United this summer, and if any business could be conducted over the next week.",
      "United's interest in signing Matthijs de Ligt, who is valued at £42million, has been well known for quite some time now. The move to sign Yoro has seemingly delayed the move for the Bayern Munich centre-back, but there is no reason to assume the interest has disappeared.",
      "With Ten Hag and Co. set to travel to the United States later this month, the Reds would ideally like as many new signings in the squad as soon as possible. Now that De Ligt has had nearly two weeks on holiday following the Netherlands' involvement at Euro 2024, United could step up their interest in the defender in the coming days.",
      "It's not just defence where United are looking to strengthen, but midfield, as well. Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte has been linked with a move to Old Trafford for a while, and it could be this week that the interest ramps up.",
      "Benfica's Joao Neves was formerly a target, but now it seems that attention has moved to Ugarte. The Uruguay international only signed for PSG last summer, but with the Ligue 1 club seemingly close to signing Neves themselves it may be a case of United moving to bring in Ugarte in the near future, too.",
      "United's interest in signing Jarrad Branthwaite is not exactly a secret. The Reds have already had two bids rejected by Everton for the defender, with the Toffees seemingly holding out for a value of between £70million and £80million.",
      "It remains to be seen if Everton will change their financial stance on Branthwaite's future. If United can negotiate a lower fee, then it's possible that Branthwaite could be part of Ten Hag's squad that features across the Atlantic later this month.",
      "However, there may be a case of United no longer needing to sign a third centre-back this summer. The arrivals of Yoro and, potentially, De Ligt as well as the new contract for Evans may mean that United may have a decision to make over whether or not to sign a long-term target.",

Hugill, 20, played a half in both games and scored the second against Rangers, smashing a first-time finish in off the crossbar.",
      "Onana remains the only senior goalkeeper back in pre-season training, with Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton granted extra leave as a result of their involvement in the final stages of Euro 2024. That means Vitek is set to be included in the goalkeeping group for the tour and could feature in the games against Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool.",

That will give Hugill the chance to impress in the United States.",

      "Back in the 2022/23 season, there were multiple incidents of them exchanging verbals, with Fernandes appearing to want more effort from Antony in matches against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. Ten Hag played down talk of any rift at the time.",
      "He said: \"They are both players who play with the heart and, when they bring that in the game, they are on their best so it’s always a kind of balance. And always between players, sometimes emotions flare up.",
      "\"But I think, in the second moment, they are already good with each other so that is not a problem. I think definitely the players are not frustrated with him.\"",
      "Antony didn't help his cause with a disappointing second season for the Red Devils, regressing rather than progressing on his largely underwhelming debut campaign. Several moments of dissent, including a kick-out on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester Derby, summed up his annoyance.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Adult sizes from £80",
      "However, Arsenal legend Ian Wright reckoned he was being sent the wrong message by his skipper, calling Fernandes out for pressing on his own and looking out for himself.",
      "\"For Bruno sometimes, he just goes off and they’re not ready. It’s not good for the team,\" Wright said. \"Watching Antony come on and his contribution was to kick out at [Jeremy] Doku like that, but the example of the captain is seeping in. That’s the captain doing it.\"",
      "Fernandes and Antony have maintained a professional relationship nevertheless, with the former praising the latter after United's 4-3 FA Cup victory over Liverpool in March. \"In the last 15 minutes, no one's probably going to talk about it, but Antony made a great effort playing as a left-back to help us,\" he told MUTV.",
      "Sign up to our United newsletter so you never miss an update from Old Trafford this season.",
      "But their time as team-mates could soon be coming to an end. United need to make outgoings to fund their business in the summer window, and Antony could be sacrificed despite Ten Hag continually backing him.",
      "\"I am still convinced that Antony has the potential to play at this club,\" he even told AD this week. \"He certainly showed that potential in the first month: he scored three times in his first three games. After that, it became more difficult, last season was not good.\"",
      "Following Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro through the door could be long-time midfield target Adrien Rabiot, who's a free agent after leaving Juventus. French journalist Romain Collet-Gaudin claims talks are progressing with Rabiot, who prefer a move to Old Trafford over joining Liverpool.",

There are staff within United who believe Mount had a false start last season due to injury and believe next term is an opportunity for him to show why he was signed.",

When we bring this in the dressing room... but it's not just to do with the dressing room, the standards should be delivered in the whole club.\"",
      "Speaking at the end of last season, United legend Wayne Rooney was critical of the lack of leadership in the team, saying: \"One thing I would say with Manchester United now is, I look at the team and you’re still asking questions about who the leader is. I know Bruno is the captain, but who are the leaders there.",
      "“I said this a few weeks ago, when Marcus Rashford was getting stick for his body language. I think he’s always been like that. I don’t think he has ever been a big talker on the pitch. When he is going through a tough moment, or you want him to work a little bit harder, that is where the senior players have got to demand that from him.",
      "\"That’s the one thing I’d say that I don’t see. Every time United concede a goal their heads go down too quickly and you almost think there is no way back their getting back into the game.”",

      "Former German international Didi Hamann has watched De Ligt closely over the last couple of years and also believes he would add drive and authority to the United team if a deal went through. United are believed to have agreed personal terms already with the Netherlands centre-back ahead of a potential £45million move.",

      "\"It comes as a surprise that Bayern would let De Ligt go and I'm not surprised that somebody is happy to pay that fee. He's been brilliant and what I like about him, he's a leader.",

I don't think in one transfer you go back from finishing fifth or sixth or seventh to finish in top four, but I think they might be a lot closer with him [De Ligt] in the side.",

      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",
      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",

      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",

      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",

However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",

In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United's defensive overhaul this summer was expected while the previous season was in its relative infancy.",
      "Injuries decimated the backline and led to United scrounging around for players who could fill the gaps left behind. The now departed Willy Kambwala was given an unlikely call-up while veteran defender Jonny Evans made a whopping 23 appearances in the Premier League - something which was not accounted for when he signed a one-year deal last summer.",
      "Things needed to change this summer and so far we have seen just that. Impressive teenager Leny Yoro has arrived from Lille in what has been described as a coup considering Real Madrid's intense interest.",
      "United have their eyes on Matthijs de Ligt too but are looking to complete some more sales first to fund their bid for the Bayern Munich man. The last piece of the puzzle for the Reds looked to be to bring Jarrad Branthwaite on board too.",
      "Hopes of signing the England international were boosted last week when Everton's takeover fell through and it was suggested the Toffees would now be open to selling Branthwaite at a cut price. However, these suggestions were quickly extinguished when conflicting reports stressed the Merseyside club were no longer open to receiving bids for the 22-year-old.",
      "Any lingering hope that United could benefit from another twist in the tale appeared to be snuffed out on Monday evening as Aston Villa announced the arrival of Everton's Amadou Onana. It is believed the West Midlands club have splashed £50m on the Belgian in a bumper departure for Sean Dyche's team.",
      "With Onana gone and with Everton in an even stronger position financially, United must now accept that they will be unable to lowball the Toffees for Branthwaite. The midfielder's departure only serves to strengthen their hand and there is no reason why Everton should feel inclined to hand out a discount.",
      "In which case, the Reds may have to settle for just two new centre-back additions this summer should Victor Lindelof depart. Harry Maguire is more than capable of becoming the fourth central defensive player, used on rotation for what is yet to be another busy season.",
      "This is not a disastrous scenario for Ten Hag either even though he was open to having three new centre-backs in his team. With the Branthwaite deal all but dead, he can now focus his efforts on other areas of the pitch instead of adding a third centre-back into the squad.",

      "First up was Netherlands and Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee who joins the club as competition for Rasmus Hojlund at the top end of the pitch. Next to arrive was Lille's centre-back Leny Yoro in a deal which has been considered a coup by many considering Real Madrid's interest this summer.",
      "Next on the agenda for strengthening is likely to be midfield. There is a widely held view that Casemiro is unlikely to be a starter for the Reds next season but who will come in to replace him is unclear.",
      "In our latest look at the media headlines, the Reds have been given a secret update on one target - Joao Neves.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese newspaper A Bola, Benfica's president Rui Costa admitted a bid is on the table for his defensive midfielder Neves however, he remained tight-lipped on the details. \"I never said that Joao Neves would only leave for his release clause and therefore, those claims are false,\" he began.",
      "\"What I can say in relation to Joao Neves is that there is an offer on the table. That has been in the news in the last days but I'm not going to say where this proposal stands.",
      "\"There is a proposal on the table which is being evaluated and is being discussed. But at this moment, Neves remains a Benfica player.\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: If United are not the ones to have made the bid for Neves, they will be bracing themselves to discover whether Benfica deem the offer acceptable or not. What is clear is that the bid is not valued at Neves' release clause. Of course, there would be little to discuss if it was.",
      "United will be buoyed by the news that Benfica could accept a bid lower than Neves' release clause and that should give them motivation to go low on their offer to test the water. The Portuguese club still hold a lot of power but that is beginning to change with Costa's recent comments.",
      "According to journalist Florian Plettenberg, United are willing to consider bids as low as £10m for Aaron Wan-Bissaka this summer. This is because the Reds have reportedly targeted Bayern Munich full-back Noussair Mazraoui as his replacement.",
      "They are set to face competition from West Ham for his signature and should they fend off that threat, the Iron are set to target Wan-Bissaka instead.",
      "What MEN Sport says: United are obviously weary about having an inflated squad and if they feel Mazraoui is a significant improvement then it makes sense to get Wan-Bissaka off the books as quickly as possible. However, they must also be cautious not to underprice the Englishman in the transfer market especially when the Reds are relying on money made from departures to bring in players - not just direct replacements either. £10m seems low and every penny does count especially with Financial Fair Play (FFP) restraints.",

      "Man Utd have signed players in two key positions but change is likely in midfield and Erik ten Hag's options in that position are improving.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "It's been a good start to the summer for Manchester United, with arrivals secured in the two priority positions identified before the window opened to freshen up Erik ten Hag's squad.",
      "A forward and a centre-back were considered the most pressing issues after the departures of Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial on free transfers. In Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee they have young replacements on much lower salaries. Ten Hag is certainly pleased with the business done and praised the new football structure in place at United when speaking after the pre-season friendly win against Rangers on Saturday.",
      "\"I think at the moment the football leadership is very on the front foot. I think that's what clubs like Manchester United should do,\" he said.",
      "The signs are encouraging under the leadership of sporting director Dan Ashworth, technical director Jason Wilcox and interim director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, but the window could get more challenging from here on in. The work is certainly not done for United. A deal for Matthijs de Ligt remains likely if a centre-back is sold, while they could for a full-back if Aaron Wan-Bissaka departs.",
      "Then there is the midfield. A new holding midfielder is now a priority for United and although that doesn't entirely depend on sales, it would clearly grease the cogs when it comes to freeing up funds.",
      "So far Casemiro has started both pre-season friendlies in a deep midfield role without looking much sharper than last season. As one of the squad's highest earners Ineos are keen to move him on, but there has been limited interest so far and at the moment the Brazilian is expecting to stay.",
      "If flogging the five-time Champions League winner proves to be beyond United, then they might have to consider cashing in on Scott McTominay. Ten Hag said he wanted to keep him on Saturday, but he was never likely to say otherwise and was happy to sell him a year ago.",
      "Any fee for the academy graduate would be pocketed as pure profit in accounting terms for PSR, so the advantages are understandable. There might be more of a willingness to sell McTominay after Mason Mount made an impressive start to pre-season.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Adult sizes from £80",
      "The £55m midfielder has been one of United's best performers, in a deeper role against Rosenborg and a more advanced position in the win against Rangers at Murrayfield. His first season at Old Trafford was a write-off after a slow start and then a string of injury issues, but he has had a summer without international disruption and looks to have returned ready to make his mark.",
      "If Mount's fitness issues are behind him - and his fitness record at Chelsea was excellent - then it could further limit McTominay's game time. That could make a sale more tempting and the funds could be reinvested into the squad.",
      "There's no doubt shifting Casemiro would be the priority, however, not least because the profile of midfielder United are pursuing suggests the 32-year-old is unlikely to be starting games next season. He had a disappointing 2023/24 and the midfield was a mess for much of the season, too often outplayed and outfought by the opposition.",
      "Sofyan Amrabat did bring some steel to that area of the pitch towards the end of the season and United are yet to rule out bringing the Moroccan back, although he isn't a priority at the moment. Instead, United are at looking at younger options at the base of midfield.",
      "They have held talks with Paris St-Germain over Manuel Ugarte, with the 23-year-old valued at around £50m and keen to move to Old Trafford. They also hold an interest in Arsenal target Martin Zubimendi. The 25-year-old came off the bench for Rodri in the Euro 2024 final and has a €60m (£50.5m) release clause in his Real Sociedad contract.",
      "United have made a point this summer of targeting players that either have a release clause in their contract or only a year left on their deal and Zubimendi fits the bill. He would certainly improve United's midfield on the evidence of last season, as would Ugarte.",
      "The issues in that position last summer were structural as well as about personnel. But bringing in a new £50m holding midfielder and getting a refreshed and revitalised Mount would certainly present Ten Hag with improved options.",

      "Former Manchester United centre-back Rio Ferdinand called Leny Yoro to convince the teenager to sign for the club, the teenager has revealed.",
      "United had been courting Yoro since the end of last season and held meetings with the 18-year-old to explain their plans to him, while Erik ten Hag also spoke to the central defender.",
      "Real Madrid had long been expected to complete a deal for Yoro this summer but United's groundwork paid off when they had an offer of £58.9m accepted by Lille, while Ferdinand also turned on the charm offensive.",
      "Ferdinand called Yoro and sold him on the benefits of a move to United and the defender, who made the Ligue 1 team of the year last season, revealed the conversation with the six-time Premier League winner played a key role in convincing him to join the club.",

      "\"It was like two weeks ago. He called me, so first of all I was really impressed to speak with him and yeah, we spoke like 10 minutes about Man United, so he helped me a lot to make my choice. So yeah, it was really an honour to speak with him.",
      "\"He spoke to me about the club, and [that] this is a historic club with a big story, and if I go there I need to fight for the club, to be ready, because this is the biggest club in the world. So, yeah, for me it was really good to speak about this.\"",
      "Yoro revealed he had watched Ferdinand playing for United as a child and reflected on the quality of defenders who had gone before him in that era.",
      "\"When I was younger, Rio was one of the best defenders in the world. I think everyone watched United when he was young and, for me, it was a dream to play for this club,\" he said.",

      "Yoro also picked the brains of former United youngster Angel Gomes, who now plays for Lille, before making the move.",
      "\"Yeah, we spoke a lot about United,\" he said. \"He just told me this is the biggest club in the world, you know the fans, even the way to play, the training camp, everything is really big, is really incredible. So yeah, every day I spoke with him about this and it helped me a lot to come here.\"",
      "Yoro's own footballing journey started in Paris before he made the move to Lille's academy and started a rapid ascent to the first team, making 60 appearances before leaving this summer.",
      "\"First of all, I'm born in Paris, so yeah, I started to play in a little club in Paris with my friends where my dad came a lot to see me play football,\" he added.",
      "\"After, I came to Lille when I was 10 years old, something like this. And yeah, I started to play in the little club of my town, and after that I go to LOSC, the club of Lille. I started to grow up there and after I start to make my first step into professional games. After, everything goes really fast for me.\"",

      "Man United have been credited with interest in signing Paris Saint-Germain ace Xavi Simons, who has previously worked with Reds assistant boss Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "With just over three weeks to go until the start of the new Premier League season, the number of players who are being linked with moves to Manchester United is increasing.",
      "United made their second signing of the summer last week, drafting in highly-rated centre-back Leny Yoro from Lille. The Reds saw off competition from Real Madrid to sign the Frenchman and he impressed on his debut against Rangers on Saturday.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is the club's only other new arrival so far in this window, but United are working tirelessly behind the scenes to add more quality to Erik ten Hag's squad. It is understood the addition of a new midfielder is now their next objective.",
      "United want to draft in a new defensive-minded midfielder to operate at the base of the engine room and have been heavily linked with Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte. They have also expressed interest in Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi.",
      "Despite the addition of a holding midfielder being United's main aim in relation to their quest to strengthen their midfield options, they have been credited with interest in Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Xavi Simons. The Netherlands international is an attack-minded midfielder, recognised for playing as a No.10. He can also operate out wide, either on the right or the left.",
      "According to Transfermarkt, Simons, who spent last season on loan at German club RB Leipzig, made 41 of his 43 appearances last term as a wide player, starting just two games centrally. United are currently knee-deep in wingers, meaning it is hard to envision them wanting to sign him to operate out wide.",
      "Nevertheless, reports overseas suggest the 21-year-old, who scored for the Netherlands in their European Championship semi-final defeat to England earlier this month, is at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war, with Bayern Munich and Barcelona also being credited with interest in his services.",
      "Prior to last season's stint at Leipzig, Simons spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan at PSV Eindhoven, where Ruud van Nistelrooy was the manager. The Dutchman recently joined United as one of Ten Hag's new assistants.",
      "Simons starred under Van Nistelrooy's management, scoring 20 goals and creating 12 in 46 games in all competitions. Although his attacking output impressed the former PSV boss, it was his mentality that pleased Van Nistelrooy most.",
      "Speaking to Voetbal International in September 2022, Van Nistelrooy said of Simons: \"His mentality, his mindset, it's unprecedented. It's a boy of only 19 years old, but Xavi is already much further advanced than his age.",
      "\"But he really is a pure professional, a boy who is working towards a goal, who wants to get the most out of his qualities.\"",
      "He added: \"He's doing everything he can to get to the top, his top. And where that will be, that's the beautiful challenge.",
      "\"That bit in him, wanting to do everything for that, I recognise that from myself as a player. I can only enjoy that.\"",
      "Having been so impressed by him during his stint at PSV, Van Nistelrooy will be able to provide Ten Hag and United's hierarchy with as much information about Simons as possible. The former United striker quickly developed an understanding of his mentality and that is a key trait Ten Hag analyses when drawing up recruitment plans.",
      "Speaking in August 2022, Ten Hag said: \"Of course you analyse your squad…what are the weaknesses, what are the strengths and where can we improve? Which players are on the market?",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Adult sizes from £80",
      "\"But it's also really important that you know the characters of your current squad and also the players that you bring in… what characters and behaviour they have. And what the effect, or probable effect, they will have in the dressing room.\"",
      "Ten Hag, if United are serious about signing Simons, will take comfort from Van Nistelrooy's comments. The Reds chief wants his squad filled with players with the right mindset and mentality, meaning Simons could slot in seamlessly.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "RB Leipzig and Spain star Dani Olmo is one of Europe's most in-demand players after his dazzling performances at Euro 2024. The 26-year-old helped his nation win the tournament leading to a number of clubs showing interest.",
      "Manchester United are one of the clubs reportedly keeping tabs on his situation in Germany. Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal have shown interest but he remains at Leipzig.",
      "Olmo has insisted he is unsure if he will stay at the club this summer, saying he wants to be somewhere where he is valued. After claiming there were several options, speculation has accelerated ahead of the 2024/25 season.",
      "United are being linked with several potential new signings after Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro arrived. Midfield is the priority for sporting director Dan Ashworth with Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte and Benfica's Joao Neves top targets.",
      "Olmo is another player linked although the Spain international is a different sort of profile to the one being prioritised by United. The RB Leipzig playmaker plays further forward, similar to the role that Bruno Fernandes occupies in Erik ten Hag's XI.",
      "It is thought that Olmo's contract at Leipzig contained a €60m (£50m) release clause, with some reports stating that it has expired this week. However, he is expected to be available for the same price despite the clause no longer being available.",
      "Ashworth and United have plenty of reasons to move for Olmo this summer and Pep Guardiola has already explained why any club would benefit from his services. Speaking in 2019 when Manchester City beat Dinamo Zagreb 4-1 in the Champions League, Guardiola hailed Olmo's ability.",
      "The Spaniard opened the scoring for the Croatian team before Gabriel Jesus netted a hat-trick to help City win. Olmo was the subject of questions after the game after impressive displays against Shakhtar Donetsk and Guardiola was full of praise.",
      "\"He's a top player - he has a bright future, of course,\" he said. \"(His) performance shows it. About the transfer and the money he deserves, that is not the point.",
      "\"The point is he is an incredible player and I am pretty sure he is able to play in the strong leagues in Europe.\"",
      "It isn't just Guardiola who has spoken highly of Olmo. In 2020, Julian Nagelsmann credited the midfielder for his adaptability from the Croatian league to the Bundesliga so quickly. \"The Bundesliga has a higher pace than the Croatian league, so it takes some time to adjust physically,\" he said.",
      "\"He was extremely hard-working, won the ball a lot of times and defended very robustly. He has exceptional abilities and is very safe with the ball. When he gets under pressure, he knows how to provoke a foul.\"",

      "Manchester United's capture of exciting teenager Leny Yoro is only one part of their aim to transform their defence this summer.",
      "The Reds spent big to entice Yoro from Lille, beating Real Madrid to the 18-year-old's signature after a fee that could rise to £58.9m was agreed with the French outfit. Yoro then made his debut on Saturday, impressing over 45 minutes against Rangers.",
      "United, however, are not finished there with their central defensive makeover. Having finished last season in eighth position and with a negative goal difference, Erik ten Hag and Ineos are determined to improve most areas of the squad.",
      "Yoro is a replacement for fellow Frenchman Raphael Varane, who left Old Trafford when his contract expired. However, United want at least one more centre-half - potentially two - in a bid to get back into the Premier League's top four.",
      "Jarrad Branthwaite and Matthijs de Ligt both remain firm targets. United have had two bids for Branthwaite rejected while they have agreed personal terms with Dutchman De Ligt, but are yet to settle on a fee with his club Bayern Munich.",
      "The deal for De Ligt looks likely to happen at some point this summer, but former United striker Teddy Sheringham has urged Ineos to move on from the player and instead swoop for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi. The England man has been linked with a move to United over the last month, while Arsenal are also reportedly interested in him.",
      "Guehi excelled at Euro 2024, taking the place of the injured Harry Maguire alongside John Stones in Gareth Southgate's starting line-up. And Sheringham believes the 24-year-old is a better option than the other players being scouted.",
      "\"Manchester United should go for Marc Guehi over Matthijs de Ligt,\" he told OLBG. \"United don’t need big name players they need hard graft and players who will put a shift in week in and week out.",
      "\"From what I’ve seen of Guehi, especially this summer, he’d be a great addition at Old Trafford.\"",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "The wheels are in motion for Manchester United this summer - with Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee now on board - as INEOS plot further additions behind the scenes. A third incoming is edging closer for United as they continue to run the rule over four midfield options including Euro 2024 winner Martin Zubimendi.",
      "Manuel Ugarte and Adrien Rabiot are also on radar, while a return for Sofyan Amrabat hasn't been ruled out, either.",
      "United have started discussions with PSG over Ugarte - who only joined the French outfit last summer - while free agent Rabiot has long-since been linked with a move to Old Trafford. Interest in Zubimendi is relatively fresh after a coming-of-age season with Real Sociedad preceded Euro 2024 glory at England's expense in Berlin.",
      "There are pros and cons to each of the options above. Here, our team of reporters share their thoughts;",
      "It is very clear that Manchester United need to and likely will sign a new defensive midfielder. Despite the emergence of Kobbie Mainoo, United's midfield issues are well known with Erik ten Hag making a surprise tactical change which saw Bruno Fernandes deployed in a false nine role in an attempt to solve those problems.",
      "With the hope of avoiding doing that again, United are looking at several midfielders with Ineos identifying a number of targets. Joao Neves, Adrien Rabiot and Manuel Ugarte have all been linked with Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi the latest name to emerge of interest.",
      "Arsenal are also admirers of Zubimendi, however that is no longer present with it seen as likely the 25-year-old remains in Spain. As for Ugarte and Neves, both Paris Saint-Germain and Benfica are expected to command sizeable fees with it intriguing PSG are looking at Neves as a potential replacement for Ugarte.",
      "Sofyan Amrabat meanwhile, impressed in the latter weeks of the last season with United having the option to make his loan permanent for just over £20million. Considering how he performed in several decisive games for United, alongside Ineos' eagerness to not overspend, bringing Amrabat back to Old Trafford should be completed.",
      "Manchester United's transfer business so far has looked promising with deals for young and talented players completed swiftly. It's a far cry from previous windows under Ed Woodward and John Murtough.",
      "And a deal for Manuel Ugarte should be next on their list. Yes, the Uruguayan struggled at PSG but aged 23, he shouldn't be written off after just one season, particularly when he shone in the Champions League for Sporting just two seasons ago.",
      "Whilst Sofyan Amrabat impressed at times towards the end of 2023/24, I don't think he's demonstrated enough throughout his career to be considered good enough for what United want to be. He was dealt a bad hand at times with United's injury crisis forcing him to play out of position but I don't think he's good enough.",
      "Adrien Rabiot is an interesting one. At his best, he is an asset to any team but I'm unsure how often we'll see that and United can't afford to sign another inconsistent midfielder. Ultimately, Ugarte is the one they need to sign and we're then looking at a very good window.",
      "Budget will be the buzzword from here on this summer. Yoro and Zirkzee have arrived to plug two much-needed gaps for the present and future - at either end - with further centre-back additions planned. The deals to get them to Old Trafford have been calculated, precise and effective to offer up hope for INEOS control.",
      "However, there are a few moving parts at play when it comes to the engine room, meaning the best option might not be the most practical or attainable. Funds, who moves on and what United actually want from a new defensive midfielder is not set in stone, but Zubimendi does represent an intriguing proposition.",
      "As shown by his Euro 2024 showpiece appearance - when replacing injured Manchester City talisman Rodri at half-time - the Sociedad man is technically brilliant, tactically aware and defensively sound. He might not have the same physically as Ugarte, for example, but his ability on the ball could fit perfectly into the style Ten Hag wants.",
      "If money were no object, Zubimendi might just be the one to allow United to evolve this season.",
      "It’s been a summer of bringing young talent to United so far with the arrivals of Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro. It should be the same with the club looking to strengthen their midfield for the upcoming season.",
      "Defensive midfield is the priority area, especially considering the reports surrounding United not making Sofyan Amrabat’s move permanent. Manuel Ugarte is the name that has probably been the most heavily linked, while he hasn’t had too much success at Paris Saint Germain, at just 23-years-old he has plenty of time to prove what he can do.",
      "Another interesting name is Adrien Rabiot, who is available on a free transfer following his exit from Juventus. While he would be the cheaper option in terms of a fee, he would demand bigger wages and see United move away from signing young, up-and-coming players.",
      "Rabiot is a more attacking option and could cover both the defensive midfield position as well as providing competition further forward. But I feel that opting for Ugarte would be a better long-term choice.",
      "United may have to spend shrewdly for the remainder of the summer until they can offload several players who have become surplus to requirements under the new regime. That is why Rabiot represents an opportunity they should seriously consider.",
      "While the France international was one of Juventus' highest earners before his contract expired, the chance to sign a player with his experience and versatility on a free transfer is not one to pass up. Rabiot does not turn 30 until early April and has shown no signs of slowing down over recent seasons.",
      "The midfielder made at least 35 appearances across all competitions during all five seasons in Turin and has avoided major injuries throughout his career. Capable of playing in defensive midfield or a more traditional role in the middle - and even wide on the left at a push - the Parisian would be a welcome addition to Erik ten Hag's squad.",
      "PSG have arguably failed to replace the academy graduate since he left in 2019, which, in a roundabout way, led them to sign Ugarte last summer, a move that went so well they are willing to sell 12 months later. United must not make the same mistake.",

      "Man United have added Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee to their squad so far this summer, but a lot more work still needs to be done ahead of the transfer deadline.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United strengthened their defensive options with the signing of Lille centre-back Leny Yoro in midweek. It was a huge deal for the club, beating Real Madrid to his signature.",
      "The 18-year-old finalised his switch to Old Trafford on Thursday and put pen to paper on a five-year deal. He became the club's second signing of the summer, following in the footsteps of Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The youngster has immediately strengthened United's centre-back options, but the club is open to making more additions in the heart of the defence. It is one of a handful of areas they could still add to this summer.",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport has taken a close look at how United's squad looks as it currently stands and what might change before the window closes in our audit of the player inventory.",
      "United are currently well-stocked in the goalkeeping department after tying Tom Heaton down to a new contract earlier this month. Andre Onana will continue as the club's No.1 this season and it is likely he will be supported by Altay Bayindir, who played just once last term after arriving from Fenerbahce.",
      "Beyond Onana, Bayindir and Heaton, United also have the likes of Radek Vitek, Dermot Mee and Elyh Harrison who can provide even more depth. It would be no great surprise to see Vitek head out on loan again after his excellent performance against Rosenborg.",
      "Following the capture of Yoro, United's level of strength in depth across all areas of the back four is currently reasonable, with the Frenchman joining Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans at centre-back. However, United are keen to offload Lindelof and that could open the door for a replacement.",
      "Erik ten Hag has confirmed the club's interest in Bayern Munich's Matthijs de Ligt and United have already agreed personal terms with him. Bringing him in and shipping Lindelof out would be an upgrade, and would leave the club with a strong collection of central defenders.",
      "In the full-back areas, United will only strengthen at right-back if Aaron Wan-Bissaka is moved on. His contract is up in just under a year's time and he has been linked with clubs both domestically and overseas.",
      "At left-back, last season's long-term injuries to both Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia could force United's hand to bring in another option, but they have youngsters Sam Murray and Harry Amass showing plenty of promise and they could make up the numbers.",
      "If they are fit and available for selection, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes will be two of the very first names on the teamsheet. Fernandes is United's captain and chief creator, while Mainoo is an undroppable figure.",
      "The need for a defensive midfielder to complete Ten Hag's ideal midfield trio is no secret. Casemiro regressed last season and United need a younger operator in that area of the pitch. They still need to replace Sofryan Amrabat too, whose loan spell came to an end.",
      "In an ideal world, United could do with selling Casemiro before his value plummets further. In a stocktake of United's inventory, this one is pushing close to the best before date. Mason Mount will be hoping for an injury-free second season at Old Trafford to prove his worth and Scott McTominay could be retained after a haul of 10 goals last season, but a tempting offer could convince them to sell.",
      "Christian Eriksen and Hannibal Mejbri are still on the books and can operate as No.8s. Both are out of contract next summer and could be moved on to avoid losing them for free. Hannibal, in particular, would provide United with a significant PSR boost, having come through the academy since joining from Monaco in 2019 aged just 16. His loan spell at Spanish side Sevilla featured an option for the LaLiga club to sign him permanently this summer for £17m but after he failed to impress, United have missed out on that FFP windfall.",
      "If United cut them both from their squad, they will need replacing. United will admit they need to trim the squad in places, but they cannot leave themselves short.",
      "Speaking of wingers, if United need to trim any department within their squad this summer it has to be the wide areas. Ten Hag is knee-deep in wingers who can operate on either flank. There is plenty of surplus stock that could be sold to help reinvest.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Facundo Pellistri, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Amad are all vying for the right-wing berth, while Marcus Rashford's future on the left is far from certain. Both Garnacho and Sancho can play on either side to compete with Rashford.",
      "Sancho, despite clearing the air with Ten Hag, could still be offloaded, while Pellistri needs to go for the good of his own career. It means Garnacho and Rashford are primed to start on the flanks, supported by Amad and Antony.",
      "United moved fast to replace Anthony Martial, bringing in Zirkzee from Bologna. He will provide support and competition for Rasmus Hojlund, who is expected to remain the club's first-choice striker.",
      "Ten Hag operates with a system that features just one centre-forward, meaning Hojlund is expected to remain top of the pecking order, with Zirkzee providing cover from the bench. There is still talk of another striker being signed this summer, but it is not a leading priority.",
      "Ethan Wheatley will provide an extra element of depth, particularly if he impresses in pre-season.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Man United youngster Toby Collyer has made progress in the academy and has been given a prominent role in pre-season.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Erik ten Hag believes Manchester United youngster Toby Collyer has 'earned' his opportunity to get first-team minutes.",
      "Collyer was given the captain's armband in the second half of the opening pre-season clash against Rosenborg and he started against Rangers this weekend.",
      "The midfielder started alongside Casemiro and Mason Mount and is set to be included in the travelling squad for the upcoming pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "Earlier this month, Collyer signed a new contract with United until 2027 and Ten Hag insisted on attending his signing ceremony at Carrington. The Dutchman was also spotted deep in conversation with Collyer after the FA Cup final and is understood to 'really like' him.",
      "Ten Hag took time to speak to a handful of Manchester-based reporters after Saturday's friendly victory over Rangers and he was asked for his opinion on Collyer. \"You know me, I always want to make pathways for young players but they have to earn it,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"He's now earned an opportunity. Today he was in the starting XI, that's something, and we see how we can progress. We saw last year with [Alejandro] Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo what can happen, so the pathway is also open for other players and Toby is there in fourth.\"",
      "It's believed Ten Hag was suggesting Collyer would be the 'fourth' academy player to contribute to the first-team squad after Garnacho, Mainoo and Willy Kambwala.",
      "Ten Hag has overseen the development of Garnacho and Mainoo and both youngsters are now established first-team players. They both scored in the 2-1 victory in the FA Cup final over Manchester City at Wembley and are now playing senior international football.",
      "Kambwala enjoyed a breakthrough last season but was sold to Villarreal this summer in a deal worth €11.5m, which was considered a transfer fee too big to reject.",
      "Collyer was named on the bench eight times last season and although he didn't make the squad for the FA Cup final, he travelled to Wembley and was on the pitch at full-time.",
      "Ten Hag speaking to Collyer on the pitch at Wembley has drawn comparisons to his conversation with Mainoo after United won the Carabao Cup in February 2023.",
      "Collyer is yet to make his first-team debut but is not expected to go out on loan this season, which suggests he could become the next player to make his senior bow.",
      "United signed Collyer from the Brighton academy in 2022 and he trained under Ten Hag in September 2022.",

      "Manchester United's transfer business has ramped up over the last week - but it is only set to get busier as Ineos continue what could be a remarkable rebuild of the first-team squad.",
      "Leny Yoro's arrival from Lille for £58.9million was completed just a few days after Joshua Zirkzee arrived from Bologna for £35.7m. They are the first two signings of the Ineos era but won't be the last.",
      "United will look to add more players to the squad this summer to give Erik ten Hag's side a boost after what was a dismal league campaign. And while the summer sales have already begun, there will also be more outgoings with several players heading for the exit door.",
      "READ MORE:Erik ten Hag makes transfer demand",
      "There are 40 days and 40 nights left until the transfer window closes at 11pm on August 30. We take a look at what could happen between now and then.",
      "It's shaping up to be one of the greatest comebacks since the 1999 Champions League final. Jadon Sancho, sent on loan to Borussia Dortmund after a savage fall-out with Erik ten Hag, looked to have no future at Old Trafford, only for the pair to bury the hatchet last week.",
      "Sancho, remarkably, then started at the weekend against Rangers, but doubts still persist over whether he has a long-term future at the club under the Dutchman. There would be few people surprised if the winger had departed the club before the transfer deadline, either on loan or permanently. Interest remains from clubs in Serie A, including Juventus, while Dortmund can't be ruled out from making another move.",
      "At one stage last season it looked like Rashford would be on his way this summer. An alarming drop in form and indiscipline - including being fined for an unauthorised night out in Belfast - had seen the forward's stock drop, not just in Ten Hag's eyes but also in those of some United matchgoers.",
      "Arsenal and Paris St Germain have both been linked with a move for the striker. The Manchester Evening News reported earlier this month that the player was set for talks with the United hierarchy with his future still uncertain.",
      "Since then, there has been little speculation about Rashford. He remains off social media, and started Monday's pre-season game at Rosenborg. He will be hoping that he can recapture the form that saw him hit 30 goals in the 2022-23 season and force his way back into the England reckoning.",
      "Whether that is with United or elsewhere will be seen after August 30.",
      "Now, firstly some apologies on this one. It could actually be that United have longer than 40 days to seal this deal with the Saudi Pro League's transfer window not closing until September 2. United would still want a deal wrapped up well before that, however, so they know what position they are in financially and for finding a replacement.",
      "Casemiro suffered a difficult campaign, looking a shadow of the player who set the standards at United in his first season at the club, and 100 miles away from the force who won multiple Champions Leagues with Real Madrid.",
      "United are keen to cash in, but may have to lower their £30m asking price. Saudi interest has gone quiet but still remains - it will just take a bit of time to agree on contract, fee and demands.",
      "Another centre-back and a midfielder are likely additions this summer, with one player in those areas likely to be sold. A full-back could also be pursued if Aaron Wan-Bissaka leaves the club, with Premier League interest in the former Crystal Palace right-back.",
      "United could potentially need two midfielders, regardless of what happens to Casemiro. Sofyan Amrabat's loan came to an end and while a return for the Moroccan hasn't been entirely ruled out, there are other options.",
      "If a senior midfielder does depart, United will push ahead to bring in a new addition this summer, having held talks with Paris St-Germain over Uruguay international Manuel Ugarte, who is keen to make the switch. There is also interest in Real Sociedad's Spanish international Martin Zubimendi. However, a move for Benfica's highly-rated teenager Joao Neves looks to have hit the buffers due to his price tag, with PSG now seemingly in pole position.",
      "United are now in a position where they need to sell to raise funds. The transfer budget was limited this summer and reliant on bringing in money by selling players, with offers listened to for everyone bar four - Andre Onana, Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Peripheral members of Ten Hag's squad such as Victor Lindelof, Christian Eriksen and even potentially Harry Maguire could be moved on. And there will be no space in the squad for Facundo Pellistri and Hannibal Mejbri. United missed out on a £17m windfall when Sevilla failed to take up the option to sign Hannibal permanently after his loan spell, and with just a year left on his deal United will hope they can still get a good sum for him this summer. Pellistri, meanwhile, is interesting Greek side Panathinaikos.",
      "United have already brought in more than £40m from the combined sales of Mason Greenwood, Willy Kambwala and Donny van de Beek but will need to raise a lot more before 11pm on August 30. If they can get £35m for Sancho, £20m for Casemiro and £25m for the combined sales of Pellistri and Hannibal, it will have added £120m to the budget.",

      "There has also been talk over who could leave the club before the transfer deadline next month. Fringe players could potentially move on in search of game time with any money raised possibly boosting the funds available for incomings.",
      "Here’s a look at a couple of stories from in and around Old Trafford over the past 24 hours. We’ve also given our own view on the situation.",
      "The agent of United winger Antony has said that his client plans on staying with the club beyond the transfer window, amid speculation over his future. It has been reported that United could consider sending the Brazilian out on loan this summer, if his wages are paid.",
      "But Junior Pedroso, Antony’s representative has poured cold water on that suggestion. He told Fabrizio Romano: “I see reports about potential exit on loan. Antony’s plan is clear: Manchester United”.",
      "“He wants to stay, he’s only focused on Man United. We already spoke about that with the club”.",
      "MEN Sport says: It’s always nice to hear that a player wants to stay at the club and fight for their place in the team, but after a season to forget a move away from United, even if only on loan may be just what Antony needs. The emergence of Amad, who will be looking for more regular starts this season, plus the return of Jadon Sancho, who could now stay at the club after making up with Ten Hag, only adds to the competition on the wings.",
      "If Antony can’t get regular game time, then he’s going to find it hard to play himself into form. That will only reduce his value and make any sale in upcoming transfer windows harder.",
      "Brentford manager Thomas Frank has given an update on striker Ivan Toney. The England man has just one year remaining on his contract with the club with admissions made earlier in the season over him being sold this summer.",
      "United have previously been linked with an interest in Toney, but Frank has warned that any deal will be ‘expensive’ for the buying club.",
      "“You never know. He’s a Brentford player and I would love him to stay,” he said. “That would give me a very positive challenge.",
      "“But I haven’t met a coach who doesn’t want as many good players as possible. Right now, Ivan is a Brentford player. I would be more than happy if he stayed with us. He’s a goalscorer and that’s very good to have in your team so if you want to buy him, it’s expensive.”",
      "MEN Sport says: If United hadn’t have signed Joshua Zirkzee earlier this month, then Toney would be a brilliant signing. But the arrival of the Dutchman means that United now have no need for another striker, especially one that is going to eat into the transfer budget further.",
      "Toney showed what he can do in his short cameo against Slovakia for England in the Euros. He also does it week-in, week-out for Brentford in the Premier League.",
      "The striker would be a clever signing for a club on the lookout for a striker who is a proven goalscorer in the league, but United should concentrate on other areas of the pitch.",

      "Alongside preparing for the new season on the pitch, United are working tirelessly off it to provide Ten Hag with all the tools he needs. After signing Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna last Sunday, Leny Yoro arrived from Lille on Thursday.",
      "United entered this summer's transfer window with the ambition of strengthening both up front and at centre-back. To have achieved both of those objectives before flying out to the US deserves recognition.",
      "However, United are not done yet, with the addition of a defensive midfielder still a leading objective. They are also still open to bringing in at least one more centre-back, while further additions in other areas cannot be dismissed.",
      "United will also want to increase their number of outgoings. They have so far offloaded Alvaro Fernandez, Willy Kambwala, Donny van de Beek and Mason Greenwood.",
      "To complete their 25-man squad for the forthcoming season, United need to oversee more wheeling and dealing. Ten Hag wants to increase the level of quality throughout his squad and that means assembling an improved level of depth.",
      "Starting with the goalkeeping department, United, barring any unexpected developments, are all set in that area of the team, with Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton primed to provide support for first-choice shot-stopper Andre Onana. The Cameroonian improved as last season unfolded and there is very little chance of him being dislodged at the top of the pecking order.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's contract situation creates a puzzle at right-back. The former Crystal Palace man has entered the final 12 months of his current deal and that represents an opportunity for United to cash in and get money in the pot. A fee of £15million has been mooted as being enough to convince United to let go of the man they spent £50m on back in 2019.",
      "Diogo Dalot deserves to remain United's first-choice right-back but would need a degree of competition if Wan-Bissaka is sold. Denzel Dumfries has once again been linked with a move to Old Trafford but he would expect to start every week.",
      "The Reds have acted swiftly to replace Raphael Varane, bringing in Yoro. The highly-rated 18-year-old is a statement signing and he will expect to start alongside Lisandro Martinez at the heart of the back four.",
      "United, despite wanting to add another centre-back, are now well-stocked in that area of the team. However, the Reds want to sell Victor Lindelof, meaning it could prove to be a case of shipping the Swede out and bringing Matthijs de Ligt in.",
      "At left-back, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia will be hoping to put an injury-hit 2023/24 campaign behind them and make up for lost time. The former, if he maintains his fitness, will start most games, but Malacia's fragility means United could benefit from another left-back addition.",
      "Harry Amass and Sam Murray are both showing signs of promise, but their inexperience could convince United to bring in another option for the left side of the defence.",
      "The defensive midfield berth needs fresh legs before the window closes. Casemiro regressed last season and Sofyan Amrabat has returned to Fiorentina after his season-long loan spell.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte has been identified as an option to succeed Casemiro, who could be sold amid his surprise downfall. If he is shipped out, United would need to bring in an additional defensive midfielder to ensure they have two players vying for that role, meaning you cannot rule out the possibility of Amrabat returning.",
      "Elsewhere in midfield, Mason Mount will be hoping to put a forgettable first season at Old Trafford behind him and kick on, but Hannibal Mejbri is in danger of being moved on ahead of his contract expiring next summer. Christian Eriksen is in the same boat and could also depart if a suitor comes calling.",

However, the 26-year-old has never been able to live up to the hype surrounding him when he first signed from Crystal Palace, and it does appear that it's now time for him to move on.",

      "Convincing the 23-year-old to leave a Champions League club will be difficult, although they were able to convince Leny Yoro to join them, despite Lille playing a qualifying tie in August, which will ensure them of a lucrative place in Europe's elite competition.",
      "But if they can sell Wan-Bissaka and have enough money to fund a deal if the player wants to join, then it's a no-brainer for United. Frimpong scored nine goals and provided seven assists, compared to just two assists for Wan-Bissaka last season.",
      "The comparison may not be fair considering how much United as a whole struggled in comparison to Leverkusen enjoying one of the greatest-ever seasons after going unbeaten domestically. But the contrasts are stark, and if Ten Hag's team are going to improve, then adding Frimpong will certainly accelerate that.",

      "Man United winger Jadon Sancho made his first appearance for the club in almost a year against Rangers, but there are no guarantees it will mark a fresh start.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Those who purchased tickets well in advance for Manchester United's trip to Murrayfield Stadium on Saturday would not have expected a sighting of Jadon Sancho to have been included in the admission price.",
      "After patching things up with Erik ten Hag just over a week earlier, Sancho made his first appearance in a United shirt in 329 days in the Scottish capital. He started on the left of United's front three as goals from Amad and Joe Hugill sealed a 2-0 win over Rangers.",
      "For most, the friendly will not live particularly long in the memory. It was a standard pre-season encounter that featured flashes of quality on what was otherwise a fairly chilled-out afternoon north of the border.",
      "The main talking points, whatever the result, were always going to be Leny Yoro's debut and Sancho's return. Those who attended the Edinburgh clash knew they were in with a chance of catching a glimpse of the duo after they were named in the 26-man travelling squad on Saturday morning.",
      "Sancho was left out of the squad that had travelled to Norway for the pre-season opener against Rosenborg a few days earlier but he was still a topic of conversation.",
      "\"As we said, we draw the line,\" said Ten Hag post-match. \"Manchester United need good players and Jadon is a good player. We have drawn that line and we move on.\"",
      "Sancho was banished from United's first-team squad last September after publicly accusing Ten Hag of lying in a social media post. The whole episode extended from Ten Hag revealing after United's 3-1 defeat to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium that the winger had been omitted from the squad due to his performance levels in training.",
      "After refusing to apologise for his actions, Sancho was frozen out. He eventually got the chance to get his career back on track in January, rejoining Borussia Dortmund on loan for the remainder of the season.",
      "Sancho's second stint in Germany was not as impressive as some people would have you believe; he scored three goals and registered three assists in 21 appearances. However, he banked credit for helping Dortmund reach the Champions League final.",
      "As a result of Dortmund's run to the showpiece event at Wembley, which they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid, interest in Sancho started to surface. Dortmund quickly admitted they were keen on signing him for a third time and Juventus have been heavily linked. As of Monday morning, Paris Saint-Germain can now be thrown into the mix.",
      "United entered this summer's transfer window with the intention of selling Sancho and ending what has been an unhappy marriage. Since joining the club three years ago, he has struggled for consistency, scoring just 12 goals in 82 games, and has failed to find his feet under three different managers.",
      "United have plenty of options in the wide areas and Sancho has a lot of fighting to do if he is to become an Old Trafford regular again. Alejandro Garnacho is one of United's most important stars and Amad has earned the right to be given a meaningful crack of the whip this season.",
      "Sancho's appearance at Murrayfield should not suddenly change United's plans; they should still be actively looking to sell him. It is likely he will head to the US on the pre-season tour later this week, but that offers no guarantee he will still be a United player by the time the window shuts.",
      "Ten Hag, according to a colleague, did not speak about Sancho with any warmth after the defeat to Rosenborg, suggesting all might not be as rosy as United make out. The club will want to put Sancho back in the limelight as much as possible to try and drive interest and offers.",
      "In a summer where United need to sell to raise funds, they could bank anywhere between £30million and £40m for Sancho, who can still make up for lost time and previous mistakes. It would be in everyone's best interests to part ways.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Rangers fans would be forgiven for not recognising Amad in the flesh last weekend.",
      "Amad spent the second half of the 2021/22 season on loan with Rangers, but he failed to make an impression at Ibrox Stadium and quietly departed through the back door.",
      "The winger who started against Rangers in a friendly for Manchester United at Murrayfield on Saturday looked like an entirely different player and, just in case their supporters had indeed forgotten who he was, Amad opened the scoring by cutting inside and finding the corner.",
      "Amad produced the only genuine moment of attacking quality in the first half and did brilliantly to create a yard of space before lashing the ball beyond goalkeeper Jack Butland.",
      "Amad was the standout performer for United in the opening 45 minutes - wholesale changes were made at the interval - and had a wide smile, which is now becoming his trademark, when scurrying through the bodies in the corridors of Murrayfield to get on the team bus.",
      "Erik ten Hag was speaking to five Manchester-based reporters when Amad walked past and Jadon Sancho was another to brush past while the United manager was speaking.",
      "Ten Hag had been critical of United after the opening pre-season friendly, but he was content with the victory over Rangers and pleased with Amad's strong performance.",
      "\"As you say, he made a very good progression last season,\" said Ten Hag about Amad. \"The past two seasons he was on loan [with Rangers and Sunderland]. and then he was planned to play a role but he had a very bad injury in pre-season that dropped him a little bit back. But in the last games of the season, he showed his assets. Today, this season has to become his season.\"",
      "Ten Hag was asked whether he sees Amad playing regularly on the right, his preferred position, and replied: \"I think that's his best position, but he's capable of playing a lot of positions like the nine, the 10 or from the left wing. He can play all the offensive positions.\"",
      "Amad might be versatile, but he's most effective when playing on the right and might stake a claim to start in that role when the Premier League season begins on August 16.",
      "The 22-year-old ended last term with a flourish, starting the last three league games, and many believed he was unfortunate to start on the bench in the FA Cup final given his form.",
      "Although a summer break can disrupt a player's momentum, Amad picked up where he left off and there's a feeling that 2024/25 could be his coming-of-age season.",
      "If that proves to be true, Amad will force his way into the starting team and Alejandro Garnacho might be relocated to his favoured position on the left. Garnacho played on the right for the first time against Aston Villa on December 26 and excelled there for the remainder of the season.",
      "Garnacho was brilliant, he scored in the FA Cup final and doesn't deserve to be dropped, so on form, Amad and Garnacho might be the picks to start with Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "That would mean Marcus Rashford would be named on the bench. It still feels like the possibility of Amad and Garnacho starting, with Rashford on the bench, is some way off, but there is an opportunity in the next few weeks of pre-season to sway Ten Hag into a decision.",
      "Rashford wasn't good enough last season, however, Ten Hag is aware of what he's capable of when he's firing and has challenged the forward to return to his best. Whether Rashford can achieve that in the new campaign remains to be seen and Amad could benefit if his slump continues.",
      "United believed they were signing a future star when signing Amad for £19million rising to £37m - a large transfer fee for an 18-year-old who had only played nine times - from Atalanta in 2020 and, a few years after his arrival, he's finally striving to reach his potential at the club.",
      "Amad has taken time to break into the first team and stay there, but the transfer fee he commanded might be considered value at the end of this season if everything goes to plan.",
      "Garnacho was signed for just under £500,000 from Atletico Madrid when he was just a teenager in the summer of 2020 and there's no doubt that fee was a bargain.",
      "Both players could start on the wings next season if everything goes their way.",

      "Real Madrid were thought to be at the forefront of the race to sign Yoro, but they were pipped to the deal after deciding not to match United's bid. It was reported the 18-year-old had his heart set on moving to the Bernabeu and hoped Los Blancos would come back to the table.",
      "However, if this were the case, he has clearly experienced a change of heart, as Yoro has since spoken passionately about being a United player. In an interview with the club's social media channels, the centre-back expressed his delight at moving to the Theatre of Dreams.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "AS Monaco right-back Vanderson has previously admitted he was flattered by links connecting him with a move to Manchester United amid fresh suggestions he could be on the move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to Sky Sports, United have included the Brazilian on a list of options to strengthen at right-back if Aaron Wan-Bissaka is sold this summer. The latter is out of contract in just under a year's time, meaning this summer's window represents United's last chance to cash -in for a respectable fee.",
      "He has been heavily linked with West Ham United and a handful of clubs overseas in recent weeks, such as Galatasaray and AC Milan.",
      "Wan-Bissaka, since resurrecting his United career out of nowhere midway through the 2022/23 campaign, has regularly fought with Diogo Dalot for the right-back berth. However, the former's contract situation means Dalot is poised to start the forthcoming season as United's main right-back.",
      "With less than a year remaining on his current deal, it would make sense for United to offload him and avoid the prospect of losing him for free next summer. The club needs to raise funds via player sales and Wan-Bissaka is a sellable asset.",
      "Amid the prospect of him being offloaded, United would have to source a replacement to directly compete with and provide cover for Dalot. The Reds have a long-standing interest in Jeremie Frimpong and have once again been credited with an interest in Vanderson.",
      "The 23-year-old was regularly linked with a move to Old Trafford throughout last summer's transfer window. Wan-Bissaka's comeback, however, meant there was no need for United to draft in another right-back.",
      "Instead, the Brazilian remained in France and chalked up 23 appearances, scoring three goals in the process. He regularly played as an attack-minded wing-back.",
      "His dribbling capabilities are as his biggest strength, meaning he would give United a completely different dimension down their right side if they were to turn to him this summer. Amid suggestions he is once again on their radar, he admitted last year it was \"great\" to hear of interest from United, plus Barcelona.",

Those transfers have been secured under Ineos, with Dan Ashworth in as sporting director, Jason Wilcox as technical director and Christopher Vivell as interim head of recruitment.",
      "United are now in a position where they need to sell to raise funds, with Ten Hag admitting that is a balancing act as he wants a deeper squad this season to deal with an increase in games, with the Europa League group stage now two matches longer. He also wants more quality in the squad and United are continuing to pursue Matthijs de Ligt, while Manuel Ugarte and Martin Zubimendi are two options for a central midfield role.",

      "Another eight will return to Manchester in the week of the Community Shield and have a decent chance of featuring. New signing Savinho joins those players who were knocked out before the final of the European Championship: Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, Manu, Akanji, Matheus Nunes, Bernardo Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, and Jeremy Doku.",
      "There are another four - Kyle Walker, John Stones, Phil Foden, and Rodri - who went as far as the final with their national teams whose return is yet to be confirmed. They could make it in time for the Community Shield but nobody would be bothered if they took up an offer of extra rest ahead of a gruelling season.",
      "That offers a door into Wembley for some of the young players currently on tour with Guardiola. Whatever else they can get from two weeks of training with the first team, the chance of making the Community Shield squad is a tantalising reward in sight.",
      "Kalvin Phillips could be part of that group if he is still at the club by then, although the midfielder is looking for another move after a disastrous two years at the Etihad. Maximo Perrone, Callum Doyle, and Tom Galvez are all expected to secure loans.",
      "From the rest, holding midfielders Jacob Wright and Mahamadou Susoho are well-placed as cover for Rodri while further up the pitch James McAtee and Micah Hamilton are both hoping to kick on this year. Then there are more wildcard options, from promising playmaker Nico O'Reilly to 16-year-old centre-back Stephen Mfuni.",
      "Guardiola has made it clear that he doesn't hand out appearances in his squad as presents, but there is room for a few youngsters to do enough in the US to earn their place at Wembley.",

Manuel Ugarte, Adrien Rabiot and Sofyan Amrabat are the other players on radar for Erik ten Hag and INEOS behind the scenes.",
      "Signing another forward and bolstering the defensive ranks were United's main priorities this summer. Key figures at Old Trafford have also been doing their research on midfielders, though, with Zubimendi seeing his stock rise on the back of a top campaign for Real Sociedad, which preceded Euro 2024 glory.",
      "Arsenal and Barcelona are also thought to be considering a move the for 25-year-old. In that respect, United have their work cut out, but they are by no means out of the race.",
      "On the proviso he does pitch up at Old Trafford this summer, Zubimendi has the perfect shirt number ready and waiting for him. The midfielder, who is not only technically gifted but possesses defensive qualities, too, has held the No.4 shirt at Sociedad over the last two seasons - previously wearing No.3 in San Sebastián.",
      "As luck would have it, those two options are unassigned at United right now. However, with Matthijs de Ligt also donning those numbers for club and country, there could be an in-house conversation to be had.",
      "For sentimental reasons, Zubimendi might also have his eyes on the No.18 shirt. He was assigned that number for Spain at Euro 2024 - and we unfortunately know how that ended - and it could be freed up at Old Trafford should former Real Madrid powerhouse Casemiro move on.",
      "Other shirt numbers currently available include No.9, No.13, No.19, No.26, No.27, No.30, No.31 and No.32.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Not a transfer window goes by without Manchester United needing to strengthen up the engine room. It was not their main priority this summer but, with four options in the pipeline, there is an ever-increasing demand to provide more company for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and co.",
      "United have splashed out a calculated £90million-plus on Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee so far this summer, aiming to improve their squad for the present and future, with further centre-back additions wanted on the proviso Ineos can find a new home for unwanted first-teamers. Sales will also help their search for a midfielder.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands United are monitoring Martin Zubimendi amid interest from other top clubs including Arsenal and Barcelona. Discussions over a move for PSG's Manuel Ugarte have also been held, while free agent Adrien Rabiot has resurfaced as a potential option, while United could yet decide to sign Sofyan Amrabat on a permanent deal.",
      "Of course, he was on loan at Old Trafford last season and United held an option (not obligation) to make that deal permanent despite the Moroccan World Cup hero already returning to Fiorentina. A presumably four-way decision, then, with pros and cons to each option - and Zubimendi somewhat a wildcard choice.",
      "While the 25-year-old is well-known in European circles, to the casual follower his emergence has been relatively recent. He produced a fine cameo during the Euro 2024 showpiece win over England - after being given the tough task of replacing injured Manchester City talisman Rodri at half-time - and helped Spain coast past the finishing line.",
      "In doing so, he underlined a technical prowess, defensive solidity and tactical awareness that makes him a worthy target for United, Arsenal, Barcelona and others. United might be up against it to win the race for his signature, but a dream engine room for next season is the golden ticket they could win amid uncertainty over Casemiro.",
      "His decline last season was rather significant. It means the Brazilian is by no means certain to stay put.",
      "Academy graduate Mainoo and Fernandes are certain starters. Casemiro, Scott McTominay and Mason Mount are three in-house options for that third spot in the line up, but competition and cover is needed and a clever transfer, such as Zubimendi or those mentioned above, could offer United a different dimension to unlock their main players.",

      "Bellingham's impressive tally of 23 goals across all competitions was instrumental in driving Real Madrid to both the league title and European glory, establishing himself as one of football's preeminent stars. Yet, only a year ago, his future was the subject of speculation, with clubs from around Europe circling Dortmund's Westfalenstadion in the hope they could get their clutches on England’s biggest star.",
      "Manchester United were among those fighting for his signature, with Ten Hag desperate to fill the void left by Paul Pogba's departure the previous year. In a rare public display by a manager at the top level, Ten Hag openly expressed his desire to land Bellingham in April 2023.",
      "When prompted by a fan outside United's training ground to sign Kylian Mbappe and Bellingham, he responded with a smile, saying: \"Why not?\" before driving off.",
      "That was despite Bellingham openly rejecting United in a video uploaded on social media just a month prior. The Euro 2024 superstar was asked: “Are you gonna come Man U?” while taking a photo with a fan, before chuckling and responding: \"No. Don't be silly.\"",

      "United have travelled overseas during pre-season since Sir Alex Ferguson's reign - aside from when Covid restrictions didn't allow it - and the Reds have received incredible support everywhere they have travelled.",
      "There have been trips to nearby Scotland and Ireland, and longer haul journies to Scandinavia, Asia and North America. Arranging pre-season fixtures around the world gives United's global following an opportunity to see the team in the flesh but they are also commercially lucrative.",
      "The Premier League's elite sides have made regular trips to the United States in recent years and United will visit Los Angeles, San Diego and Columbia this summer.",
      "Erik ten Hag oversaw United's pre-season preparation in the States last year and named a 31-man travelling squad, which included Kobbie Mainoo, Omari Forson and Dan Gore.",
      "Mainoo became a first-team star in the following season. Gore was given his senior debut in September and Forson was handed his senior bow in January, which showed that the youngsters included on the USA tour in 2023 were highly regarded by Ten Hag and his staff.",
      "The crop of youngsters selected for the first-team squad for an overseas tour is usually a strong indicator of the manager's plans and it will be fascinating to see which academy players make the cut this summer.",
      "United have been at the forefront of youth development for decades and they continue to produce talent. Alejandro Garnacho and Mainoo are the most recent success stories from the youth set-up and it's understood academy staff are confident more senior debuts will follow.",
      "The milestone of the 250th player from United's academy to make a first-team debut was reached last season and that was a magnificent achievement worth celebrating.",
      "Ethan Wheatley's name was written into the club's history books when he became the 250th graduate thanks to his cameo from the bench against Sheffield United in April. The young striker replaced Rasmus Hojlund in that game and savoured every minute on the pitch.",
      "After the match, Wheatley spoke to MUTV and he had to fight the smile on his face while he answered questions. \"It's a great club with a massive history, especially in the academy. It's an honour to make my debut and that number - 250. That's a little bit extra,\" he said.",
      "\"I was just excited and when I got the call [to come on], there were a bit of nerves, but as soon as I was stripped and ready to go I was excited and did my best for the team.\"",
      "Wheatley was given the nickname '250' by his teammates in the academy and his debut capped a whirlwind 24 hours, in which he also fired the Under-18s to a trophy.",
      "On the day before Wheatley's senior debut at Old Trafford, he scored a first-half brace for the U18s in a cup final against rivals Manchester City at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "Wheatley was substituted at half-time so he could be involved with the first team the next day. Wayne Rooney was in attendance at Leigh and the United legend would have enjoyed what he saw, as Wheatley's goals were smartly taken and they were enough to win the trophy.",
      "There is more to come from Wheatley, who has already looked sharp in pre-season, and he's got an excellent chance of being included in the touring squad of the USA.",
      "The same can be said about Toby Collyer. The midfielder had the privilege of wearing the captain's armband in the second half of the opening pre-season clash against Rosenborg and there have been a few clues along his journey that suggest he's well regarded by Ten Hag.",
      "Collyer was named on the bench eight times last season and although he didn't make the squad for the FA Cup final, he travelled to Wembley and was on the pitch at the final whistle.",
      "Once the initial celebrations died down, Ten Hag was spotted in deep conversation with Collyer and he had a similar moment with Mainoo after the Carabao Cup final in 2023.",
      "Whether Collyer can have the impact in the first team Mainoo did remains to be seen - the Stockport-born youngster is an exceptional prospect and was superb for England at Euro 2024 - but it seemed significant that Ten Hag took extra time to speak to him.",
      "There was a further clue when Collyer was rewarded with a new deal in July that extended his stay until 2027 and Ten Hag insisted on attending his contract signing.",
      "A club source said Ten Hag 'really likes' Collyer, who is yet to make his senior debut, and it's highly likely he will be included in the pre-season travelling squad.",
      "United lost their opening friendly against Rosenorg 1-0 and Ten Hag was scathing with criticism after the game, but he couldn't be disappointed with the performance of Radek Vitek.",
      "Vitek travelled to America last summer and could fly across the pond again, despite United having Andre Onana, Tom Heaton and Altay Bayindir in their goalkeeping ranks.",
      "The 20-year-old stands at a towering 6ft 6ins and he made an outstanding impression against Rosenborg, making multiple key saves and delivering a man-of-the-match display.",
      "Vitek performed like Peter Schmeichel in his prime and was only denied a clean sheet, which he deserved, in the final minutes when Rosenborg scored with an unstoppable effort.",
      "Vitek spent last term on loan with Accrington Stanley and that spell was considered a huge success due to the experience he gained and the volume of matches he played, but he's expected to play in a higher division next season and perhaps a Championship loan could come next.",
      "The young 'keeper was brilliant in the successful FA Youth Cup campaign of 2021/22 - Mainoo and Garnacho were in that team - and seems like a prospect worth keeping an eye on.",
      "Elsewhere, Harry Amass has a chance of making the USA squad after a superb season with the U18s, who won a stunning treble and claimed two of those trophies at the expense of City.",
      "Amass took part in first-team training in February when he was just 16 years old and he signed his first professional contract a month later when he celebrated his birthday.",
      "The left-back signed for United from Watford in 2023. Amass is considered one of the most exciting talents in English football and, although he still has scope to develop physically, Ten Hag trusted him enough to include him in matchday squads at the end of last season.",
      "A young player who has an outside chance of making the squad is Jack Fletcher, the talented son of former United player Darren Fletcher, who is now part of Ten Hag's coaching staff.",
      "Sources at United believe Fletcher has first-team potential and while his progress was briefly delayed last season due to an injury, he's now back to full fitness again.",
      "United's tour of the USA is upon us and fans should closely follow which youngsters are included. They could be starring for the first team before you know it.",

      "The 16-year-old made headlines in April after netting seven goals in a stunning 9-0 victory for the Gunners' under-18s team. Obi-Martin scored 32 goals in total at U18s level for Arsenal, including five against West Ham United, four against Crystal Palace and another four against Fulham.",
      "In achieving this, Obi-Martin has surpassed Folarin Balogun's record of most goals scored for Arsenal U18s in a season, previously set at 25 during the 2018/19 campaign. And the Athletic reports that United are exploring a deal with the player said to have visited United’s Carrington training facilities earlier this week. Manchester City are also said to be interested.",
      "The teenager, who also managed to score an impressive ten goals in a 14-3 victory over Liverpool's under-16s back in November, has represented Arsenal in UEFA Youth League matches against Sevilla and Lens, and has made two substitute appearances at Premier League 2 level.",
      "Born in 2007 in Glostrup, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, the Danish youngster moved to the UK as a teenager. He has represented both England and Denmark's national teams at youth level and is also eligible to play for Nigeria, reports football.london.",
      "However, it currently seems more likely that he will represent Denmark, having recently scored ten times in 14 games for their Under-17s, including four in a 6-2 win against Norway.",
      "International head coach Jesper Mikkelsen, spoke to Bold (via Tribal Football) and outlined the extraordinary abilities of the Arsenal forward. \"Right now he is really dominant because of his physique, but I don't think that is the only reason,\" claimed Mikkelsen.",
      "\"His greatest characteristic and challenge is that he really wants to score goals.\"",
      "He added that this focus on goal-scoring could be a double-edged sword: \"When I say it can also be a disadvantage, I mean that he can sometimes play his own game. He is very searching for chances, where he forgets that you also have to play with the others.\"",
      "Whether Obi-Martin decides to stick with Denmark or switches allegiance to England or Nigeria, his recent impressive exploit would only ignite further interest in his potential. Arsenal's legend Ian Wright recently sang the young player's praises, noting: \"Chido Obi-Martin, he's 15, honestly, he's like 6 foot 2, he looks really quick.\"",

      "Manchester United sporting director Dan Ashworth has insisted \"delivering a successful women's team\" ranks highly on his priority list, despite the club having recently come under fire for their treatment of Marc Skinner's side.",
      "The Reds finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL) last term, missing out on European qualification and winning just 10 of their 22 league games. A number of high-profile players, including England goalkeeper Mary Earps and captain Katie Zelem, have left the club this summer, while co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy when he admitted plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "Fan frustration was further compounded when it emerged Skinner's side were set to be moved out of their state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate the men's team while a £50m refurbishment of their Carrington facilities was underway. However, the long-awaited arrival of Ashworth from Newcastle could be exactly what United Women need to progress next term.",
      "Addressing the Carrington revamp in an open letter to supporters on Monday, Ashworth said: \"There are also changes to the physical environment at Carrington as work commences on our season-long £50 million redevelopment of the training ground – evidence of our commitment to improving the club’s infrastructure.",
      "“This will require some adaptation this season, but all our teams – men’s, women’s and academy – will maintain access to high-quality facilities, with the promise of a fully refreshed, world-class site once the project is completed.\"",
      "On his vision for Skinner's side, Ashworth added: “Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas. Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",
      "“Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",
      "While Ashworth's priority will almost certainly be changing the fortunes of Erik Ten Hag's side, the 53-year-old has long been an advocate for investing in women's football and could be the spark United require to reignite their commitment to Skinner and his players.",
