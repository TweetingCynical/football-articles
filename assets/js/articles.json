      "Sir Mo Farah's name will always be mentioned as one of Team GB's all-time legends at the Olympic Games. He won two gold medals in London in 2012 and two more at the Rio De Janeiro games four years later, captivating the sporting world on his way to a knighthood in 2017, where Queen Elizabeth II made him a Sir.",
      "He will be wearing an England shirt with 'Farah' emblazoned on the back when he steps onto the Old Trafford pitch for Soccer Aid this weekend. Yet, the name on the Three Lions shirt, the name that was pinned onto his running vest and the name next to his many records is not really his.",
      "In 2022, as part of the eye-opening BBC documentary 'The Real Mo Farah', the athlete revealed his name was not 'Mo Farah' and that he had been living under somebody else's identity.",
      "Farah, 42, revealed his real name was Hussein Abdi Kahin. When he was only four years old, Farah, who was originally from Somaliland, lost his father, who was killed while tending to his cattle by a piece of shrapnel from a bazooka blast during Somalia's civil war.",
      "After being sent to neighbouring Djibouti for his safety, Farah would eventually be illegally trafficked into the United Kingdom. A woman, whose identity is still unknown, pretended to be his mother and brought him to the UK under the premise that he would be staying with family.",
      "He was instructed to come into the country under the name Mo Farah - who was a different child - and was handed illegal documents. This dangerous process went through while he was only nine years old. He realised he had taken someone else's place at the airport when he saw a man wondering why his child had not arrived.",
      "When he got to the woman's flat, she tore up a piece of paper with his family's contact details on it and ordered him to look after the children of another family. He told the BBC: \"If I wanted food in my mouth, my job was to look after those kids, shower them, cook for them, clean for them. She said, 'If you ever wanna see your family again, don’t say anything.' Often I would just lock myself in the bathroom and cry.\"",
      "At the age of 11, Farah enrolled into Feltham Community College. Teachers and other staff at the school were told he was a refugee from Somalia. His form tutor Sarah Rennie said Farah was, \"unkempt and uncared for\" and \"emotionally and culturally alienated,\" largely due to the lack of English he spoke.",
      "It was during PE lessons when the teachers realised he was an athletics prodigy. Alan Watkinson, Farah's PE teacher, said: \"The only language he seemed to understand was the language of PE and sport.\"",
      "Watkinson would go on to contact social services who managed to find another family from Somalia to foster him. Mr Watkinson helped him gain British citizenship under the name Mohamed Farah, which was granted in 2000.",
      "From that point onwards, Farah developed as a person and an athlete, going on to become a four-time Olympic gold medallist and a six-time world champion. When Farah was sent away, he had to leave his mother Aisha and two brothers, who all live on a farm in Somaliland.",
      "Farah met his now-wife Tania Nell while at university in West London. Together they have four children, Rhianna, Hussein Mo, Amani and Aisha Farah.",
      "Incredibly, in the documentary, Farah also met the real Mohamed Farah over a video call. However, The Sun claimed the athlete had to break contact with him and change his phone number, after he was allegedly hounded for money by the man and around ten others who had got hold of his number.",

The pair of Red Devils legends are among a number of famous faces from the Sir Alex Ferguson era who will return to Old Trafford on Sunday evening to raise money for Unicef through a friendly kickabout.",
      "And while Scholes and Vidic worked brilliantly alongside one another during their Premier League glory days, they will be playing for separate teams at Soccer Aid. Scholes is representing England with Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Gary Neville, while Vidic will play for the World XI with the likes of John O'Shea, Carlos Tevez and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "Despite coming across as a fun-filled spectacle between former players and celebrities, Scholes may head into the fray a little anxious if his past comments on Vidic are anything to go by. That's because the Serbian national was one of the many hard-men in Manchester United's ranks during his playing days.",
      "Speaking to the UTD podcast about what Vidic was like as a team-mate, the 50-year-old said: \"I was fairly good at tackling. It was all calculated. I was just getting people back. That’s all I was doing.",
      "\"I never instigated. If someone got me, there’s a chance I’d get them back. Vida [Vidic] had some tackles in the box, he could be a lunatic.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn’t play as a centre half in five-a-side. He was one of those defenders that thought he could play a bit as a No. 10. You know what I mean?",
      "\"When you get to a five-a-side a he does anything but play in his position, ‘Give it to me’ all that stuff. But when it came to a game he would head and kick everything.",
      "\"In training he could be a bit moody and a nuisance in the box especially but a great centre half. He was perfect for English football. He could head the ball, tackle, he was great, a really good player.\"",
      "After forming a formidable partnership with Rio Ferdinand quickly after arriving at Old Trafford in 2006, Vidic made 300 appearances for the Red Devils. He lifted five Premier League titles, three League Cups and a Champions League. Vidic left United in 2014 to play for Inter Milan, before calling time on an illustrious career in January 2016.",
      "Scholes, meanwhile, spent the entirety of his professional footballing career with United, racking up 155 goals and 82 assists from 716 games primarily as a central-midfielder. Alongside Vidic, he is part of a wealth of household names who will play at Soccer Aid on Sunday from content creators like Morgan Burtwhistle (AKA AngryGinge) to fellow athletes like Sir Mo Farah and Tony Bellew.",
      "Football fans can catch all of the action live on ITV1 and ITVX from 6pm onwards. Kick-off is slated for 7:30pm.",

      "Arsenal have reportedly paused their pursuit of Viktor Gyokeres, despite the striker rejecting a move to Manchester United in favour of the Gunners. Mikel Arteta is keen to sign a new goalscorer and has told fans to expect a \"big summer\" in the transfer market.",
      "\"It's going to be a big one and we are very excited about it,\" Arteta said earlier this year. \"The way we planned the five first summers, they were going to be very big and they were going to have different objectives because the turnaround of players and the objective of those windows was going to be different.",
      "\"But now when you are going to go again, we want to increase the depth of the squad but as well we want to increase the quality and the skills that we need to go to the next step.\"",
      "And Gyokeres had emerged as their top attacking target, having scored 97 goals in 102 games since joining Sporting in 2023. United were also interested in the 27-year-old, but he informed them that he did not want to join as he would rather sign for a club in the Champions League.",
      "However, Portuguese outlet Record are now reporting that Arsenal have 'frozen' their pursuit of Gyokeres‌ due to Sporting's asking price. It is claimed that Sporting rejected an initial offer of €55million (£47m) plus an additional €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons.",
      "Arsenal are then said to have proposed a total package worth around €70m (£60m), but Sporting want the player's £85m release clause to be met. \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me,\" Sporting president Frederico Varandas said.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has said that Manchester United should look to finish in the top six to eight of the Premier League next season. The Red Devils will be eager to quickly forget 2024/25, given they finished a dismal 15th in the league and failed to achieve silverware both domestically and in Europe.",
      "And while many managers may have had their future thrown into question given the lacklustre campaign, Ruben Amorim - who was only appointed in November following the sacking of Erik ten Hag - has seemingly been given the benefit of the doubt by the board.",
      "The Portuguese tactician was forced to work with a mismatched squad that he inherited when he entered Old Trafford. And, following Ten Hag's spending spree on the likes of Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Light inlast summer, limited funds were available in January for Amorim to start his own rebuilding project.",
      "There were also fears of failing PSR regulations if they continued to spend frivolously. As a result, Amorim was only able to bring in Patrick Dorgu from Lecce for £25.1million, as well as Arsenal youngster Ayden Heaven in a deal thought to be around the £1m mark.",
      "However, it appears as though Amorim will be backed by the board this summer to recruit suitable players for his system, with United already splurging £62.5m on Matheus Cunha from Wolves in the early transfer window.",
      "\"I don't think you should be looking outside of that. And that's from someone who only thought about winning the league at United. So it's a big come-down in that sense.\"",
      "Ferdinand also agreed that Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Project 150 plans were a little far-fetched at present. The INEOS chair and Red Devils minority shareholder had initially planned to see his club win the league by 2028 in line with its 150th anniversary, but the stark reality is that Amorim may need more time than that to work his magic and slowly but surely build United back to the Premier League giants they were under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "While an insider told the Mirror back in March that Amorim \"felt he could get more from the current squad when he came in,\" they added: \"There’s no getting away from the fact that overall it’s been a really tough watch - and that it’s going to take a lot of time and patience to get the team to where they should be. You’ve got to be brave or foolish to think winning the league by 2028 is doable from where United currently are.\"",
      "This, coupled with continually growing rivals in terms of talent, may force Ratcliffe to abandon his ambitious Project 150 plans altogether as United plan for a less turbulent future. It comes as Ferdinand recently launched his Career Transfer Hub with Talking Futures, with hopes of bridging the gap between teenagers and parents for planning their own futures.",
      "Speaking about the initiative, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents. I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time. So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch the Career Transfer Hub – giving parents access to information on their child’s education options just like football agents have transfer insiders, negotiation teams and career scouts. You can find out more here.",

      "The 25-year-old enjoyed his most prolific campaign to date under Thomas Frank this season, having arrived in west London from French side Troyes six years ago for a then-club record fee of £5.8million. Fast forward to this transfer window, and he's the subject of bids exceeding £55m from both the Red Devils and Spurs.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side looked all set to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo earlier this month, with reports suggesting he had 'prioritised' a move to Old Trafford, and personal terms would be no issue. However, his former boss Frank's move from the west of the capital to the north threw a spanner in United's works.",
      "The Danish head coach has replaced Europa League-winning boss Ange Postecoglou at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and it seems he wishes to bring Mbeumo along with him.",
      "Spurs have now risen to the ascendency in securing Mbeumo's signature, tabling a £70m bid, £15m more than the £55m figure United had rejected, and reports suggest that the player is now 'more open' to staying in London. Comments made by the 25-year-old last May also give Frank's new side the edge.",
      "Interest from top sides in Mbeumo can be traced back to the summer of 2024, when, after a campaign that saw him muster a respectable nine league goals, Liverpool and Newcastle came sniffing.",
      "Mbeumo issued a response to rumours linking him with the Premier League's finest, and told L'Equipe: \"I have spent five years at Brentford, at a club that has allowed me to grow and pass a milestone but yes, I would like to play in the biggest competitions, at the best clubs. It is tantalising to see some big clubs interested in me.\"",
      "The winger ultimately stayed put at the Gtech Community Stadium last summer. However, his comments regarding playing in the biggest and best competitions arguably throw weight behind Tottenham's bid in the current battle for his signature.",
      "While Amorim's United will be without European football next term, having finished the season in a lowly 15th, Spurs will grace the Champions League.",
      "They bested the Red Devils 1-0 in the Europa League final, ending a 17-year wait for silverware and qualifying them for UEFA's elite club competition. Yet, while Mbeumo clarified that playing in a tournament like the Champions League is an aim, he added the caveat that he would like to do so for the 'best clubs.'",
      "Not only did United finish slightly higher than Spurs in the Premier League this season, but they are also historically superior, having lifted a joint record 20 top-flight league titles, among countless other accolades that Tottenham have not.",
      "Mbeumo himself has dropped few hints as to which side he would prefer, though a post on Instagram when it was announced that head coach Frank would be departing made for telling viewing.",
      "The 25-year-old uploaded pictures of himself and Frank, captioned only with two prayer emojis, perhaps alluding to a desire to reunite, or maybe just wishing his former boss good luck.",
      "Either way, it seems the pull of Champions League football and the prospect of playing under the coach who mentored him into stardom could give Tottenham the advantage in this bidding war, though United still cannot be ruled out.",

      "However, having decided to part ways with Lille at the season's close, Gomes has now put pen to paper with Marseille.",
      "On Thursday, the Ligue 1 side announced on Instagram that they had secured an agreement with Gomes, set to join the club when the transfer window reopens later this month. His former United colleagues, Rashford and Greenwood, showed their support by liking the post.",

      "In a recent interview with The Athletic, Marseille midfielder Adrien Rabiot hailed Greenwood as an incredible player.",
      "The French star heaped praise on him, declaring: \"Mason is an incredible player,\" and went on to say, \"If he hadn't had all of his problems, I think he'd have an image like [Jude] Bellingham. Mason would be the star.\"",
      "He continued to extol Mason's virtues, stating, \"He's an exceptional player. He can score with his right foot and his left foot, he has an exceptional shot, he can dribble.\"",
      "Expressing gratitude for having such talent in the team, he added, \"We're very lucky to have him. When he's really focused, he does really great things.\"",

      "Bayer Leverkusen are weighing up a bid for Manchester City youngster James McAtee - who has previously been linked with Manchester United. Erik ten Hag is now in charge at the German outfit and will have to replace Florian Wirtz.",
      "The playmaker is closing in on a £116million switch to Liverpool, which will leave the Bundesliga outfit with cash to spend and a sizeable void that needs filling. They have identified the City playmaker as an individual who could bolster their squad, reports Sky Germany.",
      "McAtee has enjoyed some impressive moments in a City shirt, but is still very much establishing himself under Pep Guardiola, who is known for taking his time when integrating young players into his system. The recent signings may also push him down the pecking order.",
      "He scored an FA Cup hat-trick several months ago and has also contributed in the Premier League. One of those keen on McAtee are the Red Devils. Selling direct to the Old Trafford outfit would prove a hugely controversial move however.",
      "As a result it could open the door for the club's former manager, Ten Hag, to swoop in with City likely to favour selling him abroad if they did have to part with the player.",
      "Guardiola admits he wants to keep the 22-year-old, but would understand his desire to play regularly. He said in April: “For the age, I’d like him to stay. But I understand players want more minutes. He can play different positions but I don’t know how the squad will be and we will see.”",
      "City have seen Cole Palmer flourish since leaving the Etihad. He headed to Chelsea where he knew he'd play regularly and saw his career blossom - which may factor in McAtee's thinking. Conversely, Phil Foden's patience in Manchester was richly rewarded.",
      "Another factor at play is that McAtee’s contract expires in 2026 - leaving the City hierarchy to either hand him a new deal or cash in before he becomes a free agent. The Manchester club have bought and sold well in recent years, meaning they have toed the PSR line well.",
      "McAtee may also see Leverkusen as an ideal destination given how the likes of Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham have excelled in Germany. The Bundesliga outfit can also offer Champions League football.",

      "Ekitike, 22, the France Under-21 international has also been attracting the attention of Liverpool after scoring 22 goals for the German club last season. But Frankfurt’s £80million valuation of the former Paris St Germain forward will have to be lowered significantly before United table a bid.",
      "Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta has made it his mission to add more goals to Mikel Arteta ’s squad next season.",
      "The Gunners have drawn up a shortlist that also includes RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Atletico Madrid’s former Manchester City forward Julian Alvarez. Berta met with Sporting director of football Bernardo Palmeiro in Menorca last week to discuss Gyokeres.",
      "The former Coventry striker has scored an impressive 97 goals in 102 games in Portugal. And with Bayern Munich now registering an interest in Slovakian International Sesko and Argentine World Cup winner Alvarez settled in Spain, it appears that Gyokeres ticks a lot of boxes.",
      "One major issue is that the player’s agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, has become embroiled in an ugly war of words with Sporting president Frederico Varandas.",
      "Cetinkaya insists he has a written guarantee from the Sporting chief promising to do a deal with any club offering £59million. Varandas has countered by claiming that while he did make a verbal agreement to sell Gyokeres for less than the £84.7million get-out clause stipulated in his contract he is yet to set a valuation.",
      "Now Varandas is threatening to impose the full terms of the buy-out after being angered further by a threat that Gyokeres could go on strike to force through a sale.",
      "The row is further complicated by Cetinkaya’s revelation that Sporting will have to pay him almost £6million if they reject an official bid of £51million up front and £8million in add-ons.",
      "But according to sources close to Sporting, they have told coach Rui Borges to prepare for the next season without his top goalscorer and have started the process of recruiting a replacement.",
      "There has also been confirmation from Portugal that Coventry will get a 10 percent cut of any fee that Sporting generate from selling Gyokeres. The Sky Blues had originally negotiated a 15 percent concession as part of the deal that took the Swede to Lisbon for £20million two seasons ago.",
      "But they accepted a payment of £843,500 last year to reduce their entitlement.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Their pursuit of the sought-after Cameroon star, 25, has been complicated by Tottenham, though, with Thomas Frank keen to make Mbeumo his marquee summer signing after swapping Brentford for Tottenham earlier this week.",
      "And while Mbeumo wants to join Manchester United ahead of all others this summer, ESPN report that the club will not exceed a certain price point for the former Troyes man and that they have alternative targets in mind.",

      "Semenyo has also had a fine season, registering 11 goals and five assists in the Premier League. Intriguingly, the Ghana international is also of interest to Spurs.",
      "Bournemouth are thought to value Semenyo at around £70m, though they may not need to cash in on another of their top-tier talents with Dean Huijsen already sold and Milos Kerkez and Illya Zabarnyi likely to follow in the coming weeks.",
      "While United have alternative targets in mind, they are expected to try and push through a deal for Mbeumo given the player has made no secret of his desire to make the move.",

      "Arsenal and United are both in the market for more firepower, with the former understood to be targeting either Gyokeres or Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",

      "It feels a long time ago that the Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United began with a bang at Portman Road.",
      "Barley two minutes in and Marcus Rashford had scored for the Reds at Ipswich and prompted plenty to wonder whether he might prove the striker beneficiary in the central role in Amorim's set-up.",
      "Within a matter of months, Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa and he has no future at United. The decision to cast him aside is ultimately one for Amorim and it will likely still provoke debate while United continue to struggle in front of goal.",
      "His expected departure would also see the end of a two-decade association for Rashford at United, having first joined the club aged seven.",
      "The Reds have almost always had young English talent in their side and more often than not those players are local lads who have come through the ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "Sometimes the talent comes from further afield but a look down some of the greatest players in the club's rich history includes plenty schooled in the ways of United and born and raised in the city.",
      "Yet just now that path is, if not empty, certainly sparse. United didn't have a single player in the last England squad and they don't have a representative in the England Under-21 squad currently competing in the European Championships.",
      "And two prospective transfers this summer could see the prospective numbers drop further. United are keen to move Rashford on this summer. His fellow academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo could follow.",
      "The midfielder was an England regular 12 months ago, playing in the European Championships having ended a breakthrough campaign at United with a goal in the FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "But little over a year on, a combination of injury, form and Ruben Amorim's seeming uncertainty in knowing exactly where Mainoo should play, has led to him dropping down the pecking order.",
      "United's need to sell players to fund a squad overhaul also places Mainoo at risk, given as an academy graduate he would represent pure profit for the football accountants. There is no certainty the midfielder is sold this summer, but neither is there a guarantee he remains. And the fact that contract talks have stalled on a new deal only muddies the waters further.",
      "If Mainoo does depart, then United will not only lose a talented young footballer, they'll lose another part of their identity.",
      "Rashford and Mainoo represent the pathway at United, from growing up in the city to growing into first team regulars. If both departed that baton would fall to Tyler Fredricson, who made his first senior appearances last season but is still in the early stages of his development.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Harry Amass and Toby Collyer have all made the breakthrough into the first team as young English players but all arrived at United late on in their junior development.",
      "Mason Mount, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw are the senior English professionals at the club while Tom Heaton came through the United ranks before making his way in the game elsewhere prior to rejoining in the autumn of his career.",
      "Part of United's make-up is the local boys done good. The Reds have plenty of promise in their academy and a recent trend for recruiting talented teenagers from at home and abroad shows that promoting and investing in youth remains a part of the modus operandi, but it's home where the heart is. United have to make sure they don't lose theirs."

      "The Frenchman has been linked with Manchester United in recent days as the Reds step up their striker search, while Chelsea and Liverpool have also been credited with an interest. Arsenal are similarly seeking a striker with goal-getters at the top of plenty of shopping lists.",
      "Ekitike shops for goals and clothes. “I’m interested in fashion and I follow trends, but I used to be much more into it,\" he said, speaking to Frankfurt's website earlier this season. \"I only think about football now – I don’t have time for anything else.",
      "\"I don’t really have a particular style – it changes every time. Sometimes I go for streetwear, sometimes I go classy, and sometimes I dress more extravagantly.\"",
      "Ekitike broke through at hometown club Reims in France and his form quickly attracted PSG, who secured his services for €35million after an initial loan. Aged just 20, Ekitike found himself competing for a strating spot in a star studded frontline that included Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar.",
      "Perhaps unsurprisingly minutes were tough to come by and he made only 12 league starts for the Parisians. A loan to Frankfurt followed, a move which became permanent and where Ekitike has flourished.",
      "That rise is down to talent and hard work but also the lessons learned from being on the fringes in Paris.",
      "\"At the time, I didn't see things like that because I wanted to play.",
      "\"I'm always on a quest to learn. I have a thirst for learning. I realised that at the end of the day, I'd maybe spent a year, a year and a half watching the best players in the world go through their paces in training and even in matches. Sometimes up close, sometimes a little further away.\"",
      "His form at Frankfurt has catapulted him into conversations of Europe's best strikers. He plundered 22 goals last term to help the club to a third place finish and a Champions League place.",
      "Ekitike has five goals in five games for France Under-21s and a senior call is surely not far away. Whatever the summer holds for the talented frontman, his work etic and outlook won't change.",
      "\"Everything moves fast in football,\" he added. \"You're (up) there, then you're (down) there very quickly. What I'm trying to show is that I'm constantly progressing, that it's linear and that I'm continuing to climb.",
      "\"I was young and I climbed quickly, even though I had a lot of things to learn and store up, but that's how it happened.",

      "\"He was a player with lots of speed and a good technique with the ball, he was a quick dribbler,\" Zermatten added. \"He knew very well the game, he had good vision. He was intelligent. He could change position. Now it is 10 years on but he always wanted to win.\"",

Or will he be a back-up further forward. That looks his natural habitat but he has the capabilities and the intelligence to play deeper.",

      "There are some ongoing changes at Manchester United that most fans won't notice.",
      "The revised transfer strategy of signing talented youngsters falls into that category. United have always signed young players to add to their academy, but the profile of targets has evolved.",
      "Sekou Kone (19) was signed from Mali, Diego Leon (18) has been scouted from Paraguay, while Enzo Kana-Biyik (18) is set to arrive on a free transfer from the renowned academy of French club Le Havre AC.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Chido Obi, James Overy, Samuel Lusale and Harley Emsden-James have also been lured to Manchester with the promise of a pathway to first-team football at Old Trafford.",
      "Heaven and Obi have already broken into the senior squad. Ruben Amorim gave opportunities to both players last season and they will be used as a shining example to future targets.",
      "United's transfer strategy has become interesting, although it could be argued they are simply catching up with the times. Premier League rivals have cast their nets around the globe to sign young players with high ceilings, some of whom will never make a first-team appearance in England.",
      "Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have been a huge factor and some Premier League clubs are buying young players with the intention of making a profit on their sale in a few years' time.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Chelsea signed Angelo Gabriel from Santos for £13million. They immediately sent him on loan and sold him to a Saudi Arabian club for £19.4m the following summer.",
      "Around a similar time, Newcastle signed Yankuba Minteh from OB for £5.9m. Minteh joined Feyenoord on loan and was flipped to Brighton for £30m in the following summer.",
      "Angelo and Minteh didn't make an appearance for Chelsea and Newcastle. Such transfers have become common to work within PSR rules, despite being against the essence of football.",
      "United sources would deny that young players are being signed to be 'flipped', but the reality is that not every signing will make the grade and some will be sold for profit down the line.",
      "Club sources stress that each young signing in the last 18 months has been made because they have first-team potential, however, that does not guarantee they will make a senior debut.",
      "The transfers are essentially low risk and high reward. For example, United signed Kone for around £1m for Guidars FC and the young midfielder arrived in Manchester with a huge upside.",
      "The best-case scenario is that Kone breaks into the first-team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "Similar signings were made by the previous regime, but they have increased since Ineos gained control of football operations. Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "The club's network of scouts present reports on young players and Kone was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "After following Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where he featured as one of the players of the tournament.",
      "It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",
      "Deals to sign Obi, Overy and Lusale were also arranged last summer. United became aware that Obi wanted to leave Arsenal and was about to join a European club after visiting their training ground.",
      "Nick Cox (head of the academy), Luke Fedderenko (head of academy recruitment), Stephen Ajewole (lead scout) and Sam Williams (lead scout) all played a huge role in signing Obi from Arsenal.",
      "Overy (18) attracted interest from other Premier League clubs but he signed for United, while Lusale (17) was signed from Crystal Palace, and they both went into the U18 squad.",
      "The signing of Emsden-James, 16, from Southampton this summer is similar to those deals. The centre-back will join up with the U18s in 2024/2025 and still has a long way to progress to make a first-team debut.",
      "It will be fascinating to see how United handle Kone, Leon and Kana-Biyik ahead of 2025/2026.",
      "Kone could leave on loan after being given time to find his feet in England, but Leon might be kept within the building so he can adapt to his new surroundings after leaving South America.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in early January and the defender signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year.",
      "It's understood United agreed a £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno and Leon continued to play in Paraguay with a view to moving to Manchester this summer.",
      "United are expected to formally announce the arrivals of Leon and Kana-Biyik. The latter is joining from Le Havre on a free transfer and only a few regulatory steps remain for him to complete his move.",
      "The highly-regarded Kana-Biyik is a natural striker and he scored nine goals in 16 appearances for the French club's Under-19s last season, while also training with their first-team.",
      "Kana-Biyik has been linked with an immediate loan move to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport, but it's understood that no loan plan has been confirmed for the incoming French youngster.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",
      "The role of Matt Hargreaves as director of football negotiations should also be noted. Hargreaves has a large responsibility for transfers and contracts at Old Trafford, and is known to be an excellent operator.",
      "Representatives have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",
      "Hargreaves does exactly what his job title says on the tin and will continue to try to obtain value during negotiations this summer, wherever that may be found across the world."

      "The Serbian defender was known for his robust style and no-nonsense approach during his stint at United. Previously speaking to the UTD podcast about what Vidic was like to play alongside, the 50-year-old said: \"I was fairly good at tackling. It was all calculated. I was just getting people back. That's all I was doing.",
      "\"I never instigated. If someone got me, there's a chance I'd get them back. Vida [Vidic] had some tackles in the box, he could be a lunatic,\" reports the Mirror.",
      "He added: \"He didn't play as a centre half in five-a-side. He was one of those defenders that thought he could play a bit as a No. 10. You know what I mean?",
      "\"When you get to a five-a-side he does anything but play in his position, 'Give it to me' all that stuff. But when it came to a match he would head and kick everything.",
      "\"In training he could be a bit moody and a nuisance in the box especially but a great centre half. He was perfect for English football. He could head the ball, tackle, he was great, a really good player.\"",
      "After quickly establishing a formidable partnership with Rio Ferdinand upon arriving at Old Trafford in 2006, Vidic made 300 appearances for the Red Devils, winning five Premier League titles, three League Cups and a Champions League. Vidic left United in 2014 to join Inter Milan, before retiring from an illustrious career in January 2016.",
      "Scholes, on the other hand, spent his entire professional football career with United, scoring 155 goals and providing 82 assists in 716 games, primarily as a central midfielder. Alongside Vidic, he is among a host of well-known names who will participate in Soccer Aid on Sunday, including content creators like Morgan Burtwhistle (AKA AngryGinge) and fellow athletes like Sir Mo Farah and Tony Bellew.",
      "Football enthusiasts can watch all the action live on ITV1 and ITVX from 6pm onwards. The match is scheduled to kick off at 7:30pm."

      "When you finish the Premier League season with a -1 goal difference and only 57 goals scored in 38 outings, it's pretty clear where your priorities should lie in the transfer market, right? Well, maybe not.",
      "When Manchester United slumped to eighth in the table, only managing to secure European football thanks to their FA Cup triumph, it was clear that their blunt attack was their main issue and that it needed to be addressed in the transfer market.",
      "Only six players in the entire squad managed to score more than two league goals all season. One of those six players was sold in Scott McTominay, another was shipped out on loan during the mid-season window in Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo can't even get into the starting XI.",
      "Of the five major signings United made in the 2024 summer window, three of them were defenders and one was a defensive midfielder. Joshua Zirkzee represented the only attacking arrival, yet his haul of 13 goals in two years in Serie A hardly suggested he would be the answer to United's goalscoring woes.",
      "Did they really expect things to get any better? If they did then they'll have been very disappointed.",
      "Things only got worse in the 2024/25 season, with Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee - the club's two senior centre forwards - managing just seven league goals between them. United scored 13 goals fewer last season than they managed in 2023/24, recording a -10 goal difference as they finished 15th in the table, having looked set to finish just one place above the relegation zone at one point.",

      "And then there's the big question of who will lead the line next season.",
      "United are determined to sign a striker, with Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen two of the names continuing to be linked with the club. Both are regular goalscorers and would help to sharpen a very blunt attack.",

      "Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres is a man in demand, and little wonder when you consider his goalscoring record.",
      "Since making the move to Sporting from Coventry in 2023, Gyokeres has plundered 97 goals in 102 games for the Portuguese heavyweights, including six in eight games in the 2024/25 Champions League.",
      "Gyokeres's route to the wishlist of some of Europe's top sides has been anything but conventional. Just two years ago he was plying his trade in England's second tier having failed to make a single league appearance in three years at Brighton. He was loaned out numerous times during his spell with the Seagulls, including a season in the second tier of German football and a dire stint at Swansea that saw him fail to score in 11 league outings.",
      "There's something to be admired in Gyokeres' ascent, and with so many top teams on the hunt for a new No.9 this summer it would be a shock to see him playing in the Primeira Liga next season. But Sporting certainly won't be letting him leave on the cheap.",
      "Club president Frederico Varandas addressed the speculation surrounding his star man this week, insisting he would not be allowed to leave for the €70million (£59.5m) fee that's been bandied about in recent weeks. And that could be an issue should Manchester United look to pursue Gyokeres.",
      "After years of being taken for a ride in the transfer market and paying well over the odds, United are keen to make 'the United tax' a thing of the past.",
      "Manchester City's hit rate in the market has to be admired, and so United looking to adopt their stance of rarely paying over £60m for players makes a lot of sense. It must be added that the club have already sanctioned a £62.5m deal for Matheus Cunha this summer after triggering his release clause, though the deal made a lot of sense given his Premier League record and suitability for Ruben Amorim's system.",
      "If United make a move for Gyokeres this summer they're almost certainly going to break their £60m transfer rule. After finishing 15th in the Premier League with a -10 goal difference and no European football to look forward to next season, this is no normal summer and rules may need to be broken.",

      "The deal has now formally gone through and Cunha has signed a five-year deal at Old Trafford. United have the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months.",
      "Cunha has become the club's first signing of the off-season after United triggered his £62.5million release clause. He was a leading target and director of football Jason Wilcox has described him \"as one of the most exciting and productive forwards in England\".",
      "Cunha will add goals and athleticism to United's attack, meaning he ticks a variety of boxes for head coach Ruben Amorim. He scored 17 goals across all competitions in 2024/25, including 15 in the Premier League.",
      "Despite strengthening their attacking pool with the addition of the former Atletico Madrid forward, United do not want their attacking additions to stop there, with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo next on their hit list.",
      "United, just over 24 hours after announcing they had reached an agreement to sign Cunha, discovered Mbeumo had chosen Old Trafford as his preferred destination this summer. United made an opening offer for the Cameroonian last week, understood to be worth £55m, but it was rejected.",
      "Nevertheless, discussions between United and the Bees have remained ongoing and the Old Trafford outfit are confident of making a breakthrough in negotiations in order to make Mbeumo their second signing of the summer. United would like to get the deal wrapped up in time for the former Troyes man to report to Carrington for pre-season training at the start of July.",
      "In addition to wanting Mbeumo, United remain hungry to sign a striker this summer. Liam Delap was United's top target to bolster their No.9 options, but they were beaten to his signature by Chelsea, meaning they are now looking elsewhere for a goal-getter.",
      "They have been linked with a collection of strikers in recent weeks, including Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli. Gyokeres is keen to leave Sporting and Napoli want to sell Osimhen.",
      "United are in desperate need of a proven goalscorer, meaning either Gyokeres or Osimhen would fit the bill. However, amid the fact they have signed Cunha for £62.5m and could end up paying around £60m for Mbeumo, outgoings will be required to fund the addition of a striker.",
      "As well as bolstering their attack, United also want to sign a midfielder. Christian Eriksen will be leaving the club when his contract expires later this month and uncertainty continues to surround the futures of both Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘initiated talks’ to sign an elite goalkeeper target, after an ‘agreement’ killed the chances of a Barcelona deal.",
      "United have deemed themselves in need of a new goalkeeper this summer. The below-par performances of Andre Onana have shown them that he’s no longer the right man.",
      "The stopper was at fault for a number of goals in both the Premier League and other competitions, and that certainly did not help the Red Devils’ attempts at success, as they came 15th in the league.",
      "Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez has been linked with United since the back end of the season, when it seemed his exit from Villa Park was likely when he was visibly upset on the field after his last home game.",
      "According to ESPN Argentina, United have ‘initiated talks’ with the goalkeeper, who’s open to a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "That’s in spite of the fact that there won’t be any European football on offer there next season, whereas Villa will play in the Europa League.",
      "Indeed, it’s recently been suggested that Martinez is waiting for a call from United, with staying in England his preference, amid an offer from Galatasaray.",
      "That call has come at the right time, and the reason for United now going hard for Martinez may be as Marc-Andre ter Stegen seems to be off the board.",
      "It was reported of late that United were eager to sign the Barcelona star, who could agree to cancel his deal with the Nou Camp club.",
      "But it’s since been reported by Fanatik that Ter Stegen has ‘reached an agreement’ to move to Galatasaray, and it’s expected that the deal will be finalised if Barca don’t demand a large transfer fee.",
      "The Turkish outfit knew Martinez was not going to come on board, so they went after Ter Stegen, meaning he’d not be available to United.",
      "But the Red Devils moving for Martinez seemed the easier transfer, given his preference of staying in England, so both clubs have seemingly got good moves for themselves, if both are indeed secured.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana.",
      "Barcelona are reportedly ‘willing’ to allow a 422-game icon to leave the club amid interest from Manchester United, and he has made a big demand ahead of the potential departure.",

      "Premier League side Man Utd have been ‘offered’ a Barcelona player in exchange for Marcus Rashford this summer, according to reports.",

      "Gyokeres hoped his exit would be seamless as he felt he had a gentleman’s agreement to depart Sporting Lisbon for around £60m this summer, but club chiefs have gone back on their supposed word to demand a higher fee for their prized asset.",

      "14) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nWord is that Newcastle and Burnley are haggling over the price of a deal that Eddie Howe wanted to do a year ago, with the intention of Trafford and Nick Pope slugging it out for the No.1 spot. Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered.

      "Man Utd’s Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly “ahead of everyone” on Inter Milan’s priority list as the Danish striker nears the Old Trafford exit door.",
      "Hojlund only joined United in 2023 but has failed to live up to his £64m price tag, scoring 26 goals for the club in 95 appearances.",
      "With rumours that United are in the market for a new number nine, Hojlund has been linked with a move away with Serie A’s Inter said to be the favourites for his signature.",
      "Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport claim the 22-year-old is “ahead of everyone” on the San Siro side’s wishlist and that talks have seen a “definite acceleration.”",
      "“Inter is working on this scenario, even at a distance, because the entire management has moved to America [for the Club World Cup],” the newspaper reports. “But the whole thing has seen a definite acceleration in the last few days.",
      "“Hojlund has stepped on the pedals. He is now ahead of everyone in the club’s preferences for the attack of the future: there is finally room for investment up there at the front, and at the moment, no one seems to deserve it more.”",
      "For Inter, Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram were the main goal threats but Gazzetta believe Hojlund would be able to challenge for a starting spot.",
      "“Once back in Italy, [head coach Cristian] Chivu is confident of a quality addition in the department: a striker with international experience who can stand worthily alongside Lautaro and Thuram and not just be considered the first of the reserves,” they added.",
      "“An added starter is urgently needed, as Hojlund would be. The Dane has already let it be known that he quite likes the idea of wearing the Nerazzurri.”",

      "The cheeky little early transfer window door creaked shut but the transfer window proper is set to open on Monday as we split our focus between Premier League comings and goings, and the inaugural all-new Club World Cup.",

      "",
      "Rodrigo Mora (Porto)\nRuben Amorim supposedly wanted Sporting to sign Mora as the teenager was coming up through the Porto academy and unsurprisingly retains an interest in signing him for Manchester United on the back of ten goals and four assists in his first senior senior season.",
      "That haul came despite Mora starting just 16 Liga Portugal games for Porto, largely in the left-sided attacking midfield role in a 3-4-3 formation that’s become infamous at Old Trafford since Amorim took charge.",
      "The Red Devils could do a lot worse than Mora as they scour the market for alternatives to top target Bryan Mbeumo amid interest from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham, but will have to pay a similar fee for the 18-year-old, with Porto inserting a €70m [£59m] release clause into his new contract.",
      "",
      "Goncalo Ramos (PSG)\nLiverpool are reportedly considering Ramos as a fall-back option should they fail to land any of their top targets – we’ve ranked ten of them – and PSG have also ‘offered’ him to United for £50m, which can’t have felt good for a striker with a more than reasonable goalscoring record for the Ligue 1 giants.",
      "And we wonder whether United should climb down from a high horse which has seen them make a failed attempt for Viktor Gyokeres ahead of various other doomed bids for elite strikers and consider a move for a guy whose 32 goals for PSG have come at a rate of one every 109 minutes when they’re current leading No.9 has scored 26 at a significantly reduced lick of one every 246 minutes.",
      "",
      "Randal Kolo Muani (Juventus)\n“I’m very happy at Juventus, I hope to continue there,” Kolo Muani said. “They welcomed me well, and I’m enjoying it.”",
      "Juventus are also thought to be keen on retaining the France international’s services after his eight Serie A goals for them since his January move, but it remains to be seen whether they can meet PSG’s demands. They wanted €75m [£64m] for his permanent transfer in January but that asking price is now thought to have dropped to around £42m as the Champions League winners look to cash in.",
      "United were also interested in January and are still being linked with the 26-year-old, while the majority of the Premier League big boys are keeping tabs.",

      "“We have different ideas about the player’s current value,” Kehl explained, in the process revealing that the Bundesliga club are at least open to his sale for the right price.",
      "They may well see the tournament as an opportunity to bring more clubs to a bidding war party for the Englishman, while Noni Madueke – who looked set to be the big loser had the deal been reached – should be looking at the CWC as a way to prove Chelsea don’t need to add further competition for his spot on the wing as Estevao will be hoping to impress through his displays for Palmeiras ahead of his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "",
      "Oscar Gloukh (RB Salzburg)\nGloukh’s performances at the European U19 Championships in 2022, including a stunning goal against England in the final, alerted the world to his potential. Interest from Barcelona was eschewed in favour of a move to Red Bull Salzburg, but he has since been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and, most recently, Aston Villa.",
      "“It makes more sense for my development,” Gloukh said when asked to explain why he opted for RB Salzburg, aware as we all now are that the Austrian club is one of the best springboards to bigger and better things in Europe.",
      "On the back of 11 goals and eight assists this season, the No.10 is now looking to follow Erling Haaland, Dominik Szoboszlai, Karim Adeyemi, Benjamin Sesko and other esteemed Salzburg alumni in taking the next step.",

      "Milton Delgado (Boca Juniors)\nBoca Juniors have put a timely €20m [£17m] release clause in the defensive midfielder’s contract ahead of a summer in which the 19-year-old is expected to turn plenty of heads in Europe.",
      "Inter have already been credited with interest in Delgado, who describes himself as a dynamic, tactically minded player, who loves to steal the ball from the opposition, which sounds like precisely what Manchester United hoped they were signing in Manuel Ugarte and explains why they too have been linked with the teenager with Ugarte failing to meet that expectation.",

      "Obed Vargas (Seattle Sounders)\n“At this point, what I’d say is I don’t know if there’s a club in the world that doesn’t know who he is,” Sounders general manager and chief soccer officer Craig Waibel told reporters of Vargas after a recent training session. “I mean, anyone who’s got analytics, he’s triggered and kind of set off the red alarms.”",
      "A come and get him plea if ever we heard one, and we can say with some degree of certainty that the 19-year-old central midfielder would be the first player hailing from Anchorage, Alaska to play in one of Europe’s top five leagues should he attract enough attention in Group B games against Atletico Madrid and PSG.",
      "",
      "Samu Aghehowa (Porto)\nHe came very close to a move to Chelsea in what would essentially have been a straight swap for Conor Gallagher, but the deal broke down over what Aghehowa saw as a ‘disrespectful’ attempt from the Blues to buy 50 per cent of his image rights.",
      "The 21-year-old went to Porto instead and has enhanced his reputation with 25 goals in all competitions. A €100m release clause makes a move this summer unlikely, but we suspect there will be feelers put out from the raft of Premier League clubs looking for a new No.9 if Aghehowa impresses.",
      "",

      "Chelsea blinked when given the chance to sign one of Europe’s top goalkeepers. If the Blues don’t get a second chance, there are other options.",
      "A number of big clubs are on the lookout for a new No.1 and there are some very good goalkeepers available – to varying degrees – this summer.",
      "Here are 10 top stoppers we think might be gettable…",
      "",
      "10) Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG)\nDonnarumma’s agent will have you believe the Italy keeper is available because he needs more leverage on contract talks with PSG, who want to keep their current custodian, but not at any cost.",
      "Of course, Manchester United’s name has been mentioned because that’s the oldest trick in the agents’ book, but Donnarumma himself said his priority is to renew with PSG. But only if he gets paid.",
      "",
      "9) Nick Pope (Newcastle)\nEddie Howe clearly isn’t entirely convinced by Pope given he’s trying again to sign James Trafford from Burnley. Newcastle want us to believe that Trafford would be arriving to compete for the No.1 position, but the new boy is not likely to make that move at this point in his career without a certain level of assurance. Which suggests Pope’s days as first choice are numbered; there would be considerable interest from other Premier League clubs in need of an experienced England international.",
      "",
      "8) Mads Hermansen (Leicester)\nThe 25-year-old keeper was one of very few to emerge with a smidgen of credit from a miserable season at the King Power. At least the Dane had ample opportunity to show what he can do – only Ipswich and Southampton allowed more shots on their goal.",
      "Before demonstrating that he could stay at the highest level while Leicester return to the Championship, Hermansen played a big role in the Foxes’ promotion to the Premier League. Brentford were linked before they found a bargain in Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "",
      "7) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton)\nRamsdale’s move to Southampton last summer made you wonder if the England keeper actually enjoys being relegated. Were there really no other better offers? Perhaps not, given the daft sod once openly admitted to struggling with concentration, but when his mind is on the job, Ramsdale remains a very good keeper. West Ham were sniffing and he feels like a good fit for Leeds.",
      "💷 The 20 most expensive goalkeepers ever: Chelsea shamed but Arsenal evolution clear",
      "",
      "6) Marcin Bulka (Nice)\nThe Nice no.1 has told the French club he fancies a move this summer, which they will be keen to facilitate since the Pole has only a year remaining on a contract he almost certainly won’t renew.",
      "The 6ft 6in giant, who began his career at Chelsea and went via PSG to Nice, has been catching eyes across Europe, and obviously Manchester United have been linked. But the Red Devils will have to wait until January since UEFA banned them doing any business with INEOS stable mate Nice until after this summer window.",
      "",
      "5) Vanja Milinkovic-Savic (Torino)\nThe Serbian stopper began his career as a youth player at Manchester United and he has been linked with a move to Old Trafford – maybe we should just assume that to be the case for all these keepers unless stated – after three solid seasons in Torino’s sticks. AC Milan, though, seem to be the frontrunners, with an agreement in place to pay the 28-year-old’s £17million release clause if they lose Mike Maignan.",
      "Only two keepers in Europe’s top five leagues performed better in relation to their expected goals against than Milinkovic-Savic, who conceded 11.4 goals fewer than the algorithms expected him to.",
      "",
      "4) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nWidely proclaimed as the best goalkeeper in the world but, more accurately in our view, he was the goalkeeper for the best team in the world. Argentina, that is, not Villa. That doesn’t mean he isn’t very, very good, and he would be an asset to any team looking for a stopper this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been linked, and he’d certainly be an upgrade, but Villa don’t have to give him away, even if they are the club in most PSR peril.",
      "",
      "3) Lucas Chevalier (Lille)\nIf Villa sell Martinez, then Chevalier is said to be high on their list of potential replacements. Though that plan could be scuppered by PSG if they can’t reach an agreement with Donnarumma and sell the Italy keeper to a club more willing to meet his massive wage demands.",
      "At 23, Chevalier conceded 7.3 goals fewer than xG suggests he should last season, with Manchester City said to be keen on the France call-up.",
      "",
      "2) Andriy Lunin (Real Madrid)\nIt seems Lunin is open to exploring his options away from Real’s bench because we have to assume he’s given up on ever replacing Thibaut Courtois as No.1. The penny should have dropped when Courtous returned from injury for the 2024 Champions League final when Lunin had played most of the season.",
      "Apparently, Real are open to selling the Ukraine stopper for £20m-25million, with the 26-year-old said to be on the radar of a host of top clubs.",
      "",
      "1) Mike Maignan (AC Milan)\nThe France No.1 is a year from the end of his contract and seemingly intent on leaving AC Milan after growing tired of the lack of progress in negotiations over a new deal. All of which presented a great opportunity for Chelsea to upgrade their goalkeeping option, none of which Enzo Maresca is happy with, but the Blues refused to take their opportunity.",
      "Milan apparently want around £21million but Chelsea were prepared to go no higher than £12million. Chelsea blew a clear run at Maignan, which should alert a number of big clubs. But here is the one keeper Manchester United haven’t been linked with, when they really should be.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United are ‘in talks’ over signing Burnley star James Trafford but they face competition from rivals Chelsea.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea have missed out on a key transfer target before the Club World Cup, with Fabrizio Romano confirming a deal is ‘off’.",
      "The ‘exceptional’ Club World Cup transfer window closes at 7pm on Tuesday, with a series of eye-catching possible signings including some Liverpool sales.",
      "Chelsea are expected to return with an improved bid for Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens after reaching a contract agreement, according to reports.",
      "If Chelsea secure the bargain signing of an AC Milan star, it could reportedly ‘spell doom’ for two of their players, with an ‘immediate exit’ suggested.",
      "It’s now a ‘matter of time’ before Man Utd sign AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan to replace Andre Onana, according to reports."

      "GK: Kepa Arrizabalaga (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, £71.6m)\nGianluigi Buffon was the world’s most expensive goalkeeper for 5,820 days. Ederson reigned for just over 13 months. Alisson only managed three weeks.",
      "Kepa retains that mantle seven years on, despite spending much of the intervening time not even his own club’s best shot-stopper, nor even at his own club.",
      "Chelsea continue to stumble and muddle through imperfect goalkeeping solutions despite otherwise spending literal billions assembling their squad, with Kepa deemed entirely surplus to requirements and ready to board the Arsenal train for a fair whack less than Chelsea paid.",
      "",
      "CB: Harry Maguire (Leicester to Manchester United, £80m)\nAnother whose stock has fluctuated wildly between most expensive player ever in his position and saviour of the future, to poster boy for financial incompetence, Maguire is on his latest successful quest to win over a manager who tried to phase him out.",
      "For his myriad faults and foibles, the England centre-half is as committed to the cause as they come and, as Ruben Amorim has taken barely any time to discover, can be useful if chucked up front while chasing a late goal.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United definitely just tried to copy Liverpool’s homework but missed most of the working out, figuring that simply spending a world-record sum on a defender makes them an unbeatable leader of men for the best part of the next decade.",
      "But across six years at Old Trafford, Maguire has given far more to the club than he has taken away. And if that sounds like a remarkably low bar for an £80m signing, he’s one of a handful who can say the same in that same timeframe.",
      "",
      "CB: Josko Gvardiol (Leipzig to Manchester City, £77m)\nThe Premier League always seemed to beckon for Gvardiol. Leeds almost signed the Croatian in the season after their top-flight promotion, while the centre-half publicly discussed his dream of playing for Liverpool for years.",
      "Try as they might, Chelsea simply could not extract Gvardiol from Leipzig in summer 2022, when Boehly was throwing money in every direction.",
      "A £77.4m bid was not enough to persuade Leipzig to sell then, but Manchester City found their breakthrough with a similar figure 12 months later.",
      "Gvardiol might not take immense pride in being named the club’s Player of the Season in what was a trophyless and often quite miserable campaign, but he has already collected a few winner’s medals in a brief spell at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "CB: Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool, £75m)\nBefore Liverpool signed Van Dijk on New Year’s Day 2018, the most expensive centre-half in history was David Luiz (£50m), the great man removing new teammate Thiago Silva (£32m) from that particular throne in 2014.",
      "One further step back from Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian connection takes the lineage of the world’s most expensive central defender all the way back to Rio Ferdinand, who joined Manchester United for £30m in 2002.",
      "The obvious importance of the position was appreciated, but not in transfer fee terms until Van Dijk. Liverpool laying £75m down on the Dutchman seemed to break the dam: there have been ten different moves worth at least £50m involving centre-halves in the subsequent seven-and-a-half years.",
      "Each have been chasing that transformative impact Van Dijk had on Liverpool, turning them from exciting but porous entertainers into stable, brilliant winners. They reached consecutive Champions League finals upon his arrival and dropped just 32 points in his first two full Premier League campaigns.",
      "The Dutchman has won the lot at Anfield, not missing a single minute of a title win and being named PFA Player of the Year in 2019, once again blazing a trail as the first defensive holder of that honour in 15 years.",
      "Even now, with the 33-year-old slowing down and past his imperious, perhaps peerless physical peak, there are few better overall. The sums were astronomical but pound-for-pound, Liverpool have rarely spent more wisely.",
      "",
      "RW: Antony (Ajax to Manchester United, £82m)\nDoubts were expressed long before Manchester United completed the second most expensive signing in their history, and the only 180s conducted since have been by Antony himself.",
      "Ten Hag vouched for and personally requested the purchase of his former Ajax colleague, which was a pitfall the Dutchman kept walking into until he was sacked.",
      "Antony never has lacked the appropriate work ethic and his attitude has rarely been in question either, but a lack of pace and general one-dimensional style did not translate at all well to the Premier League beyond the first few weeks.",
      "The years since his arrival have been defined by those involved in his signing trying their utmost to absolve themselves of blame. Antony has scored or assisted a goal every 319 minutes at Manchester United, compared to one every 152 minutes during that prodigious loan at Real Betis which has nevertheless not done quite enough to inflate his value to a point Old Trafford executives can sell without dying of PSR-related shame.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Brighton to Chelsea, £100m)\nFor about £4.5m, Brighton signed Caicedo from Independiente del Valle on deadline day of the 2021 winter transfer window. Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",
      "Caicedo long seemed destined to join Chelsea in the summer of 2023, but some painful attempts at bargaining with actual professional poker player Tony Bloom saw their bids fall predictably short at £80m.",
      "Then Liverpool crashed in with an offer of £111m, accepted by Brighton but certainly not by Caicedo himself, who had agreed personal terms with the Blues and was in no mood to renege.",
      "That prompted Chelsea to eventually find a breakthrough in talks with Brighton, paying a premium for the inconvenience caused and leaving Liverpool with a small amount of egg on their faces.",
      "If enough of the £15m in clauses are activated, Caicedo will become the most expensive player in Premier League history. He is already the biggest transfer step down.",
      "",
      "CM: Declan Rice (West Ham to Arsenal, £100m)\nIt took two rejected bids, a rubbish Manchester City hijack attempt, more chat about payment structure than anyone would care to admit and a torturous wait for The Paperwork to be filed, but Arsenal finally inserted what they hoped to be the final piece of their jigsaw before jetting off on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies. But two years in he has been unable to drag them over the line, although little of that is down to the shortcomings of Rice himself.",
      "",
      "CM: Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThere were precious few positives to glean from Chelsea’s miserable first season without their Roman Abramovich stabilisers. Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",
      "It took a while and some managerial change for things to properly click but Fernandez and Chelsea are finally on the right track.",
      "",
      "LW: Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m)\nA year is a long old time in football. While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",
      "It turns out that there aren’t many clubs out there willing to either match the sort of wage Manchester City offer, or the kind of fee they need to tick enough PSR boxes. And Pep Guardiola couldn’t care less.",
      "",
      "AM: Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United, £73m)\nAs far back as August 2017, Sancho has been on the Manchester United radar. Borussia Dortmund’s ability to grant the ambitious young forward a clear first-team pathway meant they secured the Manchester City academy talent but his immediate burst onto the Bundesliga scene only crystallised interest from back home.",
      "For each of the subsequent years until he finally arrived at Old Trafford in 2021, Sancho was frequently linked to a club hoping to build around a youthful British core; Manchester United even ‘forced the Germans’ into selling the England forward 12 months before he actually moved.",
      "But Sancho has been nothing close to the wait. Even during his “freedom” from 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for Manchester United, Chelsea paid £5m to specifically not sign him permanently.",
      "This place will belong to Florian Wirtz soon enough.",
      "",
      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",
      "Buying clubs: Chelsea (x4), Manchester United (x3), Manchester City (x2), Arsenal (x1), Liverpool (x1)",
      "Total cost: £962.9m",
      "Most expensive players to miss out:\nPaul Pogba (Juventus to Manchester United, £89.3m)\nRomelu Lukaku (Everton to Manchester United, £75m)\nNicolas Pepe (Lille to Arsenal, £72m)\nKai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, £71m)\nWesley Fofana (Leicester to Chelsea, £70m)\nRuben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £65m)\nKai Havertz (Chelsea to Arsenal, £65m)\nDarwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64m)\nRasmus Hojlund (Atalanta to Manchester United, £64m)\nRodri (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, £62.8m)\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United, £62.5m)\nMykhaylo Mudryk (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, £62m)",

What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100 million.",

      "Does Viktor Gyokeres have a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with Sporting? Does his agent have proof of said agreement? Does that same agent have a ‘sales mandate’ for rejected bids? Have Arsenal made an offer? Two offers? Are Manchester United in the running? We’ve attempted to unpick fact from fiction…",
      "Here’s what we do know: Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting since his €20m plus €4m in add-ons (which we strongly suspect have been reached) move from Coventry in the summer of 2023. He now wants to leave. Arsenal and Manchester United are interested. He has a €100m [£84m] release clause in his contract.",
      "From there it all gets a bit murky.",
      "It’s been widely reported that Gyokeres has a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with Sporting that he could leave the club this summer for €70m [£59m], but that’s since been refuted by the Portuguese club.",
      "It’s been claimed they actually want €80m [£67m], with that supposed U-turn infuriating Gyokeres to the point of threatening a strike on the back of multiple Swedish outlets claiming his agent Hasan Cetinkaya has ‘written evidence that Sporting promised him to let the player out for €60 million and another €10 million for goals’.",
      "In response, Sporting Lisbon President Frederico Varandas said: “Threats, blackmail and insults don’t work with me.",
      "“I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that.",
      "“This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyokeres, neither today nor last season.”",
      "Gyokeres took to Instagram on Thursday to shed some light on the situation: ‘There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it false. I will speak when the time is right.’",
      "As it turns out, according to Portuguese outlet Record, one of the false claims was his agent’s reported proof of the gentleman’s agreement. He doesn’t have the evidence and never said he did, but Varandas fell hook, line and sinker like the rest of us.",
      "“It was agreed that Sporting would not demand the release clause at the end of the following season, especially because he was going to be 27,’ added Varandas. “Then, we knew Viktor’s dream of going to a club where he could fight for the Champions League and we have common sense.",

What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100 million.",
      "“From then on, I never spoke to the agent again, I never spoke to the player about departures and values. 10 months have passed and I see the agent in the press spouting information here and there, but Sporting has common sense, it keeps its word.”",

      "Now to the offers. Manchester United are said to be ready to make a bid worth €60m plus €10m in add-ons, which Sporting chief Varandas has already told everyone won’t be enough.",
      "What’s more, Record are now claiming that ‘the footballer’s agents have officially told Ruben Amorim’s club that he is no longer an option for the striker’. They end by saying that the door to Old Trafford is ‘definitively’ closed and that ‘the dream destination is really the Emirates’.",
      "But that door to Arsenal looks to be ajar at best with Fabrizio Romano claiming RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko is sporting director Andrea Berta’s ‘clear favourite’.",
      "Pinches of salt are therefore required over reports claiming the Gunners have made one bid of ‘around €55m’ as a fixed fee for Gyokeres plus bonuses which could take the transfer up to €65m (again, not enough) and that they are preparing a second bid that will ‘exceed €70m’ in total.",
      "And it’s no wonder Sporting want to ramp up the asking price if, as A BOLA claim, Cetinkaya is due 10 per cent of any rejected proposal which exceeds €60m thanks to a particularly cunning ‘sales mandate’ the agent ensured was part of his contract.",
      "We assume that clause can only be triggered once, and not for every rejected proposal over that amount, but the report suggests if the agent does decide to take up the option (and why wouldn’t he?) then ‘Sporting will demand the full value of the player’s termination clause, that is, the €100 million euros’.",

      "10. Josko Gvardiol – £78 million\nThe £77m paid out by Manchester City for Josko Gvardiol made him the second most expensive defender in the world but already the Croatian has gone some way to proving he was worth the money.",

      "Manchester United’s signing of Antony has turned out so poorly that almost everyone involved is trying to claim it was not their idea.",

      "It started promisingly with a goal against Arsenal in his debut but his scoring soon dried up. The Brazilian ended his first year with eight goals in 44 appearances.",

      "Since then, Mudryk has struggled to break into the team, playing 15 league games in his first season without scoring. He did at least play 41 times in the 2023-24 campaign, ending it with just 11 goal involvements.",
      "As a result, Chelsea looked to strengthen in that position, pushing Mudryk to the bench before he was hit with a provisional suspension for failing a doping test.

      "Eventually, United cut their losses – allowing his contract to expire and Pogba moved back to Juventus again.",
      "In February 2024, Pogab was hit with a four-year ban for doping but it was reduced on appeal. Now able to play again, the Frenchman has been unable to find a club as of yet.",

      "The Catalan manager tends to leave new signings to it in their early days, meaning Grealish’s numbers were quite good, but as more was asked of him, the former Villa player’s performances took a nose dive.",
      "A great season in the Treble-winning campaign was followed by a stop-start season in 2023-24 and he ended the year with just six goal involvements in 36 games.",

      "The report says new Spurs boss Frank is keen to bring Mbeumo to north London after working with the forward at Brentford since 2019 and that the club have ‘launched a £70m bid to hijack United’s move’.",

      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",

      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",

      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Premier League clubs splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "City were the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side looked to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, having spent a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides have yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to United has been the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Dortmund for £32m and City also sold Yan Couto to the Bundesliga club for £25m.",
      "Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old was one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the US. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the tournament - and he could face Chelsea there while turning out for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as an option for Saudi Pro-League club Al Hilal as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup, but the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left winger is another priority, with Real's Rodrygo among the list of targets. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the Spaniard's £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool now agreeing a British-record transfer fee of £116.5m to sign Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after the Germany playmaker turned down a move to Bayern Munich.",
      "The Reds have, though, lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit, with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Huijsen to Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for centre-back Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barca have for the forward position, along with United's Marcus Rashford, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "United were unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. The Bees have turned down their opening £55m bid, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the Cameroon forward, valued at more than £60m.",
      "However, Tottenham have now held initial discussions with Brentford about a deal for Mbeumo, who is more intrigued in a Spurs move now that Thomas Frank has been appointed head coach, although the player is still understood to be leaning towards United, who are expected to go back in with a fresh offer for the for the 25-year-old.",
      "Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker. Gyokeres is one of their targets up front and approaches have been made for the Sporting frontman through intermediaries, although recent reports in Portugal claim the player would prefer a move to Arsenal.",
      "United have also entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike - who is also interesting Liverpool and Chelsea - according to Sky in Germany. However, it will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan, but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "United's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad having appointed Thomas Frank to replace the sacked Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south-coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing [excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows], so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window re-opens for business on Monday, before slamming shut on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "With Hugo Ekitike linked with a summer transfer to the Premier League, Adam Bate speaks to Oscar Garcia, who coached Ekitike at Stade Reims, to find out more about the Eintracht Frankfurt forward and what he could bring to the Premier League",
      "Friday 13 June 2025 10:31, UK",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool as proposed landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",

      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Man Utd have made an initial approach to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting; Sweden international is in-demand after a sensational spell in Portugal which has sent his value soaring; Gyokeres has also attracted interest from Premier League rivals Arsenal",
      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 15:13, UK",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Antoine Semenyo; Man Utd also remain admirers of the Bournemouth forward; he is also on the list at Liverpool this summer and is believed to favour playing for a Champions League club - but has not yet ruled out a move to Old Trafford",
      "Monday 9 June 2025 18:40, UK",
      "Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Manchester United also remain admirers of the Bournemouth forward despite having a bid rejected for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo - a player also on the list at Spurs.",
      "Mbeumo appears to be United's priority target after a £55m offer was rejected by Brentford last week - and they are expected to follow up with another offer.",
      "There have been reports that Thomas Frank wants Spurs to sign Mbeumo if he becomes their new head coach - but it is ultimately Spurs as a club that decide who they sign.",
      "Chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Johan Lange call the recruitment shots, with the returning Fabio Paratici also having a say - so a Frank arrival would not necessarily make a move for Mbeumo inevitable.",
      "He is also on the list at Liverpool this summer and is believed to favour playing for a Champions League club - but has not yet ruled out a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It means both Semenyo and Mbeumo's futures remain in the balance as Frank nears the head coach role at Tottenham - an event that may prove pivotal in the outcome for both men.",
      "Tottenham have opened talks with Brentford for Thomas Frank.",
      "Discussions between the clubs over compensation are under way. Spurs have no second or third-choice options. Frank is and has been the No 1 target for board members.",
      "Frank is interested in taking the job and wants to speak to Spurs. Although Brentford do not wish to stand in his way if he wants to move to a bigger club, they do not plan to let him go on the cheap.",
      "Brentford are prepared to listen to offers from Spurs but expect them to be serious ones.",
      "Frank has a release clause in his contract, which has two years left to run. It is widely being reported to be in the region of £10m.",
