      "Alan Shearer has backed Harry Maguire to potentially earn a space in the England squad for next year's World Cup. The Red Devils defender has been in fine form under Ruben Amorim this season, playing a key role in recent victories over Sunderland and Liverpool.",
      "Despite currently being out of favour with Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel, Newcastle United legend Shearer is confident that it may not be long before Maguire is back in the national set-up. In conversation with Betfair, Shearer said: \"I think Maguire's got an amazing attitude; I love how nothing seems to affect him - he goes out and you know what you're going to get.",
      "\"You know he gives his all - he may make an error every now and then, but who doesn't? I love his attitude towards that, whether it's going well or not.",
      "\"I suppose he can make a late play for the England squad - knowing his attitude, he'd never rule it out. He's got to get in, stay in and be a regular in the Man United team to show what we saw last weekend, every weekend.",
      "\"I guess the answer is that you could never rule it out and I don't think he would either. He would expect if he was to continue playing the way he is, then he might get it. He might get the call-up, you never know.\"",
      "Reflecting on being left out, Maguire said at the time: \"To miss out was tough. It has been really frustrating, working all season to get myself mentally and physically at the top of my game and be in a position to feel I could really make a difference for Manchester United and my country.\"",
      "Whilst he hasn't pulled on the England shirt since last September's Nations League triumph over Ireland, many believe the 32-year-old could earn a recall for Tuchel's maiden major tournament with England at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Maguire has been a standout performer in Amorim's team lately, featuring in seven Premier League matches this season. The defender came off the bench to help secure a 2-0 victory against Sunderland at Old Trafford before the international break, then started in the dramatic 2-1 triumph over bitter rivals Liverpool last weekend.",
      "In that encounter, Maguire netted the decisive goal with a commanding header at the far post, demonstrating how he retains the ability to influence matches despite approaching the latter stages of his career. The spotlight will be on the centre-half as Manchester United welcome Brighton to their home ground on Saturday evening.",
      "As it stands, Brighton are just one point and one position behind United in 10th, thanks to a varied start to their own season. However, they enter the fray with momentum, having not lost in their last four Premier League matches.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "Wayne Rooney turns 40 today meaning it is more than 23 years since a fresh faced 16-year-old marked his arrival by scoring a last minute winner for Everton to down then champions Arsenal on an October afternoon in 2002.",
      "Little did we know that it would herald the beginning of a career for a player that would go on to break teenage transfer fees, light up an international tournament and surpass Manchester United, England and Everton goalscoring records.",
      "Clive Tyldesley, the commentator at Goodison Park that day remarked: \"Remember the name...Wayne Rooney!\"",
      "As introductions go it was an emphatic one and, unlike so many teenage players before and after him, this wasn't a case of lighting the touch paper only to underwhelm in later years. Rooney would deliver, deliver and deliver across the next two decades.",
      "Everton were always going to struggle to keep up with Rooney's ambitions and, even though he inspired them to a seventh place finish that year, bigger and better things were not far away. His England debut came at Upton Park in a loss to Australia on February 12 2003 at 17 years and 111 days - making him the youngest ever Three Lions player.",
      "The Toffees can boast about having the best young player at a major tournament, something they may never do again. Euro 2004 was the stage on which Rooney truly got Europe and the world's attention as he starred for England en route to the last eight. The teenager tore the French defence apart, scored against Switzerland and Croatia before injury ended a tournament of what might have beens.",
      "It was a few weeks though which would ultimately make Sir Alex Ferguson decide to push the go button and, after a transfer battle with Newcastle, Rooney would move to Old Trafford for £27million. It made him the world's most expensive teenager at the time.",
      "Ferguson had claimed that he'd landed a player who he felt would make any United team, even the one that had won the treble in 1999. Injury meant United fans had to wait to see their latest superstar in action, but he didn't disappoint and patience truly was a virtue.",
      "Rooney's debut in Manchester would come in the Champions League. He needed just 17 minutes to score his first goal, which was one of three as he notched a hat-trick to down Fenerbahce and truly announce himself to his new supporters.",
      "Playing at Old Trafford served as the springboard to take Rooney to some stellar individual honours. The Englishman was named the PFA Young Player of the Year in successive years in 2005 and 2006. Only three players this century have achieved the feat.",
      "But whilst the brilliance was often on show it wasn't being backed up by trophies. Rooney began his third year in Manchester and the best he had to show for it was a runners-up medal from the FA Cup final in 2005. Chelsea, who were keen on signing Rooney back in the day, had become England's dominant force.",
      "That was all about to change as the 2006/07 season began, but whilst it soon led to the second Holy Trinity in United's famed history, it would begin an era that would see Rooney play second fiddle as Cristiano Ronaldo morphed into one of the world's greatest players.",
      "It came after a World Cup in 2006 when Rooney and Ronaldo clashed on the pitch in a quarter-final where Portugal again came out on top. Rooney was sent-off, many claiming his United team-mate played a central role in that dismissal. A wink to the camera did little to help the situation. But it was another case of Rooney's hot-headed temper getting the better of him.",
      "He and Ronaldo didn't seem to have an issue on the pitch though and three years after Rooney moved to Manchester he claimed a first Premier League title during a year in which he dovetailed with Ronaldo brilliantly. The duo teamed up to score one of the great counter-attacking goals in top flight history during a 4-1 win over Bolton.",
      "That campaign also marked the first time that Rooney had exceeded the 20-goal mark. The success was the beginning of a three-year spell that saw Ferguson pick up a hat-trick of titles for the second time. That phase also included back-to-back Champions League finals - winning in 2008 in Moscow before losing to Barcelona the following year.",
      "Rooney was one third of a frontline that also included Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. It was a hark back to the days of George Best, Sir Bobby Charlton and Dennis Law. Few teams in Europe, let alone England, could compete with their brilliance.",
      "The Champions League final loss in 2009 marked the end of an era. Ronaldo would leave for Real Madrid in a world-record move, but that would be Rooney's sliding doors moment. Ever since he'd arrived at the club he'd never been the out and out main man.",
      "When he rocked up, Ruud van Nistelrooy was still central to the attack and after his exit Ronaldo quickly emerged. Come the 2009/10 season though Rooney was the main man, no question. It was a responsibility that saw him thrive - backed up by the numbers.",
      "He would score 34 times in all competitions - a career high - en route to his only PFA Player of the Year award. United, now without Ronaldo and Tevez, would miss out on the title but Rooney's stock had never been higher.",
      "53 – Goals for England, a national team record until surpassed by Harry Kane (76).",
      "120 – England caps, a record for an outfield player, five short of Peter Shilton’s overall record.",
      "253 – Club-record goal tally for Manchester United.",
      "208 – Goals scored in the Premier League. Only Alan Shearer (260) and Kane (213) have scored more.",
      "16 – Rooney was 16 years and 360 days old when he scored his first Premier League goal, for Everton against Arsenal in October 2002, making him then the youngest goalscorer in the competition’s history.",
      "12 – Major honours won with Manchester United – five Premier League titles, three League Cups, an FA Cup, a Champions League, a Europa League and a FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "4 – Professional clubs represented – Everton, Manchester United, DC United and Derby.",
      "366 – career goals for club and country, in 883 games.",
      "25.3 – Rooney’s win percentage as a manager, with Derby, DC United, Birmingham and Plymouth.",
      "40 – matches in his last two managerial spells combined. He was sacked by Birmingham after less than three months, having won just two games out of 15, then won five out of 25 with Argyle.",
      "It all meant that excitement among England fans was peaking ahead of the World Cup in 2010. Fabio Capello had the team purring and they were among the favourites to win the tournament. An underwhelming 1-1 draw with America was followed by a goalless draw with Algeria, where England looked poor. Fans made their feelings known and the camera panned to Rooney at full-time as he let loose.",
      "\"Nice to see your own fans booing you, you football 'supporters',\" he remarked. The heat was on him. A win over Slovenia meant England made it into the last 16, but there they were hammered by Germany to end a tournament that will not be looked upon positively in history.",
      "Despite the international disappointment, at club level Rooney was the talisman and perhaps that is why he felt he had the stature to go in and ask Ferguson what his plans was in the transfer market. It was a conversation that would get heated, leading to an argument with the Scot as his authority was questioned. Rooney would then hand in a transfer request as he called the club's ambition into question. Years later he stands by his approach. \"I still think I had a right to ask the question,\" he said recently.",
      "Rooney would later reconcile with Ferguson, agreeing a new deal that would see him stay at United for his peak years. The Premier League success of 2013 would be his last before David Moyes, his manager at Everton, was appointed to replace Ferguson as the Manchester managerial merry-go-round began.",
      "Rooney played under three managers in his final four years in Manchester, which saw him claim a further three major trophies. The landmark moment of his career came in January 2017. He scored at Stoke to surpass Sir Charlton’s all-time goalscoring record, stepping up four minutes into stoppage time to score his 250th goal for the club with a stunning free-kick.",
      "It was the second major record Rooney had to his name. In 2015 he became England's all-time leading goalscorer after scoring his 50th international goal in a 2-0 win over Switzerland at Wembley. He would end his Three Lions career with 53 international goals.",
      "But the man who looked destined to conquer the world at Euro 2004 never delivered on that promise. England would lose in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012, fail to make it out of the group at the World Cup in 2014 and endured the embarrassment of a last 16 loss to Iceland at Euro 2016 - Rooney's final major tournament.",
      "The striker left Manchester in the summer of 2017 with a total of 253 goals to his name, returning to Everton for a year. It was a feel good homecoming, but ultimately a short-lived once as he headed to the MLS with DC United before heading to Championship side Derby, which began his route into management.",
      "Rooney has now had four managerial gigs and, it is fair to say the jury is still out. If anything its veering against him. Plenty of England's recent 'Golden Generation' have turned their hand at management with mixed results.",
      "Rooney, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard are among those to swap the pitch for the dugout following retirement. But the United legend has a CV that's seen him preside over Derby's relegation, albeit one influenced by huge points deductions and a lack of funds.",
      "A return to DC United provided a chance to make a name for himself away from the English spotlight, but he won just 14 of 53 games before mutually leaving the MLS outfit. Just four days after that exit and Birmingham City, newly taken over by an American consortium, trusted Rooney to lead their drive up the football pyramid.",
      "Instead quite the opposite occurred. Rooney's two wins from 15 games pushed Birmingham into a relegation battle, one they couldn't overcome. The Championship drop zone has become an unwanted home for Rooney. After Derby and Birmingham he took over at Plymouth.",
      "The Pilgrims would follow a familiar pattern and, even though they sacked Rooney midway through the season, he'd left the new manager with plenty to do and they now find themselves in League One.",
      "Wife Coleen, who Rooney has been with since school, wasn't sold on Rooney taking over at Plymouth. Rumours claim she also struggled when her husband had his managerial stint in America.",
      "Despite a number of off-field scandals that have seen Rooney placed on the front page, as well as the back page, she's stuck by him. Among the England icon's issues were alcohol abuse and he recently told his friend and former teammate Rio Ferdinand he would \"drink for two days straight\" at the peak of his career.",
      "Rooney admitted his 39-year-old wife \"helped me control that massively\" and \"managed me because I needed managing\". \"I honestly believe, if she weren't there, I'd be dead,\" he said.",
      "The footballer turned manager has attributed Coleen with making huge interventions during his life. He said: \"I've made mistakes in the past which are well documented and whatever but I'm a little bit different at times and she keeps me on that path and she's done it for 20-odd years.\"",

      "Alan Shearer believes Marcus Rashford has had to change his attitude while on loan at Barcelona. The England international joined the La Liga heavyweights on a season-long loan deal over the summer after Ruben Amorim made it clear he had no place in his plans at Manchester United.",
      "Barcelona have an option to make the switch permanent for £30million in 2026 and are said to be keen on keeping him beyond this campaign, albeit at a reduced fee. The 27-year-old has rediscovered his best form at the Camp Nou, bagging four goals and laying on six assists in all competitions under Hansi Flick this term.",
      "His resurgence has earned him a spot back in the England setup. And Shearer has now delivered his assessment of Rashford's spell in Spain, insisting the academy product has no route back to M16 regardless of what unfolds.",
      "\"I don't think anyone ever denied the talent that Marcus Rashford has, it's just whether he had the desire or the hunger to go and produce that talent on the big stage,\" he told Betfair.",
      "The former Newcastle striker also claimed Rashford 'got away' with certain behaviour at United and has been forced to sharpen up his approach.",
      "\"He knew moving to Barcelona that he couldn't get away with certain things which he might have got away with at Manchester United. Not with the big-hitters there and the manager of that team.",
      "\"I know they've got an incredible amount of players from the academy, but because of what the club is, I guess he'd gone there with the right attitude and shown everyone the ability we all knew he had.",
      "\"We saw that a few years ago when he got 30 goals in a season and he's showing that again now. It was just about unlocking it in him. But the ship has sailed for him to return to Man United.\"",
      "Rashford netted twice as his side thrashed Olympiacos 6-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday evening. After the match, he revealed the prospect of featuring in El Clasico against Real Madrid this weekend played a major role in his summer switch to Barcelona.",
      "\"The Clasico is a great game and that's why I've come here, for this number of games,\" he said. \"I am looking forward to it, I hope we win.\"",
      "Rashford made it clear on Thursday night that he wants to remain at with Barcelona in the long term. \"Oh yeah, for sure,\" he said, when asked whether he wants to stay.",
      "\"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player it's an honour.\"",

But people change. People grow up. People learn from their mistakes. Even those who have lived out most of their lives in the public spotlight.",

Rooney has taken his family to the UAE, where he is holding some coaching clinics with star struck kids.",
      "Is it really 24 years ago Rooney introduced himself to English football with a stunning goal for Everton against Arsenal at Goodison Park? He was 16 - and life felt sweet.",
      "Not least when he went on to join United - and elevated himself to becoming the greatest player of his generation. A teenage tearaway from Croxteth who became a global superstar.",

      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Rooney became England and United's greatest ever goalscorer. And he remains England's most capped outfield player. But with all the brilliance came some bad choices.",
      "He could go from sweet to sour in the blink of an eye, making headlines on the front pages as well as the back. For a decade, he was one of the most famous and infamous footballers on the planet.",
      "Since retirement he has tried his hand at management, and is now forging a successful career as a pundit. He has his own BBC podcast, and is an integral part of the 'Match of the Day' team. His views are engaging and intelligent, spawned from a playing career which saw his footballing brain work faster than most of those he came up against.",
      "His long-time agent, Paul Stretford, has been on the rollercoaster ride from the beginning. Stratford still believes Rooney remains underrated, but is proud of the man he has now become.",
      "He said: \"Look back to that day he signed his first major professional contract with Everton and his introduction to the world and the media. Then see the person that stands there now, who is aware of his place in the world and he’s self-assured of what that place is.",
      "\"I don't think too many people gave much chance of that being the case all of those years ago. He’s faced demons, he’s faced challenges, but each and every step along the way, whenever they’ve come along, he’s faced them full on and dealt with them and come out the other side.",
      "\"I think he's been under-appreciated throughout his career and it’s the misfortune of being on both ends of the paper, both the front and back pages. That undoubtedly shaped opinion in the formative stages and even to this day.",
      "\"Coleen has been such a rock for Wayne and the family generally, and now they can spend more time together and enjoy that aspect of their life.",
      "\"I would say at 40 he’s ended up very much in a good place, whereas a lot of us at 40 are thinking, ‘Oh, well, that’s my young days gone, it’s all downhill from here’.",
      "\"Do you know what he’ll be doing on his birthday? He’ll be coaching kids in Dubai.",

      "With the loaned-out Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir failing to convince under Ruben Amorim, Lammens arrived on transfer deadline day from Belgian outfit Royal Antwerp for £18.2million.",
      "The keeper was anticipated to claim the number one spot in goal and following an adjustment period, he made his bow against Sunderland in a 2-0 triumph. Lammens kept a clean sheet on his debut and delivered a vital yet low-key performance in United's 2-1 success over Liverpool last weekend.",
      "His personality mirrors this quiet approach. He has allegedly forbidden any talk of clean sheets before matches as he considers it unlucky. This superstition extends to team-mates and relatives.",
      "Double Premier League winner Lescott has encouraged Lammens to maintain his inconspicuous presence as this signals excellent goalkeeping displays.",
      "\"I think defensive players and goalkeepers, the more unnoticed they go in the game, the better they're performing,\" said Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet.",

      "\"If you're not talking about Lammens, it's a good thing. It's a positive. I think after like five or six games, all of a sudden, 'Oh, he's been in goal.' Then you're like, 'Yeah, he has done all right.'",
      "\"It's the same with defenders. I mean, when you hear their names in the press, they're up to no good. They have either scored or they've been sent off. I don't want that. I just want to go under the radar.\"",
      "Lammens wasn't the sole new arrival that caught Lescott's eye during the clash with Liverpool. Matheus Cunha, who joined Old Trafford for £62.5m this summer, operated as a central striker at Anfield and troubled the Reds' backline.",
      "It was his movement without the ball that particularly impressed Lescott. He added: \"Cunha showed that it's important that forward strikers score but highlighted the importance of their role.",
      "\"Ball retention, I think that it is probably one of the most underrated things a striker has to do and be good at. Do you know what I mean?",
      "\"I think the ability to keep possession and just relieve pressure, get the team on the pitch, whether you're travelling or just holding the ball up and occupying that position and player. Cunha was top.\"",

      "Manchester United will make adding a midfielder a priority the next time they go to market with Carlos Baleba and Conor Gallagher among six players they are considering a move for.",
      "Ruben Amorim spent much of his summer budget on his frontline, which meant there was a lack of funds to land someone in the middle of the park. United's options there have question marks over them with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes deployed as the preferred two so far this term.",
      "But Casemiro's contract is winding down, Fernandes continues to be linked with a lucrative exit and youngster Kobbie Mainoo has not yet proven himself under Amorim amid talk he too could be moved on.",
      "Brighton's Baleba was linked with a £100million move to Old Trafford in the summer, but the transfer never got off the ground. He has seen his form dip this term at the Amex but remains a player on United's shortlist following a stunning debut campaign.",
      "Ex-Chelsea skipper Gallagher was linked with a loan move to Manchester but Atletico Madrid are only interested in a permanent sale. His minutes have declined this season and he's open to a return to England, but the type of deal may prove a major hurdle.",
      "Two of England's next generation are also on United's radar. Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson have both enjoyed meteoric rises and are set to be part of the Three Lions' World Cup efforts, which will only see their stock rise even further.",
      "Wharton is tied down with Crystal Palace until 2029 and has shown no desire to leave with the Eagles likely to demand a mammoth fee if he ever was sold. It is a similar situation with Anderson and Nottingham Forest, despite their struggles. Newcastle have been linked with a return for Anderson, who also appears focused on his football despite talk of a move to bigger things.",

Stiller has a release clause of around £35m, but Stuttgart can pay a fee in the region of £1.5m to remove that from his contract.",

      "Wayne Rooney is unable to watch his son, Kai, play for Manchester United due to his own intense fame. The teenager, 15, is the oldest child of Rooney and wife Coleen, who share three other younger sons - Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai, a forward like his legendary father, joined the academy of the Red Devils in 2016 as he followed in the footsteps of Rooney Sr, who celebrates his 40th birthday today. While there's a long way to go for the teen in his journey to the top-flight, he is regarded as a highly-rated talent at Old Trafford.",
      "Unfortunately for the ex-England captain, he'll have to watch his matches from a distance after it was revealed the budding young talent told his father that he's not allowed to go to his games, because of the sheer amount of attention he receives.",
      "The revelation was made public during Coleen's time on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. The 39-year-old finished runner-up in the popular reality show to McFly singer Danny Jones and it was when she was in camp that she opened up about the sad decision her son opted to make.",
      "\"That’s the thing with kids I think, it’s hard to go on days out,\" Coleen said last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn’t even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, ‘Go away, I'm watching my son?’ Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, ‘Oh, dad there’s no point you coming because you don’t even watch me play anyway.’ Which is sad, but it can’t be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "While he may not be on the touchline while Kai is in action, he still plays a huge role in his footballing education. Rooney previously admitted he tends to leave the coaching to the club's staff but makes sure to pass off words of wisdom to his sons when practising at home.",
      "It was during last month's edition of The Wayne Rooney Show that the 40-year-old said: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he said to Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Given Kai's status as the son of one of England's greatest-ever players, Rooney praised his mental strength for dealing with added pressure and attention that comes with being his son.",
      "During the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney said to BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim and Manchester United will aim to maintain their momentum when they face Brighton on Saturday. The Portuguese manager's side pulled off a brilliant win against rivals Liverpool last time out.",
      "Despite a dire start to the season, United's results have begun to improve. They have won three of their last four league matches and calls for head coach Amorim to be replaced have have quietened – for the time being, at least.",
      "Their 2-1 victory at Anfield last weekend seemed to be a turning point and it is hoped this momentum can carry forward to their clash with the Seagulls. Matheus Cunha, who arrived this summer for £62.5million from Wolves, impressed on Merseyside.",
      "Cunha played a pivotal role in United's victory over Liverpool and head coach Amorim explained why after the clash. He said: \"Sometimes the characteristics of the game change the way you are going to approach the game, so I think, for example, Cunha in the middle.",
      "\"If we put Ben [Sesko], I think it's easier for these centre-backs to control our striker. Especially in the bad moments, you have to go with your gut. And I always go by that, no matter what.\"",
      "As well as making an impact on the field, it appears Cunha is doing the same off it. According to The Sun, the Brazilian has cut a friendly figure behind the scenes and is providing good for morale at Old Trafford. They claim that Cunha has been well received by members of staff and is very pleasant to all, while one source said he has been \"great around the place.\"",
      "It is also said he has struck up a friendship with Luke Shaw and is much more extroverted than fellow summer signing Bryan Mbeumo, who joined from Brentford.",
      "Cunha's international team-mate Casemiro started the match at Anfield and wasn't afraid to dish out some heavy challenges. Just before the hour mark, he went into the book and he was replaced by Manuel Ugarte a minute later.",
      "The holding midfielder has started six of United's eight league games but has been no stranger to a booking. So far, he has been shown three yellow cards and was sent off in the win against Chelsea after being booked twice.",
      "Casemiro missed the loss against Brentford as he served a one-match suspension but Amorim could soon be given another headache to deal with. The Brazilian has technically been shown five yellows this season already.",
      "Aside from the Chelsea and Liverpool cards, he was also shown a yellow in the win against Sunderland and the draw against Fulham. He is now in the somewhat risky predicament of only needing two more cautions for another one-match ban. He will have until the 19th game of the season to avoid two bookings too, which is a tall order for a player of his tendencies.",
      "Harry Maguire bagged a late winner against Liverpool, which capped off an impeccable performance at the back. The English defender has endured tough spells at Old Trafford and Peter Crouch claims he's been made a villain.",
      "\"I'm just really, really pleased for Maguire,\" Crouch said on That Peter Crouch Podcast. \"Throughout my career, there have been points where I've been low and I've had a lot of grief, a lot of stick, so I kind of know what that's like.",
      "\"For him to get that amount of grief, it was above and beyond what is acceptable, I think. Attacking his family, his personality, the way he looks, everything was wrong about the way he's been villainised at that club.",
      "\"I just think it shows absolutely massive b******s to consistently go [and perform]. Even the game against Liverpool, it was like, 'Ah, why is he playing?' There's always this whole thing of being down on him starting.\"",

      "United paid an initial £20million, which later rose to £27m, for Rooney after he demonstrated his world-class ability for England during Euro 2004. The young striker had already made waves in the Premier League with his spectacular goal for Everton against Arsenal in October 2002 and his career only continued to soar at United.",
      "Despite the high-profile transfer, Rooney took it all in stride, even scoring a Champions League hat-trick on his debut in a 6-2 victory over Fenerbahce. His fearlessness extended beyond the pitch, as former United captain Keane recalled an incident where the young forward cheekily wound him up during an early away trip.",
      "The event occurred on the eve of United's 3-1 away win over Newcastle in November 2004. Keane was watching rugby on TV in the team hotel when he briefly left the room, only to return and find that someone had changed the channel.",
      "When Keane confronted his teammates, no one confessed until Rooney stepped forward on the morning of the match. However, it proved to be a rare row between the two United icons.",
      "\"We were in a hotel, the Friday night before a game – I forget where,\" Keane explained in his 2014 autobiography The Second Half. \"The team would always sit down and have a meal together. There was a big TV in the room.",
      "\"I was into rugby league, and there was a big game on. I went to the toilet, came back and someone had changed the channel to something stupid. I can't remember what it was. A few of the players were sitting there, giggling away.",
      "\"I said, 'Where's the rugby league?' I knew Wayne was up to something. I said, 'Where's the remote control?' He said, 'I don't know.' I said, 'You f****** do'. I didn't exactly storm out, but I couldn't be bothered trying to get the remote control back, so I decided I'd watch the rest of the match up in my room.",
      "\"I came down the next morning for the pre-match meal and Wayne was brave enough to come up to me. 'Did you ever find the remote control, Roy?' I think I told him to go and f*** himself. It was the only disagreement I ever had with him.\"",
      "The wind-up appeared to help bring the duo closer together. Rooney shared similar memories to Keane, though United's record goalscorer believed the clash actually improved how the captain saw him.",
      "\"I always remember my first away trip, having that argument with Roy Keane,\" Rooney recalled in 2018. \"We were watching the rugby before we were playing Newcastle away.",
      "\"He went to get some food, so I put X-Factor on and hid the remote. He wasn't happy about it and we had an argument. But I think straight away, he respected me more for standing up to him.\"",
      "This unconventional pre-match routine seemed to work wonders for Rooney, who bagged a double at St James' Park, with Ruud van Nistelrooy also scoring from the spot. Rooney's debut season saw him net 17 times in all competitions, helping United to a third-place finish in the league and reaching the FA Cup final, where they were defeated by Arsenal on penalties.",

Garnacho, 20, severed all ties at Old Trafford when he publicly criticised Ruben Amorim's choice to side-line him for the Europa League final.",
      "The United boss, furious with Garnacho lashing out at him so publicly, reportedly told him, in front of team-mates: \"You better hope you have a good agent this summer.\"",
      "Garnacho did eventually get his move to west London, which was secured through a £40million deal. However, he has yet to make a significant impact, failing to score or assist in any of his appearances and was left warming the bench when his side lost 2-1 on his return to Old Trafford.",

      "In the Champions League, boss Enzo Maresca could have handed Garnacho an ideal chance to get off the mark for the Blues but opted against it. Despite Chelsea leading a 10-man Ajax 4-1 at half time, Maresca chose to bring on Tyrique George and Reggie Walsh, as well as Andrey Santos, Trevoh Chalobah and Josh Acheampong, leaving Garnacho as an unused substitute.",
      "While there have been glimpses of promise from him, he is yet to truly shine. Looking back at his performances for the UEFA Conference League winners, it's easy to recall Parker's remarks from June.",
      "The former United defender said at the time: \"I also think it would be a bad decision for both him and Chelsea if he went there.",
      "\"He needs a bit of fresh air. He needs a change of environment, and I think he could benefit from a move to another country.\"",
      "The ex-United star added: \"He doesn't have the right attitude and he doesn't want to put in enough work. I don't think that ever will change.\"",
      "During Chelsea's 3-0 away triumph over Nottingham Forest in the Premier League, Garnacho was given a starting role on the left flank. As the west Londoners found themselves struggling against the home team, he was withdrawn and substituted by Jamie Gittens.",
      "Chelsea attacker Pedro Neto looked clearly annoyed with the South American's failure to get onto the end of multiple crosses to the far post. Former England international Peter Crouch spotted this and commended Maresca's choice to substitute the ex-United star.",
      "He said: \"Chelsea were a bit sloppy. Credit to Enzo for making those changes. I know Neto was really frustrated with him [Garnacho]. He was crossing the ball and not getting on the other side. Neto was really frustrated with him.\"",

      "Manchester United's Marcus Rashford, currently on loan at Barcelona, has disclosed that he had previously held discussions with the La Liga giants but a move didn't come to fruition until this year.",
      "Following a stint at Aston Villa last season, Rashford made a summer switch to Barcelona on a season-long loan. After making a splash when first breaking into the first team picture at United, Rashford found himself sidelined under Ruben Amorim, prompting his departures from the club. However, he has now revealed that this wasn't the first time a possible transfer to Barcelona had been on the cards.",
      "\"I just believe that things happen when they're supposed to happen,\" he shared with ESPN. \"It's not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn't happen in the past and now is my opportunity to make it happen.",
      "\"I feel like there's no time like the present now. So I just take things day to day. The key thing for me is just to continue to improve because when you retire, you're going to miss everything - the good stuff, the bad stuff - you're going to miss it about the sport.",
      "\"Every day I just take it day by day and just try to improve from the day before.\"",
      "Barcelona have the option to make Rashford's move permanent in the summer, although Spanish media outlet Sport reports that the club are prepared to bide their time before making a decision on a potential transfer. Rashford has made his intentions clear regarding his future, expressing his desire to remain at the club beyond his loan spell and stating that it's an 'honour' to wear the shirt.",
      "\"Oh yeah, for sure,\" he confirmed when asked if he wishes to stay. \"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player, it's an honour.\"",
      "After netting twice in Barcelona's recent Champions League match against Olympiacos, Rashford will be aiming to make a similar impact in his first Clasico showdown this weekend as Barca head to Real Madrid.",
      "Ahead of the match, Rashford has shared his thoughts on his move from United to Barcelona: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United.",
      "\"So sometimes you just need a change. I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney and Peter Crouch reckon Harry Maguire has been unfairly treated during his time at Manchester United. The 32-year-old centre-back faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford after entering the final 12 months of his deal.",
      "From January, foreign clubs will be eligible to approach Maguire about a free transfer in the summer – unless he puts pen to paper on fresh terms beforehand. Should the England international refuse to sign an extension, United will face a tough call.",
      "The Red Devils must weigh up whether to let Maguire walk away for nothing at the season's end or cash in during the January window for a small portion of the £80m they splashed out for his services back in 2019. The Daily Mail reports that United are in discussions with the player regarding a new contract, although no formal offer has been tabled yet.",
      "The report claims that any prospect of Maguire accepting reduced wages would depend on the specifics of the deal, particularly the duration of the contract. Despite bailing out the Red Devils on countless occasions in the past, Rooney and Crouch feel the Englishman has been harshly treated and have taken umbrage at comments aimed at him by his critics.",
      "Speaking on his podcast after United's 2-1 triumph over Liverpool, Rooney said: \"Today shows why he should be in the World Cup squad. And I really mean that. I think he's so important.",
      "\"I think with Harry, I would really struggle to have dealt with what he's been through. You know, he was a meme for years. I've seen him in Parliament over in Africa somewhere, where he's getting brought up in that, and they're laughing at him.",
      "\"So for him to have dealt with so much, he's incredibly strong-minded to have gone through that. Then, getting the armband taken off him, and people laughing at him.\"",
      "Rooney added: \"You're like, this guy has been in World Cup teams of the tournament and been incredible for England, been really good for Man United, and it's completely unfair, and it was bullying.",
      "\"He was getting bullied from all over the place, and for him to have dealt with that and got through it and stuck with it, you'd have to say, 'You know what, that's a strong human being'.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"And for him to get through that and his family to get through that and come out the other side and show his ability and quality and strength, I couldn't be happier for him.\"",
      "Echoing Rooney's sentiments, Crouch said on his podcast: \"I'm just really, really pleased for him. Throughout my career, there have been points where I've been low and I've had a lot of grief, a lot of stick, so I kind of know what that's like.",
      "\"For him to get that amount of grief, it was above and beyond what is acceptable, I think. Attacking his family, his personality, the way he looks, everything was wrong about the way he's been villainised at that club.\"",
      "Crouch continued: \"I just think it shows absolutely massive b******* to consistently to go [and perform]. Even the game against Liverpool, it was like, 'Ah, why's he playing? !' There's always this whole thing of being down on him starting.",
      "\"Listen, there have been times where he hasn't been good enough and that's been called out, but I think the stick went beyond football. When he scored... genuinely, I don't want to see any Manchester United player score.",
      "\"But when it was him, I kind of half had a feeling of, 'Good for him, he kind of deserves this,' and I think there's a lot of the football community that feel that way.\"",

      "The England international has started superbly in Catalunya, scoring five goals and laying on six assists in 12 appearances, mostly as a winger. Barcelona had been interested in signing Rashford on multiple occasions since he made his United debut in 2016, but they finally got a deal over the line this summer.",
      "His new team-mate, Yamal, knew all about him, having played as his character on the video game franchise FIFA (now called EA Sports FC) when he was growing up. \"When Lamine found out that Barcelona were interested in Rashford he said, 'Get him! Get him!',\" Spanish football reporter Guillem Balague revealed on Match of the Day.",
      "\"Because he used to play as him on the PlayStation. He said, 'He's so good, he's so fast'. Everybody loves him.\"",

      "\"Maybe Ronaldo Nazario... To have that influence on the pitch at such a young age and on such a consistent basis is incredible. He has a long career ahead of him, and I hope he maintains his level and even improves.\"",

Hansi Flick's side are the reigning La Liga champions and dominated their rivals last term, winning all four meetings in league and cup, but are two points behind Real after nine games.",

Gabriel, who's just 15, confirmed on social media that he trained alongside United's senior pros for the first time, as they prepare to face Brighton on Saturday.",
      "The winger, whose style of play has been compared to his idol, Neymar, was handed a two-year deal at Old Trafford in June. Technical director Jason Wilcox played a role in the discussions that led to Gabriel committing his future, which is unusual for a player his age.",
      "A star for England at under-15 level, Gabriel caught Amorim's attention when the United boss was shown clips of his progress in pre-season. Amorim was impressed and met him in person.",
      "Gabriel watched the Red Devils' opening game of the season, a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, from the directors' box at Old Trafford. The 15-year-old was informed that he'd occasionally be part of first-team training sessions - and now the first one has come.",

      "Manchester United coaches reportedly believe Benjamin Sesko is a major upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund. Sesko, 22, endured a slow start to life at Old Trafford after his £74million move from RB Leipzig.",
      "The Slovenian had to settle for cameos from the bench in his first three Premier League matches and struggled to make an impact. However, he scored in United's 3-1 loss to Brentford and found the net in the 2-0 home victory over Sunderland just before the international break.",
      "While Sesko was finding it difficult to find his feet, Hojlund was making an immediate impact on loan at Napoli, scoring four goals in his first six matches, including a brace in the Serie A winners' 2-1 home victory over Sporting Lisbon. Despite the Dane performing admirably in Italy, many of Amorim's backroom team are convinced Sesko is a much better player.",
      "According to the Sun, United staff have been 'stressing' how much of an 'upgrade' the ex-Leipzig man is compared to Hojlund. While the Dane is further ahead in the goal standings, Ruben Amorim and coaches felt his work off the ball was a 'major concern'. However, they are said to be happy with Sesko's performance in this regard.",
      "It's also claimed that Sesko's awareness and distribution have drawn praise from the United staff. In his final season in the Bundesliga, Sesko helped himself to 13 goals and five assists, while also scoring four goals in eight Champions League appearances.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund contributed 10 goals and four assists, with nine of his goal contributions coming in their Europa League campaign. The ex-Atalanta forward was initially hoping to fight for his place at United and believed he could convince Amorim to start him.",
      "When it was clear the club did not want to give him any more opportunities, he managed to secure a move to Naples, where he is working under Antonio Conte. In the summer, United icon Paul Scholes said the club should have kept Hojlund in their squad.",
      "The former midfielder said: \"I'd keep Hojlund. I know he's not been great but he's a 22-year-old kid who has been asked to play centre-forward for Manchester United on his own for the last two years.",
      "\"He's had to play every week. He's the only one there. He's a 22-year-old kid. With the way they play, Man United should have at least three top centre-forwards, and I'd bring him into that.",
      "\"He's struggled like mad of late, especially, but he's not got the chance to sit down and watch. If a striker is not doing well, no confidence, the manager sits you down and says, 'Have a look, get a bit of hunger back, a bit of feeling back for the game.' We all know he has got centre-forward qualities, we've seen it.\"",
      "Despite the United coaches' thoughts on Sesko, Amorim still opted not to start him against Liverpool. Instead, the Portuguese boss deployed summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in a front three, with Mason Mount being the third forward.",
      "It worked perfectly as Mbeumo was able to get in behind the Liverpool backline and score, while Cunha also linked play brilliantly. Sesko came on from the bench and was played through one-on-one, only for a spectacular last-ditch tackle from Ibrahima Konate to stop him from taking a shot.",
      "He could get his chance to add to his tally of two goals this season when United take on Brighton on Saturday night.",

      "Bruno Fernandes might well be the best signing Manchester United have made in the last decade.",
      "Fernandes, who has been inspirational for United since arriving in 2020 from Sporting Lisbon, will make his 300th appearance this weekend when Ruben Amorim's side host Brighton at Old Trafford. But the landmark occasion might never have happened, had certain individuals at United panicked over a video of Fernandes losing his temper.",
      "Here is the exclusive story of how United lured the Portuguese international to Old Trafford, a move which involved countless phone calls, a private jet, red carpet and getting the better of Barcelona.",
      "Fernandes came onto United's radar in 2018, having emerged as one of the brightest talents in the Primeira Liga. And in the September of that year, United's recruitment department, along with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, decided the midfielder would be targeted the following summer.",
      "The problem was, Sporting didn't want to sell Fernandes, resulting in the Portuguese club refusing to name a price.",
      "But Ed Woodward, who was United CEO at the time, would not be put off, despite a bizarre meeting at Carrington which threatened to scupper a future move for Fernandes.",
      "One which saw United's head of recruitment play a video to all those in the room of Fernandes kicking in Sporting's dressing room door, having been sent off in a game against Boavista.",
      "A club source recalls: \"The internal debate was about his temperament. That he was too hot headed. He was a risk. He couldn't control himself.\"",
      "But Woodward loved the passion Fernandes showed. He recalled what Sir Alex Ferguson had once said about wanting players to be humble off the pitch, but firebrands on it. He thought Fernandes's attitude was perfect for United.",
      "He also knew he had a very close relationship with Sporting president Federico Varandas. Countless dialogue started to take place between both men, with Varandas warming to the prospect of getting almost £50m in return for selling Fernandes.",
      "Barcelona and Tottenham were also interested in signing Fernandes, but the player only had eyes for United. United were desperate to keep the signing a closely guarded secret, but news started to leak out back in Lisbon.",
      "So United sent a delegation to the Portuguese capital at the start of 2020, to get a deal over the line.",
      "United were willing to go to £55m, but Varandas accepted £47m instead, due to the goodwill which existed between both clubs.",
      "United had bagged themselves a 'bargain'.",
      "Fernandes flew to Manchester on a private jet, accompanied by senior figures from United, and couldn't keep the smile off his face. Fernandes grew up watching United games on TV back home in Maia, close to Porto. He'd had a lifelong dream to play for them one day. And it showed once he made that dream come true.",
      "A club insider said: \"He was very keen to come. He arrived at the training ground and he was beaming. He wanted to meet everyone and have a good look around the place. He couldn't be happier. We laid out the red carpet for him.",
      "\"He couldn't wait to get started. He looked like someone who had United's DNA inside him. And he's gone on to represent the club with distinction ever since. He's had a great attitude.",
      "\"He's been engaging with supporters, he signs so much stuff when he's asked to. He would walk into any environment and be super comfortable. He'd own the room. He's had a great attitude. He would run through walls for Manchester United.\"",

      "Looking back to when he first broke the news to Victoria that he was planning to restore derelict barns into a new family home, he told Country Life magazine: \"To begin with, Victoria wasn't over the moon about it, as we'd only just done up our house in Holland Park, so how I feel about the countryside started earlier than it did with my family.\"",
      "However, as plans went ahead to convert the dilapidated Oxfordshire barns, the former England international recalled the desperate rush to put the finishing touches on their new home before his wife and kids saw it for the first time: \"I can still remember the morning when Victoria and the children were all due to arrive to see the refurbished barns for the first time. It was still a complete mess.\"",
      "And, despite Victoria's initial concerns about moving into the new property, he revealed how Victoria broke down in tears, as she finally stepped foot in the property: \"Then I waited at the front door with a glass of wine for Victoria to arrive. And, the moment she walked in, she burst out crying because she couldn’t believe how perfect it was.\"",
      "Besides his newly renovated Oxfordshire barns, Sir David and Victoria have also raised their family of six at their stunning Grade II-listed Holland Park mansion, a property in Miami, as well as a penthouse in Miami's One Thousand Museum building.",

The Brazil ace has been a mainstay in United's starting line-up this season, featuring in six of their first eight league matches, with his only absence being the 3-1 defeat to Brentford - due to a ban already served.",
      "Casemiro found himself in hot water after receiving two yellow cards, leading to a red card during the 2-1 triumph over Chelsea in September. Despite previous doubts about his ability to still perform at the highest level, manager Ruben Amorim has chosen to pair the 33-year-old with Bruno Fernandes in midfield this term.",
      "However, with a packed fixture list ahead for the Red Devils, they could be left ruing the loss of their seasoned midfielder for a match. According to Premier League regulations, a player will serve a one-match ban if they accumulate five yellow cards within the first 19 games of the season - and that is still some way off right now.",
      "Alarmingly, despite only playing seven matches, Casemiro has already been shown five cards this campaign; three of which count as bookings because the other two led to his dismissal. He was cautioned in the first half of the 1-1 stalemate at Fulham and then saw two yellows in the victory over Chelsea.",
      "After serving his initial one-match suspension, the 80-cap Brazil international found himself in the referee's book in consecutive matches against Sunderland and Liverpool, meaning just two more warnings will result in him sitting out another match. If Casemiro receives a booking in Saturday's fixture against Brighton and the subsequent one at Nottingham Forest, he'll be ruled out of the crucial journey to Tottenham Hotspur on 8 November.",
      "After 19 matches, the threshold will increase to 10 yellow cards, meaning any player who accumulates that by the 32nd matchday will face a two-match ban. To date, only Everton's Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has served a one-match suspension for five yellow cards.",
      "Should Casemiro accumulate two more yellow cards, Amorim will have no choice but to call upon either Manuel Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo from his midfield reserves. Previously, the Portuguese suggested that the latter is vying with Fernandes, implying that Ugarte is likely to be the first choice.",
      "It has led to Mainoo being linked with a move away from United. Reports have suggested that Napoli are keen to reunite him with Scott McTominay in Naples on loan.",
      "However, Amorim has refused to entertain any suggestion that the 10-cap England international will be allowed to leave when the January transfer window opens. \"That is normal, and I also know that in our club, everything is a lot of noise, and you have to have news, and players are not playing,\" Amorim said. \"They want to play.",
      "\"Like you said, there's a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So, I understand that, but they're our players, and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will address the media this afternoon ahead of the Premier League clash with Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "United are looking to make it three straight Premier League victories this weekend after beating Liverpool last time out.",
      "Amorim will be asked to give an injury update and provide some early team news heading into the clash.",
      "Transfers may also come up this afternoon following news that Joshua Zirkzee will be looking to seal an exit away from Old Trafford in January.",
      "A win for United this weekend would put them back in the mix for Europe qualification. The Reds sit ninth in the table after last Sunday's win, having taken 13 points from their opening eight games. They are just two points behind Liverpool and a win this weekend would see them continue to build on the momentum of recent weeks.",
      "Follow all the updates from Amorim's press conference below...",
      "Hurzeler was asked in his press conference about United's inconsistencies under Amorim but Hurzeler was keen only to praise the Portuguese head coach.",
      "It's not my job to comment on that but the only thing I can say is that I am really looking forward to competing against one of the best managers. I think he is one of the best, of course he's not in an easy phase with Manchester but he's proved in the past how good he can be. Why can't they win three games in a row? I don't know because I'm not there.",
      "Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler has been speaking to the media this morning and had this to say on United:",
      "I think they are playing more direct and more vertical style so more long balls trying to target [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Benjamin] Sesko, trying to win the second balls and continue on the wing. Trying to attack the box with deep runs and of course they have a lot of individual qualities. They can change the game with one action. No matter who it is. They are a danger for us and we have to be staying alive for 90 minutes because they can score from every phase.",
      "Every United player who took to the field on Sunday against Liverpool played their part in the victory and created special memories for the fanbase who travelled perhaps more in hope than expectation.",
      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "On Thursday, MEN Sport reported that Zirkzee was aiming to leave United in the January transfer window. It is understood that the Dutchman is keen to gain more minutes to revitalise his career.",
      "The World Cup next summer is likely to be a driving factor for the centre-forward who has not been called up for the Netherlands since November 2024. While he wants to remain in the Premier League, he would also be open to a move to another European club.",
      "West Ham are thought to be leading the way at the moment.",
      "Read more >>>",
      "United are looking strong at present ahead of the clash with Brighton.",
      "Mazraoui was a doubt heading into the Liverpool game but he managed to be fit enough to make the bench. Martinez is expected to be the only player missing from the squad again.",
      "However, he is closing in on a return in November.",
      "Amorim will address the media this afternoon at 1.15pm. However, what he says will be embargoed until 1.30pm.",
      "Once that embargo lifts, we shall bring you everything he spoke about in the first part of his press conference.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live blog of Amorim's pre-Brighton press conference.",
      "We will bring you everything he has to say this afternoon ahead of the Brighton clash, including team news and injury updates as United look to make it three wins in a row after last Sunday's excellent 2-1 win over Liverpool.",
      "Stay tuned for updates..."

      "Manchester United's interest in Carlos Baleba didn't last long in the summer transfer window.",
      "Brighton valued Baleba at around £100million, which made it tricky for United to finance a deal, and they outlined that they were \"very confident\" he would remain at the Amex Stadium.",
      "The Seagulls had planned to have Baleba for at least another season. United sources eventually said the midfield was not a priority due to already having squad options viewed as strong and versatile.",
      "Baleba was considered at one stage in the summer transfer window, though, and United may have made an offer for the 21-year-old if they hadn't already spent a hefty sum.",
      "United prioritised overhauling their attack and signing Senne Lammens. They were happy to delay their interest in signing a midfielder until next summer, so will Baleba be revisited at the end of the season?",
      "There is potential for interest in Baleba to be reignited next summer, although his performances this season have not been great, which might raise a few concerns.",
      "Baleba was substituted at half-time against Everton in August and didn't look like a player worth £100m when he came off the bench against Bournemouth in September.",
      "Speaking after Bournemouth, Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler admitted he was struggling. \"I think it’s normal for a young player when the media creates the noise around him,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s not easy for this player to handle it. Therefore, we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance.",
      "\"But he’s a young player and I think that’s something we have to accept, that young players don’t always have the face we want to see. It’s our responsibility to help them in the right moments.\"",
      "When asked specifically if the interest from United had affected the midfielder, the Brighton boss added: \"I think everyone gets affected, especially when you are that young and you hear these kinds of things, no matter if they are wrong or right. But it’s just noise we don’t need.\"",
      "Baleba must improve and put an underwhelming start to the campaign behind him if he wants to earn a move to Old Trafford, where he will make an appearance on Saturday evening.",
      "It wouldn't be a surprise to see Baleba deliver his best performance of the season in Manchester this weekend, given Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox will be present in the directors' box.",
      "Baleba will probably see the game as a transfer audition. However, to be worth £100m, Baleba must deliver consistently strong performances each week, not just when the time feels right to perform.",
      "Brighton have a reputation for exporting players for huge fees and are unlikely to budge on their valuation next summer, so it's down to Baleba to perform like a player worth that fee.",
      "There are currently doubts about whether he is worth such an outlay.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee's time at Manchester United looks to be in its closing stages as we begin to creep further towards the January transfer window opening.",
      "MEN Sport reported on Thursday that Zirkzee is looking to leave United sooner rather than later, with the winter market seen as his time to request a departure. Struggling West Ham are thought to be keen on the Dutchman, who is searching for more minutes ahead of next summer's World Cup.",
      "It is believed that Zirkzee is keen to leave United to reignite his stuttering career and few can blame him. The 24-year-old has yet to start a match this season for the Reds.",
      "He played nearly an hour in the victory over Burnley but his introduction came after Matheus Cunha picked up an injury in the first-half. Since then, he has played just 15 minutes across five Premier League matches.",
      "The brutal reality for Zirkzee is that he has dropped down the pecking order at a rapid rate. Ruben Amorim has two main tactics at present when it comes to his attack.",
      "The first is the traditional triangle that he likes to utilise at the top of the pitch. Benjamin Sesko leads that three with two of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount behind him.",
      "The other option is to play the striker-less system which worked expertly against Liverpool at Anfield. This sees Mbeumo and Mount partnering Cunha, who plays a free role up top. Few expected Sesko not to start on Sunday having bagged two goals in two games - with even Arne Slot caught out by the move - but it worked a treat.",
      "Cunha was sensational in that role on Sunday. Sadly for Zirkzee, he just does not fit in that picture.",
      "Zirkzee is now third-choice behind a striker-less system and that sums up how desperate the situation has become for him at the club.",
      "There is no longer any justification for keeping Zirkzee beyond January and while he will always deserve credit for how he bounced back last season, now is the right time to move on.",

      "It's said that the loan move that has an option of around €30m, although Barcelona have rejected that idea.",
      "Man United are reportedly considering a move for Athletic Club star Oihan Sancet.",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes have claimed that the Reds are preparing a €70m offer to test Athletic's resolve. Arsenal have also been linked.",
      "For once, Manchester United do not seem like the kind of team who are desperately counting down the days to the start of a transfer window.",
      "In recent years, United have looked a mess with several areas of pitch in desperate need of improvement, mid-season. This time last year, we had just seen the Reds draw at Fenerbahce in the Europa League as they continued their simultaneously unbeaten and winless start to that competition and we were less than a week away from the West Ham defeat that ended Sir Jim Ratcliffe's patience with Erik ten Hag.",
      "Fast forward 12 months and not everything is perfect at United, there is an acceptance that the recovery will take time but at least we are starting to see some green shoots of hope. Yes, the midfield needs a major overhaul but that seems like it could be a task saved until the summer.",

      "Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller is a player that Manchester United are monitoring before the January transfer window, according to Fabrizio Romano, despite false reports of a late move this summer.",
      "Now, speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano has revealed that no talks have been held between United and Stuttgart just yet, but there is genuine interest held. \"I'm always receiving many questions on Angelo Stiller, there was a report from Bild in the last few days on Manchester United tracking the player,\" he said.",
      "\"Manchester United have always been following this player and Angelo Stiller is really appreciated internally. Last summer, we had some stories about Manchester United going on a mission to Germany negotiating to sign Stiller as a surprise for the final weeks.",
      "\"No, Manchester United never started any negotiations for Angelo Stiller in August last summer. That was never a possibility. It was always impossible.",
      "\"Stiller was always going to stay at Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, especially in August, so there was no chance to change the story in the final days of the window.",
      "\"But Angelo still remains a player monitored by Manchester United. They are following him.",
      "\"They are closely monitoring his progress. Again, at the moment, there's no negotiation, no talks.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford is a popular member of the Barcelona squad as he continues on loan from Manchester United.",
      "And journalist Fabrizio Romano has claimed that not only is Rashford a popular member of Hansi Flick’s squad, but there is also a possibility that he will remain at the Catalan club beyond this season.",
      "“Rashford is sending very clear messages, his desire to be a Barcelona player is there since January 2025, so basically almost one year ago,\" he said in a video on his YouTube channel.",
      "“In the January window, it was not possible to make the deal happen because Barcelona didn’t have the space to register and sign Marcus Rashford because Ansu Fati didn’t want to leave the club in January.",
      "“Then in the summer, Ansu Fati accepted the possibility to leave Barcelona, went to Monaco. Barcelona had the space to sign Rashford and completed the transfer on a deal with a €30million buy option clause, but now, Rashford is performing in a fantastic way, already reaching 10 goal contributions – between goals and assists – and doing very well in the Champions League.",
      "“He can play as a striker, he can play as a winger. You can feel how comfortable Rashford is at Barcelona, and, once again, as I have been telling you for weeks, the feeling internally at Barca is that Rashford really perfectly fits the structure they have on the tactical point of view with Barcelona.",
      "“They are all very happy with all the relationship Rashford has with his team-mates as well. The reputation of Rashford is something that has to be clarified. He is really popular in the dressing room at Barcelona.",
      "“Look at the image after the game of Fermin Lopez scores an attack against Olympiacos, Marcus Rashford, who scored two goals, took the ball and went to Fermin Lopez, telling him, okay, take the ball, because, also, this kind of behaviour is something really appreciated by Barcelona.",
      "\"The performance is okay, of course, goals, assists, Rashford is doing very well, very versatile player upfront who can play in several positions, but also important to say, the behaviour, the attitude of Marcus Rashford is really appreciated by Barcelona.",
      "“So, let me say, from what I understand, the feeling internally at Barcelona – internal means board, management, technical staff, the manager and those who work closely with Hansi Flick – is that if Marcus Rashford will continue like this in every single point of view – delivering performances and perfect attitude – he will have very good chances to continue at the club beyond this season.”",
      "Manchester United reportedly remain interested in VfB Stuttgart star Angelo Stiller.",
      "That's according to journalist Dennis Bayer, via Sport Witness, who is reporting that United are one of several sides looking at the 24-year-old, who is open to taking the next step in his career.",
      "The report also goes on to cliam that Stuttgart have set a €50m asking price on the player - but it is unclear if that is the value of the release clause in his current deal.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is set to request a transfer away from Manchester United in the upcoming window, with West Ham United leading the race to provide the Dutch international an exit route from his Old Trafford woes.",
      "Zirkzee's time at United has been challenging since his £36m move from Bologna under Erik ten Hag. The forward has struggled to make his mark, becoming a target of mockery among United supporters due to his goal drought.",
      "Read the full story from Jeremy Cross here.",
      "Football finance expert Dan Plumley has had his say on what he believes the Glazers are asking for to sell their shares in Manchester United.",
      "“I think it’s unlikely [a takeover] will be how its played out, when Ratcliffe came in we saw how that played out,” he told Football Insider.",
      "“A big bid from Qatar we were led to believe that was full takeover and it wasn’t at the price that the Glazers wanted. I’ve always suggested that they are after a higher price for their exit which is certainly more than £5billion, there’s been rumours that they want £10billion in the future to exit.",
      "“With football clubs though we say it all the time they’re really for sale, if the right offer comes in then people will listen.”",
      "Manchester United have reportedly been informed that Juventus are willing to put their striker Dusan Vlahovic up for sale in the January transfer window.",
      "The 25-year-old arrived from Fiorentina in 2022 however, his time in Turin turned sour last season over disputes regarding a new contract offer. It is understood that Vlahovic was offered a deal with a lower wage as Juve tried to lower their salary bill at the club amidst the looming threat of Financial Fair Play (FFP).",
      "In January, Vlahovic will be able to sign a pre-contract agreement with any club overseas - including United. However, Gazzetta dello Sport claim Juve are going to be pushing to sell him in January to reclaim some money.",
      "Carlos Baleba is said to have held private discussions with Fabian Hurzeler, as Manchester United continue to be linked with the Brighton midfielder.",
      "The 21-year-old was the talk of the town this summer, with the Reds holding talks with the Seagulls over securing Baleba's services. The youngster impressed at the AMEX Stadium last term, with three Premier League goals from 34 outings in total, despite being defensive-minded.",
      "And as a result, Ruben Amorim and the Manchester United board were keen on securing his services for 2025/26. However, determined to retain the Cameroonian for the news season, Brighton slapped Baleba with an audacious price tag of £100million, which ultimately proved too rich for United's liking.",

      "It was a brave decision from Ruben Amorim to bench Benjamin Sesko against Liverpool last weekend.",
      "Sesko had scored twice in his last two matches for Manchester United, but Amorim decided to revert to the striker-less front three he picked for the first three games of the season.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo looked threatening in those matches, but none of the three scored when all on the pitch together (Mbeumo only scored against Burnley once Mount was substituted).",
      "Although there was the potential for United to be blunt at Anfield, Mbeumo scored within two minutes at the Kop, finishing brilliantly following a perfectly-weighted pass from Amad.",
      "The decision to play with a striker-less front three worked a treat. Mbeumo, Cunha and Mount were excellent and Amorim now has a tough selection decision for Brighton's visit to Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "Should Amorim persist with the striker-less attack that delivered at Anfield? United had one of the worst attacks in the league last season and it must be refreshing for Amorim to have a selection dilemma.",
      "It's a welcome headache for Amorim. The 40-year-old has strong attacking options at his disposal and can tweak the team accordingly to adapt to the opposition this season.",
      "The attacking pieces have fallen into place for Amorim and he will be aware of the importance of getting his team selection right against Brighton when considering what is at stake.",
      "The Liverpool victory was outstanding, but it must serve as a springboard for further success, so the visit of Brighton is arguably just as important as last weekend's visit to Anfield.",
      "United have a huge opportunity to win three games in a row and could possibly enter the November international break in the Champions League places if they build on their result against Liverpool.",
      "There would be logic in rewarding Cunha, Mount and Mbeumo for their performances in Merseyside by starting them against Brighton, as managers can be reluctant to change a winning team. There would also be logic in recalling Sesko to the starting XI, given his form before the Anfield visit.",
      "It will be a difficult decision for Amorim to make ahead of this weekend, but he prepared for the new season with a frontman in his plans and perhaps the scales will tip in Sesko's favour.",
      "Cunha, Mount and Mbeumo have developed an impressive understanding, however, there is a strong argument to play Sesko down the middle this weekend.",
      "Sesko arrived at Old Trafford in the summer window for a fee of €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons. He could reach 20 goals this season if the attack clicks into gear, but Mount or Cunha are unlikely to reach that figure down the middle.",
      "Sesko has found his feet in Manchester over the last month, following his first goal against Brentford with a clever strike against Sunderland, and could be on the cusp of a purple patch if he's given starts.",
      "The ceiling for the striker-less front three is essentially lower than that of an attack including Sesko, which is why Amorim should recall the Slovenia international to the XI to face Brighton.",
      "In that scenario, who is moved to the bench is arguably an even bigger headache, but it has to be between Mount and Cunha, who would compete to start on the left side of the attack.",
      "Mbeumo has made an excellent start to the campaign and has the right side locked down, while it's difficult to choose between Mount and Cunha on the left after the last fortnight.",
      "Mount was superb against Sunderland and was industrious against Liverpool. Cunha was recalled at Anfield and his clever game management was key in the closing stages of the contest.",
      "It's encouraging Amorim has tough decisions to make in a department that struggled last season.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "It was a monkey off Amorim's back and a welcome fillip for United after a mixed start to the campaign. The challenge now for the Portuguese and his players is to find consistency and turn back-to-back wins into three in a row.",
      "The clash with Brighton offers a chance to do just that, and provide Amorim with another first.",
      "United are targeting a top six finish this season after a dismal domestic campaign last term but they won't be able to challenge for the European places without being able to consistently string wins together.",

      "Therefore, the actual priorities list for new arrivals will likely depend upon who departs. Again though, United will not be expected to allow loads of players to exit.",
      "January remains a seller's market but it also makes replacement additions hard to come by. However, the player they should prioritise to leave this winter does not have to necessarily be replaced.",
      "In the summer, Diego Leon arrived in Manchester full of confidence. \"When you're a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity,\" the full-back told the Paraguayan media in July.",
      "\"Everyone thinks I'll go out on loan, but I don't have that mindset. I'm going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I'll already be playing with them.\"",
      "As much as you can admire Leon's confidence, things have not quite worked out like that for him. The 18-year-old has made just two appearances in United colours - his latest coming in the 5-2 defeat to Barnsley in the EFL Trophy in midweek.",
      "In fact, he has yet to make an appearance for the senior squad. He made the bench against Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland but was missing on Sunday at Liverpool.",
      "With United's injury problems starting to diminish, Leon's opportunities to break into the first-team this season are starting to dwindle too. In pre-season we saw signs of why the teenager was signed and he did impress, particularly against Leeds.",
      "However, he still needs time to adapt to European football and a loan spell away from Old Trafford in January could be just what is needed. Of course, the club chosen for him needs to be right.",
      "United have a long-standing tradition of sending the youngsters who they favour most, to the Championship. This season Harry Amass, Radek Vitek and Toby Collyer are among the players battling in the English second tier at Sheffield Wednesday, Bristol City and West Bromwich Albion respectively.",
      "We must remember that it was only recently that Amad changed the course of his United career playing for Sunderland in the Championship, so it would be a sign of confidence in Leon to organise a similar switch for him. By the end of the season, Tyrell Malacia will have left and Leon will re-enter the squad with further experience which could help him make that jump to the first-team.",
      "If opportunities are not going to be forthcoming for Leon this campaign, this has to be the club's priority going into January.",

      "Darren Fletcher must burst with pride when he watches his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, play in the academy.",
      "The 41-year-old was in attendance at Oakwell Stadium and had a perfect view of Jack's goal.",
      "Chido Obi brilliantly won the ball from Vimal Yoganathan just outside the Barnsley penalty area, and Jack Fletcher pounced to finish into the right corner thanks to a slight deflection.",
      "Fletcher scored an instinctive volley from 35 yards that dipped under the crossbar when he last played at Oakwell Stadium in 2024. His deflected goal may not have been as impressive, but they all count.",
      "Manchester United signed the Fletcher twins for £1.25million from Manchester City in the summer of 2023. The pair opted to move to United and are now pushing towards being involved with the first team.",
      "United use the EFL trophy to give 'elite young players' the platform to perform in a more pressured environment which prepares them for the first team.",
      "Travis Binnion named an Under-21 team that included players on the cusp of the first team against Barnsley, with Chido Obi, Shea Lacey, Tyler Fredricson and Diego Leon all starting.",
      "Leon made his international debut for Paraguay during the international break. He said it was an \"unforgettable night\" but he was back down to earth starting in South Yorkshire a week later.",
      "In August, there was a sense of frustration among academy staff that Leon had exclusively worked with the first team when he could have benefited from getting minutes in his legs during youth matches.",
      "Leon made his first appearance for the academy in a friendly shortly afterwards. The 18-year-old is still very raw and needs time to adapt to English football after his summer window arrival from Cerro Porteno.",
      "The Paraguay international struggled for the U21s against Liverpool and looked better against Barnsley, although he still has lots to learn, which was highlighted when he attempted to make an adventurous run through the middle of the pitch, only to be dispossessed in a dangerous area.",
      "Binnion shook his head on the touchline. United signed Leon for £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, because scouts believed he possesses first team potential, but he still needs to develop his game.",
      "The U21 boss cut a frustrated figure again just before the interval when Barnsley were awarded a penalty after a foul from Dan Armer. Veteran striker David McGoldrick made no mistake from the spot.",
      "Stephen Torpey sat alongside Jason Wilcox. The pair recently sat together at Old Trafford following Torpey's appointment as head of the academy (succeeding Nick Cox).",
      "Torpey and Wilcox returned to the warmth during half-time while Darren Fletcher passed on tactical feedback to an analyst. Fletcher is the Under-18 manager, but had clearly spotted something.",
      "It didn't take long for Barnsley to take the lead when play resumed. McGoldrick, 37, rolled back the years when finishing beyond Will Murdock again, although Obi produced an immediate response at the other end.",
      "Lacey intelligently won the ball on the halfway line and slipped through a perfectly weighted pass to Obi, who found the net with a classy finish. \"Chido, Chido, Chido,\" sang the small section of United fans.",
      "However, former Ipswich Town, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest striker McGoldrick wasn't done there and netted his hat-trick. Then Jack Fletcher was shown a red card in a bizarre incident with the referee.",
      "It seemed Fletcher received his marching orders for dissent. Perhaps a strange decision, but his father might argue that there is a lesson to learn: you must control emotions on a football pitch.",
      "Barnsley smelt blood after the sending off and scored another two goals to claim a 5-2 victory. Wilcox had seen enough with seven minutes remaining, but Torpey remained in the stands to see the game out.",

      "Wayne Rooney finds himself unable to attend his son Kai's matches for Manchester United's academy due to the overwhelming attention his celebrity status attracts. The 15-year-old is the eldest of four boys shared by Rooney and his wife Coleen, alongside younger brothers Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai, who plays as a striker much like his iconic father, became part of the Red Devils' academy setup in 2016, treading the same path as Rooney Sr, who marks his 40th birthday today. Whilst the youngster still has considerable ground to cover on his route to professional football, he's considered a promising prospect within the Old Trafford ranks.",
      "Sadly for the former England skipper, he must observe his son's performances from afar after the emerging talent requested his father stay away from matches due to the overwhelming media circus that follows him.",
      "This heartbreaking situation came to light during Coleen's stint on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. The 39-year-old claimed second place in the hit reality programme behind McFly vocalist Danny Jones, and it was whilst in the jungle that she revealed the difficult choice her son had made.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen explained last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Whilst he might not be present on the sidelines during Kai's matches, he continues to play a significant part in his footballing development. Rooney has previously acknowledged that he generally leaves the coaching duties to the club's coaching staff, but ensures he offers guidance to his sons during practice sessions at home.",
      "During last month's instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he told Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Considering Kai's position as the offspring of one of England's most celebrated players, Rooney commended his psychological resilience in handling the additional scrutiny and expectations that accompany being his son.",
      "During the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Sporting Lisbon came from behind to beat Marseille 2-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday, with former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood hooked at half-time.",
      "Greenwood came into the clash on a high after scoring four goals against Le Havre at the weekend. The 24-year-old has seven strikes and four assists so far this season, but he was sacrificed by Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi after the Ligue 1 side went down to 10 men in Portugal.",
      "De Zerbi's call to go safety first in the game has not gone down well with French media. Some outlets believe the Italian somewhat stifled his team's chances of winning by hauling Greenwood off and opting for a negative set-up, with De Zerbi seemingly still unconvinced when it comes to the defensive side of his game.",
      "Igor Paixao had put Marseille into the lead in the 14th minute. However, after Emerson was sent off in added time of the first half for diving to win a penalty having been set up by Greenwood, De Zerbi changed tact.",
      "His call to forfeit firepower in favour of solidity backfired as Sporting grew into the tie. Goals from Geny Catamo and Alisson Santos condemned Marseille to defeat.",
      "Prior to Greenwood's exit at half-time, French outlet L’Equipe offered reserved praise for his performance. They wrote: \"This goal freed his team, much higher, calm and dangerous, with a valuable Mason Greenwood in a more central role than usual.",
      "\"Marseille thought they were safe just before half-time, when, following a corner and a well-aimed pass from Greenwood, Emerson found himself knocked to the ground and Mr. Obrenovic [the match official] didn't hesitate to point to the penalty spot.\"",
      "The outlet also awarded Greenwood a 5/10 rating for his first-half contribution. They said: “Playing in support of the main striker, alongside Paixao, he was a little less prominent than his team-mates, even though he tried his luck several times (16th, 27th, 35th minutes).\"",
      "Le Parisien, subtly perplexed by Greenwood's hooking considering the player's general consistency, said: \"The second half was nothing but misery for Marseille, despite being so impressive in Ligue 1 with four consecutive victories and a first-place finish ahead of PSG.",
      "\"Roberto De Zerbi had anticipated this by adding a defender, Amir Murillo, to bolster their position. Mason Greenwood, who scored four goals against Le Havre on Saturday, paid the price.\"",
      "De Zerbi has been critical of Greenwood's work rate ever since the ex-United player made the switch to France in July 2024. The Italian took another chance to remind Greenwood of his defensive responsibilities following the defeat to Sporting CP.",
      "“Greenwood had already played up front at Lyon last season, but I needed players willing to do more, and Greenwood doesn't necessarily have the kind of characteristics to make that kind of sacrifice,\" he said. \"We had to find an alternative; we needed different characteristics.”",
      "He told Canal+: \"I made the choice to take Greenwood off because they sent off Emerson, we had to defend with five and, between Greenwood and Paixao, at that time, the one who had the characteristics to defend and attack at the same time was Paixao.",
      "\"Last year, when we were 10 against Lyon, we put Mason as a center forward and he had a lot of trouble. Even Vermeeren, who had played well in the first half, I had to replace him to put a little more weight on it.\"",
      "De Zerbi's strong words echo those he made in March, when he claimed he expected more from his striker. He said: \"I wanted him here, I said it over and over again. He was the first player I contacted, even before I signed for OM.",
      "\"I had already spoken to his father. No one can have more respect for him than I do. But that doesn't change anything: I expect more from him. He has to do more, because what he is currently showing is not enough. If he wants to achieve his ambition of becoming a champion, he has to be more consistent, sacrifice more and be more determined.\"",

      "United engaged several agents to try and sell Casemiro before the January transfer deadline, and they tried their luck again in the summer transfer window. Yet again they were unsuccessful.",
      "Despite it not being a leading priority, United were keen on strengthening their midfield options in the summer, but the continued presence of the high-earning Casemiro meant they were unable to do so.",
      "A £15million fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). It was clear Casemiro was going nowhere, try as United might.",
      "The Brazilian reserved his best football for European fixtures last season, and with no European football on offer at Old Trafford this term, it seemed he would be left to run down the final year of his contract while having very little impact on the first team.",
      "Seven weeks on from the closure of the summer transfer window and the narrative has definitely changed.",
      "It would be a stretch to say Casemiro is one of the first names on the team sheet, but his value to the team cannot be underestimated. Granted, that is partly down to the man who was brought in as his intended successor, Manuel Ugarte, failing to showcase his best form at Old Trafford, but Casemiro suddenly looks like a different player.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted last season that he was learning how best to utilise a player like Casemiro. No longer is he being asked to cover vast areas of the pitch, a task he simply isn't up to at the age of 33, but instead the Brazil international is simply being asked to sit in front of the backline and break up play.",
      "Amorim also showed against Liverpool that he's learnt his lesson when it comes to allowing the veteran midfielder to walk a disciplinary tightrope.",
      "As soon as Casemiro was booked against Chelsea alarm bells started ringing. Amorim decided not to take action and half an hour later he was sent off. Amorim wasn't going to run that risk against Liverpool and Casemiro was hooked as soon as a yellow card was brandished.",
      "United are expected to strengthen their midfield ranks next summer, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton among their intended targets. It's understood United could exercise the one-year extension option in Casemiro's deal if he agrees to reduced terms, but there's every chance he could be on his way out next summer on a free transfer.",

      "Every Manchester United player who took to the field on Sunday against Liverpool played their part in the victory and created special memories for the fanbase who travelled perhaps more in hope than expectation.",
      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens.",
      "Like the Sunderland match, Lammens did not necessarily have to play out of his skin to have a good game against Liverpool. But he did have his moments.",
      "The Belgian commanded his area in the hostile atmosphere and did superbly when he was called into action in the first half to prevent Alexander Isak equalising. In the second half, United came under further pressure but Lammens stood tall and inspired confidence from those who were in front of him.",
      "He did excellently to close down Mohamed Salah to ensure his strike sailed wide and while he was beaten for Cody Gakpo's goal, there was little he could have done to prevent that. Potentially Lammens' most important contribution though came in stoppage time.",
      "With Liverpool looking to pile on the pressure, the corners started to flow and that's when the goalkeeper truly impressed. Instead of wilting, the 23-year-old took charge of his box, punching the ball away and ensuring that there was no need for any further jangling nerves.",
      "After Sunderland, nobody wanted to get too excited about Lammens. We have seen too many false dawns in that position before.",
      "However, combine this with the Liverpool performance and suddenly it looks like there is even greater reason to be optimistic about the goalkeeper. Yes, Altay Bayindir tried his best to fill that role but it now feels as though that place firmly belongs to the Belgian.",

      "It is beginning to sound like a broken record for Manchester United supporters as, once again, Scott McTominay shines for Napoli.",
      "McTominay is firmly among the contingent of former United players who are benefitting from their new surroundings. What has been so impressive from the Scot's perspective is that he has gone from a player who was overlooked to a Ballon d'Or nominee.",
      "Such a meteoric rise does little to hide the envious looks that United fans are shooting over to the Naples club though. When he left, Erik ten Hag spoke about how disappointed he was to be forced to sell McTominay for Financial Fair Play (FFP) reasons and that assessment looks like an understatement, if anything, at the moment.",
      "However, the one small crumb of comfort that can be taken from McTominay adding another two goals to his Napoli tally in a Champions League defeat to PSV on Wednesday, which took him to just 13 behind his all-time United record - which was accomplished in 255 appearances - is that there is a huge chance he would not have replicated such figures at Old Trafford, had he stayed. The Reds never really utilised McTominay in the more advanced position in midfield.",
      "Scotland were the first to trust in him, perhaps out of necessity due to their lack of options in attacking midfield, and he flourished. Since then, that has been his position for Napoli rather than the defensive midfield role which he had become associated with in Manchester.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, that may have changed and he could have potentially been utilised in one of the No.10 roles. However, McTominay's new role for Napoli now is not one that Amorim uses.",
      "Antonio Conte picks a 4-1-4-1 system with McTominay on the wide left as either a midfielder or a winger, depending on how you look at it. For Amorim, the width comes from the wing-backs.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount have the luxury to play wider and attempt to stretch the opposition's defence but they are expected to focus themselves in a more central position for the team. This season, McTominay's goals for Napoli have come from wide left and it's unthinkable that Amorim would alter his formation.",
      "Instead, had McTominay still been at United when Amorim arrived, he would have either been played as a No.10, which may have worked but the competition with Mbeumo, Mount and Matheus Cunha could have stalled his progression. Or, the 28-year-old could have been asked to play that deeper role but would have found himself in the same difficulties that Kobbie Mainoo is experiencing trying to unseat Bruno Fernandes.",
      "So for United supporters, that is at least a small shred of comfort. Albeit knowing that McTominay may not have been correctly used throughout his time at the club, regardless of the manager, will come as a shame for most.",

However, an away win over your fiercest rivals, for the first time in nearly a decade, will breed confidence and leave Amorim feeling as though he is walking on air.",
      "Before the clash with Liverpool, United had a couple of injury concerns. Lisandro Martinez was the only definite absentee as his recovery from an ACL injury continues.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Martinez is likely to be out of action until November while the only other issue of note was Noussair Mazraoui, with Amorim unsure if he could play a part at Anfield.",
      "Mazraoui was fit enough to feature on the bench meaning, ahead of the clash with Brighton, just Martinez is out for the Reds.",
      "We are nearing the one-year anniversary of Amorim's arrival at United and during that time it is hard to remember when the Portuguese head coach has had all of his options to call upon. Last December, Amorim bemoaned the injury crisis with the likes of Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount all having to be managed in terms of minutes.",
      "In February, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer, Amad and Manuel Ugarte were all unavailable for one reason or another just before Martinez suffered his serious injury. If, by some miracle, United did not have a long list of injuries, the relentless and arduous schedule forced Amorim to rotate his squad anyway.",
      "While nobody at United will be pleased about having plenty of free midweeks this season, it has allowed the Reds to nurture players back to full fitness and, most importantly, keep them there. Mount is arguably the main benefactor.",
      "Amorim having a full set of players to choose from for a matchday squad may seem a luxury that Premier League managers rarely get, and one that those at the top have to work around in modern day football. But United must now take full advantage and build a winning run.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "After speculation that Amorim could be sacked just a couple of weeks ago, Man Utd have now won back-to-back Premier League matches for the first time in his tenure.",
      "Their impressive 2-1 win against Liverpool at Anfield over the weekend has given supporters fresh optimism that Amorim can finally get his side on a consistent run of positive results.",

      "Another big ol’ weekend of football on the horizon, and one now dominated by each and every one of us just desperately hoping and praying that Brentford do as they’ve been asked and keep the ball on the ground against poor little Liverpool.",
      "Please, guys, we beg of you. None of those beastly long throws. Liverpool do not like it when the ball is in the air, and the rest of us should definitely respect that.",
      "Elsewhere, Manchester United will have to overcome a recent bogey team if they want to take their first ever chance under Ruben Amorim to go on an actual decent little run, Eberechi Eze faces his old club, and Thomas Frank has to find some answers to Spurs’ suddenly soporific attack.",
      "Oh, and there’s quite a big game over in Spain as well. Might be worth a look.",
      "",
      "‘The biggest exception for me was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them — in the last four or five games we’ve played we were not able to press the opponent, because the ball wasn’t on the ground. It was through the air.’",
      "We love absolutely everything about the speed and totality with which Slot has responded to coming under pressure for the very first time as Liverpool manager by dusting off the ol’ Wenger and Klopp playbook and, having considered all the possibilities, come to the conclusion that it is the fault of other teams playing football wrong.",
      "We’d love it even if it were all true. The fact it’s also just absolute mad bollocks only makes it even more delicious.",
      "What we do know, though, is that Liverpool are going to face an aerial bombardment from Brentford this weekend and if they don’t cope with it then it’s all going to look very silly indeed thanks to the manager’s decision to come out and say they don’t like it.",
      "Liverpool are set to face a night of the long throws and, while that was always going to be the case, it now leaves them with no way to save face if they don’t come up with a solution.",
      "Because nobody is going to be interested in further complaints from Liverpool or their manager about opposition tactics.",
      "This was actually a weekend where picking a standout game was actually quite tricky. There’s lots of interesting games, lots of potential, but no clear and obvious blockbuster. So personally, we’re actually quite big fans of Slot’s tactics for making it so much easier for us.",
      "We’ve even resisted the overwhelming temptation to say that Liverpool’s season is at risk of being up in the air but, fair warning, we will absolutely not be able to do so should they come any kind of a cropper at the Gtech.",
      "",
      "Well now. That astonishing ball-in-the-air victory at Anfield has given United the chance to do something they haven’t managed to do at all even once in 11 months under Ruben Amorim: go on a little bit of a run.",
      "They’ve got some okay fixtures coming up over the weeks ahead, but that of course brings its own dangers. Lose at home to Brighton this weekend and all the air goes straight out of the balloon. United go straight back to crisis jail, they do not pass Go, Sir Jim does not collect £200.",
      "And the big problem here is that losing at home to Brighton is precisely the sort of thing Banter Era Manchester United do. Both generally and very, very specifically in this case. Brighton have won on each of their last three Premier League trips to Old Trafford.",
      "United have lost eight times to Brighton in their 16 league meetings, and the trend is one way: in the last four seasons, United have lost six out of eight games against the Seagulls.",
      "It all adds up to the worst possible fixture at the worst possible time in many ways. A fixture that sits precisely in the crisis-restoring sweet-spot of being one United will now be expected to win but recent history suggests they probably won’t.",
      "There’s more to consider here, though, because another thing that’s undeniably true this season is that Brighton only trouble themselves with beating the best. Their three Premier League wins this season have all come against sides who finished in the top five last season.",
      "So if United do lose to them, it’s not a crisis at all but actually proves United are big and good again. Which also means that maybe United shouldn’t win and go on that little run we mentioned earlier, because beating Brighton this season is clear and incontestable evidence that you are no good.",
      "It’s possible we’re overthinking this.",
      "",
      "A fascinating potential battle as Eze faces his former club at the Emirates. The player who got his move from Selhurst Park goes up against Marc Guehi, who very much did not.",
      "It’s a key match-up in a key game, with Palace suffering the most minor of wobbles via defeat at Everton and last-gasp draw against Bournemouth while it already feels like this is a pivotal stage of the season for Arsenal, for whom Palace represent one of the toughest challenges in a run of games that really do offer a captivating chance to open up a significant lead at the top of the table given the far harder challenges that simultaneously face the less convincing Liverpools and Citys of this world.",
      "Eze’s affection for Crystal Palace is deep and obvious, and it’s highly possible that if he were to score this weekend we might see the most muted celebration in Premier League history. Which, in a further twist, are actually the celebrations the Celebration Police should be investigating.",
      "",
      "Nothing is ruined yet, but there has been a sense all season that performances weren’t quite keeping pace with results in Frank’s early games as Spurs manager and now those two lines do seem to be converging.",
      "Spurs were cravenly limp in defeat against Aston Villa last weekend, extending their own dismal home form to a now scarcely creditable three wins in 18 league games while also giving Villa’s also-honking away form a timely boost.",
      "The midweek trip to Monaco produced more of the same, with the only difference being the performance of Guglielmo Vicario. Among the guilty against Villa, he was a hero in the Champions League and almost single-handedly allowed Spurs to burgle a point they absolutely did not deserve.",
      "Spurs have started to look horribly short of attacking ideas, with Plans A, B and C all seeming to amount to not much more than ‘Get the ball to Mohammed Kudus and await him performing a madness’.",
      "He’s been brilliant, and it should absolutely be a prominent element of the Tottenham playbook. But not the only one.",
      "There is a lack of cohesion about Spurs at the moment; this is a new team figuring things out under a new manager and right now it still looks like a bunch of talented individuals rather than a team.",
      "Injuries haven’t helped, for sure. Any one of Dejan Kulusevski, Dominic Solanke or James Maddison would shift the current uncertain and one-note efforts of the non-Kuduses Frank has at his disposal.",
      "But those players have been out for some time and will be out a while longer yet. Neither team nor manager can afford to wait in the hope their returns provide the spark Spurs currently lack.",
      "At least a first trip to the Hill Dickinson Stadium offers a rare chance for Spurs themselves to benefit from the enticing welcome of a stunning new stadium, given the extent to which it seems still to inspire visitors to Spurs’ own spectacular digs.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite the season so far for Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, who remain unbeaten in the Championship and have won their last five league games by a combined aggregate of 16-1.",
      "Mid-table Watford are the visitors to Frank Lampard’s Coventry City in one of this weekend’s Saturday lunchtime kick-offs, which gives Frank Lampard’s Coventry City a chance to put some significant scoreboard pressure on their rivals with a victory that would add to the growing sense that we really could see Frank Lampard and his team, Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, in the Premier League next season.",
      "",
      "You can’t ask for much more than a lovely bit of Clasico action, but if you were greedy and decided you did want to ask for more than that, then you’d ask for a Clasico where top spot in La Liga is up for grabs.",
      "Your gluttony sickens and appals us, but you have got your wish. Real Madrid take a two-point lead into this one, so there’s far more than just the standard-issue bragging rights on the line here.",
      "If you still insist on a bit more spice, then how about the fact this game takes place a year to the day after Barcelona won 4-0 at the Bernabeu to lay down an early title marker as well as establishing a dominance that would see them record three further all-competition wins over their old rivals before the season was through?",
      "Memorable wins they were, too, with that 4-0 actually the lowest scoring of the lot. There was a wild Spanish Super Cup clash that ended 5-2 in 10-man Barca’s favour, before more red cards and drama in a 3-2 extra-time Copa Del Rey win and the very best saved for last in the return La Liga fixture, one in which Real Madrid led 2-0 within 15 minutes, but trailed 4-2 by half-time and would eventually lose 4-3 despite Kylian Mbappe completing his hat-trick.",
      "It’s unlikely to be dull, is what we’re saying here.",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank feels there is a “very good comparison” between Xavi Simons and Florian Wirtz, with the Spurs and Liverpool new boys struggling – and the stats show ...",
      "Liverpool’s summer of spending had many predicting another easy league title but their difficulty to settle is in stark contrast to other teams.",
      "A Tottenham insider has stated it’s “madness” two players have been snubbed by Thomas Frank, after he made an important squad decision recently.",
      "Insider Florian Plettenberg has confirmed that Tottenham are among the teams ‘closely monitoring’ a Brentford forward who scored 14 goals when being managed by now-Spurs boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Former Premier League boss Sam Allardyce has revealed the one “concern” he has about Tottenham under Thomas Frank this season.",
      "Tottenham are reportedly keen on signing a former Real Madrid defender, with Thomas Frank leading the push after his solid start to the season."

      "There has been a lot of change at Man Utd over the past couple of years.",
      "At the start of 2024, the Glazer family sold a 27% stake of the Premier League giants to INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who in turn took control of football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "This deal was worth around £1.25bn and Ratcliffe has since made a further investment to increase his share to around 29%, though he has been heavily criticised over his decisions since joining the club.",
      "Ratcliffe inherited a mess and decided to sanction a brutal cost-cutting programme to balance the books, though some have argued that certain changes were needless, as there have been mass redundancies, reduced payments to club legends and ticket prices have been hiked.",
      "This means that the British billionaire has quickly become a villain at Man Utd, so recent reports surrounding a potential takeover have been met with positivity.",
      "It has been claimed that an UAE-based consortium are plotting a full takeover of Man Utd and have made ‘approaches’ to several club legends, including David Beckham, over their potential involvement.",
      "Meanwhile, Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh has claimed that a deal is ‘advanced’.",
      "However, Jacobs, who has regularly reported on the Man Utd takeover saga over the past couple of years, has pointed out that Al-Sheikh’s comments were “misleading”, while Beckham is unlikely to be involved.",

      "“The Glazers are still waiting to see whether anything actually materialises, and we still don’t know whether they would sell imminently, ie, within the next two years or less.",
      "“But within the UAE, what this consortium, as they build, have done is gone to ex Manchester United legends, including, as I revealed, Eric Cantona are as a possible ambassador, not at investor. We’ve heard David Beckham mentioned as well.”",

      "Whereas there are other Manchester United legends that would be prepared to endorse a consortium even if it didn’t develop, even if it was just a publicity stunt, even if they never held any talks with the Glazers. So that’s kind of where we’re at the moment. Let’s see whether or not it develops.”",

      "Ji-sung Park is one of the great unsung heroes in Premier League history, but do Manchester United currently have the attacking quality to offset the limited goal contributions of his Old Trafford regen?",
      "After joining United from PSV Eindhoven for just £4m in 2005, Park made over 200 appearances for the Red Devils and was frequently leaned upon by Sir Alex Ferguson in the toughest fixtures as a reliable 7/10 player in a squad brimming with star talent which would frequently be snubbed in favour of the South Korean.",
      "Park won eight major titles with United, including four Premier Leagues and the Champions League, and Ferguson believes they would have won another had he used the midfielder to man-mark Lionel Messi in the 2011 final.",
      "“That’s where I lost the final against Barcelona at Wembley,” Ferguson said. “I should have changed at half-time and put Ji-Sung Park on Messi. That was a mistake.”",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov were just some of the highly-skilled forwards to have shared the pitch with Park, whose standout attribute was his extraordinary ability to get around the pitch and snap into challenges to win the ball back for United. He was a pressing demon before it became so in vogue.",
      "And the weight of numbers of those he was playing with offset Park’s relatively meagre contributions – he got 19 goals and 23 assists in 154 Premier League appearances across his seven seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha – promising though their starts to life at United have been – offer nothing like the same goals/assists buffer as Ronaldo, Rooney et al. Which begs the question, can Ruben Amorim afford to include the new Ji-sung Park in his starting XI?",
      "On the Stick to Football podcast, Gary Neville said: “Do you know what I think about [Mason] Mount? He reminds me, say, Darren Anderton or Adam Lallana, Ji-Sung Park, maybe a little bit.",
      "“Players who do that sort of ugly bit well, but they also connect and glue things with, like, he starts the press.”",
      "But Roy Keane doesn’t think Mount is worthy of a place in Amorim’s starting XI, pointing out his poor record in what he believes is his baffling selection.",
      "He said: “That’s a head-scratcher, I think. He’s doing well to get in the starting United team, Mount.",
      "“A lot of managers have loved him over the years, he was the main man with England for a while, Chelsea of course and now obviously the manager wants to put him in.",
      "“But you go back to stats as an attacking player. At United, his stats when he’s played are really poor. It’s not as if you’re going, yeah I can see he’s getting a lot of assists, his stats are really poor.”",
      "Mount has scored one goal this season but has managed just two further Premier League goals since his arrival from Chelsea in 2023, and remarkably, is yet to provide an assist in his 37 games in the top flight for the Red Devils.",
      "Park’s inclusion could be seen as something of a luxury afforded to Ferguson, made possible by the goal contribution machines he was playing with.",
      "But it’s impossible to know whether those more creative and deadly players would have racked up those numbers without Park scrapping for possession alongside them.",
      "Amorim is faced with the same chicken-and-egg scenario with regard to Mount, but without the goals and assists in the team besides to nullify his shocking lack of quantifiable contribution to points on the board for Manchester United.",

      "According to football analytics expert McKay Johns:",

      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",

      "Manchester United target Carlos Baleba has reportedly held ‘private talks’ with Brighton over his future, while Fabrizio Romano has provided an update.",
      "In recent seasons, Baleba has emerged as one of the best young midfielders in the Premier League and he attracted interest from Man Utd in the summer.",
      "The Red Devils are crying out for a quality No.6 and they made an audacious move for Baleba in the summer, though they were priced out of a move as Brighton demanded around £100m for his services.",
      "Still, a transfer remains possible heading into 2026, though Baleba’s form has declined in the opening couple of months of this season.",
      "Baleba appears to have been impacted by the ongoing transfer speculation, though The Sun have revealed that a knee issue is also behind his below-par performances.",
      "The outlet has also pointed out that Baleba has held ‘private talks’ with Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler, with it noted that he has ‘reassured’ the manager ‘of his commitment to the club’ as Man Utd ‘continue to monitor his situation closely’.",
      "Romano has also provided an update on Baleba, as Man Utd “internally” sees VfB Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller as a potential alternative.",
      "“I’m always receiving many questions on Angelo Stiller. There was a report from Bild in the last few days on Man Utd tracking the player. Man Utd have always been following this player. Stiller is really appreciated internally at Man Utd,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Mikel Arteta only third in Premier League manager rankings for 25/26",
      "“Last summer, we had some stories on Man Utd going on a mission to Germany, negotiating to sign Stiller as a surprise for the final weeks. No, Man Utd never started any negotiations for Stiller in August last summer. That was never a possibility, it was always impossible.",
      "“Stiller was always going to stay at Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, especially in August. There was no chance to change the story in the final days of the window.",
      "“But Stiller remains a player monitored by Man Utd. They are following him. They are closely monitoring his progress.”",
      "Romano has also made it clear that Amorim “wants an important midfielder in 2026”, while he has made it clear that Baleba cannot be forgotten in this situation.",
      "“Again, at the moment, there is no negotiation, no talks. But Ruben Amorim wants an important midfielder for Man Utd in 2026. We will see whether it’s going to be January, if it’s possible, or a summer transfer window. Stiller is one of the players being monitored,” Romano added.",
      "“Don’t forget about [Carlos] Baleba, don’t forget about other profiles. Man Utd are tracking midfielders. Stiller is an interesting player for Man Utd.",
      "“Stiller is a very respectful player, German, so he didn’t want to create any problem with Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, and he’s never going to be that kind of player, forcing moves, creating problems.",
      "“That’s not the attitude of Stiller. He’s a very serious guy, in a very good relationship with everyone at Stuttgart. At the moment, we are not at the stage where we have to mention a negotiation, a discussion.",
      "“There are several clubs keeping a close eye on him because he’s a very interesting one, very good player with potential to become even better.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has provided a new update on Marc Guehi’s situation at Crystal Palace as Liverpool ‘remain attentive’ to his situation.",

      "Marcus Rashford got another couple of goals and an assist for Barcelona on Tuesday, and for some that serves as proof he was “lazy” at Manchester United.",
      "We typically air the views of former Red Devils full-back Paul Parker because their bizarre, controversial nature offers at worst the opportunity for a smile or a chuckle of a weekday.",
      "Those that are too bonkers for publication we typically ignore and brush off as the witterings of someone who might ordinarily scrawl their opinions on a toilet cubicle door.",
      "But we couldn’t help but be provoked by his latest views on Rashford, whom he’s never been shy in giving his two pennies’ worth on.",
      "“He let his team-mates down. He was lazy, he didn’t do anything. He’s got a lot to prove if he comes back to England. How many players in the UK would trust him if he played for their team? We know it, the answer is no-one. They would never say it, but they would be feeling it inside. It was life and death when I played, and that should have been inbuilt in him, but it isn’t.”",
      "Rashford can’t win. Either he doesn’t do well for Barcelona to prove he was never all that anyway. Or he does do well and that apparently shows just how “lazy” he must have been for United. And what about this assertion that “no-one would trust him”.",
      "That certainly didn’t seem to be the case at Aston Villa in the second half of last season, or indeed for England now. We would actually suggest that the Rashford currently slamming in goals and notching assists for Barcelona is the sort of of guy most “players in the UK” would turn to in order to get them out of a bind.",
      "As is the case with Roy Keane, Gary Neville and other former Manchester United players, Parker is struggling to come to terms with his former club being the problem, rather than Rashford and the many other players who have moved on and are thriving elsewhere. Not that he is actually thriving…",
      "“He has done alright, but I don’t think he is in Barcelona’s ideal starting 11. Will he start in a Champions League final with Yamal, Raphinha and Lewandowski? I think the answer is no. He doesn’t start. Everything about Marcus Rashford seems to be about politics, to be honest.”",
      "Using the guys who came second and fifth in the Ballon d’Or and arguably the greatest goalscorer of his generation as the yardstick to show Rashford isn’t actually doing that well shows just how few straws Parker has to grasp in that particular argument. And what’s that “politics” bit about? Still annoyed about feeding starving children? He’s got four goals and two assists in three Champions League games by ‘focusing on his football’.",
      "“Rashford put himself in a bad position where he didn’t know what to do. If you can’t give everything for your boyhood club and you are willing to let down the rest of the team, then that says a lot about you. If you can’t do it at the club you have been at since you were a kid, even saying you support that team and love the city where you have been brought up. If you can’t deliver for them and let your teammates down on numerous occasions, then you are in a very bad position.”",
      "It’s a “bad position” which now sees him playing and enjoying his football at one of the most famous and best clubs in Europe. He’s probably alright.",
      "“Then he went to Aston Villa and the media claimed he did well, but did he do better than Ollie Watkins? No. Did he do any better than Jacob Ramsey? No. But he was sold that way because the narrative was to put pressure on Man Utd.”",
      "We don’t think comparing Rashford with other very good footballers is making quite the point that Parker is aiming at, and Unai Emery often selected him ahead of Watkins. In both legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, for example.",
      "Here’s to Rashford rattling in a hat-trick for Barcelona in his first El Classico on Sunday and Parker again being asked for his thoughts on his dramatic resurgence. He’ll find some new stick to beat him with, and if not, his brilliance for his new club will only strengthen his claim that Rashford was “lazy” at Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘huge transfer U-turn’ at Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Marcus Rashford scored his second Champions League brace of the season against Olympiacos. The Man Utd loanee is loving life at Barcelona.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is behind just two players for Premier League goals against the Big Six for Manchester United, and should get enough penalties to catch them.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "Keane, Rooney and Neville all believe Rashford should look in the mirror before criticising Manchester United, but his Manchester United was theirs in name only.",
      "Rooney say Rashford blaming Man Utd for his “inconsistent” displays is an “easy” excuse and told the England international to look in the mirror."

      "From what he has shown so far, Zirkzee doesn’t look up to the pace of the Premier League and his game is not well-suited to the competition.",

      "Yet for every one of those there were two or three defensive calamities, and injuries, for a team that just didn’t have those things last season.",
      "It was always just so obviously asking too much of both Postecoglou and Forest’s players to make such a seismic shift in approach work without any kind of pre-season to bring in the right players and get everyone to understand the process.",
      "Postecoglou will walk away with a nice pay-off for barely a month’s work, but with his reputation in tatters. It is only five months since he did the unthinkable and delivered a major trophy to Tottenham, yet now, two sackings later, his managerial career at this level of club football is surely over.",
      "There must have been better options with just a bit more patience. But still we’re kind of glad he did it, because Nuno to Ange to Dyche in barely five weeks is something the like of which will never be seen again.",
      "",
      "Got absolutely none of the help he needed from the club in the summer, which meant all the talk during the late-season struggles last term about not judging Potter until he had his own players and a full pre-season to instil his methods became instantly moot.",
      "But while Potter was not and is not the primary source of West Ham’s travails, let’s also not pretend he is blameless. West Ham didn’t help him, but he didn’t help himself either, and a once-promising career suffered another huge step back.",
      "We’ll admit we didn’t really know how or where the road to recovery might begin for Potter, but will cheerfully admit we didn’t have ‘Simply be almost immediately named manager of Sweden’ high on our list.",
      "That admittedly incredible run of promotions with Ostersund is still evidently highly thought of in a country that has had an absolute catastrof*ck of a World Cup qualifying campaign but one that still has enormous potential for absurd redemption with their Nations League success meaning they’ll still be in the play-offs despite the likelihood now of finishing actual last in their qualifying group.",
      "",
      "Already enjoying one of the most spectacular early seasons of any Premier League manager. And remember this is a bloke who rocked up at Tottenham, won his first three Premier League games (including an opening-day win over Manchester City) and still ended up out on his ear by November.",
      "He knows a thing or two about early-season managerial shenanigans.",
      "But surely nothing quite likes this. There are still 10 days of October to go and Nuno stands on the very brink of being sacked for a second time.",
      "During these first two months of the season he has already watched his Nottingham Forest side tear Brentford to shreds, then watch his Nottingham Forest side be torn to shreds by West Ham, and then watch his West Ham side be torn to shreds by Brentford.",

      "We worried it would happen right back in May when that brilliant run of six straight wins that secured Premier League survival for Wolves was followed by three defeats and a draw in their four remaining games.",
      "We worried even more it would happen when key players were picked off by the Manchester giants with inadequate replacements coming in.",
      "And now it has happened. Wolves, a club where a ropey finish to one season always seems to bleed effortlessly into a terrible start to the following season have made a terrible start. Not even Dr Tottenham at his most inexplicably hospitable was able to find a complete cure for Wolves’ ills.",
      "We’re not actually worried about Wolves. They’ll be fine in the end. They always are. They’ll be 14th when the music stops in May and the very idea they were in quite serious relegation bother will appear vaguely silly.",
      "But we do worry about Pereira. By that point, he will likely have been out of the picture for a good six months. If Dr Tottenham doesn’t quite do the trick, the only option left is often a managerectomy. Right now he’s the sack race favourite.",
      "",
      "Fell out with everyone, which given who that ‘everyone’ is at Nottingham Forest is kind of understandable. But f*ck, what a waste. Didn’t get the chance to follow through on the brilliant work he did last season and was the first manager out of a job in the Premier League this season.",
      "Despite that, his volatile, anger-filled few weeks at Forest are still probably his best weeks of the season. Because his punishment for the end of his Forest reign has been severe indeed. Surely not even Mr Marinakis would have wished the West Ham job on his new worst enemy.",
      "",
      "It’s not been disastrous – and that really is something, because Farke’s overall record in this division after storming to promotion absolutely is disastrous – but it’s not been great either and there are significant grounds for concern after defeats either side of the international break.",
      "Losing narrowly to Spurs in a game that could have gone either way was no cause for great alarm, but the abject nature of last weekend’s defeat at Burnley in what was a real chance to plunge them into serious trouble while putting significant distance between themselves and the bottom three was ropey as all hell.",
      "Farke does have legitimate grievances about the big-talking Leeds hierarchy’s utter failure to provide him with the firepower he wanted and clearly needed. And if this season does go wrong for Leeds and Farke it will be the lack of threat in front of goal that will be the main contributing factor.",
      "Only the current bottom three have scored fewer goals than Leeds this season, but it does also need mentioning that they – along with Burnley – are also three of the only four teams to have conceded more.",
      "Farke might not be able to perform alchemy with the attacking players he has available between now and January, but he has to find some way to make the defence more secure.",
      "",
      "That statement win at Anfield has clearly changed the landscape for Amorim and Manchester United.",
      "For the first time since the very earliest days of his United reign, back in the far-off dim and distant days of late 2024 where his biggest problem was Ed Sheeran gatecrashing post-match interviews for some reason, Amorim has one precious gift: time.",
      "For the first time all season he is not among the most conspicuously under-pressure managers, and not solely because all the other under-pressure managers have been sacked.",
      "And even the league table now looks so much less appalling. It was easy, and fun, to joke about previous Man United corner-turning victories lifting them all the way to, say, 10th. But while they do remain in mid-table, that mid-table has become incredibly congested thanks to the weekend’s results at Anfield and elsewhere.",
      "Ninth place is still historically bad for Manchester United in the Premier League, but three points behind second place sounds a lot better.",
      "But let’s not lose the run of ourselves. Let’s not pretend all in the garden is suddenly rosy. Even United’s two big wins this season, against Chelsea and now Liverpool, have owed a great deal to their opponents doing some really very daft things indeed.",
      "And, while Liverpool were undeniably worryingly weird and so very rattled against United, on another day that was still a game that even a hyperactive and panicking Liverpool win with something to spare. Cody Gakpo could have won it on his own, having hit the woodwork three times, scored and then headed wide when a second equaliser looked a certainty.",
      "So no, let’s not pretend that finally, after almost a year in the job, Amorim winning two games in a row means something is definitely happening here.",
      "But what it does mean is that Amorim and the rest of us now at least have a much better chance of finding out for sure.",
      "",
      "Testament to the work Silva has done over several years now at Fulham that three straight defeats haven’t caused much of a ripple at all. Not quite sure a fourth straight loss at Newcastle will be quite so easily explained away, even if it is yet another in a difficult run, and it might just shift Silva away from the prominent positions he’s started to take in the various next manager markets.",
      "That might be no bad thing, because unless Fulham go completely stupid and sack him – and a new contract still seems like a far more likely outcome than that – it just means a longer stay at Craven Cottage.",
      "And we are increasingly of the view that both Fulham and Silva are better for having each other and that any change in that would go badly for both parties.",
      "",
      "Hmm. Not going well, is it? That’s now four straight defeats for Liverpool in all competitions, and do you know which other Premier League clubs have lost four straight games in all competitions this season? That’s right, none of them. That is awkward.",
      "We’d been pretty glib about the Liverpool Crisis before Sunday. They were no more in crisis after a couple of late defeats than they were cruising to inevitable all-competition glory after some late wins. Neither felt like they were particularly sustainable, neither felt like they could be extrapolated so easily to mean all that much for a season as a whole.",
      "But there really was something about the specific madness of that performance against Manchester United that freaks us right out. The panic. The confusion. The playing the entire second half as if there were 30 seconds remaining.",
      "This was a team and manager that had come under a bit of pressure and a bit of scrutiny and allowed themselves to be rattled into the shadow realm by Harry Maguire.",
      "Slot complaining about Man United’s squad rotation as if it were some kind of nefarious dark art is not the kind of thing you want to be hearing. Certainly not from a manager facing a tiny bit of pressure and unwanted attention for the very first time in Our League.",

      "",
      "An awkward, distracted and disjointed summer has given way to an awkward, distracted and disjointed season. Our favourite little detail about Newcastle’s Premier League season thus far is that they’ve not had the same result two games running, for either good or bad.",
      "The net result, though, is currently quite bad. Closer to the bottom three than the top seven is not the order of the day at all, no matter what injustice the club feels about not being able to just spend all of the money all of the time however they like.",
      "They’ve had a tough set of fixtures, for sure, but they should be doing better than this.",
      "Greater reasons for positivity can be found in the Champions League, mind, where they were only undone in a good game by a couple of moments of Marcus Rashford magic, before making a full mockery of their Premier League inconsistency by being very consistent indeed and winning their next two games in the competition 4-0 and 3-0.",
      "The weekend’s game against Fulham feels really quite hefty for early season perceptions. Whoever wins is safely back among the mid-table peloton. Whoever loses is down among the stragglers and the strugglers.",
      "",
      "We feared for him, we really did. Villa’s much-discussed fondness for sailing close to the PSR wind and boasting wildly unsustainable wage-to-turnover ratios makes them the very last club that could afford – in sporting and financial senses – to miss out on Champions League football as cruelly as they did at the back end of last season.",
      "It definitely leaked into this campaign, but there is now some pretty solid evidence that they have escaped from the funk, and burgling a first away league win of the season at sleepy Spurs cements it. After five winless games had you wondering whether the quite brilliant Emery revolution at Villa might be coming to a swift and sticky end, they’ve now won five games in a row with that number likely to be six after this week’s Europa League trip to Go Ahead Eagles.",
      "Never underestimate the power of the Europa League to influence the early-season mood of its competitor clubs for both good or ill. The (relative) ease and (relative) lack of pressure on those games can do all sorts of wondrous things to free players and managers up and get a season up and running, and there’s no doubt it has massively helped Villa already.",
      "Or, of course, you can be Nottingham Forest. Which is not the recommended approach.",
      "The Europa League also presents Villa with a wonderful opportunity to end what is now, after last season’s successes for Newcastle and Spurs, comfortably the silliest ongoing trophy drought in English football.",
      "",
      "Flawless mid-table behaviour from Brighton so far. In the space of just eight games this season they’ve already beaten three of last season’s top five in Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle.",
      "And where has this got them? Tenth. It’s got them to tenth.",
      "Now sure, it’s a congested mid-table area where they are also only three points behind third, but that only adds to the fun of it, along with the fact those three wins against last season’s top five are in fact Brighton’s only wins this season.",
      "Which also means, in a weird way, that if Manchester United really are back, back, back, then the absolute best way for them to prove it is to lose at home to the Seagulls this weekend.",
      "",
      "Could there be a more perfect job at a more perfect time for the great anti-woke firefighter?",
      "There are two perfect scenarios for Dyche to come in to a club and unleash his Brexitball. Either a club that is thoroughly aware of its limitations, or one paying the ultimate price for being entirely unaware of them.",
      "Nottingham Forest and their main-character owner deluded themselves into the deeply dangerous belief that one thoroughly competent season playing rigidly defined and expertly trained counter-attacking football in a season when so many big teams were just awful had elevated them into the elite.",
      "That they were now a club that could dare to dream big and face no consequences should the heat of the Barclays sun prove too much for their new and hastily glued wings.",
      "They have now discovered that was very much not the case.",
      "You only appoint Ange Postecoglou, with his recent Premier League record of just losing almost all of the games all of the time, if you have kidded yourself relegation is not something you have to think about.",
      "And you only appoint Dyche if you’ve realised that relegation is now the only thing you have to think about.",
      "Forest are the most perfect example of the second kind of Dyche club we can possibly imagine. As such, it is actually a very decent appointment. It’s a smaller, quieter, chastened Forest that Dyche enters than the one Nuno left just a few short weeks ago, but one that is therefore more malleable. More open to what must be done.",
      "You will have gruel-and-gravel Brexitball, and you will enjoy it. Or at least accept and appreciate its necessity.",
      "The other thing that’s just great for Dyche is that it should absolutely work a treat too. In the round, Forest have bollocksed this up. Dyche is not as good a manager as Nuno. He is even less subtle in his methods. He is a downgrade from the manager Forest had at the start of the season, but he is of the same school.",
      "And thus a much better fit than his immediate predecessor for the profile of squad he will inherit. Because it really is a very good squad indeed, and one that absolutely need not be in any of the sort of strife in which it finds itself.",
      "The low-block-and-counter might not be quite so effective for Dyche this season as it was for Nuno last, but it should be plenty effective enough to quickly steer Forest away from their current self-inflicted Angeball-delusion relegation fight.",
      "Dyche will get Forest organised and efficient once more. He will prioritise what they are good at, which we already know thoroughly aligns with what he wants his teams to be good at. We saw it work time and again last season, and it will work time and again this.",
      "We are beyond confident that Chris Wood goals in p*ss-boiling xG-spiting draws and wins will once again soon become the norm at the City Ground.",
      "Forest will once again return to being one of the hardest teams to play against instead of the softest and easiest.",
      "This is a club that has taken its medicine and should feel the benefit, but it is Dyche who emerges the clear winner here. He won’t be able to keep the smile off his disc-bearded face.",
      "He has everything he could possibly want. A squad of very good players who are perfectly suited to playing his specific brand of football to an extremely high level, yet at a club where the humblings of recent months mean there will not be any quickly declared desire for anything more.",
      "This is a club that got high on the smell of its own farts and is now choking. They don’t need crisp, crystal-clear filtered air to breathe. They just need something that isn’t their own farts.",
      "",
      "Not sure what we make of Chelsea. They have been, at times this season, almost unforgivably stupid and it’s always hard to imagine that kind of thing doesn’t come in some way or another from the manager. The Manchester United game was incredibly stupid.",
      "They were quite stupid against Forest as well, albeit that in the end they couldn’t quite compete with Forest’s stratospheric levels. Few could, which was why Ange Postecoglou had to go just to try and make it fair on other teams who wanted to try and be stupid.",
      "Hats off to Malo Gusto, mind, for never losing belief that Chelsea could still emerge as the most stupid on the day long after that ship had sailed.",
      "Enzo Maresca has been Chelsea boss for over a year now, which is no mean achievement in its own right. He’s taken them to the Champions League, won the Europa Carabao and been crowned quite literal champion of the world at the Trump World Cup.",
      "And yet when we ask ourselves the most simple and straightforward questions – Is Maresca actually good? Are Chelsea? – we still find that we really don’t know. Which we suppose is kind of inevitable when you stop running a football club as a football club.",
      "",
      "‘Outside the bottom three after eight games’ is surely a position Parker and Burnley would have taken before a ball was kicked, especially given the nature of those eight games.",
      "In fact, given Parker’s previous record in this competition and the fact those first eight league games have included Tottenham, Man United, Liverpool, Man City and Aston Villa, he’d have probably settled for just still being in a job at this point. As it is, he’s barely even an also-ran in the Sack Race at this point.",
      "Burnley have duly lost all five of those games mentioned above, but only at Spurs on the opening day and City last month have they been conspicuously second best. Both Man United and Liverpool needed late, late penalties to beat them, and Villa were given a late scare at Villa Park.",
      "What Burnley have done so far is secure points against their more direct rivals. They’ve already beaten both their fellow promoted clubs and taken a point off Nottingham Forest that at this time we really don’t know is any good or not.",
      "At some point Parker and his team really will have to work out a way to beat teams that were already in the Premier League before this year, but in fairness he hasn’t had many good chances. Games against Wolves and West Ham before the international break are definitely good chances. Arsenal perhaps not so much.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But what we do sense at Spurs is a vital and widespread uncertainty. A distinct lack of purpose. We don’t know what the goal is for Spurs this season after finally sorting out the silverware albatross. And we’re not too sure they – or Frank – really know either.",
      "This is a new team and new manager trying to build a relationship with each other and the fans, for whom the last major tie with the ups and downs of the eventful last decade has been severed with the departure of Son Heung-min.",
      "Spurs are a club now in search of new heroes and favourites, on the pitch and in the dugout, and it all just feels a bit directionless. Frank is a good coach, obviously, and there have been enough signs that in the right – and often that appears to be the most theoretically taxing – conditions his Spurs team could also be very good indeed.",
      "But they can also be thoroughly apathetic and entirely maddening. One could thus argue, if one were so inclined, that this is in fact already far more Spurs than has perhaps yet been realised.",
      "",
      "Has got Jack Grealish officially Enjoying His Football Again and we should all be delighted to observe it.",
      "It’s all going well enough right now, but Everton are one of several clubs in the big mid-table hump for whom this still feels very much like a season that could break in either direction as they sit four points away from both third and 17th.",
      "",
      "For varied and obvious and entirely understandable reasons, the Premier League manager discourse is currently dominated by a few names. Your Slots, Your Artetas, Your Amorims. The Sean Dyches of this world.",
      "But it occurs to us that there is currently very little being said about Pep Guardiola, and we find that quite interesting.",
      "Because this is a pretty crucial juncture in the Premier League career of one of Our League’s greatest managers. And we think he might just be starting to enjoy himself again.",
      "We’re pretty sure he didn’t really enjoy last season very much. You could see it on his face, sometimes viscerally and literally. A man used to competing for – and very often winning – the very biggest trophies was suddenly not doing that.",
      "Man City’s bids for a fifth straight Premier League crown and a second Champions League title were barely perceptible. The former disappeared in an astonishingly miserable run of form last autumn, one that also caused damage to the latter that proved to be unrecoverable.",
      "We spent a lot of last season wondering whether he might in fact walk away from City altogether, whether he any longer had the energy or desire to keep pushing himself and his players to go again in pursuit of yet more tin.",
      "Having watched his great rival Jurgen Klopp walk away from Liverpool due to possessing sufficient self-awareness and self-knowledge to know he just didn’t have another rebuild in him, would Guardiola be thinking in anything like the same way? We’re certain the thought at least crossed his mind, especially with Klopp clearly very much enjoying his less intensely and demandingly stressful Red Bull role so much.",
      "And despite his new contract, those thoughts resurfaced when City made a stuttering start this season, with consecutive and quite alarmingly tame early defeats to Spurs and Brighton hinting at another season in transition, a season building the foundations for something new rather than competing at the very top level.",
      "Could Guardiola really be arsed with all that? Building a new team to one day go against Arne Slot seemingly finding the Premier League embarrassingly easy, or whatever phase Arteta Arsenal are now in? What about right now?",
      "That’s all shifted a bit, though. City have been very good since the Brighton game and, with Liverpool/Slot losing the entire run of themselves over recent weeks it is once again Guardiola and his side who have emerged from the chaos looking the likelier challengers for a currently dominant Arsenal.",
      "And we know that going up against his old mate Mikel Arteta enlivens and energises Guardiola. It might just do so again. And we also don’t have to worry about just how much of an achievement Guardiola would consider it were City able to come out on top once again in that particular title battle.",
      "This new slightly more direct Haaland-centric, post-De Bruyne City shows tantalising signs of capturing Guardiola’s imagination in a way nothing really did last season.",
      "When you’ve achieved what Guardiola has achieved it must be unbelievably hard to keep coming back and putting yourself through it all again.",
      "This season suddenly looks to be playing out in just the way to get his blood up. The combination of the revitalising change in his own team’s methods and the familiarity of their direct rival might just be ideal.",
      "",
      "Still represents one of the most astonishing gambles a Premier League club has ever taken, the continuity candidate at a club that no longer had any of that, but three wins from the first eight games for a rookie manager suddenly in charge of a team that has lost its inspirational manager, most of his backroom staff, and players of the calibre of Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard is absolutely fine.",
      "They’re still scoring goals, which was the main worry. If Igor Thiago keeps up his current rate, Brentford will be fine. They’re the leading scorers in the bottom half of the table, and that’s a fair effort when you consider the resources Andrews has available and those he does not.",
      "There are lots of managers doing exceptional things at the Premier League’s smaller clubs, for want of a better word, but if Andrews negotiates this season keeping Brentford as far clear of the trapdoor as is currently the case, it will be as impressive as any of them.",
      "",
      "Feels like we could be just days away from the backlash. For when you have had your balls tickled and been told how brilliant you are as much and for as long as Glasner has, a backlash there must be.",
      "Very obviously an excellent manager, very obviously taking Palace to heights they really haven’t ever scaled before. But is there now, slightly awkwardly, just the slightest argument to be made they’re not doing quite as well this season as perhaps they ought?",
      "They’ve got the same number of Premier League wins as Brentford. They sit behind Sunderland in the table. We’re being very, very harsh here, but it feels like Glasner has done such things at Palace now that neither he nor they should be truly happy with sitting eighth in the table behind some conspicuously daft teams. They’re even being outperformed by Bournemouth as the division’s standout ‘punching above their weight with elite manager’ club.",
      "",
      "Mikel Arteta has now turned Arsenal into just about the least interesting team in the country, and this is almost entirely a compliment.",
      "They are now just exceptionally good at what they do, and it has provided them with a far more plausible, sustainable and coherent route to title success than previous Arteta phases have possessed and, even more importantly, than any of their potential (and largely wilting) rivals can lay claim to this season.",
      "The fact that Arsenal’s set-piece goals boil enough p*ss to solve the energy crisis is just a bonus.",
      "Because it’s Arsenal and because it’s Arteta, we still kind of expect a massive meltdown around January/February, with an FA Cup exit combined with a three-game winless Premier League run plunging them into a headloss crisis in which dark conspiracies are invoked and from which no recovery is possible.",
      "But that’s a triumph of experience over hope. This Arsenal side looks and feels different to Arteta’s previous efforts. Just their last three Premier League games provide compelling evidence of that. They’ve won at Newcastle and Fulham, while easing to a home win over West Ham.",
      "It might not seem too startling, until you consider that Arsenal contrived to collect but a single point from the same three games last season.",
      "They’re not even incurring as much wrath from the celebration police these days. This really should be the season they finally get over the line, at which point it probably will be a smart idea for everyone else to just switch off the internet for a month or so until the World Cup.",
      "READ: Arsenal are ‘boring’ and rely on set-pieces? Nope, they’re just really, really good",
      "",
      "Hands up who thought he and his team would be doing this well, with nary a thought of relegation or prominent Sack Race involvement to be seen?",
      "Put them down, you ridiculous liar.",
      "He’s been brilliant, they’ve been brilliant. And what Le Bris and Sunderland have done in these first eight games is in no small part responsible for the absolute panic currently going off at clubs around the league.",
      "The fact none of the promoted teams this year appear willing to meekly accept their designated role as cannon fodder is making several members of the Settled Seventeen nervous in a way they haven’t been in the last two seasons, but Sunderland are the main reason there are so many arses currently twitching so violently at your Wolveses, Forests and West Hams, and why even the Fulhams of this world no longer appear immune.",
      "",
      "He’s not just doing a good job. He’s doing one so good that we genuinely suspect it might actually be witchcraft. How, for instance, does a team of Bournemouth’s resources lose, in the space of one summer, defensive players of the calibre of Ilya Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez – not to mention their first-choice goalkeeper – and not just carry on regardless but actively improve?",
      "Something’s not right here. If anything for me, Clive, Iraola’s almost managing Bournemouth too well.",
      "We really are no more than two minor Arsenal setbacks away from asking whether Bournemouth can Do A Leicester in what we’re already confident Barclays scholars will come to consider the stupidest season since all the nonsense of 2015/16. Although last season is also right up there, now we think about it. This is the age of nonsense.",
      "But at Bournemouth, it is only the good kind of nonsense.",
      "Tell you what you don’t hear much of these days. People saying it’s an absolute disgrace for Bournemouth to have replaced Gary O’Neil with Iraola. That kind of chatter was all the rage for a while back there.",
      "This week’s Famous F365 Friday Quiz tests your knowledge of the songs you will be murdering on the terraces this weekend…",
      "The reaction to some Arne Slot quotes have led to some ‘po-faced nonsense analysis’ which ‘means we’re talking about the wrong bloody things’ with Liverpool.",
      "Tottenham and Chelsea are in a slightly false position in the Premier League according to the underlying numbers.",
      "It’s been six years for Arsenal so they are way down this list, but it does feel ridiculous. But not as ridiculous a trophy drought as some…",
      "Manchester United are among the the Premier League’s biggest underperformers, but they are way behind Newcastle United.",
      "Arne Slot might want to consider that other managers can play against Liverpool as they wish; it’s his job to coach against that."

      "Marcus Rashford scored his second Champions League brace for Barcelona to help Hansi Flick’s side thrash Olympiacos 6-1 on Tuesday evening.",
      "Barcelona were nowhere near their best but still led 2-0 at half-time thanks to Fermin Lopez’s brace.",
      "Ayoub El Kaabi halved the deficit from the penalty spot in bizarre circumstances. He’d headed home in open play, but the ball struck Eric Garcia’s arm and deflected off El Kaabi into Daniel Podence — who assisted the header — in an offside position.",
      "The game then shifted completely in Barcelona’s favour.",
      "Santiago Hezze was sent off for a very debatable second yellow card just four minutes after El Kaabi’s goal, and Olympiacos collapsed.",
      "Within 11 minutes of Hezze’s dismissal, Lamine Yamal converted a penalty — won by Rashford — to restore Barca’s two-goal lead, triggering a flurry of four goals in 11 minutes.",
      "Fermin completed his hat-trick with a fine volley sandwiched between two brilliant Rashford finishes.",
      "Rashford couldn’t complete his own treble, but it was another hugely positive night for him in a Barcelona shirt.",
      "The Manchester United loanee has come alive in the Champions League this season, scoring a brace against Newcastle United on matchday one and providing an assist against Paris Saint-Germain on matchday two.",
      "That means Rashford now has the most goal involvements in the competition in 2025/26. Only Julian Alvarez (10) and Kylian Mbappe (17) have more contributions across all competitions of La Liga players this term — Rashford has nine.",
      "He’s also been involved in goals in eight of his last nine appearances for the Blaugrana.",
      "Rashford is a player revitalised, thriving in a system that suits him perfectly.",
      "He led the line against Olympiacos but has mostly featured from the left, and proving himself in both positions is a major boost for both him and Flick.",
      "His resurgence isn’t just good news for Barca, Flick and the player himself — it’s also a positive for Manchester United and England.",
      "While Rashford is showing he’s a player United could still use, that chapter looks closed. If he somehow stops scoring now, Barca probably won’t trigger the £26million buy option. But if he keeps this up, they’ll activate it the second it becomes available.",
      "Both his goals against Olympiacos were fired in at the front post, leaving Konstantinos Tzolakis rooted to his line — instinctive, clinical, and vintage Rashford.",
      "Next up for Rashford and Barcelona? Real Madrid in El Clasico. Delicious.",
      "READ NEXT: Barcelona want to ‘send Rashford home’ to Man Utd? Of course they do…",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘huge transfer U-turn’ at Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Marcus Rashford got another couple of goals and an assist for Barcelona on Tuesday, and for some that serves as proof he was “lazy” at Man Utd. He can’t win.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is behind just two players for Premier League goals against the Big Six for Manchester United, and should get enough penalties to catch them.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "Keane, Rooney and Neville all believe Rashford should look in the mirror before criticising Manchester United, but his Manchester United was theirs in name only.",
      "Rooney say Rashford blaming Man Utd for his “inconsistent” displays is an “easy” excuse and told the England international to look in the mirror."

      "READ: Actually, winners Manchester United had a better summer transfer window than losers Liverpool",
      "In the summer window, Mainoo submitted a request to leave on loan, but this was denied as Man Utd felt that they did not have appropriate cover.",
      "However, Mainoo’s situation has not changed in recent months and it is not out of the question that he leaves Man Utd in January.",
      "Serie A giants Napoli were among the clubs interested in Mainoo in the summer and a new report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims he is already ‘very close to finalising’ a move to the Italian side.",
      "According to the report, Man Utd are more willing to let him leave in the winter than in the summer, with the Premier League giants setting ‘favourable conditions’ for a transfer.",

      "The report adds:",
      "‘The terms of the deal will be crucial: United are demanding that the loan not include a buyout clause; Napoli, meanwhile, needs space in midfield to include him.",

      "A report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Mainoo’s ‘concerns are growing’ at Man Utd as he is ‘weighing up a loan move in January’.",

      "However, United went ahead in the second minute of the game and though Cody Gakpo equalised for Liverpool in the 78th minute, honours were only even for six minutes, before Harry Maguire secured the win for United with a header into the corner of the net.",
      "Red Devils legend Neville has revealed he and many others had little faith of the club pulling off a win, but they were immediately proven wrong.",
      "He said on the Gary Neville Podcast: “And not just me, but when I saw the team, I thought, we’ve got no chance.",
      "“And I had three or four texts from United fans saying, oh my God, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] in midfield, [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt at the back.",

      "“I have to say, within a minute, that had gone because it was a brilliant moment for United, a really good bit of play from Amad [Diallo], slipping it into [Bryan] Mbeumo. And that just got them off on the right footing.”",
      "A look at the stats of the game suggests there was indeed reason for Neville and others to be cautious.",
      "Liverpool had more shots, more on target and much more of the ball. However, United sat back and played the ball long to get themselves out of trouble and transition from defence to attack.",

Bournemouth are understandably keen to persuade the Spaniard to sign on again but Iraola is ambitious and many big European clubs will be circling.",

      "Marcus Rashford has made it clear he wants to stay at Barcelona as he gears up for his first El Clasico against Real Madrid on Sunday.",
      "Rashford moved to Barcelona on loan from Manchester United this summer and the LaLiga giants have the option of making the deal permanent next year.",
      "Having scored five goals in 12 games, including a double in the midweek Champions League thrashing of Olympiacos, the 27-year-old is clear where his future lies.",
      "Asked if he wanted to stay, Rashford told ESPN: \"Oh yeah, for sure.",
      "\"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game.",
      "\"To play here, it's an honour.\"",
      "Rashford has a contract at Old Trafford until 2028 but having also spent a brief spell on loan at Aston Villa last season it is highly unlikely he will return under current boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Rashford believes the timing was right for him to move from United last summer, saying he is benefitting from a \"new environment\" at Barca after more than 20 years at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It's been a big change but it hasn't felt big,\" Rashford said. \"I watched Barcelona for years and I felt if I was to move, this team would be a perfect fit.",
      "\"I am happy here and to be with the group is a special feeling.",
      "On his move away from United and needing \"a change\", he added: \"It was so many years in one place.",
      "\"People forget this, but 24, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United, so sometimes you just need a change. I think maybe this is the case with me and I'm enjoying everything.",
      "\"There's not been much change in me.",
      "\"It's a new environment and a new culture, and I've looked forward to coming here. It hasn't disappointed.",
      "\"I'm hungry to improve and I know there is more to come from me.\"",
      "Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa for the second half of last season and he produced some promising displays under Unai Emery at Villa Park as he looked to get his career back on track.",
      "However, at Barcelona this season he has looked much more like the Rashford of old.",
      "His two goals on Tuesday in the Champions League against Olympiakos took his tally to five in 12 games in Spain, with his form leading to an England recall under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "\"I just believe that things happen when they're supposed to happen,\" Rashford said.",
      "\"It's not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn't happen in the past and now is my opportunity to make it happen.",
      "\"I feel like there's no time like the present now. So I just take things day to day.",
      "\"Every day I just take it day by day and just try to improve from the day before.\"",
      "Rashford's Spanish adventure continues on Sunday with his first El Clasico as Barca travel the Bernabeu to face LaLiga leaders Real Madrid.",
      "Hansi Flick's side are currently two points behind Real and have the chance to leapfrog their rivals into top spot with a win.",
      "\"For me, it's the biggest game in football,\" Rashford said ahead of his first experience of El Clasico.",
      "\"Being from Manchester, it's not the biggest game in Manchester or England, but for me, we were always watching El Clasico. The one game to watch was this game.",
      "\"To play in it will be an unbelievable experience, but for me, it's about winning.",
      "\"To make the experience memorable, I have to try and help the team win.",
      "\"That's the main objective but of course it is a great team we are playing against. They are in really good form so it's not going to be easy but we will give our best to get the job done.",
      "\"It's been an okay start but obviously this next game is a good opportunity to accelerate the process. We are looking forward to it and like any game, we'll try to get the job done and win.\"",

      "After calling events at Anfield last weekend to a tee, The Radar column returns with a look at Tottenham's mismatched midfield pairing of Joao Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur and the numbers underlining the super-powers of Man Utd's Bruno Fernandes",
      "Friday 24 October 2025 10:34, UK",
      "",
      "🤔 Tottenham's midfield issue analysed📊 Fernandes' unrivalled creativity🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Wednesday's game against Monaco was just the latest in which the balance has looked off in the centre of Frank's team. It is becoming increasingly apparent that Palhinha and Bentancur are too similar, both players' strengths lying out of possession.",
      "Spurs are struggling to progress the ball through midfield. Amazingly, the pair only directed seven of a combined 58 passes forward against Monaco. They only found striker Richarlison three times. Substitute Randal Kolo Muani was not found once.",
      "The issue was clear in Spurs' defeat to Aston Villa too, with Palhinha and Bentancur sending only 15 of their 79 passes forward and only finding Mathys Tel once. Even in the win over Leeds, in which Tel scored, he was only fed twice by Palhinha and Bentancur.",
      "Tel's goal proved crucial at Elland Road but he was substituted in the second half of the game having only touched the ball 13 times.",
      "Spurs profile similarly to Burnley, West Ham and Everton for forward passes and defenders bypassed from central midfield this season, at the opposite end of the scale to the Premier League's top sides.",
      "Frank can argue the decision to pair Palhinha and Bentancur together is justified if it adds defensive solidity. But that is a hard case to make after Wednesday's game. Monaco cut through Spurs easily. They had enough chances to win it twice over.",
      "Their record with and without them is revealing.",
      "Spurs have only won three out of nine games with both players starting this season, and one of them was against League One Doncaster Rovers in the Carabao Cup. The side's record is far better in their other games, with three wins and a draw from four.",
      "In fairness, they are not the only ones being found wanting when it comes to servicing the side's forwards. Xavi Simons provided an assist against West Ham from a corner on his debut following his arrival from PSV Eindhoven but has struggled since.",
      "Across two starts in the No 10 role against Leeds and Aston Villa, he did not manage to complete a single pass to Tottenham's strikers.",
      "The disconnect running through the heart of the team can be seen in their passing network, which highlights the lack of combinations between their midfield and attack this season.",
      "So what are the alternatives? With Simons still finding his feet, Frank is unfortunate to be without the injured James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, key players who ranked first and third respectively among Spurs players for progressive passes last season.",
      "Frank's pool of midfielders without them is a shallow one. He has Lucas Bergvall and also mentioned Archie Gray as an option after using him at left-back against Monaco. Pape Matar Sarr might be his best bet to bring some much-needed drive having impressed with a goal and two assists earlier in the campaign.",
      "In the long-term, Spurs will probably need to use future transfer windows to redress the balance between ball-winners and ball-players at the base of their midfield. But in the meantime, a change to the Palhinha and Bentancur axis looks necessary.",
      "He reaches the milestone with an outstanding body of work behind him. His total of 100 goals in 299 games puts him 26 clear of any current or former team-mate in the same timeframe. His total of 84 assists is more than double anyone else's.",
      "Fernandes has had to endure periods of heavy criticism during his time in the Premier League. His status as captain remains the subject of some debate. But few players can claim to have been more consistent when it comes to the stuff that really matters.",
      "The 31-year-old is out on his own among Premier League players for chances created since his debut in 2020, his total of 560 roughly 30 per cent higher than the next player on the list in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "He also comes out on top for expected assists, which highlights the quality of the opportunities created as well as the volume.",
      "Fernandes has been moved further back by Amorim this season, into his midfield two. But he continues to deliver unmatched creativity.",
      "The sensational first-time cross to set up Harry Maguire's winning goal against Liverpool at Anfield was one of 22 chances created by him this season. No other player has created more than 17.",
      "Where Manchester United would be without him hardly bears thinking about after the lows of last season. But his robustness is another super-power. Fernandes has featured in 203 of a possible 212 Premier League games since his arrival, starting 199.",
      "He is always there. And he almost always delivers.",
      "Savinho's Manchester future City looked uncertain following interest from Spurs in the summer but he signed a new contract earlier this month and looks to be getting back to his best having provided assists in back-to-back games against Everton and Villarreal. Erling Haaland will aim to make the most of his service against Aston Villa.",
      "Ruben Amorim's back three to cause issues for Arne Slot, Liverpool's problems when playing against back threes, Man Utd being better with less possession... Last week's column previewing their meeting at Anfield was ahead of the game.",

      "Thursday 23 October 2025 14:43, UK",
      "Manchester United's win at Anfield was huge for this team, make no mistake about it.",
      "To finally get back-to-back wins for the first time, not just under Ruben Amorim, but since May 2024, is finally a topic we do not have to talk about anymore.",
      "Also, to be the first United side and manager to win at Anfield for the first time since 2016 is another impressive feat.",
      "This is in addition to the 2-0 win against Sunderland before the latest international break, which was seen as a huge challenge for a United side that had just come off a disappointing defeat to Brentford one week before. Again, well-handled by United.",
      "They are overdue a bit of credit after what had all the potential to be a disastrous few weeks, the type of few weeks that could raise even further questions about a manager's future.",
      "Having spoken to a few of the players after the Liverpool game, including Diogo Dalot and Senne Lammens, I get the feeling the players sense this could be the start of real momentum under Amorim.",
      "However, with United hosting Brighton at Old Trafford this weekend it will be their toughest test this season and truly a measure of how this team has developed under Amorim in the last 12 months.",
      "Sometimes you come across strange statistics when two teams face each other. From memory, it was pretty easy to remember Brighton had beaten United in both of their meetings last season.",
      "However it is more shocking to learn that Brighton have beaten them in six of their last seven meetings. No team has beaten the Red Devils on more occasions since 2022 than Brighton.",
      "For Amorim's only game in charge against Brighton, United were dismantled last season by long balls as well as their own errors - including one by Andre Onana, who is now out on loan in Turkey.",
      "With United's new keeper Lammens continuing his impressive start to life at Old Trafford, the side have improved from last season in terms of showing defiant defensive performances when they have needed to against the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Burnley.",
      "However, they will have to show they can contain Brighton's imposing and incisive style of play - a type of test they have yet had at Old Trafford bar the opening day against Arsenal.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba starred (while also giving away a penalty) in last season's win at Old Trafford and it will undoubtedly be an interesting subplot as Baleba's form has taken time to warm up amid interest shown in him by United during the summer transfer window.",
      "Since Amorim's arrival, United have won just 11 games in the Premier League. When you dissect those 11 wins, four have come against the 'bigger' sides in the league.",
      "Then you look at the other seven, five are against promoted sides, one against a relegation-threatened Everton last season and a win away to Fulham which, after a decent sample size, feels like a bit of an outlier.",
      "United have shown glimpses of what they are capable of but, other than Tottenham Hotspur in a few weeks, until they face Aston Villa on December 21, all of their upcoming fixtures would be classed as against mid-table sides.",
      "These are the games United have struggled in over the last 12 months, the games they have failed to consistently make an impact, a performance or gather consistency.",
      "This is going to be a pivotal time in the season for Amorim's United. The Portuguese manager as well as his players have spoken repeatedly about building momentum and wanting to put last season's troubles behind them; this is their first opportunity to do so.",
      "There will be interesting selection dilemmas for Amorim ahead of their match against Brighton.",
      "When you look at their two previous wins, he has gone with two slightly different teams - the first difference being who leads the line as the No 9. Matheus Cunha displayed an accomplished performance against Liverpool, but then Benjamin Sesko also picked up his first goal at Old Trafford against Sunderland in the previous game.",
      "Other dilemmas will be whether Amorim continues with the combination of Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo on the right - their chemistry a huge positive of the season so far - and will Harry Maguire continue at the back after his Anfield heroics? Or could Leny Yoro be recalled with Brighton's threat of pace in behind?",
      "Interesting selections for Amorim to ponder but he has got all of his tactical and in-game situations right in the last two games, so this does not seem just a huge opportunity for his side but also for the manager himself who has made no secret of just how tough the job leading this United side has been over the last 12 months.",
      "If United are able to string back-to-back wins against two opponents they have had poor results against in recent years it would do wonders for this team's confidence but also perhaps it would gain the trust and respect of not just the fans at Old Trafford but of opponents, pundits and the media alike as well.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and thinks West Ham are in for more misery at Leeds.",
      "West Ham are now 10/11 with Sky Bet to be relegated, and frankly, that might still be on the generous side.",
      "What we're watching isn't a blip or a bad run, it's the inevitable product of years of poor recruitment and muddled thinking. Across 2025, if you take out the relegated teams, the Hammers have taken the fewest points of any Premier League team (24) and conceded the most goals (45).",
      "The modern Premier League is defined by energy, athleticism and the ability to win duels all over the pitch.",
      "West Ham are not fit for purpose in that regard.",
      "What was once a robust and organised unit under David Moyes has eroded into a plodding, predictable outfit who are easily bullied. There's no clear identity to this squad now - one which is too slow to play on the counter and too fragile to play on the front foot.",
      "And in a league where even the promoted teams, like Leeds, are stacked with pace, athleticism and duel-winners, it stinks of a relegation season now for the Hammers.",
      "The Brentford performance sounded those alarm bells loud and clear. This is a football club heading one way - and that's down. Anyone looking to build a bet for this one should put a Leeds win at 5/6 with Sky Bet as the cornerstone.",
      "Dan Ballard to have a shot at 5/6 with Sky Bet jumps off the page at the prices on offer.",
      "The centre-back isn't just a threat from set pieces, he's an aerial menace, a man who dominates the skies like a 747 cutting through cloud.",
      "Ballard's presence from dead-ball situations is becoming one of the most potent set-piece weapons in the league. Sunderland know it, as do their opposition, but stopping him is another matter entirely. He attacks the ball with that blend of timing, aggression and pure intent. If you squint, it could be Harry Maguire. The two are very alike.",
      "They both play like their forehead contains a magnet to the ball. It's why Ballard's shots data is so appealing when it comes to betting. In just 293 minutes of action this season, he's had eight shots - which equates to 2.32 per 90.",
      "When this plane takes off, you want to be on board.",
      "Malick Thiaw is settling in nicely at Newcastle and is popping up as a genuine threat from set pieces. At 6ft 4in, he's built like a brick, erm, lighthouse and attacks the ball with great authority - something which is key to finding value in the prop markets on centre-backs. He goes up with the intention of scoring a goal as shown by his haul of six shots in his last five appearances.",
      "Fulham's set-piece defending has been a worry for a while. Since the start of last season they are averaging 0.35 worth of expected goals conceded from set pieces per 90 - of ever-present Premier League sides only Manchester United and West Ham are shipping more .",
      "And the absence of Joachim Andersen for Fulham, their dominant aerial presence and organiser at the back, leaves a glaring void. Thiaw can take advantage and looks a slice of value at 4/1 with Sky Bet to have a shot on target.",
      "Momentum is everything in betting and sport. Spot the players in form before the markets fully wake up and you're laughing.",
      "Last week, we were on the right lines with Amad Diallo to play a part in a Manchester United goal against Liverpool, and he delivered. He's linking up beautifully down the right with Bryan Mbeumo, forming a partnership that's quietly starting to purr.",
      "Tactically, this match-up looks tailor-made for those two again. Brighton's full-backs push on aggressively, leaving acres of grass behind them which is perfect territory for pace and precision on the counter.",
      "It's easy to picture a scenario of Mbeumo spinning infield, Amad overlapping and the net rippling for a second week in a row. It's 3/1 with Sky Bet for both Amad and Mbeumo to score or assist.",
      "All the scrutiny on Alexander Isak, Mohamed Salah and Florian Wirtz at Liverpool has taken the limelight away from Cody Gakpo, who is quietly stealing the show this season in the Liverpool attack. He's the first name on the teamsheet.",
      "In a Liverpool front line full of egos and expectation, he's quietly doing what every forward should: scoring goals, consistently. He's bagged three in his last three and at 2/1 with Sky Bet to score against Brentford, it's clear the market hasn't noticed the Gakpo hot streak.",
      "The Bees do struggle with fluid, interchanging movement from opposition strikers, and their tendency to defend the width of the box opens up the perfect pockets for Gakpo to exploit - like he did in this fixture last season where he somehow failed to score despite a bulky expected goals figure of 0.84 from three shots.",
      "While everyone's watching and critiquing the star attacking options, the smart money should be on the in-form one.",
      "There's a betting angle emerging with Arsenal regarding their second halves producing more goals than the first. Mikel Arteta's side are the masters of control and that is seen through this trend. They strangle games early, suffocate space and rarely give the opposition a sniff in the first half.",
      "But once the patterns are set and perhaps fatigue creeps in with decision-making from the opposition in the second half, the tempo changes and that's where the goals tend to come. There have been just eight first-half goals scored in Arsenal's last 10 matches across all competitions, but 16 after the break.",
      "It's 11/10 with Sky Bet for more goals to be scored in the second half than the first.",
      "There's a new ruthlessness about Manchester City, not just with the ball, but without it.",
      "The headlines might still go to the monster that is Erling Haaland, but equally as important is their defensive solidity. Led by the colossus Ruben Dias and the commanding presence of Gianluigi Donnarumma, this is a side that has rediscovered the art of control and clean sheets. The Italian goalkeeper has conceded just four goals in eight games.",
      "And that makes City to win to nil at 5/2 with Sky Bet a bet that demands attention.",
      "The market still gives Villa plenty of respect at home - and understandably so, given their record of losing just one of their last 22 Premier League home games. However, dig a little deeper and Villa's expected goals numbers in the Premier League are still underwhelming at just 0.86 per 90 - only four teams have a lower average.",
      "City are taken to see them off.",
      "Every so often, a market quietly drifts away from reality and that's exactly what's happened with Bournemouth's goal lines. While everyone associates Andoni Iraola's side with chaos and attacking flair, the raw numbers paint a far duller picture, especially at home.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League home games, matches at the Vitality have averaged just 1.92 goals per game. Enter the perfect storm for a low-scoring encounter, then, as in come Nottingham Forest under Sean Dyche.",
      "You know what you're getting with Dyche, a compact shape, an emphasis on organisation and a gameplan built around defensive resilience. His teams don't do chaos. It's all about containment, especially away from home.",
      "At 10/11 with Sky Bet, the price for under 2.5 goals is a runner.",
      "Ah, the six-pointer. Two words that make managers twitch and fans panic.",
      "These are the fixtures that decide seasons. For Wolves it is simply a massive match.",
      "They remain the only team without a win in the top four divisions this season and a failure to show the required intent against Burnley could just tip an already frustrated home crowd over the edge. Every so often in football, the biggest threat to a team's performance isn't the opposition, it's their own stadium. West Ham have proven it this season and it might just be the case for Wolves here.",
      "The hosts look a touch skinny at Evens with Sky Bet meaning Burnley on the double chance are the play at 4/5.",
      "Under Thomas Frank's watch, Spurs look more organised, compact and risk-averse. In 13 games, they are conceding just 0.8 goals per game. Frank clearly has focused on the structural basics: protecting the centre-backs, limiting transitions, ensuring the midfield-defensive link is sound.",
      "That side of the game is working.",
      "But football is not only about shutting the door - it's also about creating chances, scoring goals and giving something for the fans to shout about. Spurs aren't doing that - as shown by their lacklustre attacking showing in Monaco where they once again created low volume and low quality chances. Across their last nine games they are averaging just 9.67 shots per 90.",
      "So, we've got a team here in Spurs that don't concede goals or don't score many.",
      "Back the under 2.5 line at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",

      "Manchester United pulled off a shock victory to beat the Premier League's reigning champions Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield but how did they do it? We pick out the key reasons why Ruben Amorim was able to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time...",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 21:52, UK",
      "",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot seemed surprised by United's team selection from the outset as Amorim omitted Benjamin Sesko despite the striker scoring in his previous two Premier League appearances for the club and starting in each of the last four.",
      "In fact, it wasn't. Matheus Cunha took on the centre-forward duties, but did not give Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate such a reference point for them to mark. \"If we [play] Ben I think it is easier for these type of centre-backs to control our striker,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim was also rewarded for his positive decision to keep Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo together on the right rather than opting for a more defensively-minded wing-back. It paid off in little over a minute when the pair combined for the opening goal.",
      "Milos Kerkez, Liverpool's summer signing from Bournemouth, has been targeted by numerous teams this season and that appeared to have been identified as a weakness United could exploit. \"Kerkez does not look comfortable,\" said Jamie Carragher early on.",
      "Kerkez's uncertainty seems to have had a knock-on effect on the once imperious Van Dijk. \"Normally the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence gets punished,\" pointed out Gary Neville. \"But today it's the left hand side. Kerkez and Van Dijk have struggled.\"",
      "The goal immediately increased the tension inside Anfield. Van Dijk was urging Ryan Gravenberch to be calmer as early as the sixth minute when the midfielder attempted an ambitious pass in behind. \"We were far too rushed,\" said the captain after the game.",
      "Slot repeatedly referenced United's use of long balls afterwards but that was a smart play at Anfield, denying Liverpool the opportunity to win the ball high up the pitch through their pressing. Senne Lammens booted the ball away time and time again.",
      "In fact, the Belgian goalkeeper has the lowest pass completion rate of any Premier League goalkeeper to play 180 minutes this season. The top two goalkeepers? Giorgi Mamardashvili and Alisson Becker, both of Liverpool. A clash of styles. United's won out.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim got his tactics spot on at Anfield,\" said Carragher while analysing the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"It's not just about going long; he didn't pick [Benjamin] Sesko, he picked [Matheus] Cunha to be under the ball.",
      "\"The important thing to notice is how narrow the players are, it's not about going long, it's about picking up the second ball.",
      "\"It was all about picking up the second ball. Look how narrow the five players are. That's where the first goal comes from.",
      "\"The tactic of going long was spot on.\"",
      "Inevitably, Liverpool pushed in the second half, Slot's bold substitutions just after the hour mark meaning wave after wave of attacks towards the Kop followed. The home side got their equaliser but Amorim noted afterwards that the response was crucial.",
      "\"We managed well when we suffered the goal, we managed that moment well and that is the key point for our team.\" The momentum was with Liverpool but United managed to retain enough composure to stay in it and find a winning goal of their own.",
      "It came from the second phase after a corner. Amorim had included Harry Maguire because of his aerial ability in his own box, but it proved decisive at the other end of the pitch. Liverpool have now conceded five goals from set-pieces already this season.",
      "\"Defending in a set-piece at 1-1, it happened to us at Palace and again today,\" said Slot. The Liverpool boss pointed out that his team created far more from open play but acknowledged that set-pieces are part of the game. \"That is something we have to do [better].\"",
      "There was still time for Liverpool to equalise but Cunha came into his own in those closing stages. \"Cunha has one characteristic that can help the team move forward,\" Amorim said beforehand and he showed in late on, often getting United up the field.",
      "\"More or less all the transitions was Cunha. He was so far from the centre-backs and that helped us to take the ball,\" said Amorim afterwards. The Brazilian could be seen celebrating after winning a free-kick in stoppage time. His role was vital for United.",
      "Carragher also went on to explain on Monday Night Football how United's use of a 5-4-1 formation out of possession allowed Amorim's squad to remain compact throughout the fixture, with their only moments of weakness arriving when the team became separated as a result of players pressing Liverpool.",
      "\"The talk of the low-block, it was the right thing to do,\" Carragher said.",
      "\"On a couple of occasions, when United tried to go after Liverpool and press, that's where they had problems. If they got caught out, there was space in behind.",
      "\"That's when United they are at their worst, when the team are spread out. The team are separated. It comes from them pressing high. They were right to not go after Liverpool and to play in a 5-4-1 low-block.\"",
      "Of course, Liverpool had their chances and Cody Gakpo, who had hit the frame of the goal three times before scoring, could and should have had a second. But Neville summed it up well. \"When you come to Anfield, you need a little bit of luck.\" United earned theirs.",

      "Report and free highlights as Man Utd beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield; Harry Maguire headed winning goal after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's acrimonious opener; Liverpool have lost four games in a row for the first time since 2014",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 07:17, UK",
      "Harry Maguire stunned Liverpool as his 84th-minute header clinched Manchester United's first win at Anfield since 2016 and condemned the hosts to a fourth consecutive defeat.",
      "Maguire guided in Bruno Fernandes's cross just six minutes after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out a controversial opening goal from Bryan Mbeumo only 62 seconds into a thrilling contest.",
      "Mbeumo beat Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo's pass to leave Anfield shellshocked but Liverpool were furious play wasn't stopped for a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister, who went down in the build-up after colliding with Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Liverpool: Mamardashvili (5), Bradley (6), Van Dijk (5), Konate (6), Kerkez (5), Gravenberch (6), Szoboszlai (7), Mac Allister (6), Salah (5), Gakpo (7), Isak (5).\n\n\nSubs: Jones (6), Wirtz (6), Ekitike (6), Chiesa (7), Frimpong (6).\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), De Ligt (7), Maguire (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (5), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (8), Amad (8), Mount (6), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Ugarte (5), Dorgu (5), Sesko (6), Yoro (n/a), Mainoo (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Harry Maguire",
      "Mac Allister needed treatment and had to play on wearing protective headgear but VAR could not intervene as there was no foul. Guidance from the Premier League Match Centre suggested referee Michael Oliver did not stop play as he did not see the injury.",
      "The dramatic opening set the tone for a pulsating game with Manchester United initially resisting Liverpool's efforts to equalise with the help of some luck. Gakpo struck the post three times before finally hauling the hosts level when he tucked home substitute Federico Chiesa's low cross.",
      "The out-of-form Mohamed Salah had also missed two gilt-edged chances but it felt like Liverpool were primed to find a winner before Maguire struck to spark more jubilant celebrations from Manchester United, who might have had a second goal in the first half had Fernandes not fired wide from a big chance.",
      "Liverpool tried to rally again in the closing stages but Gakpo missed a glorious opportunity, heading wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross when it looked easier to score, leaving them to face up to a fourth consecutive loss for the first time since 2014, having also been beaten by Chelsea, Galatasaray and Crystal Palace.",
      "A momentous victory for Manchester United means they have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Ruben Amorim. It puts them only two points behind Liverpool in the table, with the champions four points off leaders Arsenal in third.",
      "\"In the first five or six games it was about the signings we made, now it's about Mo Salah.",
      "\"We had more than enough chances to score. Mo missed a big one. Some others missed a big chances. We are not used to this.",
      "\"We needed a goal, but we needed a player who could create something in that end phase. That's what Jeremie [Frimpong, who came on for Salah] did, he had a great action, crossed to Cody.",
      "\"If we had been 3-0 up, Cody would have scored. I cannot guarantee this. So every player has tried everything. But it didn't work out for us.\"",
      "\"It's three points but it's a good victory. I will do the same thing I did in the last few games which is try to see the game back.",
      "\"In key points we had some luck, but we fought for every ball.",
      "\"We lost our composure in the second half. But the most important thing was the spirit was there.",
      "\"That is the beginning of everything. Sometimes you play more with the ball, other days you play without the ball.",
      "\"But if you have the spirit, you can win any game.",
      "\"They had had the better of us over the last few years and it's not been good for our club.",
      "\"We have not given our fans enough days like today, so it has been a long time coming, coming to this ground and picking up three points.",
      "\"It is not just three points to the club and to the boys. I have been coming to this ground for seven years now and to not get three points has been tough. It's for the fans and I hope they had a great night tonight.",
      "\"We won't get carried away because we can't afford that as a club, we will use it as motivation.\"",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Ruben Amorim had cited his set-piece threat and he delivered.",
      "His goal, guided home from Bruno Fernandes's delicate cross, means he joins Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, John O'Shea, Ryan Giggs and Diego Forlan on the list of Manchester United players to have scored winners at Anfield.",
      "It is an illustrious group and nobody can begrudge Maguire his place in it. He has been written off on numerous occasions. Manchester United have tried to move him on. But he continues to play a vital role and this might be his biggest contribution yet.",
      "It was cathartic for him in a sense. On Manchester United's last visit to Anfield in January, for a 2-2 draw, he missed a late chance to win it, ending up with his head in his hands. This time, he ended up leading the celebrations, a nine-year wait over.",
      "He excelled defensively too. Manchester United needed luck on their side, with Cody Gakpo hitting the woodwork three times before his equaliser. But Maguire certainly made their life harder, winning headers, making clearances, and ultimately winning the game.",
      "\"He needed something, the pressure was building but a win at Anfield is huge.",
      "\"It's a great place for Manchester United to win a game of football.",
      "\"It's a big period coming up, the manager is under pressure and they pulled something out of the bag.",
      "\"They have to make sure this is the start of something.",
      "\"Harry Maguire and his team-mates will be proud tonight.\"",
      "\"We worked so hard to get back into the game and we created great opportunities to score the winner but if you concede a second goal like that, that is the disappointing part.",
      "\"If you look at the game as a whole, we were far too rushed. I think they were very patient they didn't press us high but they didn't let us on the ball. We still created many opportunities to score but the reality is that we lost.\"",
      "\"It is an interesting time because we have to stick together, not just us as players but as a club and the fans who want us to win.\"",

      "Plus: Morgan Rogers repays Unai Emery's faith as resurgent Aston Villa inflict more woe on Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium",
      "Sunday 19 October 2025 20:52, UK",
      "",
      "Curtis Jones and Florian Wirtz in a midfield two? It was surely not the plan at half past four in the afternoon, let alone in the summer. But this was Liverpool with a little over an hour gone against Manchester United at Anfield. Let the chaos ensue.",
      "It has been their season in microcosm, a wildness highlighted on the opening night of the campaign in a prickly conversation between Arne Slot and Jamie Carragher. Liverpool beat Bournemouth that evening. But the control they had is clearly gone.",
      "They created enough chances to beat Manchester United. Slot was at pains to point that out. Cody Gakpo struck the frame of the goal on three separate occasions. Mohamed Salah missed a chance so inviting that Curtis Jones was already celebrating.",
      "\"I do not think it is usual that we are missing so many chances. This weekend again, set-pieces are such a crucial part. We are the team that creates the most in open play, I don't think that has changed. But that is not the only way to win a game.\"",
      "He is right. Liverpool have created 85 chances from open play, the most of any team in the Premier League. But he is also right to mention the defending from set-pieces. There is a vulnerability to Liverpool now and the two may be related. It is about balance.",
      "Milos Kerkez shone for Bournemouth last season but is struggling at left-back, targeted each week by opponents who sense weakness. Virgil van Dijk looks less sure of himself too, leaving that flank exposed. The captain himself was culpable for the opener.",
      "There was an irony to Van Dijk preaching calm afterwards because more urgency from him might have helped instead of allowing Bryan Mbeumo to drag himself from the deck and sprint in behind the Liverpool defence to fire United ahead after 62 seconds.",
      "Composed can soon come to be seen as lackadaisical once the goals start going in against you. It is 11 conceded after eight Premier League games this season compared to the miserly three that gave Liverpool the platform for success last time out.",
      "Too often, Liverpool find themselves playing catch-up. \"When you are 1-0 down, you need to take more risks,\" said Slot. Hence, the sight of his Galacticos arrowing forward towards the Kop late on, all talent and no cohesion as they chased goals - and lost.",
      "\"I think we had six or seven offensive players on the pitch and that may be the reason why the structure of a set-piece against Palace and now was not as perfect as usual because normally you play four or five defensive-minded players,\" Slot explained.",
      "There is an element of living and dying by that same sword. It was not so long ago that Liverpool were snatching games late on having gone chasing for the winner. Now, they are losing to late goals. Three points for a win might well justify the approach in the end.",
      "In terms of expected goals, this was the highest total that Liverpool have racked up in any Premier League game since beating Southampton in March. But when Jamie Redknapp talked of \"an air of desperation\", you understand what he meant by it.",
      "On paper, Liverpool have some splendid players. On the pitch, the blend is still not right. Slot appears willing to trust that things will click very soon. But his team will need to make sure their rivals don't snatch the crown while they are figuring it out.Adam Bate",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro against Liverpool surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Rubem Amorim had cited his set-piece threat before the game and he delivered just when he was needed.",

      "\"I suppose I might have been a surprise package last year, but now people know about me and know my game.\"",
      "And his start to the season, without a goal in seven games, reinforced how he has become a marked man.",
      "Head coach Unai Emery wasn't prepared to give up on him, though. Rogers has started all of their Premier League and Europa League matches.",
      "\"He is always doing his task. He is a hard worker,\" explained Emery. \"And through it, the performance is coming.",
      "\"He's playing and he's scoring because he's helping the team for 90 minutes.\"",
      "Rogers' stunning strike against Tottenham was the only shot he had during the match. It was a bolt from the blue, but one that can help reinstall his confidence after a tricky period in his career.David Richardson",
      "The sound of boos at the full-time whistle has become a regular occurrence at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs' home form is alarming. Their supporters have seen just three wins at home in the last 18 Premier League games.",
      "In fact, the 2-1 loss to Aston Villa means it is Tottenham's poorest home start to a league campaign since 2008/09.",
      "Since November 10 last year, Spurs have lost more home games than any other ever-present Premier League side.Frank has been unable to solve an issue which developed under his predecessor Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Asked to explain their home struggles, the Dane said at his post-match press conference: \"I don't think it's that simple. It's about looking into the performances.",
      "\"I think we performed well against Burnley, I think we performed well today. I think we had one very good first half against Wolves, and we were bad against Bournemouth.",
      "\"We could easily have won it instead of Villa, and then it would have been a different narrative, so I look at the performance on the pitch at what we did well and look at what we need to improve.\"",
