      "Manchester United have had a busy summer transfer window so far - and it’s showing no signs of slowing down. The Red Devils have already signed Wolves forward Matheus Cunha after activating his £62.5m release clause.",
      "United have also signed young defender Diego Leon for a bargain fee. But a striker remains on the Red Devils’ shopping list before the end of the summer.",
      "Sporting Lisbon’s Viktor Gyokeres has regularly been linked with a move but United could face competition from Arsenal. Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo has also emerged as a major target but Thomas Frank’s impending move to Tottenham could throw a spanner into the works.",
      "The first transfer window of the summer is set to close on Tuesday evening so club chiefs need to get a move on if they want to sign either of those stars. With that being said, take a look at the latest transfer rumours from the red half of Manchester:",
      "Man United’s hopes of signing Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres have been handed a huge boost. According to L’Equipe, Saudi side Al-Hilal made a move for the forward after being turned down by Napoli’s Victor Osimhen.",
      "It is suggested that they offered him a £30m-a-year deal to move to the Middle East. They also indicated to Sporting Lisbon that they would be willing to pay around £55m.",
      "But Gyokeres turned down that offer and remains keen on staying in Europe for the foreseeable future. United remain firmly in the race for his signature, alongside Arsenal and Chelsea.",
      "Should United sign Gyokeres, they might need to move on a couple of their current players. A candidate for an exit could be Rasmus Hojlund amid interest from Italy but it appears that United’s demands could scupper a deal.",
      "According to reports in Italy, United want a permanent sale for around £40m. Inter Milan, Juventus and Napoli are interested but they would only be able to do a deal on loan.",
      "Hojlund has recently spoken out on his future and claimed he does not want to go anywhere. He said: “I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.",
      "\"I know I can't get much out of reading things. I know what the facts are, and that is that I have a contract with Manchester United until 2030. I expect to play there, so I'm just getting ready for some summer vacation and then hopefully a good pre-season.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told to “get on with it” amid his uncertain future by England icon Chris Waddle. He said : \"Garnacho might look good in training, and maybe Ruben Amorim would want to pick him, but he doesn't. Garnacho talks like he's got a million games under his belt.",
      "\"We know he's a talented football player, but I think players at his age need to get their heads down, and if they're on the bench, well, that's a sign they need to improve to convince the manager. Just shut your mouth, get on with it.",
      "\"He's a young player with a lot of years ahead of him, and if a manager thinks you need pulling off, you accept it. He talks like he's a senior player in his late 20s, but right now he's still learning. There's talk of him going to Italy – let's see how that goes for him.\""

      "Viktor Gyokeres has been left fuming with Sporting Lisbon after they demanded more for him than they promised as he looks for a way out of the Portuguese club.",
      "The Swede has just helped them land the domestic double and, after choosing to remain last summer, had an agreement with them that they would let him depart for significantly less than his release clause. Whilst they've honoured that Sporting have still be asking for more than he expected.",
      "The Lisbon outfit have been demanding £67million for him. Previously they agreed that they would demand £50m plus £8.4m in add-ons this summer - meaning they asked for almost £10m more, reports Record. It has left Gyokeres fuming and he's removed the club's name from his social media platforms.",
      "The player has already turned down a potential move to Saudi Arabia after Al-Hilal saw a £55million offer rejected. He is the latest striker to rebuff the Middle East league with Manchester United and Arsenal still keen.",
      "The Swede is one of Europe's most sought after strikers after breaking the 50 goal barrier with Sporting Lisbon. He's been tipped for a Premier League move but he was recently offered the chance to land fortunes by moving to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Al-Hilal, who have just appointed for Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi as manager, had been looking to land Victor Osimhen. However the Nigerian knocked them back after his loan stint at Galatasaray with his parent club, Napoli, looking to cash in. That led the Saudis to turn their attention to Gyokeres but the Swedish frontman has also said no to a lucrative offer. He could've earned an annual salary of £30m but wants to continue competing in Europe, reports L'Equipe.",
      "It means both Arsenal and United are free to pursue a move for the 27-year-old, who previously played in England for the likes of Swansea and Coventry City before his career was transformed by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese boss is looking to bolster his forward line and could pursue a reunion with Gyokeres. It is understood that Sporting would sanction his sale for around £60m - despite looking for more so far this window - and the player himself is open to the move despite them not having Champions League football.",
      "Arsenal have been touted as his other option. It is well documented that the Gunners want a No.9 but their preference looks to be Benjamin Sesko at RB Leipzig with discussions ongoing over a move for the Slovenian. Gyokeres himself has remained coy on his own future.",

      "The late Brian Clough once punched Roy Keane in the dressing room, but that did not stop the fiery Manchester United legend from loving him. Before he became the explosive Red Devils captain that won everything there was to win, Keane played under Clough at Nottingham Forest, where he received the iconic manager's own brand of tough love.",
      "The two-time European Cup winner was the man who brought Keane to England, signing the Irishman from Cobh Ramblers in 1990. Keane quickly rose to prominence as one of the most promising young talents in European football.",
      "His journey under Clough was marked by many hard and, at times, physical lessons. One of those was brutally inflicted after an FA Cup third-round replay against Crystal Palace in 1991, where Keane made an error that led to them drawing at the City Ground.",
      "Reflecting on Clough's unique approach to management during a recent appearance on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"He (Clough) played mind games sometimes. If you got beaten, you'd think he's going to go after you and then he'd go the other way and go, 'Have a few days off.'",
      "\"If you'd won a few, you'd be going, 'Listen, (I think we'll be getting) a couple of days off' and he'd be like, 'No, you're all in tomorrow.' He'd definitely be playing mind games.\"",
      "Keane reminisced about a stunning incident involving him and former team-mate Mark Crossley, who is widely known as 'Big Norm' around football. Keane turned to Crossley and added: \"We (had) the incident with me, you and the Crystal Palace goal where he punched me after the game. He'd give me days off and he'd be brilliant.\"",
      "One of Keane's worst moments as a player came in the final minutes of that FA Cup clash, when his short back-pass resulted in Crossley fluffing a clearance to Palace star John Salako, who proceeded to lob in an equaliser to force another FA Cup replay.",
      "At the time, penalty shootouts were not part of the FA Cup, so Keane's error meant Forest had to face Palace in the competition for the third time that season. Re-living that painful moment, Keane added: \"I'm looking and it was honestly like slow motion. You know about not upsetting the manager because we all loved Brian Clough. He gave us a chance like Norm did for me.",
      "\"I remember John Salako got it and I'm looking at Norm running back. John Salako, what would he have been? Forty-five yards out? (I thought) 'Norm get back. He's f***ing not getting there'. I swear, as soon as I heard it hit the net...",
      "\"He (Clough) blamed me for the back pass and it was the cup game. So then we went to a replay and he wanted the game done and dusted there. I think it ended up going to, three replays or something.",
      "\"So he (Clough) had the thought of having a free weekend and was going, 'Now I've got to go to London, all the way to London to play Palace in the cup game that we hadn't won.' So he blamed me after the match.\"",
      "Turning to Crossley, Keane said: \"I don't think you said much after the game. You just let me take the wrap for it. He (Clough) just punched me in the chest.\"",
      "Keane made 148 appearances at Forest between 1990 and 1993. He eventually left for United in a then British record £3.75million deal.",

      "Barcelona have been linked with a move for Rashford, but former England midfielder Waddle reckons the 27-year-old's lack of application will put clubs off from signing him on a permanent basis.",

      "“But is he one of those players where once the fans start singing his name and he looks the part, does he then come off the pace and think, I've made it, I've got the shirt?",
      "“I think that's what happened when he was at United, in my eyes. He thought he’d made it as the top player and just started to stroll around, doing what he wanted. That’s what it looked like.",
      "“Whoever takes him on is going to have to work out how to keep him on the top of his game every week. And I think that may scare a few teams off.",

      "United are willing to listen to offers in the region of £40m for Garnacho, after the 20-year-old spoke out against Ruben Amorim’s decision to drop him for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",

The formation United played. It was lacking in the creativity and directness you want.",
      "\"When Garnacho came on, he looked very lively. But I don't know, modern players, I don't know if they get ahead of themselves. Instead of playing their football and keeping their emotions in check, they set themselves up for problems. They ask in public why they aren't playing.",
      "\"Garnacho might look good in training, and maybe Amorim would want to pick him, but he doesn’t. Garnacho talks like he’s got a million games under his belt.

      "United are interested in signing a new goalkeeper. Andre Onana has struggled to convince since his arrival from Inter Milan, and Gianuigi Donnarumma has emerged as a contender for a move - according to French reports - with just a year remaining on his contract with current side Paris Saint-Germain.",

      "That situation may well not revolve itself until next summer, particularly given United's finances at present means they're unlikely to be able to pay anything like what PSG would want to part ways with the Italian 12 months early. But regardless, a new man between the sticks is likely to still arrive as the club have interest in bringing in a new No.2 as well.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, United are also keen to sign a new striker after their goalscoring woes last term. Viktor Gyokeres is a long-term target, while Victor Osimhen could also be an option after rejecting a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "However, there is a slight issue when it comes to a new forward, with Rasmus Hojlund claiming that he is hoping to stay at the club beyond this summer.",

      "Finally, a new midfielder is also on United’s shopping list for the remainder of the window. Atalanta star Ederson has been linked in the past and if it's not him then a similar all-action type should arrive.",
      "The Red Devils are determined to bid farewell to a few players to bolster their funds. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are all expected to leave the club following loan spells away from Old Trafford, with the trio all available for sale if the price is right. United's issue is all three have good contracts that they won't just want to give up.",
      "Almost certainly out the door is Alejandro Garnacho, who has been linked with Napoli, and has been told he has no future at the club under Amorim."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo was in tears once again as he celebrated winning his third trophy with Portugal, who defeated Spain in a penalty shootout to win the Nations League on Sunday. While Portugal have won the Nations League twice, their Euro 2016 triumph was unexpectedly sealed by Premier League flop Eder.",
      "The former Swansea forward came off the bench and stunned France with a long-range effort in extra time, a goal that would later leave Ronaldo crying in celebration. Eder had been shipped out to Lille after just half a season with the Swans, where he had failed to score in 15 appearances.",
      "Having rebuilt his reputation with the French side, the then-28-year-old forced his way into Fernanndo Santos’ squad after scoring six goals in 14 games. Becoming Portugal’s hero must have felt a long way off for Eder while the £5million signing was struggling in South Wales. However, Eder later revealed that he gained the confidence to score Portugal’s 109th-minute winner after a pep talk from Ronaldo as he waited to enter the pitch.",
      "Ronaldo had limped off injured after 25 minutes, but remained a significant presence throughout the game. He spoke to team-mates and patrolled the touchline alongside Santos as he looked to inspire Portugal to victory. It seemed to have the desired effect on Eder.",
      "“Cristiano told me that I would score when I came on and I just took that energy into my game,” Eder said after the final whistle. “We weren’t the best technical team, but we worked for each other. Since the coach arrived he believed this group could do this.\"",
      "Portugal defied the odds throughout the tournament, having remarkably reached the knockout stages courtesy of three draws in the group stage. An extra-time victory over Croatia and penalty shootout drama against Poland led to their only win in 90 minutes over Wales in the semi-finals. However, the manner of Portugal’s Euro 2016 mattered little to Ronaldo.",
      "\"Very happy, very happy,\" he said in the aftermath. \"It was something I tried for so many times since 2004, praying that I would get one more opportunity. The Portuguese people needed it and the players needed it.",
      "\"It is one of the happiest moments of my career. I won so many things with my club, individually. I always said that I wanted to win a championship with the Portugal team, to make history, And I won.\"",
      "Eder joined Lille permanently that summer and retired in 2022 following stints at Lokomotiv Moscow and Saudi Arabian club Al Raed. Meanwhile, at 40 years old, Ronaldo is captain of his country and got on the scoresheet in his team’s hard-fought win over Spain to win the Nations League for a second time following their inaugural victory in 2019.",
      "Spain’s Martin Zubimendi had opened the scoring, but Nuno Mendes quickly cancelled out his effort. Spain regained the lead through Mikel Oyarzabal before Ronaldo levelled the tie just after the hour mark. The Al-Nassr forward, who later confirmed he will not be moving clubs this summer, was taken off shortly before extra time.",
      "This meant, like Euro 2016, Ronaldo had to watch from the sidelines as the drama unfolded. Ruben Neves scored the decisive penalty, capitalising on Alvaro Morata's miss, as Portugal scored with all five of their spot kicks. After the match, Ronaldo expressed his delight at securing another international trophy.",
      "“It’s always special to lift trophies. Regardless of the fact that we’ve already won this competition, for me it’s like it’s the first,\" Ronaldo said. \"You know how passionate I am about being here, about playing for the national team, about wearing my colours. The suffering, the tears. It’s special.",

      "\"We knew it was going to be difficult, against a team like Spain , and I think we deserved it. This gives us confidence to go to the World Cup and see that it's possible to beat any team in the world.\"",

      "Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho has been told to shut his mouth and \"get on with it\" by England icon Chris Waddle. Garnacho has endured a turbulent period at United in recent times.",
      "A chequered pattern of behavioural issues with former boss Erik ten Hag has been swiftly followed by periods out of the team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Waddle has hinted that Garnacho, 20, might not yet be as good as he thinks he is, suggesting even a change of clubs may not iron out the issues plaguing the forward. The Newcastle United legend argued that despite his potential, Garnacho should put his head down and focus squarely on his football as rumours swirl about a possible departure from Old Trafford.",
      "\"I was surprised they left him out of the Europa League final because I think attacking Tottenham is the best way of getting results,\" Waddle, 64, told online-casinos.com.",
      "\"And it looked like they were a little bit cagey. The formation United played. It was lacking in the creativity and directness you want.",
      "\"And when Garnacho came on, he looked very lively. But I don't know, modern players, I don't know if they get ahead of themselves. Instead of playing their football and keeping their emotions in check, they set themselves up for problems. They ask in public why they aren't playing.\"",
      "He continued: \"Garnacho might look good in training, and maybe Ruben Amorim would want to pick him, but he doesn't. Garnacho talks like he's got a million games under his belt.",
      "\"We know he's a talented football player, but I think players at his age need to get their heads down, and if they're on the bench, well, that's a sign they need to improve to convince the manager. Just shut your mouth, get on with it.",
      "\"He's a young player with a lot of years ahead of him, and if a manager thinks you need pulling off, you accept it. He talks like he's a senior player in his late 20s, but right now he's still learning. There's talk of him going to Italy – let's see how that goes for him.\"",
      "Garnacho has been linked with Chelsea and Italian side Napoli, who made a bid for the player during the January transfer window. Saudi Pro League team Al-Nassr are also reportedly monitoring Garnacho as a potential alternative to Liverpool's Luis Diaz.",
      "However, the player himself has confirmed that he is currently in Italy. He posted a photo of himself outside the Colosseum in Rome, sparking rumours that he could be eyeing a move to Serie A.",
      "Garnacho has netted 26 goals in 144 appearances for United. Nonetheless, if he decides to part ways with United, he still has some time to secure his next move as the summer transfer window will briefly close on June 10, before reopening from June 16 until September 1."

      "Ex-Premier League referee Uriah Rennie is remembered not just for breaking racial barriers in English football, but for his presence, poise and occasional physical authority during high-stakes matches. The trailblazing official, who died aged 65 on Sunday, was once forced to step in to physically restrain Roy Keane during a heated clash between Manchester United and Sunderland in August 2002.",
      "The fixture turned volatile when Keane, under intense scrutiny following his explosive World Cup walk-out that summer, got into a fiery confrontation with Ireland team-mate Jason McAteer.",
      "Throughout the match, the pair had been dishing out tough tackles and verbal jabs, with Liverpool-born McAteer mocking Keane's newly released autobiography.",
      "Tempers flared quickly, and soon the situation threatened to spiral out of control. Spotting \"fury\" in Keane's eyes after a coming together between the players, Rennie stepped in to calm him down. A martial arts expert, the referee didn't hesitate, earning a degree of respect from the notoriously hard-to-please United skipper in the process.",
      "In his 2022 book Your Show, a novelisation of his refereeing career, Rennie recalled the tense moment with vivid detail. \"They both tumble onto the turf. Limbs flailing. Elbows and knees,\" he wrote. \"Roy's reacting now, fury in his eyes, head's gone. This feud has history... grab Roy, save Jason?\"",
      "Rennie's instincts then took over. \"Only a moment to think. You take matters in your own giant black hands with a cliff-edged ­fearlessness. You get in between the two. You do what you have to do, to stop it escalating, from turning into a 20-man mass brawl,\" he explained. \"You grab Roy, grip onto his shirt like you did a few ­seasons ago at White Hart Lane, but tighter.\"",
      "His intervention was effective. Keane, visibly seething, was separated from McAteer. Both players, in their own way, acknowledged the impact – McAteer later admitted that Keane would have \"ripped his head off\" if Rennie hadn't come between them. Keane, though never one to show deference, seemed to develop a level of respect for the referee's fearless handling of the moment.",
      "However, just minutes later, Keane lashed out again – this time catching McAteer with a sharp elbow to the back of the head. Rennie immediately issued a red card – a decision so clear-cut that even Sir Alex Ferguson didn't contest it.",
      "\"The referee had no choice but to send him off,\" the legendary United manager said after the game. \"Roy is the first United player to be sent off for this offence and I have said recently the use of the elbow is a growing problem in our game.\" He later confirmed that the club would not appeal the decision and had fined Keane £150,000.",
      "Rennie admitted his handling of the situation went beyond standard procedure: \"I didn't follow FA protocol,\" he wrote. \"You throw away the rule book and intervene early with action, words won’t do, stopping Keane from doing something he shouldn't.",
      "\"You stare Keane dead in the eyes, still clutching a fistful of his shirt... messy Irish ­history. Messy World Cup history. Keane is fiddling with his captain's armband as you ­reason with him. He's only half listening, facing you but eyeing up the Sunderland player who has retreated behind you to safety. Although he might not be showing it now, maybe in his own way, he respects you.\"",
      "Despite being sent off, Keane remained unapologetic. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast in 2023, he insisted McAteer \"deserved\" the elbow and that the two were \"absolutely not\" on speaking terms. \"He was one of those players who couldn't stop running their mouths,\" Keane said. \"I didn't mind lads kicking me or booting me but McAteer as usual had plenty to say for himself.\"",
      "McAteer, who had also played for Liverpool, Bolton, and Blackburn, later described their relationship as \"toxic.\" He didn't hold back in his own assessment, calling Keane a \"clown\" and telling him to \"bore off.\""

      "In all, Hojlund has made 95 appearances for United since his £72m move from Atalanta. In that time, he has scored just 26 goals. Former Red Devils star Phil Jones has suggested that a move away from the club might be best for his career.",

      "If he does indeed move on, it would bank United a healthy sum, which will go a way towards easing their concerns with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules. The Red Devils are hoping to be busy this summer and any fee received will be greatly appreciated.",
      "In a surprise move given he left just 12 months ago, United will benefit substantially from Oyedele's potential transfer. When they sold him last summer, United inserted various clauses into the deal.",
      "While they only sold him for a small fee, one of the clauses they inserted was a substantial sell-on clause to ensure future profit. That sell-on clause means that United are entitled to 40 per cent of any fee Legia receive for the midfielder.",
      "If he is sold for his release clause, it would see United bank just over £2m. That money would likely go straight into easing their PSR concerns, with a buy-back option also included in the original deal.",
      "A departure for Oyedele would come as somewhat of a surprise given his short time in Poland. Speaking in April, the youngster insisted he was happy with life in the capital city.",
      "“It’s just funny for my mum because she left Poland to come to England and make a life; I left England to go to Poland to start my journey,” Oyedele told The Guardian. “Legia was the biggest opportunity.",
      "\"I don’t even think I realised how big of an opportunity it was when I heard about it. I felt like this was the opportunity to play in Europe, the biggest team in Poland. It’s my nationality, so it’s close to the national team.",
      "\"It’s always a risk to leave it, but it just seemed like the best choice. I couldn’t afford to waste another year playing academy football. I could have stayed in England and continued my journey and who knows what would have happened.\""

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma’s agent has already dismissed one potential rival to Manchester United by ruling out a switch to Napoli. The Italian goalkeeper faces an uncertain future with European champions Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "He has just a year left on his deal with the French giants and despite PSG chiefs attempting to tie him down, an agreement has yet to be found. That has opened the door to United, rivals Manchester City and Real Madrid.",
      "Reports have also suggested that that Donnarumma has been discussing the prospect of a move to the Premier League with his Italian teammates. Meanwhile, Donnarumma’s agent Enzo Raiola has already denied that talks have been held with Serie A champions Napoli, who were also credited with an interest.",
      "Speaking to Radio CRC via Calciomercato, he said: \"It's pure fantasy. I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio.",

      "He added: \"His mother is a huge Napoli fan, and she gets anxious watching their games. Gigio is connected to that.”",
      "Another side who have been linked with Donnarumma is former club AC Milan. The 26-year-old originally left the club to complete a free transfer to PSG in 2021.",
      "And Raiola has claimed that he would be open to a return to the San Siro. He said: “I have never ruled out interest from the top Italian clubs, but there has never been a negotiation, let's see. He is still young, I have to squeeze him for at least another 10 years.",
      "“At the moment, however, it is very difficult to see Donnarumma in the Italian championship, I'm not just talking about numbers but also about the sporting project. In Italy, beyond Inter who reached the Champions League final, there are Milan and Juve who are struggling, they are in the process of reorganizing: these factors are fundamental.",
      "\"A return to Milan? Why not? We took Pogba from Manchester United to Juventus and then back to Juventus. There are no impossible things. Milan, even if it is not at its best, is always a very respectable club, which Gigio will always thank. They pampered and raised him, so Gigio will always have an important affection and gratitude towards the Rossoneri.”",

      "Osimhen is expected to leave Napoli this summer and has a €75m (£63.2m) release clause in his current contract, available for teams outside of Serie A. The forward could not find a permanent move last summer after a transfer to Chelsea collapsed and ultimately moved to Galatasaray on loan.",

      "United are determined to sign the Cameroon international to bolster their attack and they saw an opening offer worth £55million turned down last week. It is understood they will submit a new and improved offer for the 25-year-old.",
      "Mbeumo was one of the stars of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, netting 20 goals and registering seven assists. Only Liverpool ace Mohamed Salah (47) and Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak (29) were directly involved in more goals.",
      "Having already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves to strengthen their attacking options, United's pursuit of Mbeumo highlights their desire to recruit players who have a proven track record in the Premier League. Cunha scored 15 league goals himself this term.",
      "With Cunha expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position, Mbeumo, if signed, is expected to operate from the right-sided No.10 position. United still want a centre-forward to spearhead the attack and operate between them.",
      "Despite Amad's effectiveness from the right-sided No.10 position in the second half of the season, he has also demonstrated that he is effective from the right wing-back berth.",
      "However, Mbeumo, in terms of being a goalscorer, is an upgrade. He has scored 38 Premier League goals over the last three seasons, with this season's return of 20 his best in the top flight in a single campaign.",
      "Taking his goalscoring record and his profile as a left-footed player into account, he is perfect for Amorim, who admitted ahead of United's 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United at Old Trafford back in December that he wants to operate with a left-footed player on the right of the attack, after making the decision to move Amad further forward.",
      "\"I try to reinforce the team with the idea and try to use the characteristics of the players.\"",
      "With that in mind, Amorim's admission about Amad being a suitable fit for the right wing-back berth in the future could pave the way for him and Mbeumo to form a solid partnership down the right.",
      "Mbeumo is a multi-functional operator, capable of playing out wide or through the middle, meaning he would tick a lot of boxes for United. He could also be asked to operate as a No.9.",
      "Taking Amorim's admissions about wanting a left footer in the right-sided No.10 role and Amad being a long-term option for the right wing-back spot, it is highly likely they could join forces down United's right flank. It would be an exciting combination."

      "The summer transfer window has only been open for just over a week and already Manchester United have had to change course.",
      "After identifying Liam Delap as their top target to strengthen their attacking options, members of United's hierarchy must have breathed a collective sigh when they learnt of the England Under-21 international's decision to move to Chelsea.",
      "Delap, who scored 12 Premier League goals in his first and only season at Ipswich Town, was available via a £30million release clause, making him an attainable target. He held talks with a cluster of suitors, including United.",
      "As frustrating as it can be for a club to have their transfer blueprint shredded, the good news is that Delap has made his move to Stamford Bridge right at the very start of the summer, leaving United with plenty of time to explore alternative avenues.",
      "Furthermore, is missing out on Delap as big a 'blow' as some may claim it to be? He has just one season of top flight football under his belt and is still incredibly raw at the age of 22.",
      "After gambling on potential in 2023 with Rasmus Hojlund and again last summer with Joshua Zirkzee, United can ill-afford to take another risk on a striker this summer. They need a proven goalscorer who can come in and hit the ground running.",
      "Right now, a handful of names are frequently cropping up on repeat. The strikers in question are Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David.",
      "Of the Premier League's elite, United, Arsenal and Liverpool are the only three in desperate need of an out-and-out striker this summer now that Chelsea have signed Delap.",
      "Arsenal are prioritising a move for former United target and RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The Slovakian netted 21 goals in Germany this season and he has emerged as the Gunners' preferred target to bolster the tip of their attack.",
      "Liverpool have loosely been linked with a crop of forwards, but their current priorities are to wrap up the signings of Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez and Bayer Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz.",
      "Meanwhile, despite Osimhen's move to Al-Hilal being on, off, on again and then finally off, Galatasaray are set to try their luck to re-sign the striker permanently after his productive loan spell in Turkey this season.",
      "With Arsenal, who have also been heavily linked with Gyokeres, occupied chasing Sesko, Osimhen at the centre of a saga and David being eyed by the likes of Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, Gyokeres is shaping up to be the most accessible striker for United to chase.",
      "As soon as Ruben Amorim swapped Sporting for United last November, links connecting the Swede with Old Trafford were inevitable. Naturally, they have been persistent for months.",
      "But at a time where United desperately need a reliable goalscorer, there is a feeling developing that it may be inevitable the 27-year-old follows in in Amorim's footsteps.",
      "It is widely reported he will be available for a fee in the region of £60m this summer, which feels relatively respectable for a player that has plundered a whopping 97 goals in the last two seasons.",
      "He joined Sporting in July 2023 on the back of a prolific season with Coventry City. He was the best striker in England outside the Premier League in 2022/23 and he was linked with various Premier League clubs.",
      "However, after his agent had held talks with Amorim, it was decided Sporting was the best destination for Gyokeres to take the next step in his career. That theory has been reflected in his tally of 97 goals in 102 games.",
      "Fast, strong, aggressive and an excellent striker of the ball, Gyokeres ticks a lot of boxes. His goalscoring record in the last couple of years, for both club and country, has been astonishing and every striker ought to be judged on their record in front of goal.",
      "If United are to fulfil their mission of signing a prolific goalscorer this summer, they have no choice but to loosen the purse strings. They have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and a similar fee could soon be spent on Bryan Mbeumo, meaning sales will be key to funding any further new arrivals.",
      "However, failing to recruit a No.9 this summer is a non-negotiable. With Arsenal focusing on Sesko, Al-Hilal desperate to sign Osimhen and Liverpool currently focusing on other priorities, United might have a clear run at trying to attain a striker Amorim knows inside out."

      "Slowly but surely an image of how Manchester United could line up at the start of next season is developing.",
      "Just over a week into the first stage of the summer transfer window and United have already wrapped up the signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha. They have now set their sights on attempting to lure Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford as well.",
      "To say United have made an ambitious start to head coach Ruben Amorim's first summer at the helm is an understatement. Cunha has arrived in M16 on the back of a 17-goal season in all competitions and Mbeumo netted 20 goals in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Identified as a top target several months ago, Cunha has arrived at Old Trafford with the task of almost certainly filling the left-sided No.10 position. If Mbeumo is successfully drafted in, it is thought he will occupy the right-sided No.10 position.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference, meaning their decision to try and bolster their attack as their first port of call this summer is a wise one.",
      "Cunha, and possibly Mbeumo, would immediately add the goals that have been missing in previous seasons. Between them, they have plundered 56 goals between them since the beginning of the 2023/24 Premier League campaign.",
      "In addition to adding goals to the team, Cunha and Mbeumo would also strengthen the levels of competition for places. Despite Amorim often struggling to find a consistent and productive attack this term, it was not through a lack of options.",
      "United have a cluster of players who are capable of playing in either of the two No.10 positions: Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Alejandro Garnacho, Joshua Zirkzee, Cunha and Amad.",
      "With Garnacho facing the prospect of being sold and Fernandes looking increasingly likely to be deployed as a No.8 next season amid Cunha's arrival, the size of that list will reduce, meaning Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee, Cunha, Amad and potentially Mbeumo will all be challenging to start in the two No.10 positions.",
      "Of course, each of those players are versatile to some degree but the majority will believe that is their best position in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "If Mbeumo signs, Amad is highly likely to be installed as United's first-choice right wing-back and operate from out wide. However, Mainoo and Mount will be less assured of regular starting berths.",
      "Mainoo has struggled to force his way into the starting XI this calendar year, with his one-minute cameo against Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final feeling rather telling about where he currently sits in Amorim's plans.",
      "Meanwhile, Mount started the last four games of the season, including the Europa League final. Amorim is a massive fan of the former Chelsea man.",
      "\"I'm so happy for him,\" Amorim said after Mount scored twice in United's 4-1 win over Athletic Club last month. \"He is such a player. He works really hard, he has quality.",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him.\"",
      "The fact he started the final four games of the season as one of the two No.10s confirmed once and for all just how highly Amorim rates him. Injuries, however, plagued his first two seasons at the club, restricting him to just 46 appearances across all competitions.",
      "Well-versed in a three at the back formation from his Chelsea days, it is understandable why Amorim is so fond of the 26-year-old. He is a tailor-made fit for his system and his understanding of what to do and where to be when United don't have possession is admirable.",
      "However, if United land Mbeumo, it is hard to see where Mount fits into Amorim's first-choice starting XI. Mbeumo and Cunha would occupy the two spots reserved for the No.10s and Mount is not a central-midfielder in this system.",
      "Competition for places is healthy and should never be frowned upon, but one of Amorim's most valued players may have to settle for a place on the bench."

      "A fresh update has emerged in Portuguese news outlet Record about Gyokeres' future. The report claims that the striker is not happy with the Sporting hierarchy amid continued speculation about his future.",
      "It has been reported that Sporting are asking for a higher fee that what the club is said to have promised Gyokeres to allow the striker to leave this summer. The Sweden international has a €100million (£84million) release clause in his contract but has been reported to be available for €70million (£60million).",
      "However, it has now been suggested that Sporting are seeking a fee closer to €80million (£67.4million). This, the report claims, has made Gyokeres \"furious\" after the aforementioned agreement with the club.",
      "The report concludes by claiming that Sporting are yet to receive any bids from clubs interested in signing Gyokeres this summer. The striker enjoyed an impressive season in front of goal last term, finding the back of the net 54 times in 52 appearances and helping Sporting win the Primeira Liga title and the Taca de Portugal trophy."

      "They comfortably finished above the Reds and neither club could offer the Cameroonian talisman Champions League football. And yet, Mbeumo still favoured a move to Old Trafford and gave them priority to pursue him this summer.",
      "Clearly, the 25-year-old is not motivated by the short-term project nor does he feel like he needs to follow Frank to his next destination. Instead, he is motivated by the project at United and playing under Ruben Amorim.",

It was claimed that the Dane informed Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy that he would insist the club targets Mbeumo in the transfer window and the owner was on board with the idea.",
      "If Tottenham were to complete this deal for Mbeumo, they already have the perfect welcome gift for him. For his national team Cameroon, the 25-year-old wears the number 20 having worn number 19 for much of his time at Brentford.",

While United would not be able to offer Mbeumo the No.20 as it is currently occupied by Diogo Dalot, they could potentially go one better.",

      "Having already secured Matheus Cunha's signature, some Manchester United supporters must have felt the need to pinch themselves after learning of Bryan Mbeumo's desire to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Just over 24 hours after United announced the £62.5million arrival of Cunha from Wolves, it emerged Mbeumo had informed Brentford's hierarchy of his eagerness to move to M16. United have since held talks with the Londoners and had a £55m offer turned down last week.",
      "However, discussions remain ongoing and United are expected to lodge a new and improved bid for the 25-year-old, who netted 20 Premier League goals for the Bees this season. It is thought Brentford will demand a similar fee to what the Reds paid for Cunha.",
      "Understandably, the prospect of Mbeumo being added to United's attack has increased the excitement levels among the fans.",
      "With that said, here are four reasons why signing Mbeumo would make such perfect sense for United and head coach Ruben Amorim:",
      "After turning to Italy for each of their last two attacking signings, it is nice to see United looking closer to home this summer. Cunha scored 15 goals in the league this season and Mbeumo netted 20, meaning they are well established in England's top flight.",
      "Since the beginning of the 2023/24 campaign, the duo have netted 56 Premier League goals between them, meaning they have established consistent records. Mbeumo, who has predominantly played out wide during his time at Brentford, has scored a respectable 42 goals in four Premier League seasons since the Bees were promoted in 2021.",
      "United last signed out-and-out attackers from Premier League counterparts on permanent deals in the 2017/18 season, swooping for Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez. At this particular juncture, United are much wiser to go for ready-made talents that are already proven in England.",
      "United's attack has lacked a multi-functional operator in recent seasons, meaning the prospect of Mbeumo arriving from west London would add another string to their bow. Traditionally a right-winger, he can also play through the middle as a No.9.",
      "In Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, the expectation is Mbeumo would operate as the right-sided No.10, operating close to the centre-forward United so desperately crave. However, the Cameroonian is also capable of playing as a striker himself, meaning he could operate centrally if asked to do so by Amorim.",
      "Furthermore, his power, pace and aggression mean he could play on the right flank as a wing-back. He is also renowned for his defensive work and willingness to track back.",
      "With the exception of Amad, United do not currently have another left-footed player who can realistically operate as one of the two No.10s, making the club's pursuit of Mbeumo all the more understandable. The Brentford man is renowned for drifting inside from the right.",
      "Amorim, last December, outlined his personal preference to have a left-footed player in the right-sided No.10 role, meaning it quickly became easy to understand why Amad was often tasked with playing in that role after initially being deployed at right wing-back after Amorim's appointment in November.",
      "Also hinting that Amad's long-term position could be at wing-back, it makes all the more sense for United to pursue Mbeumo's signature. He is a perfect fit for the role Amorim so desperately wants to strengthen.",
      "Most importantly, Mbeumo will add goals to United's blunt attack. The Reds scored just 44 goals in the Premier League this season, meaning they only managed to score 24 more as a collective than Mbeumo did on his own.",
      "Mbeumo has been a regular source of goals and assists in Brentford's attack since their promotion from the Championship four years ago, contributing 28 assists in addition to his 42 goals. Marcus Rashford (131) and Bruno Fernandes (113) are the only current United players with more direct goal involvements in the Premier League than Mbeumo (70).",
      "With that in mind, signing Mbeumo is a no-brainer. United need to inject goals, creativity and flair into their attack."

      "Manchester United could be in line for a surprise cash injection this summer thanks to former youngster Maxi Oyedele.",
      "According to Italian journalist and transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, Oyedele, who left United last summer to join Polish outfit Legia Warsaw, is attracting interest from a collection of clubs from across Europe.",
      "He has reported that Werder Bremen, PSV Eindhoven, Anderlecht, Club Brugge and two unnamed Championship clubs have all expressed interest in his signature after a promising debut season in Poland.",
      "It has been reported that Oyedele, 20, 'will leave' Legia this summer and is available via a release clause worth €6million (£5.05m at the current exchange rate). The defensive-midfielder made 24 appearances in his debut season at Legia, helping them win the Polish Cup for a 21st time.",
      "News of reported interest in his signature from elsewhere will be of interest to United. As a result of becoming more proactive in the seller's market last summer, the Reds inserted various clauses into a collection of outgoing deals, including the one that saw Oyedele move to Poland.",
      "According to Romano, the sell-on clause means United will inherit 40 per cent of the fee Legia bank from any potential sale of the midfielder. It means United, who were probably not anticipating Oyedele would develop at the speed he has, could bank just north of £2m.",
      "Oyedele, as proven with the current level of interest being expressed in his signature, enjoyed a strong first season in Poland. His achievements included making his debut for the national team at senior level and making five appearances in the Europa Conference League, including two quarter-final starts against Chelsea.",
      "As a result of United's smart thinking, any funds they bank via sell-on clauses they included in deals from previous windows will go towards assisting their efforts in the quest to remain compliant with the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United's cross-city neighbours, Manchester City, have often been the masters of such scenarios in previous years, regularly offloading young talent with sell-on clauses attached to any future moves so they can receive money on the back of any future success.",
      "United also included a buy-back option in the deal that saw Oyedele move to Legia, meaning they covered all bases. Sell-on clauses were also included in other deals United completed last summer."

      "Sporting's top scorer this season has made a significant impact in the Portuguese top-flight, netting 39 goals and providing eight assists in 33 appearances. The 26-year-old has been a pivotal player in Rui Borges' squad, driving Sporting to another league title.",
      "And journalist Fabrizio Romano, who specialises in transfers, has claimed via GiveMeSport that officials from Old Trafford have made contact to 'understand how the situation was developing' for the Swedish striker.",
      "It is claimed that Champions League football was 'probably going to facilitate the deal for United.' However, the Reds' absence from that competition means a potential deal has been complicated.",
      "The report adds that until Gyokeres' situation 'gets advanced' with another club, United will keep being informed. It is claimed they are in contact with his camp.",
      "Gyokeres has been strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford since the appointment of former head coach Ruben Amorim at M16 in November. The Reds are in dire need of a consistent goal scorer this summer, having only netted 42 times in the Premier League.",

      "While United coughed up a sizeable fee to secure Cunha's services, more are expected to follow. Ruben Amorim's side are chasing a move for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo and have seen a £55m bid rejected. Mbeumo is believed to have made it his preference to make the move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Elsewhere, there is going to be a prime focus to get players out of the door. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sanchoare three players that have been tipped to leave Old Trafford. Rasmus Hojlund, meanwhile, has confirmed that he doesn't expect to leave United, despite talk of a move to Inter Milan.",
      "Tottenham are prepared to hijack Manchester United's proposed transfer for Bryan Mbeumo, despite the player preferring a move to Old Trafford, according to The Sun.",
      "He snubbed interest from Arsenal and Newcastle United, both competing in next season's Champions League, in favour of choosing to join Ruben Amorim's United.",
      "However, Spurs are keen to make a late move and attempt to tempt Mbeumo to team up with Thomas Frank, who appears to be the favourite to replace Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 goals and provided seven assists in 38 Premier League appearances under Frank for Brentford this season and Tottenham hope to bring him to north London.",
      "MEN says: Manchester United must ensure that Tottenham don't hijack a move for Bryan Mbeumo. He is one of the most sought-after players in the Premier League and he could flourish under Ruben Amorim next season.",
      "Plus, the fact that Mbeumo has chosen a move to United over Arsenal and Newcastle would give me confidence that he is committed to the project at Old Trafford and they need to get a deal done for him as soon as possible.",
      "Manchester United are considering a shock move for Everton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin when his contract expires this summer, according to Fichajes.",
      "The 28-year-old's deal is up at the end of the June and Everton are not expected to offer the 11-time England international a new contract, meaning he can leave on a free transfer.",
      "Ruben Amorim is keen to strengthen his squad and add a new centre forward, but Profit and Sustainability (PSR) constraints mean that United need to careful with their spending.",
      "And Calvert-Lewin has opened up as a potential bargain, considering he would arrive as a free agent. The former Sheffield United man has scored 57 goals across his Premier League career.",
      "MEN says: It's clear Manchester United need to sign a new No.9 this summer. The Reds scored just 44 goals in 38 matches in the Premier League last season, and that's nowhere near enough.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has been identified as a top target having impressed in Portugal for Sporting CP, but United might not have the funds to bring in the £60million-rated frontman this summer.",
      "It does mean that United may have to look for a cheaper alternative, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin is someone that has been linked, considering that he is going to be a free agent at the end of the June.",
      "However, United should avoid the temptation of moving for Calvert-Lewin due to his damning injury record and mixed form at Everton across the last couple of years. Instead, United would be better off looking at a move for Jamie Vardy, 38, after he confirmed his departure from Leicester City in April."

      "Manchester United find themselves in an unenviable scenario in the summer transfer window which they hoped they would avoid.",
      "Since losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final, United have moved into a position whereby they need to compromise on their plans for the summer. Had they qualified for the Champions League, the market suddenly becomes open for the Reds and they become a more enticing proposition.",
      "Now, having lost that final, United are in a situation where they are having to rely on reputation and players wishing to join the cause, to rebuild the club. This is how they managed to sign Matheus Cunha and it could be how Bryan Mbeumo decides he will move to Old Trafford.",
      "However, the club is unlikely to find it this easy to complete a move for a centre-forward this summer. We all know that there is an abundance of No.10s in world football but there is now a severe lack of No.9s.",
      "This is by no means a new phenomenon - no club has ever wanted to let go a No.9 who knows where the back of the net is. These days, United cannot even use their wealth to sign the next best striker like they did with Dimitar Berbatov and Robin van Persie.",
      "Therefore, when a player like Victor Osimhen is as good as telling you to make a bid for him, United would be crazy to ignore that. Journalists Ben Jacobs and Fabrizio Romano both reported on Sunday evening that Osimhen has decided to reject a lucrative offer from Al Hilal this summer.",
      "Despite the Saudi Pro League club agreeing a £63m transfer with Napoli, Osimhen decided not to agree personal terms with the Middle East club. This rejection of Al Hilal is a huge signal that the striker wants to remain in Europe, competing at the highest level.",
      "If he was solely looking to make exceptional amounts of money, he would have accepted Al Hilal's offer. If Osimhen wanted move to Galatasaray, that deal could have been struck by now as the Turkish club have been trying desperately to convince him to make his stay permanent.",
      "Now, it is up to United to put forward an alternative to him. Beyond the two clubs mentioned above, there are a lack of options currently on the table for Osimhen.",
      "Yes, United cannot offer the Champions League but they can offer him the opportunity to play for one of the world's biggest clubs in the most competitive top league on the planet. Surely it is worth at least attempting to sign a player that has scored 37 goals this season."

      "But the early signs are promising and optimism is building after United's swift start to the summer window. There is hope that Ruben Amorim's side can put a dismal campaign behind them and truly begin their rebuild under the former Sporting head coach.",
      "One man who has followed Cunha's career closely in England is Wolves correspondent for the Express and Star, Liam Keen. He explains why United may have been so eager to wrap up a £62.5million deal for the Brazilian.",
      "\"Cunha is a supremely talented footballer,\" Keen said. \"He arrived in the January of 2023 when Julen Lopetegui was just taking over and Wolves were struggling down the bottom, and obviously he was part of that that turnaround in keeping the club up at the time and he didn't do loads in the six months of the second half of that season, he was sort of settling in a little bit.",
      "\"Lopetegui was playing him as a number nine on occasions, and very clearly he wasn't a number nine. We saw his real breakthrough under Gary O'Neil in the following season, who quickly realised that Cunha is not a number nine. He's someone to play off the left more than anything, but to occupy those number 10 positions in and around the forward or the number nine, and as a footballer, he took his game to a whole new level.",
      "\"Last season and the first season with Gary O'Neill it was his two best seasons in his career. He's a very good goal scorer, glides with the football.",
      "\"For those reasons, he was able to push Wolves on a little bit under O'Neil in that first season. They were going to Europe for quite a while, until it slipped away in the back end of the campaign, and that was with him having a bad injury as well.\"",
      "Keen also reveals how Wolves have managed to get the best out of Cunha since his arrival at Molineux two and a half years ago.",
      "\"I think having a focal point number nine,\" he explains. \"That helps Cunha because he has someone to play off and feed off someone.",
      "\"Also, I think down that left side having a wing back who is underlapping him, giving him options, opening space for him. I think those options really helped to get the most out of his game.",
      "\"Equally he is quite keen to drop deep, pick the ball up in sometimes difficult areas and he's got the ability to sort of turn very quickly in tight spaces and as soon as he's got a little bit of space in front of him, he's turned one player, very often he was able to open the game up for for for Wolves.",
      "\"Going forward, I think the way United play and the sort of positions he'll occupy, I think that would be really important for them. He's able to turn defence into attack very quickly despite obviously not being a defensive player.\"",
      "Keen has shared his belief that Cunha's level is currently above that shown by Amorim's men. He does, however, claim that his personality is not the easiest to deal with.",
      "\"Without a doubt, everyone recognises he's a top player who can play at the very top in the Premier League,\" Keen admits. \"No disrespect to Man United, but we know they're not exactly the beast they once were at the moment.",
      "\"I think from a talent perspective, he can definitely be playing at a higher level than where they're currently at. In terms of the size of a club, because United's a massive club, of course, I think he's in the right place, going somewhere where he's going to be really important and having that added pressure.",
      "\"The issues he's got off the field, he's struggled to deal with pressure at times at Wolves. He wasn't massively liked around the place as a person, as an individual. Of course, plenty of teammates got on with him. There were a lot of Brazilians, and lots of Portuguese-speaking people, but in general, he was someone who would kick off very quickly. He would fall out with people around the place and with fans.",
      "\"He's someone that's got a lot of shortcomings and was universally, not particularly liked by a lot of people, but as a player, he did the business. That's the balance you've got to find at United because he's going to have so many more eyes on him at a club like United. So much more media attention, so much more attention in general that he's going to have to try and find a way to deal with that.\""

      "Manchester United might be rubbish, but two things remain true: they are still a bigger pull than Spurs, and they endure as the favourite bargaining tool for agents across Europe…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma sees Old Trafford as a ‘tempting destination’, does he? Or is it that the Italy keeper has been in contract talks with PSG for months and he isn’t getting what he wants so his representatives are pulling the oldest trick in the agents’ book? You decide.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Arsenal\nGarnacho is finished at United – but they still have to get rid of him. The winger would prefer to stay in the Premier League, apparently, with Chelsea and Arsenal having asked. But why would either do a deal on United’s terms? Chelsea have their sights set elsewhere and Arsenal have cast their net wide too. The Gunners might take Garnacho, but most likely on loan if others higher on their list opt against moving to the Emirates.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Heung-min Son – Tottenham Hotspur to Al-Hilal\nThe Saudi Arabian club are desperate to make a statement signing and the Spurs captain could be perfect. He’s out of contract next summer as well.",
      "",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Newcastle\nThis is a move we could really get on board with. The story goes that Newcastle want to take Grealish on loan with an obligation to buy for something like £67million. Which sounds like a deal City would be daft to turn down given Pep is clearly done with Grealish. Do it, Toon.",

      "",
      "15) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Fine, but he won’t get that at Newcastle while Alexander Isak is around. For how long will that be? That is the more pressing concern for Newcastle fans.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Which may be a consequence of the queue at Sporting’s door being more sparse than many of us expected. But if United can get it done, it would be a step on the road to regaining some credibility.",
      "",
      "12) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker has overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack. After much deliberation, it seems the Gunners favour a deal with RB Leipzig over whatever they could get out of Sporting. After talks at the back end of last week, the wheels seem to be in motion.",
      "",
      "11) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. Initial reports suggested there is no reason for Arsenal fans to panic, with agreements in place between all parties. But here come Real Madrid.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea have made it clear to Milan they are keen on the France keeper, but they won’t pay the £25million the Rossoneri want for a player entering the final year of his contract. Chelsea are said to be offering £10million for now, so there is some talking to be done. But whatever they pay up, it will be worth it.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nTottenham’s renewed interest threatened to scupper United’s hopes of landing Mbeumo but even the prospect of following Thomas Frank to Spurs isn’t deterring the forward from pursuing a move to Old Trafford. He’ll get his way ‘soon’, apparently.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Kevin De Bruyne – Manchester City to Napoli\nThere was a hitch around image rights last week but, apparently, that has been resolved and De Bruyne is set to sign a two-year contract to fulfil his dream of playing with Scott McTominay.",
      "",
      "7) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool have improved on their opening bid of £109million by returning with an extra £4million. Leverkusen, as they should, are still haggling but the Reds are close. They’re hardly likely to walk away over a few euros and leave Wirtz hanging. The player will be looking for progress this week now there’s no international distraction.",
      "👉 Five reasons why Florian Wirtz may not actually be a good signing for Liverpool",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nChelsea’s first offer of £30million was rejected, with Dortmund wanting £40million, and the Germans know the Blues can be squeezed as the pre-Club World Cup deadline looms. A seven-year contract is reportedly on the table for the winger.",
      "",
      "5) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord last week was it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here.",
      "",
      "4) Kepa Arrizabalaga – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThis one is moving quick, apparently, with Arsenal aware that the world’s most expensive goalkeeper will cost them just £5million. Interesting one, this. Kepa recovered some credibility on loan at Bournemouth last season and won’t be going to Arsenal just to play second fiddle to David Raya. Bring on the Gunners goalie wars!",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Jobe Bellingham – Sunderland to Borussia Dortmund\nA very on-brand deal has been agreed to make Jude’s little bro the second-most expensive player in Dortmund’s history. Jobe is apparently in Germany to drop his trousers and cough for the Dortmund doc and, all being well, he’ll be unveiled in the coming days.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Rayan Cherki – Lyon to Manchester City\nCity have agreements with Cherki and Lyon and they are in a hurry so expect this to be one of three deals confirmed this week.",
      "",
      "1) Tijjani Reijnders – AC Milan to Manchester City\nIt’s pretty much done, apparently. City have agreed a fee of £46million to sign the midfielder, with Milan hoping to net another £12.5million in add-ons. Reijnders and Rodri in midfield? City won’t be sh*t again next season."

      "According to reports, Bayern Munich have ‘offered’ Kim Min-jae to several Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea.",
      "Kim is the most expensive Asian player of all time, having joined the German giants for around £51million from Napoli two years ago.",
      "The South Korean has not quite replicated his Serie A form but still made 43 appearances across all competitions in 2024/25, starting 13 of Bayern’s 14 Champions League games.",
      "He was heavily linked with a Premier League move before joining Bayern, with Manchester United particularly keen in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Red Devils and others could now be back in for Kim following Jonathan Tah’s arrival from Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Tah has joined Vincent Kompany’s side on a free transfer, prompting Bayern to look to move Kim on.",
      "That’s according to The Boot Room journalist Graeme Bailey, who reports the 28-year-old has been ‘offered’ to several Premier League clubs.",
      "It’s claimed that United, Tottenham, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle are all ‘aware that Kim could be available this summer’.",
      "He could be an ideal addition for Chelsea, with head coach Enzo Maresca ‘looking to add to his defensive line’ having made Trevoh Chalobah and new arrival Tosin Adarabioyo available for transfer.",
      "MORE TRANSFER NEWS ON F365\n👉 Man Utd make ‘approach’ to hijack Arsenal transfer as ‘improved bid’ for Mbeumo planned\n👉 Romano gives ‘here we go’ to third Man City summer signing and Chelsea star could be next\n👉 Liverpool ‘to make final offer’ of £118m for Wirtz; Reds ‘unprepared’ to meet Leverkusen asking price",
      "Spurs, meanwhile, may need to replace Cristian Romero, who has been linked with Atletico Madrid.",
      "Outside the Premier League, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and several Saudi Pro League clubs are also reportedly interested.",
      "Bailey adds that Kim has ‘long held a desire to play in the Premier League’ and will be pleased that ‘contact has been made with a number of clubs’.",
      "The report concludes: ‘Bayern are believed to be willing to do a deal and would be willing to talk terms, which would see them taking some sort of loss on the player.’",
      "Kim is, of course, international team-mates with Spurs captain Heung-min Son, who said this of the Bayern defender last summer: “As I say every time, Min-jae Kim is a really good defender. It’s a defence that I really like.",
      "“From a global perspective, I think he is a player who can learn many things from now on.”",
      "They could yet link up at club level if Spurs move for Kim – although Son himself has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Another report from TBR on Monday said the Spurs forward has ‘received an approach’ to leave the club.",

      "There was silverware in the form of the FA Cup and consecutive European campaigns only look more impressive the further Leicester in their current guise spiral out of control.",
      "But it ultimately ended in relegation heartbreak, with Rodgers sacked shortly before a drop into the Championship. The manager was due a pay-off of around £10m but is thought to have foregone some of that payment. Being replaced by Dean Smith does that to a man.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim – £9.25m\nThere was a similar sense with Amorim that Manchester United might have found a perfect match; that feeling lasted about a fortnight.",
      "Amorim had been on the Old Trafford radar for months, including through the hilariously bungled backing and sacking of Erik ten Hag, but it was decided that one final summer transfer window of recruiting at great expense more players specifically wanted by the Dutchman and entirely incompatible with his eventual successor was the best and indeed only possible course of action for a club which believes free lunches, charity work and employing non-footballers to be the problem.",
      "Sporting paid about £8m to release Amorim from his Braga contract after just 13 games in charge in March 2020 and it was a masterstroke: he transformed the Lisbon club to the extent that they won two Primeira Liga crowns after an almost two-decade drought, while putting them on course for a third before his departure.",
      "Manchester United wasted £21.4m on replacing Ten Hag with Amorim in November 2024 after threatening/promising the Portuguese that the opportunity to manage them would not come around again.",
      "Having spent the first eight months of his reign explaining in unnecessarily public and painstaking detail precisely how incompetent he believes himself, his players and the club which has helped torch his burgeoning reputation to be, it is easy to imagine he might regret not calling their bluff.",
      "All manner of low bars were dragged towards the centre of the Earth in an atrocious season which concluded with an embarrassing Europa League final no-show. The manager who so thoroughly out-coached his rival to procure the trophy and Champions League qualification with it was obviously ruthlessly dispensed with soon after; Sunk-Cost Fallacy FC doubled down on failure and rewarded Amorim with a £62.5m signing 11 days later.",
      "",
      "Arne Slot – £9.4m\n“Everybody understands Feyenoord will want to receive as much money as they can get, but I get the feeling that they will not begrudge me this move,” said Slot when it became clear that, through the noise surrounding Amorim and Xabi Alonso, he would be handed the Jurgen Klopp dynasty.",
      "The Eredivisie runners-up were perfectly satisfied with a £7.7m fee and £1.7m in add-ons which might well have been triggered over the course of a Premier League-winning debut season. Liverpool, too, were content with a succession plan which convinced few outside the club.",
      "Among those might well have been Spurs, on whom the joke is contractually bound to always be. They considered the credentials of Slot in The Great Managerial Search of summer 2023, although when it was reported that Feyenoord wanted £15m or so in restitution, it does not requite a vivid imagination to envision Daniel Levy’s non-response.",
      "Slot parlayed that interest into a contract extension after playing Spurs like a fiddle. When it was an upwardly mobile Liverpool on the end of the phone less than a year later, negotiations inevitably went far smoother.",
      "",
      "Enzo Maresca – £10m\nLeicester were ‘disappointed’ when Maresca ‘decided at this stage that he no longer wants to be part of our vision,’ but they cannot possibly have been surprised.",
      "The Italian recognised that his stock was high after winning the Championship title; he understandably chose to cash in when Chelsea made an approach for a coach they felt would be more malleable to their unique operations and machinations.",
      "The wheels on the bandwagon felt loose for months after but Maresca and his team managed to stabilise themselves, qualify for the Champions League and win the Europa Conference.",
      "Nothing can be ruled out with Clearlake but the Italian seems likely to be the first manager of their stewardship to finish one season and start the next, making Maresca one of the biggest success stories in sporting history.",
      "",
      "Andre Villas-Boas – £13.3m\nWith Carlo Ancelotti handed one of the harsher sackings in Premier League history, Chelsea felt it necessary to conduct an absurdly expensive experiment to deduce whether lightning could indeed strike twice.",
      "The hypothesis was fair. The club’s greatest era was triggered in no small part by the prodigious brilliance of a young Portuguese manager who had just won the Treble with Porto. Jose Mourinho himself once referred to Villas-Boas as “my eyes and ears” so when the 33-year-old won the Primeira Liga, Europa League and Portuguese Cup, the comparison became unavoidably intoxicating.",
      "Roman Abramovich certainly agreed, sanctioning what was a world-record compensation package for a manager he would spend about as much to sack within eight months, at least partly because he tried to make John Terry sit in economy.",
      "‘Andre was the outstanding candidate for the job,’ the Blues said when appointing him. By the time he was dispensed with there was ‘disappointment that the relationship has ended so early’ – and presumably so expensively.",
      "",
      "Graham Potter – £21.5m\nIt was presumed that Chelsea’s financially incontinent revolving door managerial policy would end with Abramovich’s ownership, but Clearlake ensured to honour that proud history with their first appointment.",
      "Thomas Tuchel was soon shown the door Potter would be invited through thanks to his work at Brighton. As ever, the Seagulls were fully prepared for such an eventuality and guaranteed they would be reimbursed for their troubles.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi was already in place as Potter’s replacement when it was revealed that Chelsea’s latest direct debit payment to Brighton amounted to just over £21m for the manager and five of his backroom team.",
      "He was probably the best Chelsea manager that season but that only hilariously damns the Blues, who preferred to be dragged into the actual sea by Frank Lampard.",
      "One Liverpool star has hinted that he could leave the Premier League giants this summer as he does not want to “waste years” at Anfield.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made his decision on whether to sell Man Utd defender Lisandro Martinez this summer, according to reports.",
      "Arne Slot could reportedly oversee a ‘mass clear-out’ at Liverpool with the sales of 15 players speculated upon in a report given the Reds area nearing a pair of big ...",
      "Man Utd have ‘made contact’ with Sporting over a move for Viktor Gyokeres as Ruben Amorim is ‘poised to win the battle’ for the £59m striker.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Danny Higginbotham has warned Ruben Amorim he will be judged next season if results do not pick up.",
      "Liverpool winger Luis Diaz has ‘agreed’ to move to La Liga side Barcelona in the summer transfer window, according to reports."

It was a lot of money to finish in the bottom half but then they sorted themselves out.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m/€117.4m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nRice could be a game-changer for Arsenal – for £100m and another £5m in add-ons, he ought to be. The double free-kick to sink Real Madrid will live long in the memory and basically helped pay back his fee.",
      "",
      "3) Moises Caicedo – £100m/€117.1m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThere is every chance Caicedo could jump to the top of this list soon, with around half of the £15m in add-ons a grovelling Chelsea had to offer described as easily achievable in some quarters. Liverpool had put together a £111m package but, much to some hilarious and entirely grown-up Proper Red fury, the Ecuadorean wasn’t interested.",
      "",
      "4) Paul Pogba – £93.2m/€110m (Juventus to Man Utd, August 2016)\nMan Utd never did figure out how to unlock Pogba, with the weary efforts of three different managers ultimately ending in frustration, viruses, haircuts and a second Old Trafford exit to join Juventus as a free agent.",
      "",
      "5) Jude Bellingham – £88.5m/€103m (Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid, June 2023)\nThe idea of a £100m bargain sounds particularly weird but Bellingham is as close as is possible. Real Madrid would be thrilled if add-ons taking the deal to £115m/€133.9m were activated over the course of a six-year contract for a 21-year-old with more than 300 senior career appearances who will probably break soon.",
      "",
      "6) Frenkie de Jong – £74.5m/€86m (Ajax to Barcelona, July 2019)\nGiven a choice also involving Paris Saint-Germain and both Manchester clubs, De Jong cashed in on his rising Ajax stock at the absolute peak to join Barcelona just as they started financially collapsing in on themselves. The Dutchman has been central to their revival.",
      "",
      "7) Aurelien Tchouameni – £68.3m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, June 2022)\nSimilar to Bellingham, Real Madrid would not mind paying an extra £17m/€20m if Tchouameni holds up his end of a quite stunningly executed midfield renovation.",

      "9) Rodri – £62.8m/€70m (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, July 2019)\nIt was not the most seamless transition to Pepball – it never is – but Rodri went from ropey to learning the ropes and then master of the tactical fouling rest defence rope-a-dope, all the way to Champions League final goalscorer.",
      "",
      "10) Casemiro – £60m/€70m (Real Madrid to Man Utd, August 2022)\nIn a mild panic induced by consecutive defeats to Brighton and Brentford, Man Utd chucked up to £70m on a 30-year-old and gave him a four-year contract. It has worked equal parts well and disastrously.",
      "",
      "11) Jorginho – £57m/€65m (Napoli to Chelsea, July 2018)\nManchester City could not force a deal over the line but the pull of London and Maurizio Sarri delivered Jorginho to a productive if never unanimously popular half-decade at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "12) Tanguy Ndombele – £55.4m/€62m (Lyon to Tottenham, July 2019)\nA club-record signing made so long ago that Mauricio Pochettino welcomed him to north London when Ange Postecoglou was busy winning titles with Yokohama F Marinos, Ndombele left for nothing nine games short of a century of Spurs appearances.",
      "",
      "13) Kevin de Bruyne – £55m/€75m (Wolfsburg to Manchester City, August 2015)\n“I thought it was lira,” said Paul Merson of the fee an English club had agreed to pay a German side for a Belgian player. “The world is going mad,” added Phil Thompson. That fee does look crazy for what Manchester City received in return over a decade, to be fair.",
      "",
      "14) Miralem Pjanic – £54.8m/€60m (Juventus to Barcelona, June 2020)\nRemember the Arthur entry? Well as part of a fudged pandemic transfer which seemed to point towards a future of big clubs swapping their wage-drainers because no-one had any money, Barcelona were able to press the Pjanic button for a couple of years.",
      "",
      "15) Romeo Lavia – £53m/€61.9m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThirty-six senior career appearances was enough for a Chelsea side gripped by their insatiable obsession with signing young midfielders. And indeed anyone. Manchester City even received £8m or so after sticking a sell-on clause into the deal which saw Lavia join Saints a year earlier.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Nunes – £53.2m/€62m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe Portugal international went on strike to force through a move to work with Pep Guardiola at City after Wolves refused the Treble winners’ first offer. The fee includes a 10 per cent sell-on clause when City are done with the 26-year-old.",
      "",
      "17) Naby Keita – £52.75m/€60m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2018)\nThat rare example of an expensive Liverpool transfer committee misstep. Keita seemed absolutely perfect for Klopp but 75 starts in five seasons tells a particular story which revolves around hamstrings.",
      "",
      "18) Sandro Tonali – £52m/€60m (Milan to Newcastle, July 2023)\nHelping knock new teammate Bruno Guimaraes (£40m/€50.1m) off this list, the most expensive Italian footballer in history has followed a similar path into the collective hearts of the Geordie nation.",

I loved Tommy T’s touchline and post match “WTF lads?”, but if you’re gonna pick the geriatric money grubbing water carrier, and start Kane in games like this, then my patience has already run out.

      "What I’ll not have is this irrational bashing of a player based on perception rather than reality. The reality is, over the last 5 seasons he is not just the outright greatest chance creator in all of Europe (source: statmuse) he leads second place by almost 30% more chances. He is 13th in goals + assists and is the only non striker/winger in the top 25. No one in Europe is more productive than Bruno at creating chances.",
      "Even in a season without a striker worthy of the title in a fully dysfunctional United team when compared to midfielders he is in the 97-99th percentile in Shots, Assists, Exp Goals, Exp Assists and Shot Creating Actions. 98th in progressive passses. His defensive actions are far more in line with a decent central midfielder than one tasked with creating. He runs more than almost anyone else. He has more tackles and blocks than plenty of defensive midfielders.",

      "Manchester United is used to winning cups (indeed, they’d won the Carabao and FA Cups in the seasons before his sacking). Spurs, on the other hand, hadn’t won anything is almost two decades; that Europa League win was far, far more impactful than United’s FA Cup and a far better justification for retaining Big Ange. In short,  ManU made the wrong call after the FA Cup, but it doesn’t follow that Spurs made the right one.",
      "I’m not positive that Spurs have made a mistake. That will depend on the replacement they secure and the reactions along the squad, some of which seem negative indeed. But it sure would have been interesting to watch Ange and Spurs next season. I’ll miss that weirdo.",
      "Also, I’m still troubled by the quiet transfer front at NUFC. I’d expected us to have at least Mbeumo wrapped up by now. And while the club is no doubt wise to protect its wage structure, he would’ve been prefect for us. 18 year-old Antonio Cordero looks promising, but isn’t yet a first-team contributor, and that transfer has probably been quietly agreed weeks or months ago. It’s already starting to feel like last summer.\nChris C, Toon Army DC",

      "But here’s the thing – I don’t care.  We did win a major trophy, we are in the champions league, we do have a young squad that can compete with some sensible additions and a more tactically astute manager, and we avoided the ETH trap of keeping the wrong guy for (understandable) emotional reasons.  Sonny came out and said that Ange ‘changed the trajectory of the club’ and by winning something that may well be true, and he’ll always be remembered fondly but this really is the best of both worlds.",
      "Now of course Daniel Levy is fully capable of clutching defeat from the jaws of victory by signing a another bunch of 18 year olds, but if we buy a proper 6 and at least one top notch forward plus a couple of depth pieces this really is an attractive squad to work with over the next few years.  If I was Frank or Poch I’d jump at the chance.\nPhil, London",

      "“I know I can’t get much out of reading things. I know what the facts are, and that is that I have a contract with Manchester United until 2030. I expect to play there, so I’m just getting ready for some summer vacation and then hopefully a good pre-season.”",

      "Parker said: “Rasmus Hojlund has to leave Manchester United for the sake of his own career. He needs a change of environment. Old Trafford chiefs will have to think about moving on Mason Mount too, he’s not athletic enough.",
      "“Ruben Amorim needs someone to play behind the centre forward, Man Utd have no player who runs beyond and that’s one of the things that might have helped Hojlund if he had someone who’d run to create more space for him.",

If the players haven’t got it, in their heart and in their heads, you can’t change that. If you look at last season, Man Utd shouldn’t be anywhere near that level again in my lifetime.”",

      "“I went through something similar when I was at Aberdeen – for a year I was absolutely horrendous and it really gets to you, you almost lose your power to run and you feel debilitated.",
      "“There are some clubs in the world like Manchester United where everything is too much for players, and it drains big signings rather than galvanising them. I think Hojlund is in that position right now.",
      "“Do I think a loan move would help him? No – I think what’s best for him as a young man is moving somewhere else permanently. Everything seems to be too much for him and I think he’s in the mindset where he’s letting everyone down, which is a horrible place to be in.",

      "",
      "13 – Finley Burns (£250,000, Southend to Manchester City in January 2017)\nNow an ancient 21, Burns has done well to remain on the books of Manchester City since joining in his first teenage year in January 2017. The defender has even made his first-team debut in the League Cup, spent time on loan in the Championship and played for England age groups up to the U20s so far.",
      "",
      "14 – Sheyi Ojo (£2m, MK Dons to Liverpool in November 2011)\nAfter playing for the U18s and training with the first team, Ojo attracted intense interest from Chelsea and Liverpool but it was the latter who won out. He played 13 times for the Reds, was praised by Jurgen Klopp for his “big skills”, had seven spells on loan and eventually left in 2022. Maribor, to save you a Google.",
      "",
      "15 – Fran Merida (£2.2m, Barcelona to Arsenal in 2005)\n“An absolutely amazing player,” was the assessment Arsene Wenger once offered of Merida, who replaced fellow former Gunners prodigy Jermaine Pennant as the most expensive 15-year-old footballer in history. The Spaniard retired in 2024 in his mid-30s.",
      "",
      "16 – Pietro Pellegri (£17.5m, Genoa to Monaco in January 2018)\nThere is precious little separating Pellegri from fellow youthful Monaco recruit Willem Geubbels, who joined a few months later. Neither made an impact in the principality.",
      "",
      "17 – Jude Bellingham (£25m, Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund in July 2020)\nA total of 44 first-team appearances for Championship side Birmingham was enough to tempt Bundesliga giants and professional stepping stone Borussia Dortmund into signing Bellingham; none of the parties involved will have any regrets.",
      "",
      "18 – Leny Yoro (£52m, Lille to Man Utd in July 2024)\nMan Utd revelled in beating Real Madrid to “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”, even if it did largely come down to which side was willing to spend the most money.",
      "",
      "19 – Kylian Mbappe (£166m, Monaco to PSG in June 2018)\nThe most expensive teenager in the world and it is not particularly close; Joao Felix joined Atletico Madrid at the same age for £113m, while Bellingham’s move to Real Madrid could cost a couple million more than that with add-ons. The ridiculous Mbappe became PSG’s record scorer before leaving.",
      "",
      "20 – Ousmane Dembele (£135.5m, Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona in August 2017)\nBarcelona were right to sense there was a ridiculously good player there; how unfortunate the potential has only been realised at PSG.",
      "",
      "21 – Moises Caicedo (£100m, Brighton to Chelsea in August 2023)\nBrighton did what Brighton do and held out long enough for Liverpool and Chelsea to walk into a blindfolded blinking contest, with Caicedo ultimately making the decision by turning down a British record £111m move to the former in favour of a potential £115m switch to the latter.",
      "",
      "22 – Enzo Fernandez (£106.8m, Benfica to Chelsea in February 2023)\nThe £10m move from River Plate to Benfica in June 2022 did not make Fernandez the most expensive 22-year-old footballer in history, but his next transfer a few months later as a world champion certainly did.",
      "",
      "23 – Paul Pogba (£93.8m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2016)\nLeft for free at 19. Moved for world-record fee at 23. Left to join previous club – again for free – at 29. And only once did Pogba achieve what Graeme Souness “expected” of him.",
      "",
      "24 – Declan Rice (£100m, West Ham to Arsenal in July 2023)\nArsenal will not mind if Rice enjoys similar success to the last individual who proudly held the title of world’s most expensive 24-year-old footballer. Gareth Bale did just fine and the Gunners believe their new record signing could be one of the many jigsaw pieces.",
      "",
      "25 – Neymar (£198m, Barcelona to PSG in August 2017)\nOh look, it’s the transfer that broke football.",
      "",
      "26 – Harry Maguire (£80m, Leicester to Man Utd in August 2019)\nNot only did Maguire usurp Virgil van Dijk as the most expensive defender ever, he replaced him as the most expensive 26-year-old in history. That really does have to sting. The former Man Utd captain might consider himself to at least be in the same conversation now, if only just listening in the background and awkwardly laughing at all the in-jokes while being hawked around for about a quarter of what he was signed for.",
      "",
      "27 – Luis Suarez (£65m, Liverpool to Barcelona in July 2014)\nAfter arriving with a customary months-long ban for biting, Suarez really did crack on establishing a phenomenal Barcelona legacy. The only player not named Lionel or Cristiano to win the Pichichi Trophy for La Liga top scorer between 2010 and 2021, Suarez also claimed 13 trophies and a place at number three on the Blaugrana’s list of all-time top scorers. Then when they let the Uruguayan go for free he fired Atletico to the title while fuelled on pure thirst for revenge.",
      "",
      "28 – Eden Hazard (£143m, Chelsea to Real Madrid in July 2019)\nIf you had told Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 that Hazard would activate all the clauses in his Chelsea transfer to take it from an £88.5m deal to the full value of £143m, they would presumably have been chuffed at the success the Belgian must have enjoyed. But those add-ons were accidentally triggered across four seasons utterly ruined by injury, before being released with 12 months of his contract remaining and then retiring.",
      "",
      "29 – Diego Costa (£57m, Chelsea to Atletico Madrid in January 2018)\nZinedine Zidane was unmovable for almost two decades, but then Diego Costa won two Premier League titles in 20-goal seasons, was dumped by Antonio Conte over text, did not play for months and went AWOL, yet Chelsea still sold him back to Atletico for almost double what they initially paid, despite the striker turning 30 later that year and the Spanish side operating under a transfer ban. Todd Boehly could never.",
      "",
      "30 – Harry Kane (£100m, Spurs to Bayern Munich in August 2023)\nRaising the bar set by predecessor Casemiro by quite a way, Kane finally broke his Daniel Levy shackles with a 47-goal gap to Alan Shearer’s all-time Premier League record, so desperate was he to finally grab a couple of trophies.",
      "",
      "31 – Neymar (£86.3m, Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal in August 2023)\nFor more than 23 years, Gabriel Batistuta reigned as the most expensive 31-year-old in football history; it was a simpler time. Then Saudi Arabia came along, changed the game and rescued a load of superclubs from their financial burdens, including even mega-rich PSG.",
      "",
      "32 – Riyad Mahrez (£30m, Manchester City to Al-Ahli in July 2023)\nYep. Not that Manchester City were desperate to offload Mahrez, but the Algerian had won everything on offer in England and earned his jaunt in the Middle East.",
      "",
      "33 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£99m, Real Madrid to Juventus in July 2018)\nFive trophies, 101 goals in 134 games and consecutive Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, but still a failure of a signing after being picked up to win the Champions League – or at least to stop scoring against Juventus in the Champions League – yet not being able to take them beyond the quarter-finals after being knocked out by Ajax, Lyon and Porto.",
      "",
      "34 – Yann Sommer (£8.3m, Borussia Monchengladbach to Bayern Munich in January 2023)\nA Sommer signing completed in January, with Manuel Neuer injured and out for some time it was decided by Bayern that they would shop locally for a short-term replacement. And that he was, joining Inter that August after winning the Bundesliga.",
      "",
      "35 – Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£8.4m, Marseille to Al Qadsiah in July 2024)\nA 30-goal season with Marseille was slightly better than the campaign he spent playing irregularly and scoring even less often for Chelsea, with Aubameyang using that rediscovery of his goalscoring prowess to earn a Saudi pay day.",
      "",
      "36 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.9m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2021)\nManchester City lurked, Man Utd panicked, Sir Alex Ferguson was mobilised and Rio Ferdinand crowed. And for a while Ronaldo scored. But then a non-sycophantic grown-up was appointed as his manager and toys were expelled from prams with the toadying help of Piers Morgan as the Portuguese prompted a Saudi revolution.",

And it would probably take about a quarter of that to tempt them into selling now.",

      "",
      "3) Virgil van Dijk – £75m/€84m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nThe benchmark was set by Van Dijk, who claimed “I can’t do anything about the price” before doing everything to justify it, helping Liverpool reach a Champions League final within his first few months, winning the lot by his fourth year and raking in awards and acclaim in equal measure.",
      "",
      "4) Wesley Fofana – £70m/€80.4m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt took three rejected Chelsea bids – worth £50m, £60m and finally £70m with add-ons included – before Leicester finally caved and accepted up to £75m for a defender with 57 top-flight career league appearances. Even before Fofana’s serious knee issues, it wasn’t exactly going to plan.",

      "5) Lucas Hernandez – £68m/€80m (Atletico Madrid to Bayern Munich, July 2019)\nBayern Munich’s record signing was a bit of a dud, reaching just over 100 games in four years but watching the entire 2020 Champions League final win from the bench and being sold at a considerable loss to PSG.",

Man Utd might have had their ridiculous reasons for turning the latter down before signing him years later, but Juventus were not put off by his father’s weight; after three underwhelming years they might wish they had been.",

      "Man Utd have made an initial approach for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres through intermediaries, with Ruben Amorim a big admirer of his former striker; Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games last season; United also expected to bid again for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Monday 9 June 2025 17:29, UK",
      "United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for the 27-year-old. Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Man City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",
      "Man Utd saw their opening bid of £55m rejected. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",
