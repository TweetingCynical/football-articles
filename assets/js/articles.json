      "Benjamin Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has delivered a promising update on the striker's recovery from the knee problem he sustained against Tottenham before the November international break. Manchester United striker Sesko came on as a substitute in the 58th minute but managed just thirty minutes on the pitch before requiring treatment and being withdrawn.",
      "\"It's hard to say precisely when he will return. That will be up to the medical staff and the manager, but I think we'll see him back on the pitch very soon. Maybe even sooner than expected.\"",
      "Basanovic also highlighted the significance of Sesko developing an understanding with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the final third to achieve collective success. \"Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko have played very few matches together. They need games, certain automatisms, and then things become easier,\" Basanovic explained.",
      "\"When you don't have to think about where a player is or where he's going to run, but you do it automatically. Then the results come, and everything looks much better.\"",
      "Sesko has managed two goals and one assist in 11 Premier League outings this campaign. However, the 22-year-old's comeback will be vital, with Ruben Amorim poised to lose Mbeumo, Amad, and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) this month.",
      "\"I think it's going to be more or less at the same time,\" Amorim said. \"I don't want to say for sure, but when they are going to camp [for the tournament], I expect to have Ben back.\"",
      "Nevertheless, discussions are continuing over whether the club can retain the trio for their encounter with Bournemouth on December 15. The United manager was unable to provide a definitive response.",
      "\"The club is talking with the national teams,\" he explained. \"Let's wait for the middle of the week.",
      "\"I don't know for sure, but we are doing our job and the national teams are talking with us and that is a good sign.\"",

      "Mohamed Salah has been presented with an offer from Piers Morgan that will leave Liverpool bosses feeling increasingly uneasy. The Egyptian forward claimed he had been \"thrown under a bus\" and revealed he has no relationship with head coach Arne Slot after being left on the bench again against Leeds on Saturday.",
      "Following his explosive remarks, Liverpool pulled him from the squad for Tuesday's Champions League clash with Inter Milan. There's a genuine chance Salah may have featured in his final match for the Reds, with Saudi Pro League clubs keeping tabs on developments ahead of the January window.",
      "With relations between the club and player hanging by a thread, broadcaster Morgan has extended an invitation to Salah. Morgan's notorious sit-down with Cristiano Ronaldo sealed the Portuguese icon's fate during his second stint at Manchester United.",
      "Responding to Salah's damning comments, Morgan posted on X: \"Wow... maybe time for an interview @MoSalah?\"",
      "Back in November 2022, Ronaldo delivered a bombshell interview to Morgan where he slated the Glazers' ownership, slammed the club's facilities and took aim at then-boss Erik ten Hag. United promptly terminated his contract, clearing the path for his move to Al-Nassr, where he remains today.",
      "Ronaldo's revelations sparked divided opinions amongst supporters. Some United faithful praised his candour, arguing the club needed to confront some uncomfortable realities.",
      "Others, however, condemned what they perceived as a childish tantrum from a player whose sentimental homecoming had disappointed. Liverpool, and especially Slot, will be crossing their fingers that Salah doesn't accept Morgan's proposition.",
      "At the moment, a resolution seems far-fetched, but it's not entirely out of the question. However, any more public outbursts from the 33-year-old, particularly towards someone as high-profile as Morgan, could spell the end of his time at Anfield.",
      "The Reds also have to weigh up the potential impact on the rest of the team. Liverpool's goalkeeper Alisson Becker has confessed: \"This is not a situation that makes us happy, first and foremost because on a personal level we all love Mo.",
      "\"He is a hugely important player for the team, he is a wonderful human being, he is a spectacular footballer and has been very important for the club.\"",
      "He continued: \"We were a little bit caught by surprise [by Salah's comments] but we know it is a personal situation, so we are leaving it between him and the club. What we believe does not come into things.",
      "\"What we want is for him and the club to reach an agreement in the best interests of him and the club and all of the playing staff. I hope he plays again for the club. That's a personal situation between Mo and the club.",
      "\"We as his team-mates and his friends, we hope the best thing happens for him, but as Liverpool FC players we want the best for the club as well. We want a win-win situation for everyone.\"",

      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have both thrown their support behind Kobbie Mainoo as the promising midfielder continues to find himself excluded from Ruben Amorim's starting XI. Mainoo has managed just 183 Premier League minutes this season, all as a substitute, with Amorim yet to hand the 20 year old his first start.",
      "The youngster has been with United since joining their academy at the age of nine, working his way up through the system before establishing himself in the first team during the 2023/24 campaign under Erik ten Hag. However, since Amorim's arrival last November, the midfielder has found it difficult to cement a regular place in the starting lineup.",
      "Amorim has remained resolute in his squad vision, banishing several first-team players to what became dubbed the \"bomb squad\" - including Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia. Whilst Mainoo wasn't amongst that group, his lack of playing time is beginning to cause worry.",
      "Over United's previous three fixtures, he has featured for a mere 13 minutes in total. The midfielder's predicament is beginning to frustrate Scholes, with the United legend suggesting he's so talented he's likely 'embarrassing' Casemiro during training sessions",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, he said: \"Ruben Amorim has said Kobbie Mainoo is a starter... every appearance he's made in the Premier League has been as a sub. Things like that wind me up.",
      "\"I wouldn't mind if he was in a good team and they were winning every week and keeping possession but they're rubbish. Kobbie is a 20-year-old kid and he's not playing, he's going to have to leave. Do you know what will happen now? Amorim will bring him into a game and he won't be great but that's because he needs regular games.",
      "\"Fair enough, as a manger sometimes you just don't fancy a player. But look at what he's already done – scored the winner in an FA Cup final, played every game in the Euros.",
      "\"I bet he takes the p*** out of Casemiro every single day in training and is brilliant. I don't know why the club are letting Amorim treat a homegrown talent like that.\"",
      "Despite facing previous criticism, Casemiro has shown marked improvement this season and clearly enjoys Amorim's confidence. However, at 33 years old and with his deal running out next summer, the Brazilian isn't viewed as a long-term answer.",
      "Butt remains furious about Mainoo's situation and has dropped hints about where the midfielder might end up. He declared: \"The Kobbie one is an absolute joke. I went to the West Ham game [a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford] and it was an absolute s***show. It was a terrible, boring game\".",
      "\"The player to bring on to change the game, in my opinion, was Kobbie Mainoo – but he didn't get on the pitch. He'll be another homegrown player who leaves and is a superstar somewhere else.",
      "\"If Mainoo was playing for another Premier League club, United go and buy him for £70m or £80m. Now we're going to sell him and he'll be a superstar elsewhere like McTominay, Elanga, Henderson – we can mention loads of them.",
      "\"We're getting rid of players who love the football club, it's mind-boggling. I get the Garnacho one because his attitude and behaviour was terrible but you don't hear that about Kobbie.",
      "\"He's a top, top, top player that we are f****** up. Kobbie has got to go. If I'm looking after him I'm telling him \"we're getting you out of that football club\".",
      "\"For his football career he has to leave United, he's lost 18 months of development. I hope he goes abroad because it's embarrassing if he goes to Chelsea, which could happen.",
      "\"They might go and get him because they are putting together a very good, young squad and keep buying young players. He could quite easily end up at Chelsea next season.",
      "\"I've known Kobbie since he was eight but you wouldn't be doing him justice if you told him to stay and not to take that move. That's such a sad thing for me to say.\"",
      "Scholes agreed, saying: \"Do you know what? You'd have to advise him to go [to Chelsea], wouldn't you? If he rang me and said 'look, Chelsea are interested, what do you think?' I'd say go all day long.\"",

      "Mason Mount hit back at Roy Keane with his performance for Manchester United against Wolves, just a few days on from the former midfielder slamming his display against West Ham as \"schoolboy\". It comes as the 26-year-old was named back in Ruben Amorim's starting XI at Molineux.",
      "United were off the back of two disappointing results in their last three, with defeat to 10-player Everton and a draw with West Ham overshadowing the win over Crystal Palace in between them. The latest of those, the 1-1 stalemate with the Hammers, drew some criticism as the team failed to capitalise on a one-goal lead in the match.",
      "He said: \"When you look at the squad, considering the money that has been spent, they lack strength in depth. Particularly in the attacking areas. When you are trying to see a game off, I look at Mason Mount when he came on, some players take longer to get up to speed, but he was like a schoolboy out there.",
      "\"You're looking for players to come on with presence. If anything they brought the levels down at United. That seemed to be the case tonight.\"",
      "Mount, who scored the winner for Man United against Crystal Palace just days prior, managed to hit back in the best way possible. The forward did all the talking on the pitch, starting as one of the two number tens within Amorim's system in the clash away at Wolves on Monday night.",
      "He was classy in his display, showing attacking intent with every action on the ball, knitting things together neatly for the side. Mount also got on the scoresheet once again, combining with Bruno Fernandes to give United an advantage in the game, one they ended up winning comfortably 4-1.",
      "While there will be tougher challenges than Wolves up ahead, it was another display of where this team could be going when at their best. They need to hope it isn't a false dawn, with the second-half performance showing more of what the team are capable of compared to the end of the first.",
      "“Yeah, the manager had a few things to say, and we came out there, and it was down to us to really attack with a purpose and finish these chances that we were creating. So yeah, I think we’re happy with the second half. I thought in parts the first half as well. So yeah, overall, very happy with that.”",
      "Mount is starting to prove he can hold down a place in the side, after plenty of fitness issues at the start of his United career so far. With AFCON coming up, the side are set to lose some big players, but he is showing he can take over with some consistent performances for the month ahead.",
      "\"He can defend, he can attack, the quality when he touches the ball is really good, so it's not a surprise for me,\" Amorim said, glowing in praise for Mount after the game. \"He's a different type of leader. It's not like Licha [Lisandro Martínez], for example. It's a guy that leads by the example.",
      "The win saw United move up to sixth in the Premier League, just one point behind Crystal Palace in the Champions League places. Next up is a trip to Bournemouth next Monday, where another important three points are up for grabs.",

      "Garnacho looked to be ready for a new start after being left out of the starting XI for last season's Europa League final. He has been given a taste of Champions League action with his new employers after completing a deadline day switch and spoke to reporters ahead of a midweek meeting with Atalanta.",
      "During the pre-match press conferences, Garnacho was asked if he regretted the way things ended at the club which handed him a Premier League debut. A simple 'no' was his answer, with the winger maintaining the decision to move to Stamford Bridge made perfect sense.",
      "\"Sometimes in life, you have to change things to take a step forward or to improve as a player,\" Garnacho said on Monday. \"This was the right club and [moving] was an easy decision.\"",
      "Garnacho, 21, scored his first Chelsea goal in October in a Premier League defeat to Sunderland. He also opened his Champions League account for the club the following month during a draw with Qarabag, and has opened up about the impact of Blues boss Enzo Maresca on his game.",
      "\"He explained to me everything and now working together, I think we are doing well,\" Garnacho said of Maresca. \"We are going to improve with time, it’s just three months together, and he trusts me and that is the most important thing, to have confidence, and I’m going to improve.",
      "\"The most important thing is confidence. He speaks with me every week and I think we are going to be better, me as a player and the team all together, with time. We started the season just three months ago so it’s building confidence between the manager and the players.\"",
      "While Garnacho waits for his latest taste of Champions League football, his former employers are attempting to make the most of having no European commitments themselves. Ruben Amorim's United survived a scare to beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves on Monday night and now sit level on points with Chelsea.",
      "Bruno Fernandes put United in front early on, only for Jean-Ricner Bellegarde to equalise on the stroke of half-time. The visitors stepped things up in the second half, though, winning after Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount both netted before Fernandes grabbed his second of the night.",

Greenwood joined the French club last year, shortly after charges of attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour and assault were dropped - he had denied all allegations.",
      "De Zerbi has generally been satisfied with the forward, who has netted 11 goals and provided four assists across 19 outings in all competitions. Nevertheless, the Italian made a point of singling out Greenwood's display against Lille for particular censure.",
      "He declared: \"We played badly and we deserved to lose. We didn't string three passes together. We lost every second ball. Even with dribbling, we couldn't beat anyone. Defensively, we were never as aggressive as we usually are.",
      "\"We were passive from the first minute to the last. One shot on target for a player like Greenwood isn't enough for him. Shooting so infrequently isn't sufficient.\"",
      "This represents a sharp departure from Greenwood's recent praise for De Zerbi, where he credited the Italian with helping to resurrect his footballing career. The 24-year-old told Telefoot: \"I'm in a really good place thanks to the coach and my teammates.",
      "\"I feel good and I hope to improve, to win more awards this season. Roberto De Zerbi? He's the brains of the team, the architect of our game. He helps me understand football much better, he helps me improve every day.\"",

      "Nevertheless, he has not yet featured for Jamaica's national squad. In his Sun column, Deeney argued that Greenwood deserves another opportunity with England, provided his displays merit selection.",
      "The ex-striker penned: \"Football cannot be a place where people are written off after mistakes, alleged or not, in their younger years. This is not to dismiss the seriousness of those allegations. Greenwood will live with them forever.",
      "\"In truth, he does not owe an explanation to football supporters. It is his friends and family he must prove himself to. But, if he wants an England return, he must address it in public – prove he is worthy of wearing the England shirt, show he can be trusted.",
      "\"Rebuilding trust is the only way this can ever happen and it is an incredibly hard thing to achieve. It would be taxing on Greenwood himself having to face such justified scrutiny. If Greenwood can face that and come through it.",
      "\"He deserves a second chance with England. If there were to be no way back whatsoever, the game is setting a dangerous precedent. Sending a message that any mistake in your personal life rules you out for good.\"",

      "Tottenham midfielder James Maddison has once again defended his decision to hit back at Roy Keane after the duo were involved in a war of words last season.",
      "Manchester United legend Keane started the feud after he criticised Maddison, 29, before Tottenham went up against the Reds in the Premier League back in February.",
      "Speaking to the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"Maddison isn't bad when he's not at the darts... but if you think he's going to come back and get Spurs top six, you're in cuckoo land.\"",
      "He added: \"He's a talented player, but if you're a player in the Spurs dressing room and he's back in the squad, you wouldn't be looking and going, 'James is back today - we're going to be fine!'\"",
      "Maddison responded by scoring the winner for Tottenham in a 1-0 win against United. He then produced his trademark darts celebration before putting his finger to his lips in a silencing motion.",
      "\"There was a little bit of outside noise this week,\" Maddison replied. \"People will have their opinions. I wanted to do my talking on the pitch today so I hope there's a certain few that enjoyed me being the match-winner today.\"",
      "Maddison then continued his squabble with Keane after Tottenham won the Europa League in May. Although he didn't play in the final against United, Maddison joined CBS Sports' post-match coverage, and said: \"I wasn't gonna do any interviews but I heard Roy Keane was in the studio tonight!\"",
      "The panel burst into laughter, with Micah Richards urging Maddison to recreate his darts celebration on camera. He happily obliged, saying: \"Oh, I will, Micah, with pleasure - Roy Keane, that's for you, son!\"",
      "\"I remember that week,\" Maddison started. \"I love Roy Keane. People have asked me about him a lot since that. If I am watching the TV I am watching Roy Keane because he is box office, he is entertaining.",
      "\"He was a top, top player and he is great to watch. He gave me a bit of criticism during the week and I ended up scoring against United. If you're not allowed to hit back at him, what's the point?\"",
      "Jamie Carragher added: \"I love that, coming back and having that character and personality. Why would you just take criticism? You should give a little bit back. It was in a respectful manner and it was brilliant.\"",
      "Maddison hasn't played a single minute of competitive football this season after he injured his Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) in pre-season. Although Maddison returned to the grass for a light session on Monday morning, he is not expected to return for at least another couple of months.",

      "One speculated destination was Italian side Napoli. The likes of Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have left Old Trafford to prosper in Naples and it was reported that the club had shown an interest in the youngster.",
      "But Tutto Mercato now report that Napoli are \"on the fence\" regarding Mainoo and have an alternative in mind in the form of West Ham's Soungoutou Magassa.",
      "They also state that Roma and Italy star Lorenzo Pellegrini is on the club's radar, should they choose to abandon their pursuit of the promising Mainoo.",
      "Club captain Bruno Fernandes remains an integral part of Amorim's side this season and took his tally up to four goals with a brace against Wolves on Monday night. He has started every match so far.",
      "Since joining United from Sporting CP in January 2020 the Portugal international has been a dependable rock in the heart of the club's midfield and his commitment and on-field contributions have been recognised.",
      "On United's club website, there is a section that houses profiles of players the club deem to be 'legends.' This includes the likes of Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney, Paul Scholes and countless other icons.",
      "But Fernandes now finds his name on said list alongside another current, albeit on loan player in the form of Marcus Rashford. The 31-year-old's profile is complete with a biography of his time at the club so far and a suitably gold-trimmed design.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Premier League's Match Centre account issued a post on social media following Manchester United's contentious second-half penalty during their 4-1 victory at Wolves at Molineux on Monday. In the 80th minute, Amad Diallo furiously demanded a spot-kick after his powerful strike appeared to hit Yerson Mosquera's hand inside the area.",
      "Although referee Michael Salisbury initially dismissed the appeals, VAR officials urged him to review the incident on the pitchside monitor. After examining the footage, Salisbury reversed his original call and awarded United a penalty, determining that Mosquera had deliberately handled the ball.",
      "Replay footage revealed that the Wolves defender marginally moved his arm towards the ball as the shot travelled goalwards, leaving Salisbury with little option but to award a penalty.",
      "In an announcement to the Molineux crowd, Salisbury explained: \"After review, Wolves No.15 commits a deliberate handball in the penalty area. Final decision is yellow card and penalty kick.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes took responsibility from 12 yards and slotted past goalkeeper Sam Johnstone to extend United's lead to 4-1 and secure vital three points.",
      "Moments after Fernandes found the net, the Premier League's Match Centre account wrote on X: \"#WOLMUN – 80' VAR OVERTURN. After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of no penalty to Manchester United.\"",
      "It marked Fernandes' second goal of the evening, having already broken the deadlock for the Reds in the opening period. Jean-Ricner Bellegarde equalised for Wolves during first-half injury time, though this wasn't enough to stop United claiming victory.",
      "The Red Devils dominated after the break, finding the net three more times. Bryan Mbeumo restored United's advantage six minutes into the second half following Diogo Dalot's cross into the box.",
      "They're now level with fifth-placed Chelsea and trail fourth-placed Crystal Palace by just a single point. After the final whistle, Mount, who earned Player of the Match honours for an outstanding display, commended his fellow players.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was on song as Manchester United got back to winning way by beating hapless Wolves 4-1. The Red Devils took a deserved lead through Fernandes on 25 minutes after shambolic defending from Rob Edwards' rock-bottom side.",
      "But United failed to convert a series of chances before the break and were pegged back, as Jean-Ricner Bellegarde scored Wolves' first goal since October. Ruben Amorim seemingly gave his players at a rocket at half-time and by the hour mark, the away team were two goals to the good.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo finished off a counter attack as United exposed Wolves' high line before Mason Mount made it three. Fernandes then went from provider to scorer for the fourth.",
      "Here are five talking points from Molineux.",
      "They've seen a change in the dugout but Wolves' supporters aren't satisfied with just that. Their struggles on the pitch are symptomatic of what's going on upstairs at the club, with chairman Jeff Shi the focus of their anger.",
      "A healthy portion of home fans didn't take their seats until the 15th minute and chants of 'Jeff Shi is a w*****' rang around the ground once they arrived. Chinese investment group Fosun International don't want to sell at present, but the pressure is building.",
      "Some punters argue that the Premier League has never been a stronger when it comes to the quality of players up and down the division. If you changed the scoreboard and kits, though, you'd be forgiven for thinking United's opener came from Sunday league.",
      "Wolves relinquished possession in their own half, as Casemiro nipped in to give Matheus Cunha a one-on-one with Emmanuel Agbadou. Fernandes came to help him out but Cunha's pass was behind him, forcing the United captain to trip over.",
      "The United captain managed to quickly recover and fend off Agbadou, squeezing a shot through Sam Johnstone. \"What the f***ing was that?\" cried the Wolves fans in unison.",
      "Finally, the home crowd had something to cheer about. With United fluffing chance after chance to double their lead, Edwards' men knew they were still in the game.",
      "The problem was they needed to score, something that they hadn't done in the previous FIVE games - and never under Edwards. So when Amad left David Moller Wolfe free at the far post to pick up the scraps of a cross, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde smelled blood.",
      "Moller Wolfe's cutback found Bellegarde, who produced a somewhat acrobatic finish and drew Wolves level in stoppage time. All square at the break.",
      "It'd be a surprise if Amorim didn't give his players a rollicking at half-time. It was beggars belief how they let Wolves back in the game and fortunately for the Red Devils boss, they were much more clinical in the second period.",
      "Cunha slipped through Diogo Dalot on the counter attack, as they feasted on Wolves' high line to allow Bryan Mbeumo a tap-in after Sam Johnstone went wandering. Just 11 minutes later, Mount made it three.",
      "The England World Cup hopeful, starting his second game of United's last three, made a savvy run to evade the Wolves defence and was picked out by Fernandes. Mount produced an excellent finish and with Bellegarde having gone off injured between both goals, the wind had been taken out the home side's sails.",
      "Although Wolves didn't threaten a comeback, they were defending doggedly to keep the deficit at just two. That was until Yerson Mosquera stuck his arm out after Amad's shot from close range.",
      "VAR recommended that referee Michael Salisbury review the incident pitch-side and he didn't need too many looks to award a penalty. Fernandes stepped up and confidently tucked it away, despite Johnstone guessing right.",

      "James Maddison has thrown his support behind Kobbie Mainoo, insisting the young midfielder will rediscover his finest form and reach a \"really high level\", despite Ruben Amorim's latest Manchester United snub. Maddison, 29, offered his backing after Amorim once again named the England international on the bench for United's Monday night trip to Wolves.",
      "The 20-year-old hasn't featured in a single Premier League starting XI for United in 2025/26. He has played just 171 minutes in the top flight this season, and he remained an unused substitute during Thursday's 1-1 stalemate against West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "In his pre-Wolves press conference, Amorim justified his choice to restrict Mainoo's playing opportunities this season. When questioned about whether he recognised why Mainoo's status as a homegrown English talent generated particular scrutiny, Amorim said: \"Of course I understand, and my job is to answer. But you always ask me the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in]. It's my decision.\"",
      "Maddison replied: \"Yeah, definitely. It wasn't that long ago he was starting in the Euros for England. I remember Kobbie's first start for England was a game I came on as a sub in and I was very impressed with how composed he was and the occasion just didn't get to him at all.",
      "\"He is good on the ball and calm. A player with that much quality and assurance on the ball, I don't see any way how he doesn't get back to a really high level.\"",
      "Following Mainoo's omission against West Ham, an incensed Paul Scholes turned to Instagram to express his displeasure with Amorim. \"Bulls***,\" Scholes wrote in response to Amorim's recent claim that he considers Mainoo a starter.",
      "\"The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Mainoo was included in a nine-man United bench for the Wolves fixture, alongside fellow academy product Shea Lacey. Altay Bayindir, Patrick Dorgu, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee completed the Reds' substitutes.",

      "Many Wolves fans stayed in the concourse until 15 minutes of the game had elapsed in protest at their owners and executive chairman Shi.",

      "Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) boss Howard Webb has been urged to speak with with referee Andrew Kitchen following Aaron Wan-Bissaka's controversial escape from a red card during Manchester United's draw with West Ham. The ex-United full-back remarkably avoided dismissal for a reckless sliding tackle on Patrick Dorgu despite having already been cautioned mere moments before.",
      "The Hammers drew level between those two Wan-Bissaka incidents when Soungoutou Magassa converted the rebound from Jarrod Bowen's effort that had been hooked off the line. Diogo Dalot had given United the lead earlier in the second period.",
      "United pressed for a decisive goal but couldn't breach Alphonse Areola's defences again, meaning they had to make do with a point. Had Wan-Bissaka been given his marching orders, the outcome could have been vastly different, with former Premier League official Keith Hackett left baffled by the decision.",
      "He has since proposed that Webb should be conducting debriefs with officials to comprehend their thinking. Hackett, speaking to Football Insider on The Final Whistle, said: \"I was just fooled by it.",
      "\"Watching it, I was saying, 'You're off, mate. You're going to have an early Christmas present,' but nothing happened. The second yellow was worse than the first, and the second yellow was more like orange.",
      "\"On its own, I could have had it sit as a red. This was absolute nonsense. When we have situations like this, it's important for Howard Webb to talk to the referees.\"",
      "\"He should say, 'Talk me through this situation.' Why didn't you issue a yellow card? What have you seen that negates a yellow card?\". Before that moment, Kitchen had delivered a strong performance in the middle, with Hackett eager to praise the 29-year-old before subsequently offering a damning assessment in the immediate wake of the incident.",
      "He said: \"Whilst I think that Andrew Kitchen had a very good game, I would like him to review the two Wan-Bissaka challenges, particularly the last one. On a yellow card, you put in a reckless challenge, he should have had a second yellow followed by the red.",
      "\"He's a lucky guy. Andrew, you've got to keep focused up until the final whistle.\"",
      "After his fairly prominent mistake, Kitchen wasn't chosen to take charge of a Premier League fixture in game-week 15, nor did he oversee any Championship matches.",
      "United are in action again on Monday night as they take on winless Wolves and Ruben Amorim has insisted his side must remain concentrated for the challenge ahead. He remarked: \"Everything can happen, and that will change.",
      "\"There is no team in the Premier League history that didn't win one game. So, it can be any game. So, we need to try to improve, to rest the players, work really well, and prepare a tough match because, with us, it's always a tough match.\"",

      "Manchester United could potentially snap up Brighton and Hove Albion's midfielder Carlos Baleba for less than £75million in 2026, just six months after they were deterred by the Cameroon international's hefty price tag. The Red Devils have been eyeing the 21-year-old for a while and had approached the Seagulls via intermediaries about a possible summer transfer.",
      "Brighton's firm stance and a whopping £105m asking price led United to back off, opting instead to spend £18.2m on goalkeeper Senne Lammens as a replacement for Andre Onana. United's manager Ruben Amorim is keen to bring in a new midfielder when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Alongside Baleba, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is also high on their wishlist following his standout performances this season. On Sunday, Baleba was taken off during Brighton's Premier League draw against West Ham, marking the 12th time in 13 starts that manager Fabian Hurzeler has chosen to substitute the midfielder.",
      "Hurzeler has publicly questioned Baleba's performance levels, pointing to United's interest in the player over the summer. Now, recent reports suggest that Brighton's position on Baleba's potential departure has softened since the summer.",
      "However, Tavolieri has suggested that some figures within Bayern are hesitant to meet such a steep asking price for the player. This leaves the door ajar for United to maintain their position as favourites to secure the midfielder's signature, although whether they'll be willing to stump up that sum remains uncertain.",
      "Back in September, Hurzeler acknowledged his worries that Baleba's difficulties might have been triggered by United's summer pursuit. \"For sure, when a young boy reads there is interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep, deep down,\" he remarked.",
      "\"That's also part of the development to understand that when you play well, there comes a big offer, there comes a big club who wants to have him.",
      "\"But then to keep pushing, to be humble, stay here in Brighton, and try to make the next step with the team and that's something we have to keep on working with him. I can't give you a clear answer if it's really affected him or not.",
      "\"But for sure, he's a young boy and we need to understand he's not a machine that if you click on then he always runs and off then he stops. We need to understand his feelings, his emotions, where he comes from, and that's our responsibility.\"",

      "Amorim had previously revealed United were in discussions with the players' respective nations to defer their call ups, and he was asked to clarify the situation after beating Wolves.",
      "The United boss was unable to give a definitive answer again. \"The club is talking with the national teams,\" he explained. \"Let's wait for the middle of the week. I don't know for sure, but we are doing our job and the national teams are talking with us and that is a good sign.\"",
      "Mbeumo scored at the start of the second half against Wolves to restore United's lead. Amorim was pleased with the team's reaction after conceding on the stroke of half-time, saying: \"Once again, after we scored a goal, we were a little bit sloppy on the ball, and that gave a little bit of hope to the opponent, but we created a lot of chances in the first half also.",
      "\"We should have finished that half in the different way. And then in the half-time, they understood that we have everything to win the game, to win three points. And they did that. I think the pace, the quality that we showed in the second half, understanding that the moment of Wolves is really hard as a team, as a club. So we took advantage of that. \"",
      "\"Then this is a specific case we face a team that is really, really struggling and you can sense in every situation of the game. So the next game is going to be completely different.",
      "\"So we need to to know that, but in our club, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter the run that you have, the moment, if you play quite well the last game, what matters is the way we are going to play the next one.",

      "Littler was spotted next to the club's director of fan engagement Rick McGagh in the away section leading to some frustration among sections of the fanbase that the PDC world champion was receiving preferential treatment. However, it is understood that German sports manufacturer Adidas, who are tied into a 10-year partnership with the Reds worth £900m, gifted the ticket to Littler.",
      "Adidas receives four tickets for every away game through their partnership with United. In total, a small section of the away allocation, believed to be in the low double digits, are given to commercial partners of the club.",
      "United sources say the vast majority of supporters attending away matches are either season ticket holders or executive club members. Most fans seemed happy to see darts star Littler in the away end.",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes, who scored twice in United’s biggest win of the season, replied to Littler’s tweet about enjoying his “first away day” with a darts emoji.",
      "Littler and his fellow United fans were treated to a brilliant away trip as the Reds eased to a 4-1 victory against their lowly opponents. Bruno Fernandes opened the scoring in the 25th minute as he scrambled the ball past Sam Johnstone despite losing his footing.",
      "On the stroke of half-time, Wolves scored their first goal since October to level the game when Jean-Ricner Bellegarde fired into the bottom corner. Any United concerns were put to bed early in the second half as Bryan Mbeumo slotted into an open goal after Diogo Dalot broke the offside trap six minutes after the interval.",
      "Mason Mount then fired home from close range to end the game as a contest. Fernandes bagged his second of the game from the penalty spot to seal the three points. The victory moves United up to sixth in the Premier League, just one point outside the top four.",

      "It's not often a player who hasn't even started a league game dominates the build-up to a Premier League fixture. But Kobbie Mainoo has been the name on the lips of many Manchester United supporters this season.",
      "He's gone from being one of the first names on the teamsheet, scoring a goal in the FA Cup final and playing a role in England's run to the final of the European Championships, to being out in the cold for his club. His only United start this term has been in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town and he was again on the bench at Wolves on Monday night.",
      "United ultimately cantered to a comfortable 4-1 victory at Molineux and Mainoo was introduced to the action with 12 minutes left to play. His arrival was greeted with one of the loudest roars of the night from the sold out away end.",
      "The message from the travelling fans was clear, he's one of our own and we want him to stay. Mainoo's talent is obvious and his application during his period on the sidelines has been a credit to the 20-year-old. He's not moaned or whined, and has knuckled down to try and force himself into Ruben Amorim's thinking.",
      "That hasn't transpired and there is no indication to suggest it might in the near future. Amorim spoke in the build-up to the game about the young midfielder and in a spiky press conference defended his decision to overlook the England international.",
      "\"I just want to win,\" said Amorim. \"I don't look [at] who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You always ask me the same thing. I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in]. It's my decision.\"",
      "The United boss then said \"I don't know\" when asked whether the upcoming departure of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo to the Africa Cup of Nations might afford Mainoo the minutes he craves. \"I don't know what is going to happen,\" said the United boss. \"It depends. I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Mainoo's response to his lack of football is set to be a request to move in January. He asked to leave in the summer but a permanent move was blocked. He's set to seek a loan switch when the winter window opens.",
      "Whether Amorim will sanction a departure remains to be seen but one thing is clear, the United fans want their homegrown hero to stay at Old Trafford, they want him to be given an opportunity. Amorim doesn't seem to share the view.",

      "“Well I don't agree with that but it's a question of whether he can force himself in… Why not even at this late stage?”",
      "Responding to Stelling, Gabby Agbonlahor said: “If he can get a run of games and perform like he did last night, Thomas Tuchel will be aware of Mason Mount. He'll know what he can do and what he did at Chelsea.\"",

      "\"He can defend, he can attack, is really the quality that when he touched the ball is really good. So it's not a surprise for me, but of course, we need to take care of him. Sometimes you need to protect them in training in games, but when you build, that is going to happen the same, the same thing with Luke Shaw. So he's going to build that and it's going to be really important for our club.\"",

      "Ayden Heaven believes \"nobody can stop\" Manchester United if they play as they did against Wolves. United won 4-1 at Molineux in the Premier League on Monday thanks to a second-half rout. It was 1-1 at half-time after an equaliser from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Wolves had not scored for five successive Premier League games but broke their duck to get back into the contest.",
      "United responded well to surrendering their advantage and came out swinging in the second half, with Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount getting on the scoresheet to make it 3-1. United captain Bruno Fernandes put the icing on the cake when he converted a penalty to complete his brace.",
      "Heaven retained his starting role at Molineux, despite being hooked against West Ham at the interval last week, and the youngster delivered a significantly improved performance. Speaking in the mixed zone after the game, Heaven said: \"We dropped points in the last game and this was the chance to go and redeem ourselves and get more points. I feel like we did that, especially in the second half. We knew it wasn't good enough that we conceded. He [Amorim] just told us to do what we can do and we did that, as you saw.\"",
      "Heaven believes Amorim showed faith in him by keeping him in the XI. \"There's so many great defenders at this club that he's trusting you to be at the middle of that defence. He’s trusting me a lot,\" he said. \"I feel like I’m working hard every day in training and I’m showing he can trust me in the games that I’m playing. I wouldn’t say it was rust. I felt confident. West Ham are a good team and they started well.",
      "\"I thought I was a good player. I knew that I first had to gain the trust of the manager and slowly I know I’m doing that. I feel like I’m doing well at the moment, but I’ve just got to keep working.\"",
      "The 19-year-old is relishing the chance to work with experienced defensive colleagues. \"I’m enjoying it because knowing you have that experience around you,\" he added. \"You are not scared to go on the front foot and not scared of what you leave behind either. They’re always there when I need them.\"",
      "\"We’ve just got to do what we did today in every game. I don’t think anyone can stop us when we play like this. Of course, playing at Old Trafford [in three of the next four games], you can’t say no to that. It’s a real boost to us and it will work in our favour. We want to win as many games as possible.",
      "\"Hopefully we can be in Europe next season, which I think we'll do. That's where Manchester United belong, so feel like we can just continue how we did today and we’ll be back when we belong.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim praised Mason Mount following Manchester United's victory against Wolves. United were heavy favourites to win against the Premier League's bottom side, who had claimed just two points all season, and they opened the scoring in the 25th minute through Bruno Fernandes after some comical defending.",
      "However, Wolves were level at the interval thanks to Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. The home side had not scored for five games, but they broke their duck after a strike from Bellegarde. Wolves were unable to build on that in the second half. United were gifted space in the final third and took advantage, scoring three more goals through Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and a Fernandes penalty.",
      "Amorim was asked whether Mount was now delivering consistently strong performances and responded: \"I think also the way we play, if you compare the past that he had in Chelsea, which Chelsea is the same, then he has a great quality.",

      "\"Mason Mount is always the same thing, training, talking, dealing with people around Carrington. That is not easy. So he’s a very, very good player.\"",
      "Amorim explained why Mount hasn't started every game, adding: \"Sometimes it's the tactical issue. When you play a striker and sometimes Cunha is going to that position or sometimes it's also we need to protect Mason Mount.\"",

      "Mason Mount responded to Roy Keane's recent criticism in the best possible way with a strong performance for Manchester United against Wolves on Monday night. Just days after Keane labelled Mount's display against West Ham as \"schoolboy\", the England international impressed and got himself on the scoresheet at Molineux.",
      "United were recovering from two disappointing results in their last three matches, with a defeat to 10-man Everton and a draw with West Ham overshadowing the victory over Crystal Palace. The most recent of these, the 1-1 draw with the Hammers, attracted criticism.",
      "Mount, who made a substitute appearance in the match at Old Trafford, was among those criticised. Keane was particularly harsh post-match, saying: \"When you look at the squad, considering the money that has been spent, they lack strength in depth. Particularly in the attacking areas. When you are trying to see a game off, I look at Mason Mount when he came on, some players take longer to get up to speed, but he was like a schoolboy out there.",
      "\"You're looking for players to come on with presence. If anything they brought the levels down at United. That seemed to be the case tonight.\"",
      "Mount, who scored the winner for United against Crystal Palace just days prior, managed to hit back in the best way possible. As well as getting on the scoresheet, he showed attacking intent and knit things together neatly for the side.",
      "“Yeah, the manager had a few things to say, and we came out there, and it was down to us to really attack with a purpose and finish these chances that we were creating.",
      "\"So yeah, I think we’re happy with the second half. I thought in parts the first half as well. So yeah, overall, very happy with that.”",
      "Asked about Mount after his side's victory in the Midlands, United boss Amorim said: \"He can defend, he can attack, the quality when he touches the ball is really good, so it's not a surprise for me.",
      "\"He's a different type of leader. It's not like Licha [Lisandro Martínez], for example. It's a guy that leads by the example.",
      "The win saw United move up to sixth in the Premier League, just one point behind Crystal Palace in the Champions League places. Next up is a trip to Bournemouth next Monday, where another important three points are up for grabs.",

      "Manchester United talent Kobbie Mainoo has continued to find game time hard to come by under Ruben Amorim. With the January transfer window looming, there could be an opportunity to explore a loan move to regain some momentum in his career.",
      "Mainoo has clocked up just 183 Premier League minutes so far this season, with Amorim preferring the duo of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro as his deeper midfielders. Mainoo did make it off the bench at Wolves on Monday night, playing the final 12 minutes in the 4-1 victory.",
      "But with no European football and an early exit from the Carabao Cup, it's difficult to see where the real opportunities will come from for Mainoo to get any sustained time on the pitch - which will do his bid for inclusion in the England World Cup squad no good.",
      "Speaking at his press conference before the trip to Wolves on Monday night, Amorim was dismissive about calls to boost Mainoo's involvement in the squad. He said: “I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.”",
      "Some fans say that Amorim has the option to turn to his young players in the pursuit of better results, if he would only take them. Reader Allumjoe says: \"The team continues to be inconsistent results-wise and performance-wise. Now only two wins from the last 6 games, and the same excuses trotted out. It is a shame the manager refuses to use our better young players...\"",
      "Commenter Red Banana writes: \"Can't decide which is more annoying - his treatment of Mainoo, his substitutions, or his mind-numbing tactics.\"",
      "IlSacristano says: \"A tragic waste of talent. Like a lot of the Academy youngsters. And when things go wrong on the pitch Amorim needs to look at himself before blaming his players.\"",
      "Billbiggins adds: \"I have said for months, if they don't play Mainoo, then they should sell Mainoo. They are ruining a good player.\"",
      "PlymBob says: \"I do get annoyed when I see comments about Mainoo's performances when he gets to play for a few minutes now and again. How can he be expected to show his ability with so little time on the pitch?\"",
      "Others say that Mainoo isn't the answer to the issues at United. FrankM16 says: \"If he was winning nobody would care. Amorim has had more than enough time to do his thing and his thing is to be a loser. It really annoys me to see Villa and Sunderland and Palace and more befar better than us in every way, from the way the clubs are run to their scouting and their play. We are very poor at every level. Mainoo is just another player.\"",
      "Taffyj writes: \"The situation comes down to do you create a team and system to suit your squad and its best players, or do you stick with a system and ditch players who can't force their way into it?\"",
      "Moin-star says: \"I don’t even remember how Mainoo even plays, but come on… the times he did play, he has been poor. Granted he needs a run of games… but surely he’s not doing enough in training for him to get a look in on match days?\"",

Sesko was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute but lasted only half an hour before being forced off after receiving treatment.",
      "Since then, he has missed four Premier League games, though Basanovic is confident the forward may return sooner than initially expected. Speaking to Give Me Sport, he said: \"Benjamin is feeling very well. His rehabilitation is progressing according to plan.",
      "\"It's hard to say precisely when he will return. That will be up to the medical staff and the manager, but I think we'll see him back on the pitch very soon.\"",
      "The huge boost in particular came when Basanovic added: \"Maybe even sooner than expected.\" The agent also emphasised the importance of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo building chemistry up front to achieve success together.",
      "\"Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko have played very few matches together. They need games, certain automatisms, and then things become easier,\" he added.",
      "\"When you don’t have to think about where a player is or where he's going to run, but you do it automatically. Then the results come, and everything looks much better.\"",
      "Sesko has registered two goals and one assist across 11 Premier League appearances this season.",
      "However, the 22‑year‑old's return will be crucial, with Ruben Amorim set to lose Mbeumo, Amad, and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) this month.",
      "\"I think it's going to be more or less at the same time,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"I don't want to say for sure, but when they are going to camp [for the tournament], I expect to have Ben back.\"",
      "However, talks are ongoing over whether the club can keep the trio for their clash with Bournemouth on December 15.",
      "The United boss was unable to give a definitive answer.",
      "\"The club is talking with the national teams,\" he explained. \"Let's wait for the middle of the week.",

      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have both backed Kobbie Mainoo as the young midfielder continues to be left out of Ruben Amorim’s squad. Mainoo has played just 183 Premier League minutes this season, all coming from the bench, with Amorim yet to start the 20-year-old.",
      "Mainoo has been at United since joining the academy at nine years old, rising through the ranks before breaking into the first team during the 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag. But since Amorim took charge last November, the midfielder has struggled to secure a regular starting role.",
      "Amorim has been firm in his vision for the squad, exiling several first-team players into what became known as the “bomb squad” - Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "While Mainoo was not part of that group, his limited minutes are starting to raise concern. Across United’s last three matches, he has played just 13 minutes in total. The midfielders situation is starting to get on Scholes' nerves, with the United icon claiming he's so good he's probably 'embarrassing' Casemiro regularly in training.",
      "He told The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast: \"Ruben Amorim has said Kobbie Mainoo is a starter… every appearance he’s made in the Premier League has been as a sub. Things like that wind me up.",
      "\"I wouldn’t mind if he was in a good team and they were winning every week and keeping possession but they’re rubbish. Kobbie is a 20-year-old kid and he’s not playing, he’s going to have to leave. Do you know what will happen now? Amorim will bring him into a game and he won’t be great but that’s because he needs regular games.",
      "\"Fair enough, as a manger sometimes you just don’t fancy a player. But look at what he’s already done – scored the winner in an FA Cup final, played every game in the Euros.",
      "\"I bet he takes the p*** out of Casemiro every single day in training and is brilliant. I don’t know why the club are letting Amorim treat a homegrown talent like that.\"",
      "Casemiro, despite previous criticism, has largely impressed this season and appears to be someone Amorim trusts. But at 33, and with his contract expiring next summer, the Brazilian is not seen as a long-term solution.",
      "Butt is also infuriated with Mainoo's treatment and has hinted at where the midfielder could move to. He said: \"The Kobbie one is an absolute joke. I went to the West Ham game [a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford] and it was an absolute s***show. It was a terrible, boring game\"",
      "\"The player to bring on to change the game, in my opinion, was Kobbie Mainoo – but he didn’t get on the pitch. He’ll be another homegrown player who leaves and is a superstar somewhere else.",
      "\"If Mainoo was playing for another Premier League club, United go and buy him for £70m or £80m. Now we’re going to sell him and he’ll be a superstar elsewhere like McTominay, Elanga, Henderson – we can mention loads of them.",
      "\"We’re getting rid of players who love the football club, it’s mind-boggling. I get the Garnacho one because his attitude and behaviour was terrible but you don’t hear that about Kobbie.",
      "\"He’s a top, top, top player that we are f****** up. Kobbie has got to go. If I’m looking after him I’m telling him “we’re getting you out of that football club”.",
      "\"For his football career he has to leave United, he’s lost 18 months of development. I hope he goes abroad because it’s embarrassing if he goes to Chelsea, which could happen.",
      "\"They might go and get him because they are putting together a very good, young squad and keep buying young players. He could quite easily end up at Chelsea next season.",
      "\"I’ve known Kobbie since he was eight but you wouldn’t be doing him justice if you told him to stay and not to take that move. That’s such a sad thing for me to say.\"",
      "Scholes agreed, saying: \"Do you know what? You’d have to advise him to go [to Chelsea], wouldn’t you? If he rang me and said 'look, Chelsea are interested, what do you think?' I’d say go all day long.\"",

      "Former Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho harbours no regrets about how his Old Trafford chapter concluded. The Argentina international is working to revive his career at Chelsea following a summer transfer, and seems focused on what lies ahead rather than dwelling on the past.",
      "Garnacho appeared ready to shake things up after being omitted from Ruben Amorim's starting line-up for last season's Europa League final. He has returned to the Champions League with his new club after securing a deadline day move and addressed journalists before a midweek clash with Atalanta.",
      "During the pre-match media briefing, Garnacho was questioned about whether he had any remorse over how things concluded at the club that gave him his Premier League bow as a teenager. His response was a straightforward 'no', with the winger insisting his decision to relocate to Stamford Bridge was not one he regrets.",
      "\"Sometimes in life, you have to change things to take a step forward or to improve as a player,\" Garnacho said on Monday. \"This was the right club and [moving] was an easy decision.\"",
      "Garnacho, 21, netted his maiden Chelsea goal in October during a Premier League loss to Sunderland. He also got off the mark in the Champions League for the club the following month in a stalemate with Qarabag, and has revealed how Blues manager Enzo Maresca has influenced his development.",
      "\"He explained to me everything and now working together, I think we are doing well,\" Garnacho said of Maresca. \"We are going to improve with time, it's just three months together, and he trusts me and that is the most important thing, to have confidence, and I'm going to improve.",
      "\"The most important thing is confidence. He speaks with me every week and I think we are going to be better, me as a player and the team all together, with time. We started the season just three months ago so it's building confidence between the manager and the players.\"",
      "While Garnacho awaits his next taste of Champions League action, his former club are trying to capitalise on having no European distractions of their own.

      "There was a familiar name on the teamsheet for Manchester United Under-18s on Saturday as they beat Newcastle 2-0 at Carrington. Jacey Carrick, the son of former United midfielder Michael, made his debut at age-group level after coming off the bench.",
      "A left-footed midfielder, there are high hopes for Jacey at the United academy and he has been involved in the England Under-15 set-up, but Saturday was the first time he had a place in the squad for Darren Fletcher's Under-18 set-up at United.",
      "Jacey played with Kai Rooney for United's Under-16s in the SuperCupNI during the summer, a prestigious youth tournament in Northern Ireland, and his progress has continued this season. He has won national titles at Under-14 and Under-15 level, playing a key role in both of those triumphs.",
      "He came on against Newcastle with 20 minutes remaining, replacing in-form 15-year-old striker JJ Gabriel, although for once it wasn't the Barcelona target who got the goals for Fletcher's team.",
      "With the game goalless at the break, 15-year-old attacker Douka Nkoto came and produced a dazzling display, scoring twice to bag his first goal at Under-18 level.",
      "He bagged his first from close range after Godwill Kukonki did well in the build-up. The centre-back had a role in Nkoto's second as well, with another finish from in front of goal doubling the lead.",

This critical weakness will be further exposed when their most dynamic wing-back, Amad, departs for the Africa Cup of Nations. Read full story here>>>",
      "Amorim is facing growing pressure and risks losing support due to his persistent refusal to utilise Kobbie Mainoo. Fans are baffled and frustrated by Mainoo's lack of involvement, suggesting the manager's handling of Mainoo could become the tipping point for their patience. Read full story here>>>",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are facing intense scrutiny as the team's poor form could put Amorim's job in jeopardy. If United were to cut ties with Amorim, who was Berrada’s appointment, it would not only cost millions but would also reflect badly on the new executive team's competence. Read full story here>>>",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to grant Amorim time, believing structural issues are United's primary problem, but this patience may be challenged by the Glazer family. The Glazers have historically dismissed managers when Champions League qualification becomes impossible, and missing out again would be another financial blow. Read full story here>>>",
      "Manuel Ugarte is struggling significantly more than Mainoo and should be the player considered for a January exit. Despite having played under Amorim previously, Ugarte has drifted to the fringes of the squad and his lack of defensive security is underscored by the high volume of goals conceded when he is on the field.

      "Senne Lammens was \"surprised\" by the spirit and togetherness in Manchester United's dressing room when he arrived in the summer. Lammens signed from Royal Antwerp on the final day of the summer transfer window and has made a strong impact since making his debut in October.",
      "The Belgian has retained first-choice status since keeping a clean sheet against Sunderland, and he has earned praise for delivering consistent displays in between the sticks at Old Trafford.",
      "Lammens recently sat down with Malaysian broadcaster Stadium Astro to conduct an interview at Carrington and he was asked who he is closest to in the dressing room. Lammens named two goalkeepers, but admitted he is close to everyone because all the players have a strong bond.",
      "He explained: “I would say maybe Tom Heaton or the fourth goalkeeper Dermot Mee or also, like, the Dutch guys, because it’s easier with the language as well. But I think just in general that’s what surprised me the most.",
      "\"It’s just the togetherness of the group and of the dressing room. Everyone was really nice. So I don’t really want to say one or two guys. It’s in general with everybody, to be honest.”",
      "Amorim has improved dressing room morale. The bad eggs were banished in the summer and sources admitted that a feeling of 'us against them' had developed after their departures.",
      "Lammens provided further personal insight when he revealed he journals before and after matches. \"I think it started when I started played at Antwerp two years ago,\" he said. \"I like to write things down before and after a game just to get my head into the right mindset. Sometimes if things don't go right, or you don't want it in your head, you just write it down to get it off your chest.",
      "\"I came up with it [journaling] a little bit myself, but also got it [the idea] from people talking about it as well, so I thought I would give it a try and it actually helped me a lot, so I still do it.",
      "\"Before a game, I write down a little bit about the opponent, about how they will play and put pressure on me. Also individual things, like key points I have to remember throughout the game.\"",
      "Lammens continued: \"Being a complete goalkeeper is something I take pride in. It's not just stop-stopping, it's coming out for crosses and helping the defence when the balls go behind them. My distribution as well, but what I'm most proud of is being able to play with my left foot and right.",
      "\"That makes it more difficult for the opponent to press me. Coming out for crosses is really difficult in the Premier League especially. I still like to do it a lot, but you need to protect yourself a little bit.\"",

      "For the second time this season, Manchester United got a goal from a wing-back on Thursday night. The manner in which the ball fell to Diogo Dalot was fortunate, but Dalot's finish was not and neither was his positioning.",
      "This was what Amorim so desperately wanted from the wide players in his team. With the ball on the right, left wing-back Dalot moved into a central area inside the penalty box. When Casemiro's deflected shot fell to him, he was ten yards out and had time to take a touch and finish.",
      "The problem for United and Amorim is that it isn't happening enough. The wing-backs in this system are supposed to provide an attacking threat, but they aren't doing it on a regular basis. Amad was lively at times against West Ham, but generally, the quality isn't there out wide.",
      "Dalot continues to give his all and can deliver at times, but the transition to wing-back doesn't come easily and he would probably look a lot more comfortable as a natural full-back with a winger in front of him. Patrick Dorgu is a more attacking wing-back, but he has yet to show he is good enough for this level.",
      "Amorim spoke last week about the anxiety he senses when Dorgu has the ball and the 21-year-old isn't a sufficient attacking threat down the left. The quality is lacking.",
      "During the answer about the anxiety you can feel when Dorgu has the ball, Amorim also expanded on his wing-backs, admitting they weren't good enough at the moment but insisting they were showing more in training.",
      "\"What I feel when I see them training, they are doing so much better than in games,\" he said.",
      "\"I think they (wing-backs) are far from the best, and they know it. So, like a lot of players in our team, like myself. So I just, I just look at them, and I think they have so much more to give. So let's see, let's see this week if we improve that.\"",
      "He was also asked last month if wing-back was an area he wanted to strengthen, but again said time was needed to \"improve the characteristics of the team.\"",
      "The problem is that Amorim has had a year to turn the wings into a positive area for United and he hasn't done it. It is also surprising that the £25million deal to sign Dorgu in January is the only attempt to strengthen the position in the transfer market, with the £215m summer spending spree focusing on a striker and two No. 10s.",
      "Things might be about to get worse as well. Amad will head to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) later this month, as will Noussair Mazraoui, who is only a very occasional fill-in at wing-back these days. Amad's absence will be felt keenly. He is easily the most attacking wing-back in this squad and the one who looks most likely to provide the incision from out wide.",
      "Unless Amorim decides to move Luke Shaw back out wide, then Dalot and Dorgu will be the only available wing-backs while Amad is away with the Ivory Coast. It's hard not to think that will reduce United's wide threat and put more of an onus on goals and creativity on Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "If this system is to ever click into gear and work on a regular basis, then either the wing-backs have to improve or better players have to be signed for the role.",

      "There have been boos to greet the final whistle at the end of the last two games at Old Trafford and it feels like Bonnie Tyler's 'It’s a Heartache’ hasn't been heard quite as often in Manchester United ends recently, but it would be stretching it to say matchgoers have lost faith in Ruben Amorim just yet.",
      "It's clear concerns at the lack of progress are growing and the momentum built up a month ago has again been replaced by introspection, but United fans are generally reluctant to turn on a manager. They didn't really turn on Erik ten Hag in stadiums and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer only properly got abuse on his final day in charge after a 4-1 defeat at Watford. Amorim hasn't had anything like that yet.",
      "But from his adherence to a system that isn't working to concerns over a playing style that is hardly thrilling to watch, the pubs around the ground will be ablaze with fans who aren't convinced at what they are seeing. The issue that might finally drive a wedge between supporters and Amorim is a player we get barely to see, however. Kobbie Mainoo has managed just 171 minutes in the Premier League this season and as the weeks have gone by, Amorim's faith in him seems to decline.",
      "There is a similar precedent towards the end of Solskjaer's reign, when fans used his refusal to play Donny van de Beek as a stick to beat him with. The difference is that Solskjaer was right and Van de Beek hadn't shown enough for United, and never would do. With Mainoo, the feeling is different.",
      "Fans have already seen what the gifted 20-year-old can do. He burst onto the scene in 2023/24, has played in a major tournament final, scored some brilliant goals for United and been at the heart of an FA Cup final win against Manchester City. But now he is the last option in midfield for Amorim, the break glass in case of emergency player on the bench, and even then, Amorim would rather look elsewhere.",
      "With United needing a goal against West Ham on Thursday, the Portuguese head coach opted for Lisandro Martinez as his fifth and final substitute. It left Mainoo kicking his heels again, but it was clear to everyone else inside Old Trafford that he was the more likely source of a goal.",
      "To compound matters, Mainoo is the Stockport-born United fan who is the current poster boy of an academy being turned into a cash machine rather than a source of first-team footballers. Supporters are baffled at his lack of involvement and angry at Amorim's approach to homegrown players.",
      "It won't have helped matters that Amorim was so dismissive of Mainoo in his press conference ahead of facing Wolves this weekend. He gave the impression there were very few scenarios in which he would play the youngster and was clearly sick of being asked about him.",
      "Mainoo has no option but to pursue a loan move next month. His development is stalling for a lack of first-team football and whatever it is Amorim and his coaches are trying to improve in training, the approach clearly isn't working.",
      "But if Mainoo moves to the continent for six months and starts lighting up games again with his wonderful close control, ability to manipulate the ball near the box and find space in tight situations, the frustration at Amorim's approach to him will only grow.",
      "If United were flying under the 40-year-old, then this would be less of an issue. Supporters would still be frustrated, but they would be willing to trust Amorim and let it slide for now. But they are not flying. They are going nowhere at the moment.",
      "United would have no interest in letting Mainoo leave permanently in January and the midfielder wouldn't want to. He wants to make it at Old Trafford and right now he is probably looking at it and thinking he is far more likely to last the course than Amorim.",
      "The former Sporting boss is under pressure and his refusal to give Mainoo a chance is only raising the stakes. It might be the issue that finally sees patience snap for many fans.",

      "Everything Ratcliffe has said has pointed to his desire to give Amorim time. United have been through a succession of managers in recent years and none of them have managed to bring consistent success back to Old Trafford. In Ratcliffe's view, the issues are as much structural as having the wrong man in the dugout.",
      "But there will surely come a time when Amorim's position comes under intense scrutiny once again. Perhaps we're there after desperately disappointing results in the last two home fixtures. Monday's trip to Wolves sticks out as a banana skin fraught with danger.",
      "Lose to a team who have just two points from 14 Premier League games and the damage will be difficult to recover from. A win should be a given, but it might only be a matter of time until the next result that puts the Portuguese head coach back in the spotlight.",
      "All eyes at Old Trafford will be on the league table. Amorim's side are eighth at the moment, only two points off fourth but equally only three points off 14th. They need to be moving in the right direction.",
      "United can spin the positives of one season out of Europe, which includes extra time on the training pitch for Amorim and a group of fresh players to target the Premier League every weekend. But right now, they are not making the most of those advantages.",
      "A second campaign outside of the Champions League and the riches on offer in the expanded competition would be damaging. A second season outside of Europe would be disastrous entirely.",
      "The difference between the Europa League and the Champions League is north of £100 million and missing out on that kind of cash is going to hurt. It will limit what United can do in the transfer market, damage their ability to attract players and impact revenues at a time when building a new stadium is a top priority.",
      "We can't be sure how much that will come into Ratcliffe's thinking. As a businessman, he will clearly have an eye on the bottom line, but could he be willing to suck up the pain for another season in the interest of standing by his man? It would be a brave call.",
      "However, one area of potential conflict is with the Glazer family, who remain the majority shareholders, even though it's Ratcliffe who is currently running the show. The Glazers are all about the finances and they know how expensive not getting in the Champions League is.",
      "They have been ruthless with managers before when Europe has slipped away, often dismissing them when qualification for the Champions League became impossible. United's long-term ambitions can only be met with consistent entry into the Champions League.",
      "The Premier League is likely to have a fifth spot again next season, giving United more room to bag themselves a seat at the top table. An encouraging run of fixtures in December might yet see them put themselves firmly into that race.",
      "If that doesn't happen, however, and the gap grows, that is when things could get nervy for Amorim. It is also when Ratcliffe's desire to give him time and the Glazers' focus on revenue could potentially rub up against each other.",
      "For now, the Glazers are letting Ratcliffe and his team get on with running United. But you guarantee they are keeping a close eye on events at the club and they will be well aware of the consequences of missing out on the Champions League again.",

      "Ruben Amorim dismissed claims he had no faith in the Manchester United academy but refused to offer Kobbie Mainoo any guarantees that he would get a chance when the club lose players to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute during United's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday despite being one of only two attacking options on the bench. He has managed just 171 minutes of Premier League football this season and his only start came in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old will return to the scene of one of his best moments in a United shirt on Monday night. Mainoo scored a stunning winning goal at Molineux in February 2024, during a remarkable breakout season that ended with him playing in a European Championship final.",
      "However, he has fallen out of favour under Amorim and doesn't look like forcing his way into the team anytime soon. Manuel Ugarte came on for Joshua Zirkzee against the Hammers and quizzed about Mainoo's prospects before the trip to Wolves, Amorim became frustrated at the topic coming up again.",
      "“Of course I understand [why you ask], and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing,\" he said.",
      "“I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.”",
      "Amorim accepted that Mainoo's situation was becoming deflating for the academy graduate, who could leave on loan during the January transfer window.",
      "But he insisted his team selection was purely down to picking the best players and that he didn't see Mainoo in the best XI this season.",
      "“I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch,\" he said.",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.”",
      "Asked if AFCON could be Mainoo's route into the team, Amorim added: \"I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Amorim's faith in the academy has been questioned recently. He has shunted Mainoo to the margins of the squad and although youngsters such as Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey have made the bench this season, they haven't made it onto the pitch.",
      "It was put to Amorim that he didn't trust the academy, and he went on to explain why Lacey has made the bench for three games in a row but not made an appearance.",
      "\"“But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard,\" he said.",
      "“So you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.”",

United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",

      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Tottenham star James Maddison has backed Kobbie Mainoo to “get back to a really high level” amid his struggle for minutes at Manchester United.",
      "Mainoo’s struggles for minutes have been well documented this season. In the Premier League, he’s played just 183 minutes and is yet to start a game.",
      "Ruben Amorim insists he sees him as a starter, though that’s hard to believe given the circumstances.",
      "The 29-year-old suggested Mainoo will come good again.",
      "Maddison said: “Yeah, definitely. It wasn’t that long ago he was starting in the Euros for England. I remember Kobbie’s first start for England was a game I came on as a sub in and I was very impressed with how composed he was and the occasion just didn’t get to him at all.",
      "“He is good on the ball and calm. A player with that much quality and assurance on the ball, I don’t see any way how he doesn’t get back to a really high level.”",
      "Tottenham, where Maddison plies his trade, are one of a number of big clubs who have been linked with Mainoo’s capture of late.",
      "Alongside them in the Premier League are Chelsea, where Paul Scholes feels Mainoo could and probably should move if the opportunity arises.",
      "A report of late suggested there were as many as 12 sides interested in taking the United midfielder on board in January, though the club’s stance has been that he’s not for sale.",
      "That could be changing though, with a report suggesting Mainoo’s exit from United is “99 per cent done.”",
      "That report comes from Italian journalist Luca Cerchione, who claims it originated close to Napoli’s assistant manager, Cristian Stellini.",
      "The journalist said: “In the past few days, I received a phone call from a friend of Mr. Stellini, who informed me that he had learned that there had been a significant acceleration in the sale of Mainoo, even talking about percentages close to 99.",
      "“Naturally, the person who gave me this transfer rumour didn’t cite Stellini as his source.”",
      "If a Napoli transfer is to happen, Mainoo would link up with former United midfielder Scott McTominay, who was the best player in Italy last season after leaving Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, a deal for Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is “99%” done ahead of next month’s transfer window.",
      "Paul Scholes feels Kobbie Mainoo likely “takes the p***” out of Casemiro in training yet isn’t picked for Manchester United, as he and Nicky Butt are scared he’ll replicate Scott ...",
      "Paul Scholes has urged Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo to head to Chelsea, as another Red Devils legend feels the midfielder is being “f***ed up.”",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has been told that he was “absolutely terrible” vs Wolves even though he scored a brace in his side’s 4-1 victory.",
      "The real reason why Amorim continues to snub Mainoo at Man Utd has been revealed and “if it wasn’t so sad it would be laughable”.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could be set for a significant windfall as an ‘offer’ has been submitted for Marseille forward Mason Greenwood."

      "Manchester United are ‘moving in the right direction,’ says one fan. But another is ‘furious’ with the Wolves win and one still wants Ruben Amorim gone.",
      "There is a split among Manchester United supporters, and more thoughts on Mo Salah.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com",
      "Long long term reader and very occasional mailbox contributor.",
      "I wanted to write in after the West Ham game but of course we went on to draw that, so I had to wait for the waves of negativity and knee jerking to pass. So here it goes after just beating Wolves (no understatement in saying one of the worst teams in premier league history).",
      "We are 15 games in and Manchester United are currently 6th in the league, just outside CL places albeit at the head of the very bunched mid table. We could easily drop back to 10th or worse over the festive season given three of our best performers are off to AFCON shortly. We’ve been infuriatingly inconsistent and had some horror show performances and results.",
      "Our new signings all look promising in their own way. Mbeumo is a ready made premier league grade performer. Cunha feels like he should have done more by now, but you know the quality is there, as is the attitude (more on that later). Sesko offers more that he gets credit for and I’ve no doubt he will be a success for the long term whilst Lemmens provides a semblance of competency and calmness in goal which is more than we could have wished for in years.",
      "In parallel we’ve shipped out a lot of the dross and replaced players with disproportionate egos with players who at least look like they want to fight for the shirt all while lowering the wage bill as well as the average age of the squad (again – attitude, it’s everything in life).",
      "Our training facilities have been rebuilt and we are clearly doing “a lot of the right things” by installing the right people in the right roles. Apparently we’re evening taking data analysis seriously, just a decade or so late.",
      "Who knows what kind of a dumpster fire INEOS rook over when they first walked, but I’m willing to bet it was chaotic, shambolic and full of egos in the dressing room. Am I saying they’ve got every decision right? Hell no. But it takes time to turn a cruiseliner around. Did anyone think we’d seriously challenge for the league this year? If you did, you’re delusional. Have the Grimsby, Everton and West Ham setbacks been highly frustrating? F**k ya. But that’s no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater.",
      "Settle down folks. Enjoy the journey. We’re moving in the right direction but it’s not linear. There will be setbacks. There will be poor performances. But overall, there will be progress. Surely you can feel that? Can’t you feel the reduction in chaos?",
      "Trust the process. Ah sh*t.\nBrian C. PS: Do check the PL table one year after Arteta took over at Arsenal for perspective (that’d be December 20th, 2020).",
      "",
      "Interesting game yesterday, worth staying up for in the end. However it actually served to highlight just how far away this team is from champions league mentality.",
      "A situation like that, where you have an opponent so demoralised and wretched comes around once every few seasons. It’s a golden chance to rack up some serious goal difference. One looks at the league table will tell you that goal difference will be critical this season.",
      "Instead, United got the game won and just coasted to the end. No urgency, no realisation of the opportunity that was still there. When the assistant signaled 9 minutes to go, you would expect a surge to try and really make the most of it but it just fizzled out.",
      "It’s this attitude that tells us United are not ready to actually go for it. They are coasting by default, and they have talented players so that will get you to a certain point. That internal switch has not flipped to activate the ruthlessness and determination needed to compete at the highest level. You need to relentlessly pursue every edge to succeed. At 4-1 against that Wolves team you should be furious that you conceded one and didn’t score more.  Until they figure that out, they will always remain an inconsistent nearly team.\nAkillies",
      "",
      "Just watching United against one of, if not the, statistically worst performing teams to grace the Premier League. And it’s been reasonably even, a bit scrappy. United somehow keep leaving spaces wide in their own box despite having 5 defenders, and also conspire to have no actual goal-threatening options when attacking from out wide.",
      "And of course placing Casemiro with Bruno in the middle means little-to-no control centrally. The system makes the absolute worst use of this group of players. And it’s simply proven. Amorim’s win percentage isn’t bad for a Manchester United manager – it’s bad for a relegation candidate manager. It should be utterly unimaginable that a club with United’s ambition would persist with someone this bad. And yet. Here we are, with many pundits saying no matter what Amorim has til the end of the season. My point is simply: why?",
      "Every other club in our league would have fired him by now. What is it that INEOS, or the board, or United fans believe makes this club different? He was a good hire, with a good profile, excellent at the media but he was hired to do one thing: win football matches. And he’s undeniably a huge failure. So why can’t we just be like literally every other club and try someone else?\nRyan, Bermuda (the United way is youth and risk taking, not long tenure of managers)",

      "",
      "I’m really intrigued to know why the first handball in the penalty area was not a penalty yet the second almost identical incident was a clear and obvious error?",

      "",
      "It’s hilarious for me to see This Means More Football Club implode in this fashion. But in all seriousness, all Jamie Carragher did with his riposte – staged for TV in the same fashion he criticized Salah for, I might add – was make things even worse for “his club”.  In my opinion.",
      "Last I checked – the existence of Salah in a Liverpool shirt has brought the first ever and a second PL for Liverpool (after a 30 year wait that engulfs Carra’s career – but, yes, this is “his” club) and a Champions League (and multiple other opportunities to add more).  Other players were necessary for this to happen (list your VVDs, Manes, Hendos, Wijnaldums, Firminos, Trents, Robbos, and, yes, Origis here) but does this not begin and end with Salah?",
      "The rise of Liverpool predates Alisson and Van Dijk – it was Salah who began to uplift the club from also-ran, Gerrard-slipping bottlers to the status they have now with his insane 17-18 season. Without him the team that was built around him never happens. Klopp knew what he had and acted accordingly.",
      "But I somewhat digress – the point is this: what has Salah said that literally every supporter in the media, on Twitter, in this mailbox or in private hasn’t said?",
      "Slot is sh*tting the bed – why should Salah watch KONATE (????) and Gakpo and even MacAllister (who while still not playing well has finally stopped being completely sh*t, at least, fair f***s) play every week regardless yet he – who won both POTY awards *checks notes* 6 months ago – has to watch them? Because Slot thinks he knows what he’s doing when he hasn’t shown an inkling of how to arrest this slide? Why are the results – the same way they were happening before – stil happening when Salah’s off the pitch?",
      "Is it Salah’s fault that Slot won’t start Chiesa instead of Gakpo on the left? Or Rio. Or literally anyone else from time to time, at least?",
      "Is it Salah’s fault that the form of Konate and VVD leave you thinking they are angling for a step down to a Championship team?",
      "Is it Mo’s fault the midfield is as formidable as soggy bread?",
      "Is it Salah’s fault that Slot keeps benching Liverpools best player so far this season (Ekitike) to get in the more expensive guy who clearly isn’t up to match fitness?",
      "No, it’s not. And all Salah did – in not the best way, admittedly – was question why the clearly overall best and most impactful player in the squad (Salah, duh) was being benched by a manager who is failing to get the basics right.",
      "Don’t get side tracked by Mo talking about what he’s done for the club because he clearly wouldn’t care about being on the bench if Liverpool were, you know,  not continuing to play like shite while he is unable to do anything about it. Think about it – what did Salah say that Carragher wasn’t lamenting about on that candid CBS camera that caught him during the PSV match? Was Carra not saying to someone in the phone that Slot continuing to start Konate was a sackable offense?",
      "All Salah did was do what every other Liverpool supporter doesn’t have the power to do and put these issues – because they are issues – front and center in front of everyone but particularly the board of his club. And it’s not like he’s stupid enough to think his words wouldn’t cause a big deal – it’s obviously why he did what he did in the fashion that he did it in.",
      "Knowing he could get crucified – he stuck his neck out for what he thinks is best for the club. Which is moving on from this manager which, in turn, is something many, many Liverpool fans including Carra himself has suggested might be the way forward. For a large contingent of Liverpool supporters who don’t think this manager has what it takes – he spoke for them.",
      "And he’s getting slayed for it like this? It’s ridiculous and goes to show how players just sometimes can’t say anything without being judged to the highest of extremes.",
      "And he should give the finger to the board – they just spent 400 million to not improve the team! What is everyone on about?\nMAW, LA Gooner (Carra insinuating he was a nobody and Liverpool made him is absurd. He came in and promptly broke the PL single season goal record – how’s Isak for 80 million more doing in this regard, btw – and immediately made them contenders for a trophy they had yet to win going back 25 years. Absurd.)",
      "",
      "I see that FIFA has introduced standard water breaks for each game at next year’s World Cup, under the banner of player welfare. The breaks will take place regardless of the time the game is played and the temperature, so it definitely seems more like a chance to run more ads rather than player safety. After all, if player safety was a real driver, why not have it in a country where extreme temperatures isn’t a concern?",
      "This is all pretty much what we expected as FIFA marches more and more towards money over sporting endeavour. After the spectacle of the draw/peace prize giving, a lot of people on here wrote about boycotts and Infantino being the worst. I agree that he is the worst but I can’t ever see him being deposed from his current position as he has the overwhelming support of the majority of the federations. I remember back in the 90’s it was as easy for a European team to qualify for the World Cup as the Euros, such was the relative strength of the European countries and the way the competition was set up to favour the strongest teams qualification. As the years passed and competition numbers expanded the tournament became more inclusive but the standard probably dropped overall. This was probably unwelcome from a European and South American perspective, but very welcome in the rest of the world (where most of the people live).",
      "The highest level of football is now the Champions League (itself a slave to money/broadcasters and the big teams), but the World Cup is where kids fall in love with football. To play Devil’s Advocate, the watering down of the quality of the World Cup is good for football in general, as it will draw more and more people into the game from more and more countries. Seeing people who look like you play in the World Cup is a big deal.",
      "I agree that the price for it is hard to stomach, ad breaks in the middle, glad handing autocrats, dead rubber group games, Saturday evening ITV level entertainment for the draw, opening ceremony and pre-Final (can someone tell UEFA as well that no one wants to see the pre-Champions League Final ‘entertainment’), and venue selection made based on maximum revenue. You can boycott if you like, and I certainly will watch a much lower portion of games this time round, but we are a drop in the ocean from a commercial aspect, so don’t expect it to change much\nDerek from Dundalk",
      "Even dire Derby – the Premier League’s worst ever – had four more points than these wretched Wolves at the same stage of the season. It looks so bleak…",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Alisson has dropped off a cliff along with some of his Liverpool teammates; he’s no Dean Henderson, that’s for sure.",
      "Jamie Carragher is hailed for his Mo Salah response, but ‘this is the sort of batsh*t, amped up paranoia that leads others to ridicule the Liverpool fanbase.",
      "Mo Salah should consider the lot of these 10 poor sods before having another rant about only starting 12 Premier League games for Liverpool this season.",

      "Were Ruben Amorim not United manager, Mainoo might be one of their best players by now. He was important when he broke through as a teenager, but in his third season, the 20-year-old has played just 273 minutes in all competitions.",
      "He’s made no starts in the league, though Amorim stresses the midfielder is “seen as a starter.”",
      "United legend Scholes feels Mainoo is likely doing enough to be starting games, and given his credentials, alongside the fact the Red Devils aren’t bossing sides every week, he probably should be.",
      "He said on The Good, The Bad & The Football: “Ruben Amorim has said Kobbie Mainoo is a starter… every appearance he’s made in the Premier League has been as a sub. Things like that wind me up.",
      "“I wouldn’t mind if he was in a good team and they were winning every week and keeping possession but they’re rubbish.",
      "“Kobbie is a 20-year-old kid and he’s not playing, he’s going to have to leave. Do you know what will happen now? Amorim will bring him into a game and he won’t be great but that’s because he needs regular games.",
      "“Fair enough, as a manager sometimes you just don’t fancy a player. But look at what he’s already done – scored the winner in an FA Cup final, played every game in the Euros.",
      "“I bet he takes the p*** out of Casemiro every single day in training and is brilliant. I don’t know why the club are letting Amorim treat a homegrown talent like that.”",
      "Fellow United legend Butt feels there’s a chance that Mainoo leaves and becomes a Scott McTominay type of player, immediately having big success wherever he lands.",
      "“The Kobbie one is an absolute joke. I went to the West Ham game [a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford] and it was an absolute s***show. It was a terrible, boring game,” he said.",
      "“The player to bring on to change the game, in my opinion, was Kobbie Mainoo – but he didn’t get on the pitch. He’ll be another homegrown player who leaves and is a superstar somewhere else.",
      "“If Mainoo was playing for another Premier League club, United go and buy him for £70m or £80m. Now we’re going to sell him and he’ll be a superstar elsewhere like McTominay, [Anthony] Elanga, [Dean] Henderson – we can mention loads of them.”",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Manchester United and Newcastle were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to February 2 with three more games each.",
      "Arsenal were among seven teams to only have one more match chosen.",
      "=1st) Aston Villa and Manchester United (21 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £18.5m in 2024/25",

      "Scholes and fellow United legend Butt feel Mainoo is not being given a fair crack and a move to Chelsea should be taken if it comes around.",
      "Butt said on The Good, The Bad & The Football: “We’re getting rid of players who love the football club, it’s mind-boggling. I get the [Alejandro] Garnacho one because his attitude and behaviour was terrible but you don’t hear that about Kobbie.",

      "Chelsea are indeed one of the clubs who have been linked with Mainoo in recent times. A report surfaced of late which suggested there are now 12 clubs in the hunt for his signature on loan in January.",

      "“He looked absolutely terrible, but there you are.”",
      "He added: “I’ll tell you what I did notice as well, Martinez. He came on, he went into the middle, and you could see him ushering people. When he got on the ball, he was ushering them forward.",
      "“Step forward, he was telling them, he was organising them. He was getting around them, he was doing that when he came on. He’s been out there, he’s only had a few minutes of football, but he’s in his genes to do that. He is a leader.",
      "‘You don’t need an arm band to be a leader, just somebody who wants more from other people. And that’s what he’s done.",
      "‘Fernandes doesn’t do that, he doesn’t give you that. He’s an armband captain because he’s seen as United’s most important player.’",

      "“He’s such a top player. I actually think Bruno’s underrated.",

From 32, 38 and 37 Premier League appearances his numbers collapsed to 17 last season as a knee injury took him out of the side for three months. Although he did manage to force his way back in by the end of the season, further summer recruitment has left him fighting an even tougher battle for Premier League minutes in a squad so ludicrously deep that it can withstand any injury crisis apart from an Arsenal injury crisis. Arsenal injury crises, of course, being very much the M&S of injury crises.",

      "The Dutchman didn’t exactly hit the ground running, it would be fair to say, but it’s become increasingly obvious – if it wasn’t already – that he simply wasn’t the man Thomas Frank wanted. And there has appeared a certain stubbornness in how long Frank kept him out of the team during a month when Spurs’ football was often moribund beyond belief and they won not one single game.",
      "It’s one thing to find yourself out of a team as a big-money signing because someone else is doing your job better than you’ve been doing it. It’s quite another to find yourself out of the Spurs team as a big-money signing because the manager has decided he’d rather have literally nobody doing your job than you.",
      "Frank finally relented for the home game with Brentford and was rewarded with a man-of-the-match display featuring a goal and an assist as tangible contributions to a more general vibe of watching Spurs not making you want to claw your own eyeballs out with a rusty spoon just so you don’t have to watch any more of it.",

      "Poor sod. Never had Elliott’s stock been higher than this summer after his swashbuckling starring role as England U21s defended their European title. Elliott scored four goals in the three knockout games against Spain, Netherlands and Germany and had never looked more ready to graduate from the bit-part Premier League player he had become at Liverpool to a proper show-runner.",
      "That always felt like it would need a move, but he made entirely the wrong one. Not because he went to a bad club – quite the opposite – but because he went to one where he just clearly wasn’t wanted by the manager.",
      "Easy to forget now they’re swanning around in a title race, but Aston Villa had a difficult summer on the back of failing to qualify for the Champions League. Bringing Elliott in on loan was one of the late moves designed more to appease restless fans than for any real football purpose.",
      "It became very clear very quickly that this certainly wasn’t a transfer Unai Emery sanctioned. His one Premier League start came back in September; he didn’t reappear for the second half, spent the next two games on the bench and hasn’t been in a matchday squad since.",
      "Given that when Elliott was last on the pitch for Villa it was their sixth game of the season, they were drawing 1-1 with Fulham and hadn’t won a game all season and in his absence they have gone on to win that game and eight of the subsequent nine, he can’t really complain that Emery has got this badly wrong.",
      "But he can be forgiven for wondering quite how what should have been a breakthrough season now looks sure to be a complete waste at the worst possible time for his career. And the real salt in the wound is that having played one poxy Premier League minute for Liverpool before joining Villa there isn’t even the prospect of trying again somewhere else in January.",
      "",
      "Perhaps the most justified fume of the lot, this one. Trafford left City in pursuit of first-team football, found it at Burnley and did brilliantly well in a team that cruised back into the Premier League on the back of a miserly defence.",
      "He appeared set to join Newcastle in the summer, before Man City exercised a matching clause from the deal that took him to Turf Moor to bring him home. This appeared initially to be a right result for Trafford, turning his Burnley move into a de facto loan before heading back to his parent club to become first-choice.",
      "And he was, for a couple of games. He wasn’t, in fairness, flawless in those games and played a memorable part in extending Man City’s bafflingly poor record against Tottenham. But to see City respond to that by signing possibly the best goalkeeper in the world is a bit of a kick in the teeth.",
      "Trafford is now thought to be eyeing up a January departure, and his ultimate punishment for having a slightly bad game against Spurs could yet end up being having to go and play for Spurs. Just seems really harsh.",
      "There is one ray of light for Trafford at City, though. One possible and unexpected route back into the starting XI for a game at least, with Gianluigi Donnarumma quite magnificently on course to become the first Premier League goalkeeper ever to get suspended for accumulated bookings after somehow managing to collect four of the buggers in his first 12 Premier League appearances.",
      "",
      "If there is a Liverpool player to have played a vital role in so much of their recent success who has a legitimate reason to grumble at the manner in which he’s found himself sidelined, then it’s surely Robertson given the way Milos Kerkez has been stinking up the left-back spot for so much of the season.",
      "Robertson has had only three starts for Liverpool this season and it’s fair to say they’re a mixed bag because in there we’ve got the desperate 3-0 surrender at Man City and the p*ss-poor 1-1 draw against Sunderland.",
      "But the only Premier League game all season in which Robertson has played a full 90 minutes? Last month’s 2-0 win over Aston Villa, a result which can compellingly be described as Liverpool’s only actually impressive one against a proper side in the Premier League since September.",
      "Just don’t look too closely at who scored Liverpool’s opening goal that day, because otherwise the whole premise of this feature might start to crumble, and that wouldn’t do at all.",
      "",
      "Missed the opening game of the season against Newcastle while still a Villa player through suspension, and had to wait until November to make his first start in a Newcastle midfield that is tough to break into.",
      "Pro tip: if you have to wait four months for your first Premier League start at a new club, we strongly advise not making that start a limp 3-1 defeat at Brentford. Especially when that costs you your place for the next couple of games where your team beat Man City and Everton.",
      "Watching the chaos of the 2-2 draw against Spurs from the bench having failed to get a start even with Bruno Guimaraes rested from the starting XI probably worked out for the best, and he did at last complete a full 90 minutes for his new club in what became an unnecessarily fraught 2-1 win over 10-man Burnley, mainly because of his own late handball. A win’s a win, we suppose.",
      "",
      "If we’re honest, we’d clean forgotten he was even still at Everton. But he was a regular starter last season before and after a knee injury that sidelined him for four months, and barely missed a Premier League game for the Toffees in the two seasons before that.",
      "But the problem for McNeil is really that one of memorability. It took only a few months of being reduced to brief substitute cameos for us to forget about him almost entirely. Do you know who you don’t forget about quite so easily? Jack Grealish.",
      "",
      "Merely the latest recipient of the West Ham big-money striker curse, and it would be entirely fair to say he has pulled up only the tiniest imaginable number of trees since arriving at the London Stadium last summer.",
      "But given how sh*tbone awful West Ham have so often been this season, any established Germany international striker – even one as misfiring as Fullkrug – is entitled to feel a little bit aggrieved to find himself discarded to the bench.",
      "Fullkrug is one of many on this list where, sure, a large slice of personal responsibility is necessary, but so is a lot of time spent on a lot of substitute benches wondering just how it’s come to this.",
      "",
      "Imagine not being able to get a game for f*cking Wolves, for goodness’ sake. Guess it might be a blessing, in a way.",
      "Manchester United are ‘moving in the right direction,’ says one fan. But another is ‘furious’ with the Wolves win and one still wants Ruben Amorim gone.",

      "It’s unsustainable and the limited pressure United applied in a first half which saw them record more shots (14) than any away game since 2003/2004 – save for a game against Everton in 2008 (15) when Cristiano Ronaldo, Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney were their front three – went up a couple of notches in the second half, perhaps after some strong half-time words from Amorim at them drawing with this football team,  as United found their attacking rhythm.",
      "Mount was superb in response to Roy Keane branding him a “schoolboy” for having no “presence” off the bench against West Ham last time out.",
      "Creator-in-chief Bruno Fernandes largely took a backseat as Mount combined his archetypal energy and work-rate with a near-perfect performance on the ball, zipping passes into teammates or in behind the Wolves defence for Cunha or Mbeumo to run onto. He’s always everywhere, but was doing everything, everywhere at Molineux in what was surely his best game for Manchester United.",
      "It’s also arguably one of few good ones in a Red Devils career blighted by injury, poor form and the comes-with-the-territory dip in performance almost all players to have made the move to Old Trafford have suffered in the last decade.",
      "“You go back to stats as an attacking player,” Keane said on Mount back in October. “At United, his stats when he’s played are really poor. It’s not as if you’re going, yeah I can see he’s getting a lot of assists, his stats are really poor.”",
      "He made it three goals in his last four Premier League starts here, with his strike coming between Mbeumo’s tap-in on the break and Fernandes’ penalty. And it was beautiful.",
      "Fernandes’ clipped pass over the Wolves defence was delightful and spoke to a burgeoning relationship building between him and Mount, as the former Chelsea man spotted his captain with time and space on the ball, made his dart in behind and volleyed the ball past Johnstone with ease and authority.",
      "It was a performance we’ve not seen from Mount since his heady days under Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea, when the playmaker played a starring role in the Blues winning the Champions League in 2021.",
      "And Tuchel, waiting for any excuse to call up a guy branded as something of a teacher’s pet in their time together at Stamford Bridge, won’t need too many more performances like this to grant him a spot in his World Cup squad despite the absurd competition for places in his position.",
      "“He said to me, there’s no guarantees, even though you played for me,” Mount said after Tuchel rang him to say why he wasn’t in the England squad in July. “But it gives you more, you want to push even more to be able to be back in the squad.”",
      "We can only dream of the degree with which teeth with be gnashed should Mount become Tuchel’s starting No.10 given the response to the England manager preferring Rogers over Bellingham. The overwhelmingly apathetic response to Mount playing for the Three Lions even during his absolute peak days at Chelsea suggests Gianni Infantino and his Donald Trump love-in wouldn’t then be the sole cause of World Cup boycotts.",
      "We and he are still a long way off that dream. This was just one game, against Wolves, who are terrible. But if Mount can reproduce this display and get himself into the groove he found under Tuchel at Chelsea, the pair may yet be reunited on the biggest football stage.",
      "Ruben Amorim picked out one Manchester United star for particular praise following his performance in the win against Wolves on Monday night.",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane hit out at his former club after their disappointing 1-1 home draw against West Ham United on Thursday night.",
      "Paul Merson has called on Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim to drop Mason Mount for their next Premier League match against Brighton over the weekend.",
      "Ji-sung Park is one of the Premier League’s great unsung heroes, but do Man Utd currently have the attacking quality to offset the limited goal contributions of his Old Trafford ...",
      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future.",
      "Pundit Paul Merson has revealed why he thinks one Manchester United star has flopped at Old Trafford, while Ruben Amorim has “underestimated” one thing."

      "I’ve seen a lot of people saying that such poor sides as Liverpool or Manchester United sitting within touching distance of the top six shows the poor quality of the league this season. And also that Arsenal are top by winning games from set-pieces and that Manchester City are over-reliant on Erling Haaland. I honestly don’t know what such precious people want. Have you bought the ‘elite’ rubbish the league has been selling for decades?",
      "It perfectly illustrates how a certain mindset has been inculcated into some fans when the league tries to make a virtue out of tedious predictability. What do you want – competition or dominance? Surely competition wins every time? Money bringing success has become the default; don’t you find that depressing? Can’t you enjoy the smallest temporary cracks in its hegemony?",
      "I’d love to see Villa win the league (they probably won’t) but let’s not pretend the current travails of some big clubs represent a change in the overall direction of travel. The richest clubs will assert their dominance sooner or later. I think some people actively dislike unpredictability. It’s like people who buy fast food because it’s always the same and predictably so. Homogeneity reduces everything to a facility or product without the dirty unpredictability of humanity.",
      "Leeds United’s 3-3 against Liverpool wasn’t an example of the weak league; it was just really enjoyable football.",
      "If you can’t enjoy that without making some overarching judgement about this mythical concept of ‘quality’, I pity you. Living life as a series of judgements on where everything is placed on a notional quality league table sounds very anal.",
      "That draw – was it quality? Why bother judging? It was just fun. It’s not an essay writing competition. You can resort to clinical facts, of course, as if we enjoy football for the logic and statistical conclusions rather than emotion. But surely the important thing, regardless of this supposed quality, is whether it’s actually enjoyable. I take enjoyment above any skill level you want to reference. Poetry stimulates your synapses in a way maths doesn’t.",
      "If a defender kicks it in off someone’s backside, that’s clearly more fun than a technically perfect 0-0 draw.",
      "Don’t worry, the same teams will be back hogging a lot of the talent and dominating soon enough. There hasn’t been a revolution. It’s more than likely that City, Arsenal or Chelsea will win the league; let us just enjoy a brief moment where sometimes we don’t know the result of a game before kick-off.",
      "Why do these people insist on the Freudian practice of trying to measure everything and everyone to arrive at a ‘satisfaction’ quotient? Is it a result of computer football where everything is presented as predictably good, average or poor, with a corresponding price? That’s not reality.",
      "The irony is, more typically, the Premier League is less regularly entertaining and more predictable than the other four major European leagues and certainly less entertaining than the Scottish Championship so enjoy this, almost certainly brief, period where results are unpredictable. Because history suggests it won’t last long.",
      "Stop mithering that a side isn’t good enough in your vague, imprecise assessment of ‘quality’ to be top six. If many of the sides are all bunched together and keep flying up the table and dropping back down, that’s a good thing. Yes it’s unusual and a break from what has become the norm, but the opposite of a sign of this league being poor. It makes it more compelling. Better.",
      "The companies, organisations and states who own top-flight football crave predictability and want to invest in a safe bet and use huge amounts of money to ensure it. The last thing they want is teams going up and down the league as it might harm their income stream. Don’t be like them. Their influence is already pernicious enough. Celebrate unpredictability because it won’t last long.",
      "Manchester United are ‘moving in the right direction,’ says one fan. But another is ‘furious’ with the Wolves win and one still wants Ruben Amorim gone.",
      "Even dire Derby – the Premier League’s worst ever – had four more points than these wretched Wolves at the same stage of the season. It looks so bleak…",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Alisson has dropped off a cliff along with some of his Liverpool teammates; he’s no Dean Henderson, that’s for sure.",
      "Jamie Carragher is hailed for his Mo Salah response, but ‘this is the sort of batsh*t, amped up paranoia that leads others to ridicule the Liverpool fanbase.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they now somehow find themselves within two points of Arsenal despite not really playing convincingly well for quite some time now.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs.",

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, though.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom five have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",

      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now, but a win at Wolves on Monday would be handy.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out, although defeat to Palace does leave Fulham closer than they would like to the relegation fight.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. After the harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week, he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and one that could have been even more convincing.",

      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, which have gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But, well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",

      "The Glazers are ‘pushing’ for Ruben Amorim to replaced by another manager at Man Utd but INEOS want to keep him on, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd picked up three wins in a row in October with hope that Amorim could turn their fortunes around after a nightmare first year at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils’ 1-1 draw against West Ham means they are now eighth in the Premier League with European qualification a must for Amorim this season.",
      "The Glazer family handed Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS the reigns of the football operation when the British businessman bought 27.7 per cent of the club in February 2024.",
      "And now a reliable X account made up of ‘five elite reporters’ and 686k followers insists that the Glazers aren’t happy and want Man Utd boss Amorim replaced.",
      "It is understood that INEOS and Ratcliffe want to show Amorim more patience but the Portuguese head coach’s impact on the club’s ‘business model’ has seen the Glazers looking to sack him.",
      "READ: Man Utd fans left incensed by ‘muppet’ Amorim: ‘Get rid before he sells Mainoo’",

      "‘However, they believe they need to step in regarding the manager’s future. A high level meeting is on the horizon, where they’ll need to resolve their differences and decide the future direction of the club. It’s a critical moment for Manchester United, and the pressure is mounting from the fans.’",
      "Amorim’s handling of Kobbie Mainoo has been questioned by Paul Scholes and others with former Man Utd defender Paul Parker claiming the England international must be “furious” with him.",
      "Parker told MyBettingSites: “I don’t think he is leaving because I don’t think the club can afford to let him go, but if he never gets minutes, he has to leave for his own sake. He must be feeling horrible at the moment, because he knows the manager has taken away his opportunity to go to the World Cup. He must be furious at Amorim. He has to be. There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned.”",
      "“It would be a very bad story for the club if he were to leave. Just look at McTominay. I don’t think he would have made a massive difference at Man United at this moment in time, but you can’t have another one of those stories coming out. It would be terrible if Mainoo leaves and all of a sudden does very well, because then everyone will question Amorim and the club.”",
      "“He is a player and a person I hope the best for. He is a wonderful young lad and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.”",
      "Manchester United are ‘moving in the right direction,’ says one fan. But another is ‘furious’ with the Wolves win and one still wants Ruben Amorim gone.",

      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is prepared to look for a loan move away from Old Trafford in January as he seeks regular minutes, according to reports.",
      "The England international has not started in the Premier League for Man Utd this term with Ruben Amorim preferring other players in midfield.",
      "Mainoo, who has been linked with a loan move to Napoli, has made nine appearances off the substitutes’ bench but his only start in all competitions came as Man Utd were knocked out of the League Cup on penalties by Grimsby Town earlier this year.",
      "Amorim announced publicly that Mainoo would be competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth this season, leading to the Man Utd midfielder looking for a way out before the summer transfer deadline.",
      "However, Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox managed to persuade Mainoo to fight for his place in Amorim’s side.",
      "There has been no progress on him getting minutes under Amorim and now The Athletic insists that Mainoo is ‘ready to seek a loan move away from Manchester United in January after becoming deeply frustrated about his lack of minutes’.",
      "READ: Man Utd fans left incensed by ‘muppet’ Amorim: ‘Get rid before he sells Mainoo’",
      "After being an unused subsitute in their 1-1 draw against West Ham on Thursday night, Mainoo seems to have made up his mind but The Athletic adds: ‘United are, however, expected to wait until after the African Cup of Nations finishes in the middle of the winter window to make a decision on Mainoo, given the uncertainty of how the tournament will impact Cameroon’s Bryan Mbeumo and the Ivory Coast’s Amad.’",
      "When asked on Thursday if he could understand why Mainoo’s lack of football was a talking point, Amorim replied: “Of course I understand. My job is to answer but I am trying to answer always the same thing. And you ask me always the same thing.",
      "“I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England, but that doesn’t mean I need to put Kobbie (on) when I feel I shouldn’t put Kobbie (on).”",
      "Amorim added: “I see it and I just want to win. I just put the players. I don’t look who it is, I don’t care about that, I just try to put the best players on the pitch.",
      "“You have (Manuel) Ugarte that played two games, one of them, (Casemiro) was out. Bruno (Fernandes) is always fit, he’s the guy that is doing (Mainoo’s) position so maybe it has to do with that.”",
      "When asked if Mainoo’s prospects of getting into the starting XI would be improved when players depart for the Africa Cup of Nations later this month, Amorim said: “I don’t know. It’s the same question. I don’t know what is going to happen. It depends.",
      "“If I see in the training it is the best thing, I will put (him in). That is the only way I know how to respond to that.”",
      "Shea Lacey has been in Amorim’s last three squads but not come off the bench and when put to him whether he trusts the Man Utd academy players, Amorim continued: “Why? (I don’t pick) any players? We have (only) Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“When Bryan (Mbeumo) is not there, I put Amad because I have other wing backs to play and sometimes it’s hard. You are asking me why don’t I put Lacey to play when I have other guys that are international and they are also on the bench.",
      "“I try to put the best prepared guys for this moment of the club and try to win a game, that is the only thing guys.”",
      "Tottenham star James Maddison has backed Kobbie Mainoo to “get back to a really high level” amid his struggle for minutes at Manchester United.",

      "Paul Scholes feels Kobbie Mainoo likely “takes the p***” out of Casemiro in training yet isn’t picked for Manchester United, as he and Nicky Butt are scared he’ll replicate Scott ...",
      "Paul Scholes has urged Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo to head to Chelsea, as another Red Devils legend feels the midfielder is being “f***ed up.”",
      "The real reason why Amorim continues to snub Mainoo at Man Utd has been revealed and “if it wasn’t so sad it would be laughable”.",

      "Sources in Greece indicate that Olympiacos are resigned to losing their academy product within the next 18 months. And while the club have no desire to sell their prized asset mid-season, they are bracing themselves for formal approaches as early as the January transfer window for a player who first flagged up for United by former sporting director Dan Ashworth.",

      "The England international is yet to start a Premier League game under Ruben Amorim this season with the England international failing to get on the pitch as the Red Devils drew 1-1 against West Ham on Thursday night.",
      "Mainoo has been afforded one start in the League Cup as Man Utd were knocked out of the competitions by League Two Grimsby Town earlier this year.",
      "The Red Devils midfielder attempted to leave on loan towards the end of the summer transfer window when Amorim made it clear, in public, that Mainoo was fighting captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth.",
      "Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox eventually convinced Mainoo to remain at the club and fight for his place but there are rumours that the midfielder wants regular football to force his way into Thomas Tuchel’s thinking ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",

      "READ: Man Utd fans left incensed by ‘muppet’ Amorim: ‘Get rid before he sells Mainoo’",
      "When asked about Mainoo, Amorim said last Friday: “I see him as a starter like the other players. I just have to make a choice and then in the end, it’s not been Kobbie.",
      "“In the future, I don’t know. Again, I always think the same thing with Casemiro. [He] was not playing and then he plays. I just want to win games. I don’t care who is playing.”",

The English are only considering a temporary transfer, as is the player, seeking playing time so as not to miss out on the World Cup showcase.

      "Rob Edwards remains without a point from his four games in charge, with Wolves remaining 13 points from safety, adrift at the foot of the table. Ruben Amorim's team are into the top six after back-to-back Premier League away wins for the first time.",
      "Wolves: Johnstone (6), Hoever (4), Mosquera (5), Agbadou (5), Toti (5), Moller Wolfe (6), Andre (5), Krejci (5), Bellegarde (7), Arias (4), Strand Larsen (4).\n\n\nSubs: Lopez (6), Arokodare (6), Mane (6), H Bueno (6), Tchatchoua (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (6), Mazraoui (7), Heaven (7), Shaw (7), Amad (8), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (9), Dalot (7), Mbeumo (7), Mount (7), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Martinez (6), Yoro (6), Mainoo (6),  Dorgu (n/a), Zirkzee (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Many Wolves supporters missed the first 15 minutes of the match as they protested about the club's ownership, although they did not miss much from a Wolves side who looked bereft of quality and confidence early on, United cutting through with ease.",
      "Diogo Dalot wasted a one-on-one, while Sam Johnstone also saved from Mbeumo before Casemiro robbed a dallying Andre and the ball was worked to Fernandes who had time to slip over and still get to his feet to sneak the ball past the goalkeeper.",
      "Toti Gomes had to clear off the line from Matheus Cunha, returning to face his former club, and at that stage Wolves looked there for the taking. But as has often been the case under Amorim, United surrendered the initiative, allowing the bottom club back in.",
      "The home side sensed it, Ki-Jana Hoever's cross finding David Moller Wolfe who put the ball back into the box for Bellegarde, Wolves' best player before going off injured, to force home smartly. The first goal of Edwards' reign coming in his fourth game in charge.",
      "But more hapless defending from Wolves allowed United to restore their lead early in the second half, Dalot again racing through down the left channel before squaring for Mbeumo to slot into the net with Johnstone stranded for his first goal in exactly a month.",
      "A moment of quality from Fernandes saw him dink the ball into the path of Mount for the third goal before Yerson Mosquera was adjudged to have handballed in the area, allowing Fernandes to smash in his second from the spot. Wolves were well beaten.",
      "Their fate appears sealed already even in December.",
      "What lies ahead for Amorim's United this season remains a mystery.",
      "Wolves equalled their longest-ever losing streak in league history, also losing eight in a row between December 1981 and February 1982.\n\n\nWolves’ haul of only two points in the Premier League this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers, level with Sheffield United in the Premier League in 2020-21, Southport in 1975-76 in the Fourth Division and Barrow and Newport County in 1970-71 in the Fourth Division.",
      "Fellow playmaker James Maddison praised Fernandes in the Monday Night Football studio. \"Bruno Fernandes is underrated for the consistency he shows regularly,\" said the Tottenham player. \"Every time he is on the ball, he can just see it all.\"",
      "Fernandes showed that with his assist for Mount's goal. He punished Wolves and now has 15 goal involvements in his last 14 Premier League games for Manchester United against sides starting the day in the relegation zone - six goals and nine assists.",
      "\"I thought some of the combinations going forward were crisp, were sharp and that's what we can do.",
      "\"We know we can do that. It's about us creating as many chances as we can as forward players and trying to get on the scoresheet. I thought going forward we were solid, and as a defence it's about defending as a team and not letting them have any chances to get back into the game.\"",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",

      "Manchester United blew the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League on Thursday when West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford; Roy Keane slammed a 'frightened' performance and questioned the standards of the home side after conceding again from a corner",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 07:27, UK",
      "Roy Keane accused Manchester United of being too \"frightened\" to see out victory over West Ham after blowing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League, and called the performance \"desperate\".",
      "West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford when Soungoutou Magassa's 83rd-minute equaliser cancelled out Diogo Dalot's opening goal.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have only taken 27 points from 20 games at Old Trafford, and only managed one win from their last five in the league - drawing three of those, despite being ahead in each.",
      "\"After they get the goal, you are playing against a team in the bottom three, they take their foot off the gas,\" said Keane. \"Take nothing away from West Ham and they just about deserved the equaliser.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappoint. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"Same old problems. The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group of players? I've watched the games closely, the lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team. There is expectation at this club, you have to deal with that.\"",
      "Keane also questioned the standards of the home side after they switched off from a set-piece to concede the leveller. Since the start of last season, only West Ham themselves (17) have conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (15).",
      "\"The reason you are playing for Manchester United is that you deal with these situations,\" Keane added.",
      "\"If they are anxious, you worry why they are playing for Manchester United and what they are fearful of. Fearful of West Ham, why?\"",
      "\"I don't get it, I don't get the lack of urgency, and the lack of intensity. I don't get the slow play. I don't get the lack of risk in the game.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he's not going back into the changing room saying 'guys, play slowly tonight'. He's saying 'let's get the ball moving quicker, let's run forward, let's play with real threat and vigour'.",
      "\"It doesn't transpire out on the pitch, so I don't know, why does that happen? I've got no understanding.",
      "\"I don't see the actual appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game, and everything you've got, and throw it forward and take risks. They're showing us what they are, the seventh, eighth or ninth team in the league.\"",
      "Defender Diogo Dalot said his side became \"anxious\" after opening the scoring at Old Trafford, and must look at themselves after squandering another lead.",
      "\"We cannot get as anxious as we get. We were a bit more sloppy with the ball in possession. Obviously disappointed with the draw, we had the game there.",
      "\"It's a solution we need to find. In the end, we have to look to ourselves. It's more our fault.\"",
      "It was established far further back than Thursday night that Manchester United lack resolve under pressure. Diogo Dalot says his team-mates are hindered by anxiety. Really, it's just about concentration levels.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have not registered a clean sheet in seven games - since early October. They establish a foothold in games and then inevitably hand it back. They win a game and then suffer a setback in the next. There is no continuity here.",
      "United dominated every attacking metric against inferior West Ham, creating higher xG, landing more shots on target and generating three big chances - two of those were missed. They had 42 touches in the opposition box. That's a staggeringly high amount if the yield is only one goal.",
      "Ultimately, this United team have very little conviction. Amorim bemoaned a lack of second-half control post-match and blamed \"second ball losses\". If you don't compete, or can't compete, for a whole 90 minutes that is what will happen.",

      "The final will be held in Rabat almost a month later on January 18, meaning it could be a long Christmas and New Year period for some Premier League sides without a number of key players",

      "Sunderland might have given almost a third of their playing minutes to African players but given all of their three attacking signings have struggled for minutes, they find themselves well down the list of goals and assists across the Premier League this season.",
      "Instead, Fulham lead the way on that front, not least after Samuel Chukwueze's double and Alex Iwobi's finish in their pulsating 5-4 defeat to Man City.",
      "Individually, no African player has contributed more to his side's attacking output than Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, piquing further interest from Premier League suitors ahead of a potential January transfer - when a new release clause will come into being, albeit only briefly.",
      "Whether he stays or goes, for the moment Bournemouth will be happy to keep their flying forward at the Vitality Stadium for the next month, with Ghana finishing bottom of their qualifying group and missing out on AFCON for the first time since 2004.",
