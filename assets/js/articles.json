      "Liverpool and Manchester United are set to reignite their rivalry on Sunday. While United wing-back Tyrell Malacia most likely won't be involved in the clash, he is one United player that Reds boss Arne Slot previously warned for being \"arrogant.\"",
      "The Dutchman knows the full-back well from their time together at Feyenoord before Slot's switch to Liverpool and the latter's move to Old Trafford in 2022. However, Slot had sent Malacia a grave warning about a particular aspect of his game.",
      "While Slot praised Malacia for operating as a \"driving force\" he also called out his tendency to be too casual on the ball. \"When we're behind he is typically the player to try and force the issue, or to ignite a spark with a run or a tackle,\" Slot told Dutch outlet Bleed Orange.",
      "\"[But] I do see him taunt opponents a bit too much.\" He continued: \"He almost shows too much of the ball, to get them to bite. At times, it's too much. He looks a bit complacent, arrogant even, at times. I talk to him about that.\"",
      "Malacia played under Slot for three seasons before joining the Red Devils in July 2022 for £13million. However, the defender's journey at United has been fraught with challenges, including a string of injuries. He spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "While the Dutchman has returned to first-team training this season, he is yet to feature this season after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Malacia was even part of United's notorious 'bomb squad', the term that was coined for a group of United stars who were exiled by Amorim at the start of pre-season. However, he failed to seek a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Liverpool will head into Sunday's clash with United off the back of three defeats in a row. However, the Premier League champions will be coming up against a United team, who despite their recent woes, have won three of their last five games in the Premier League.",
      "Slot's team beat United 3-0 away last season but struggled to a draw at Anfield in the return fixture. Yet the Dutchman is confident his team can turn a corner on Sunday at the expense of their arch rivals.",
      "\"I look forward to every single Premier League game but maybe even more towards the United one, because I know how special it is and I've experienced last season how special a game it is,\" Slot said in a pre-match press conference.",
      "\"We know that it's probably the game that's been watched the most all over the world. It's special to be part of it but in the end it's also a game where we have to be at our best, because United, in my opinion, has had a better start of the season than maybe the league table is showing.\"",
      "United produced one of their better performances under Amorim at Anfield last season. The Red Devils dug out a hard-fought 2-2 draw, but squandered a number of chances to win the tie late on.",
      "Speaking of his side's promising showing last season, Amorim told a press conference this week: “Yeah, I remember it, we played well, it was a draw.",
      "\"I was really upset in the end of the game because we proved, on that day, that we can compete against any opponents. I know that it's special for our club. I know that they are fighting all the time for the titles, the number of titles. I know what it means to the fans, but again, it's one game that we need to prove again, that we are playing better\"",

      "Barcelona manager Hansi Flick has dismissed speculation that Marcus Rashford received harsher treatment than Lamine Yamal over disciplinary matters. Spanish media reports suggested club hierarchy 'forced' Flick to select Yamal for the Champions League loss to Paris Saint-Germain earlier this month, despite the youngster turning up late to a team meeting.",
      "Rashford was, meanwhile, benched for September's La Liga clash with Getafe for an identical breach of protocol. Claims emerged that Yamal's handling represented 'double standards'.",
      "But Flick has firmly rejected the accusations and maintained that he holds full authority over discipline. \"I'd like to know where you're getting that rumour from,\" he said.",
      "\"It's b*******. It's not true. At this club, with Deco and the rest of the professionals, I have a real relationship. I believe in my work. I have their trust, and they wouldn't ask us for it. It's rubbish. Whoever said it lied.\"",
      "Rashford has made an impressive start with the Catalan heavyweights following his season-long loan switch from Manchester United. The England star, now 27, has netted three goals and registered five assists across his opening 10 appearances, while also winning back his place in the Three Lions squad.",
      "Despite facing criticism from Spanish media after his tardiness last month, sporting director Deco confirmed the club were 'happy' with his adaptation to Barcelona. \"He's on a simple loan, there's no penalty, and if we want him, we have an option to buy,\" the ex-Barca playmaker told Mundo Deportivo.",
      "\"It's too early to talk about decisions for next season, but what matters is that we're happy with him. What we thought he could bring to us, he's bringing.",
      "\"He's a very high-level player - who exploded very early - then he had great seasons at United, then he had years of more complicated management with changes of coaches, and perhaps he struggled too because they demanded a lot of things from him there. But we're happy with him, that's the most important thing.",
      "\"These aren't decisions for now. Now it's time to focus on the games to come. A decision will be made, but that's not being discussed right now. There's a contract between the clubs, but it [the future] has to be discussed.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been cautioned that he's setting Manchester United up to fail by repeatedly rotating his defence. The Portuguese manager has faced criticism during the early weeks of this campaign as he attempts to resurrect United's prospects following a dismal 15th-place finish in the Premier League last term.",
      "Club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has claimed the former Sporting boss will be afforded three years to demonstrate his worth at Old Trafford, despite United managing only three victories from seven games so far this season. However, former United keeper Ben Foster has challenged Amorim's tactical methods, especially his tendency to regularly withdraw centre-backs during matches.",
      "The ex-England and Wrexham goalkeeper reckons substituting defenders who aren't even injured has harmed the club, emphasising that United haven't been sufficiently in control during games to take such chances.",
      "Speaking during an appearance on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"You need a solid base as a football team to really get consistency. When you're constantly chopping and changing, not only the centre-backs, but the goalkeepers as well, it just sets you up for failure.",
      "\"You can't change your centre-back at 60 minutes. You need them to play the whole 90 minutes. It's fine if you're two or three-nil up at that point, you can bring somebody on. But Man United don't have that luxury. Up until the 90th minute in games, they're fighting or trying to hold on to a lead or or get back into the game.\"",
      "Foster isn't the only ex-United star to question Amorim's tendency for unnecessary defensive switches. Rio Ferdinand also believes the changing of the backline is not helping United's cause.",
      "Speaking on his podcast Rio Presents, Ferdinand expressed his frustration at Amorim's constant substitutions in defence. He posted a clip of the podcast on X with the caption: \"Why do we keep changing our centre backs during the game?! I WOULD HAVE HATED THIS!\"",
      "Amorim took over from Erik ten Hag in November last year and his tenure has proved challenging so far. He's achieved victory in less than a third of their Premier League outings and presided over United's most disappointing campaign on record last term.",
      "United spent more than £200million on fresh talent during the summer transfer window, primarily bolstering their attacking options. Yet their form has remained patchy and they find themselves languishing in mid-table, with Amorim continuing to face intense pressure.",
      "He's faced relentless scrutiny over his rigid tactical approach, prompting widespread doubts about his suitability for the role. However, Amorim still has support from United's hierarchy after Ratcliffe defended him during an appearance on The Times' Business podcast, urging for patience.",
      "The Ineos chief said: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be. The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success.",
      "\"They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "Former Liverpool star Michael Owen has revealed he had a secret clause in his Newcastle United contract that could have seen him return to the Reds. Owen, who left Liverpool for Real Madrid in 2004, was keen to return to the Premier League after just one season in Spain.",
      "The striker, who netted 158 goals for Liverpool, eventually signed for Newcastle in 2005 for £16.8million. However, it was his controversial move from Newcastle to Manchester United in 2009 that many believe tarnished his legacy at Anfield.",
      "The ex-England striker has received heavy fire over the years for his decision to join the Red Devils, with Liverpool and United set to reignite their rivalry on Sunday at Anfield. Owen, who has stated that the Liverpool was always in his \"heart\", says he was desperate to resign with the Reds after leaving Spain, and again after leaving Newcastle.",
      "The former England international claims he had a clause in his Newcastle contract allowing him to leave for Liverpool after his first season at St James' Park. However, Liverpool declined the chance to bring him back to Merseyside, reports the Liverpool Echo.",
      "Speaking to Mashable India, Owen said: \"When I left Real Madrid I had one team I was going to sign for and when that wasn’t allowed, when the president of Real Madrid said, 'You can’t go to Liverpool because Newcastle have offered double the money. If Liverpool offer the same then you can go', but Liverpool were never going to do that.",
      "\"I was speaking to the chairman, I was speaking to Rafa Benitez at the time, I was so close to going there until Newcastle doubled the money and almost forced Real Madrid to sell me to them.",
      "\"I had some choices, I either stay at Real Madrid or I go to Newcastle. I decided to go to Newcastle. The only reason I signed [for Newcastle] is so I could insert into the contract that after one year I can go to Liverpool, one team in the world. That’s all I wanted to do.\"",
      "Defending his later switch to United, he added: \"So I had that. But nobody needs to know that. Nobody does know it. Nobody cares to know it. But they do care to say, 'Oh, you played for Liverpool, then you played for Manchester United, you know, you must have no loyalty'\".",
      "Owen continued: \"Like, come on. If you know the story. When I left Newcastle, I was on the phone to Brendan Rodgers, every single year I was on the phone to the Liverpool manager. It’s Liverpool that didn’t want me back.",
      "\"[Luis] Suarez was there, [Fernando] Torres was there. And this is absolutely fine, this is football. I understand that, I don’t hold any grudges to Liverpool for not taking me back when I openly said, 'Please take me, please take me' every single year. That’s life, that’s football.",
      "\"In theory I could hold a grudge against Liverpool and say, 'You said you'd buy me back, we had an agreement you'd take me back and it never happened'\".",
      "Owen endured four injury-plagued campaigns at Newcastle, netting 30 times in 79 matches. He subsequently bagged 17 goals across 52 appearances for United, claiming a Premier League title in 2011 plus a League Cup triumph.",
      "The striker moved to Stoke City in September 2012 before hanging up his boots just one season later.",

However, Ruben Amorim's team head into the showdown on the back of a 2-0 win over Sunderland - which saw them return to winning ways following a testing start.",
      "\"We've been through phases, especially the years that I've been at the club, where we've felt we can have them and obviously we drew in the last two seasons. We played away and got knocked out of the FA Cup, which was pretty tough. They are always difficult, we have to be ready for the big fight.\"",
      "His comments perfectly encapsulate Amorim's current United side, who have shown plenty of inconsistency this season. Van Dijk also admitted that Liverpool have to improve their performances if they are to end their winless run. \"It's pretty clear that we have to improve, offensively, defensively, in possession, set-pieces but the matter of fact that in total, we won seven out of 10 and we still have so much to improve,\" he added.",

Rumours of a takeover at Old Trafford were ignited during the international break when Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, said on social media that a deal with an investor was nearing completion.",
      "\"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. I hope he's better than the previous owners,\" Al-Sheikh posted on X.",

The footballing legend turned 50 on May 2 earlier this year and celebrated in style with family and friends, with Tom Cruise, Guy Ritchie and Gordon Ramsey just some of the star-studded names to attend his dinner party in London.",
      "However, away from the glitz and glamour of parties and holidays, the simple act of gift-giving remains a common practice within the family, with Beckham detailing a particular moment where he had to make a request for a very important reason.",
      "The England legend appeared on the latest episode of Salford City FC's docu-series on YouTube, which gives fans a peek behind the curtain at the club. He chatted with former team-mate Gary Neville about various topics, with the duo touching on money.",
      "On the topic of looking to the future, Neville told a story about when he moved his pension to a company that could allow him to buy commercial property, before losing it all. The former right-back then asked Beckham whether he had ever experienced anything similar.",
      "\"My wife is quite...,\" began Beckham, before Neville suggested: \"Prudent?\"",
      "\"Very,\" continued Beckham. \"I will go and buy her a handbag and I know she's going to like it, so it doesn't matter what I spend on it. Then, she won't. For my 50th birthday, I had to say, don't buy me anything s***!",
      "\"I did! I said, I've never asked for anything significant. I want significant for this one birthday! To be fair to her, she did well!\"",
      "Beckham's confession that he never asks for anything major, despite his astronomical net worth with wife Victoria, shows how he has retained his humble nature, despite the notoriety and fame.",
      "David and Victoria famously starred in a 2023 Netflix documentary which, although primarily focusing on the former United man, also showcased aspects of their life together. One of the most popular and funny clips of the series showed the ex-Real Madrid midfielder gate-crashing his wife's interview to ensure she was telling the truth, evidencing the brilliant camaraderie they have together.",
      "In the video, Victoria had just said that the couple were very working class, to which Beckham interjected, telling her to be honest and tell the film crew what car her dad picked her up from at school. She confirmed it was a Rolls Royce before Beckham simply said: \"Thank you\" before exiting the room in a comical moment.",
      "With Salford, Neville and Beckham are overseeing a key change at the club. More than a decade ago, when the Class of '92 took over, the team colours were changed to red - something which was not looked on kindly.",
      "However, it has now been revealed that Salford will return to wearing orange, marking the end of a 12-year period in red. Neville and Beckham completed the buy-out of their former team-mates in May, with a new ownership structure that includes businessman Declan Kelly and former banker Lord Mervyn Davies.",
      "Following extensive consultation with fans, the colour switch has been backed by an overwhelming majority of 77.1%. The club are also working to update seats, cladding and further infrastructure upgrades.",

      "After a 3-1 defeat to Brentford three weeks ago, the Portuguese boss was tipped to be the next Premier League manager to get the boot. However, a 2-0 win over Sunderland before the international break took some of the heat off - and a public endorsement from co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has since dispelled any immediate concerns about his job security.",

      "\"They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ahead of Sunday's clash with bitter rivals Liverpool, Amorim expressed gratitude for Ratcliffe's vote of confidence. Fernandes, who himself has faced criticism for his performances this season, is the first player to publicly comment on the English billionaire's defence of Amorim.",
      "\"We all know, and I think the manager has spoken about it, results make a manager stay or not. The manager is very aware of that. The players are very aware that we need to improve and to win games to help the manager be more stable and be more confident in what we can do in the moment, in the future.",
      "\"I think the club needs some stability, that's the main thing from Sir Jim that he wants to pass through everyone. We've always spoken about giving them time. I think sometimes you need to look at the bigger picture, and from the club side, they need to do that.",
      "\"As a player and as a group of players, we believe the manager can help this club get back to where it belongs.\" He continued: \"I don't know what the aim of Sir Jim is to say that.",
      "\"I think [maybe] to pass some confidence on to the squad, to the staff, to make it look like we are on a good path, not the one we want, but on a good path. We want to improve that. If Sir Jim sees that - the same as the players - that the manager is the right one for the job, it makes it better. We have got two groups looking in the same way.\"",

      "Footage of Ruben Amorim’s tearful goodbye to his Sporting CP players has emerged. It’s almost a year since the Portuguese coach took over as Manchester United boss, replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag.",
      "Following confirmation of his appointment, Amorim managed three further Sporting games, a 5-1 drubbing of Estela in the Primeira Liga, a memorable 4-1 win over Manchester City in the Champions League and a stunning fightback victory at Braga. Sporting trailed 2-1 with less than 10 minutes to go before triumphing 4-2.",
      "It was a fitting way for Amorim to sign off from his success-filled reign, which included two Primeira Liga titles. Now, his emotional final address to his players has been aired as part of a club documentary that chronicles the 2024/25 season.",
      "He told his squad: “I don't like goodbyes. We’ll win the championship. There’s no turning back. The difference is huge, huge.",
      "“What you did in the second half, wow! But now, is it going to be difficult? It’s going to be difficult for everyone. You have to help Quaresma, you have to help Pote, Geny, Ivan, who never plays, Esgaio. It's going to be difficult.",
      "“We’re going to win this s***... You guys are unbelievable, much better than on Tuesday [against City], much better. What I felt here in the second half... The third goal, the fourth goal, guys, it was the best football moment.”",
      "By that point Amorim was welling up while his speech was interrupted by a round of applause from the group. He went on: “Everything you need from me, everything, you'll have.",
      "“I’ll be cheering for you more than for myself. Thank you for everything, you’re the greatest, by far. Thank you for everything. No more goodbyes, okay, my boys?”",
      "It’s fair to say Amorim hasn’t struck up the same bond with his United squad, which he is still struggling to get a tune out of. After finishing in lower mid-table and losing in the final of the Europa League last season, hopes were high after a summer of heavy spending in the transfer market.",
      "However, the Red Devils have endured a tough start, raising doubts about Amorim’s future. He has received a vote of confidence from minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, while the 2-0 win over Sunderland before the international left them just six points behind leaders Arsenal.",
      "Amorim will be looking to complete back-to-back league wins for the first time as United boss when his side makes the short trip to Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United currently find themselves stagnating in mid-table under Ruben Amorim whose job security continues to be scrutinised on a near daily basis. The club are currently 4/1 outsiders with Betfred to pick up a shock win at Anfield with many expecting Liverpool to run out as winners on Sunday but some should exercise caution based on a statistic some may find encouraging - if you are a United fan that is.",
      "Currently, the Red Devils have picked up just three wins from a possible seven league matches this season - with all three coming in their last five outings. They currently sit on a negative goal difference trailing the likes of Sunderland, Everton and Chelsea who all sit right above Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "Yet there is a stat that would appear to give a degree optimism to the United faithful as the season progresses and it could well click in time ahead of this weekend's crucial trip to Liverpool. With the recruitment of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha, Amorim has made a mark on what he sees as his front three that will revive the club's fortunes.",
      "While it has not been plain sailing so far with all three so far achieving four goal involvements right now with Cunha failing to register in both assists and goals this season, United do lead the league in xG. Yes, expected goals, everyone's favourite marmite form of measurement in the beautiful game.",
      "Right now, United go into the weekend with 13.6 xG so far this season but are so far underperforming having just registered nine goals so far. In comparison, the current top four sides of Arsenal (11.9), Liverpool (10.9), Tottenham (7.4) and Bournemouth (8.4) have all appeared to overachieved based on their performances against the metric.",
      "The club have on a number of occasions already this season been left to rue missed chances including dropping two points at Fulham and wasteful in front of Arsenal, Brentford and Man City with all three ending in defeats. Even if they turned things around in those matches and picked up a point apiece in their defeats, they would find themselves level on points with their arch-rivals who have suffered back-to-back defeats.",
      "Ruben Amorim will no doubt have made the most of the international break as he plans to get bragging rights against Arne Slot this weekend as he seeks to finally get his United side to click with his philosophy and style of play. It would be the perfect way to shrug off the doubts around his future at Old Trafford if he continues to improve on results, especially against the reigning Premier League champions.",

      "There could be more than three points at stake when Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola meet at Selhurst Park on Saturday.",
      "Crystal Palace and Bournemouth have already emerged as the two surprise packages of this season so far as they both sit pretty amongst the early pacesetters inside the top six. Yet the biggest attraction is more likely to be in the dugouts than on the pitch - with a golden ticket to Old Trafford potentially among the prizes.",
      "There is little doubt Glasner and Iraola are the two hottest managers on the Premier League merry-go-round right now. And for all Sir Jim Ratcliffe's insistence that Ruben Amorim needs three years to prove himself a \"great\" coach, one glance at the touchline in south London on Saturday afternoon will perhaps make those in power at Manchester United ponder otherwise.",
      "Not that they will need reminding of two managers who are yet to lose to United with their respective clubs. Nor that Glasner's Palace were celebrating their historic FA Cup triumph in May a year on from when Ratcliffe was in the same Wembley stands watching Erik ten Hag lift the trophy for United.",
      "Few would have predicted that when Palace earned their first league win of last season at the ninth attempt, the night before Ten Hag was sacked.",
      "But Glasner's ability to weather a rough start in SE19 only adds to his growing appeal as Amorim's possible successor.",
      "This is a Palace side, remember, who lost their best player Michael Olise to Bayern Munich before going on to win the FA Cup. The same happened this summer with Eberechi Eze to Arsenal and Glasner's team is still thriving.",
      "The question is whether he will be happy to stick around if the same happens at the end of this season when captain Marc Guehi becomes a free agent?",
      "April 2024 - Bournemouth 1-0 Crystal Palace",
      "December 2024 - Bournemouth 0-0 Crystal Palace",
      "April 2025 - Crystal Palace 0-0 Bournemouth",
      "Because Guehi is not the only man out of contract in the summer, of course. A fact that will not be lost on those pulling the strings at United.",
      "Palace chairman Steve Parish is already trying to tie Glasner down to a new contract, as he bids to \"align their interests\".",
      "And he was quick to add that: \"Oliver wants to win things, he makes no secret of that. That's what he's in football for.\"",
      "With an FA Cup already under his belt, you'd argue he currently has more chance of that at Palace than United.",
      "But you also get the sense that someone will eventually crack the code and break the spell over Old Trafford. So why not the Austrian?",
      "He has a strong track record, talks a good game and perhaps crucial to any future transition, favours a three-at-the-back style which Amorim is currently failing miserably at implementing.",
      "Wolfsburg P87 W41 D22 L24 - 47.1%",
      "Frankfurt P97 W38 D30 L19 - 40%",
      "SV Ried P37 W13 D7 L17 - 35.1%",
      "LASK P161 W94 D32 L35 - 58%",
      "Crystal Palace P73 W34 D23 L16 - 47%",
      "Glasner clearly fosters a positive team environment, too - something sorely needed at United. No other realistic candidate for United has arguably done so better of the current managers in the top-flight. Except maybe one.",
      "If losing key players is the yardstick, how Bournemouth have performed after selling three of their back four is nothing short of remarkable. Not to mention their best striker the summer before.",
      "Iraola led the Cherries to their best-ever seasons twice in succession before Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi departed, having already lost Dominic Solanke.",
      "Yet they're already six points better off than they were at this stage last season - a campaign which included a statement 3-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "It's little wonder their Spanish coach - another from the thriving Basque hotbed of managers - is attracting interest.",
      "AEK Larnaka P29 W12 D9 L8 - 41.4%",
      "Mirandés P49 W18 D17 L14 - 36.7%",
      "Rayo Vallecano P136 W54 D32 L50 - 39.7%",
      "Bournemouth P95 W38 D23 L34 - 40%",
      "Asked about his future at Bournemouth, Iraola said: \"It's not just a one-season thing, you have to be there to stay and get results with the teams that you have. If you don't have good players, it's going to be very difficult.\"",
      "It's a tune United know all too well. And if Iraola can get one of those results over Glasner, it could make all the difference in Manchester.",

      "Manchester United return to Premier League action this weekend with a trip to arch rivals Liverpool. Despite their current mid-table status, Ruben Amorim's side head into the match in better form than their opponents.",
      "The Red Devils won their last game before the international break – a 2-0 victory over Sunderland – and also overcame Chelsea two weeks prior. Sandwiched in between those results was a disappointing 3-1 defeat to Brentford.",
      "Liverpool, on the other hand, have lost three in a row under Arne Slot and will be hoping to relight the fire on their Premier League title charge at Anfield. Before the two famous old clubs do battle on Sunday, there's been plenty going on at Old Trafford, including Bryan Mbeumo's reported attempts to encourage an international team-mate to join United, plus Wayne Rooney's firm response to recent comments made by Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rashford's exit from United has been well-documented after publicly falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim. The 27-year-old spoke earlier this week about how being in an \"inconsistent environment for a very long time\" at Old Trafford contributed towards his disappointing performances on the pitch.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "But Rooney, who played alongside Rashford at United, isn't having any of it. He hit back at the Barcelona star's comments on his own Wayne Rooney Show, saying: \"I think the environment hasn't been right but that is down to yourself.",
      "\"If you are not playing well or you get left out of the team then I think it is easier to blame the environment and whether that is right or wrong. I think that comes from how you apply yourself.",
      "\"In games we have seen with him where we know he can do more, we know he can run more - that is nothing to do with an environment. I might be wrong here, I really like Marcus as a lad and as a person but I think that is an easy one to throw at people.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe provided his unequivocal backing to Amorim earlier this month, stating that the Portuguese needs three years at the helm to prove he is a \"great\" coach. Despite that show of support, the former Sporting Lisbon boss has appeared on somewhat shaky ground following a difficult start to both his United tenure as a whole – and this season.",
      "Amorim responded to Ratcliffe's comments ahead of the match against Liverpool, showing both an appreciation for his words and a determination to keep driving the club forward in the right direction.",
      "\"He [Ratcliffe] tells me all the time, sometimes with a message after the games but you know, I know and Jim knows that football is not like that,\" Amorim explained. \"The most important thing is the next game. You cannot control the next day in football so I know that but it is really good to hear that also because of the noise. Omar and Jason tell me that all the time.\"",
      "Speaking about the vision for the club, he added: \"First of all I can feel it, it is not just that thing that people talk [about]. I feel the support every day. Sometimes the pressure I put on myself and the team is often so much bigger than them. I know it is going to take a while but I don't want to think like that, I said that last year.",
      "\"It is really good to hear that, I think it helps our fans understand that the leadership knows it will take a while but, at the same moment, I don't like that because it will give a feeling like we have time to work things out so I don't want that feeling here in our club. It is good to feel the support but we need to show people, at a big club, we are ready to win games.\"",
      "Footballers trying to convince their international team-mates to join them at a particular club is nothing new. Now it seems Mbeumo is trying to do just that with Brighton & Hove Albion star Carlos Baleba.",
      "United made no secret of their desire to sign Baleba in the summer, although they ultimately couldn't reach a deal with the Seagulls. Brighton chairman Tony Bloom recently confirmed as such, saying: \"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past.\"",
      "But, according to The Sun, United could have a trump card in their attempts to sign the £100m-rated Baleba in the future. They claim that Baleba and Mbeumo have been spending more time together on international duty with Cameroon, with the current United forward doing his best to facilitate a move to Old Trafford for the midfielder.",
      "It is claimed that Mbeumo has adopted a 'big brother' role in their relationship and that he has told Baleba all about what it's like to play for a club as big as United. Whether that will have any impact the next time the transfer window opens, remains to be seen.",

      "Jurgen Klopp's wife's reaction said a lot when the German was approached by Manchester United. The ex-Liverpool boss also gave a telling response when a signed United contract was put in front of him last year.",
      "With Ruben Amorim's side stuck in relative turmoil, having lost three of their first seven Premier League games, a daunting trip to Anfield now beckons. Calls for Amorim to be replaced are already loud but could become deafening should the result be negative.",
      "One name who certainly won't be in the running should he depart is former Liverpool manager Klopp. The German taking up a role at Old Trafford is inconceivable given the years of loyal, trophy-laden service he provided to Liverpool. However, at one point, it was a possibility.",
      "Klopp's wife was the one who had the final say on a United approach when the head coach was with Borussia Dortmund and the 58-year-old himself gave his true feelings away when he had a contract placed in front of him last year.",
      "During his time managing in Germany, Klopp was hot managerial property and a few top European sides came calling. One of those was United.",
      "Speaking to Denmark's TV2 in 2019, Reds icon Phil Thompson shed light on Klopp's decision in 2013. He said: \"I interviewed Klopp for Sky, and I asked if he and Liverpool were created for each other. He looked at me and asked, 'Why?'",
      "\"Then Klopp told me he could have taken over Manchester United, but his wife (Ulla) said it wasn't right. When Liverpool arrived, his wife said it was right. There is something strange there. It is as if he's created for Liverpool.\"",
      "After remaining with Dortmund, Klopp made the move to Anfield in October 2015 and the rest is history. He transformed the side into Premier League and Champions League winners and received a legendary send-off when he stepped down in 2024.",
      "But during the tail end of his swansong campaign, a strange incident baffled Klopp. Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by United with a 4-3 defeat in April 2024 during his final season before stepping aside for Arne Slot.",
      "The defeat was particularly painful, with Amad Diallo scoring the decisive goal in stoppage time to secure victory for Erik ten Hag's team. When Klopp entered the press room, visibly frustrated, an unusual piece of paperwork was present in front of him.",
      "Klopp held up what appeared to be a United contract, already signed. He gestured to a member of staff present with clear confusion and handed the paper over baffled.",
      "But this was actually a contract signed by YouTuber and popular streamer IShowSpeed, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr. The internet personality, known for his wild antics in videos, had visited Old Trafford that year out of admiration for club legend Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "United had hosted the American by giving him a tour of the dressing room, a jersey and inviting him to sign a mock contract in the press room.",
      "It remains unclear whether the contract was deliberately left to unsettle Klopp, especially since his time at Liverpool was coming to an end that summer. However, Klopp appeared merely confused by the situation.",
      "He took up a role as Red Bull's Global Head of Soccer soon after leaving Liverpool, and if he were to return to the dugout down the line, Old Trafford would very likely not be the destination of choice.",

      "Ruben Amorim has vowed to change Manchester United's mentality and turn his players into clutch performers. The United boss' comments were in stark contrast to those of Michael Owen, who thinks their tag as underdogs could play into their hands when they take on Liverpool.",
      "The fierce rivals clash on Sunday, with United aiming to secure back-to-back victories and deepen the misery for Arne Slot's outfit, who arrive on the back of three straight losses.",
      "Amorim eased some of the mounting pressure on his position with a win over Sunderland ahead of the international break, but he'll be eager to generate some momentum following a sluggish start to the campaign.",
      "The Portuguese boss has been talking confidently as he attempts to reverse United's fortunes. Ahead of the journey to Liverpool, he vowed to challenge his squad to shift their mindset and deliver when it matters most.",
      "Despite Liverpool's recent struggles, Slot's team remain favourites, and Owen believes that could work in United's favour.",
      "The 45-year-old, who enjoyed a three-year spell at United, reckons Amorim's players are more inclined to shine when expectations are minimal and could snatch an unexpected victory.",
      "Speaking to the MEN via casino.co.uk, he said: \"Whoever Liverpool were going to play after the break, they need to get back on track, don't they?\".",
      "\"They'll be pleased to be in front of the home crowd, after the away defeats to Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea. They've got a good record against Manchester United in recent years.",
      "\"Manchester United won't be looking forward to going to Anfield. No team looks forward to going to Anfield!\".",
      "\"That being said, a small part of me thinks that it's better for Manchester United to go to Anfield right now, rather than to play at Old Trafford. At Old Trafford, you've got to show some form of ambition. You've got to go out and attack, even if you die on your sword. You've got to push the boat out and take a couple of risks.\"",
      "Owen, who began his professional journey at Anfield, continued: \"You're in front of your home fans, and they demand that. Whereas at Anfield, I don't think you'll get criticised for just parking the bus, getting everybody behind the ball and playing on the counter-attack.",
      "\"It probably suits Manchester United; they hate giving space behind their defence. They haven't got any pace at the back. It suits them to sit on the edge of the box and defend.",
      "\"Their defenders are probably some of the best in the league for standing on the edge of the box, heading it out, volleying it out and just generally being big, tough, old-fashioned centre halves.",
      "\"The match could work in Manchester United's favour in numerous ways, provided they target a goalless draw, perhaps catching Liverpool on the break. I would imagine it's going to be Liverpool in possession a lot of the time, trying to prise them open and then United counter-attacking when they can.\"",
      "Owen's remarks fly in the face of the mindset Amorim is attempting to instil at Old Trafford.",
      "The Portuguese manager nearly ended United's barren run at Anfield last term, only for Harry Maguire to squander a golden opportunity in the dying moments as the match finished 2-2.",
      "The Reds' fortress has proved a nightmare venue for the Red Devils in recent years, but Amorim insists the club's approach to facing their bitter rivals must evolve.",
      "He said: \"Maybe the expectations when you have to win and the responsibility of winning, it is so much harder to play like that, that is why when you play for big clubs you need to win every match, especially when people are expecting you to win and we have some difficulties to deal with that when you guys expect Manchester United not to win that game, maybe it is easier for the players to perform and we need to change that.",
      "\"To change that we need to have more confidence to win games, gain more points and more free[dom] to play the game.\"",

      "Antonio Conte has claimed Scott McTominay's successful first season is costing him as he tries to replicate his form this term. The Napoli manager believes that McTominay is facing greater obstacles as opposition sides attempt to contain him.",
      "The 28-year-old enjoyed an incredible first season, helping Napoli to a Serie A title and being named the division's most valuable player. McTominay scored six goals and added two assists in seven matches to claim the title at the end of last season, notching 13 goals in all.",
      "This year has not been quite so straightforward. The Scotland star scored on the opening day of the season but has not found the net since, while new team-mates Rasmus Hojlund and Kevin De Bruyne find their feet.",
      "McTominay, who has predominantly been used off the left by Conte in 2025/26, has still started every game. The Italian coach is clearly impressed with what he has seen.",
      "Conte is not too concerned about his charge's form. The former Chelsea and Tottenham coach simply puts it down to receiving a great deal more attention on the pitch after last season's exploits.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"It’s very simple, his status has changed,” Conte said in a press conference, via TuttoNapoli. \"He was the best player in the league last season.",
      "\"When he arrived, he wasn’t being used much at Manchester United. He came in as an underdog with something to prove. Now his status is different and the attention he receives, even from opponents preparing to face him, is completely different.",
      "\"He’s seen in a new light now. It’s as simple as that. Last year, he adapted to everything, playing with two strikers, 4-3-3, but now opponents look at him differently, and naturally, they make tactical adjustments to contain him.\"",
      "McTominay's international team-mate, Billy Gilmour has not found minutes quite as forthcoming. But Conte offered a vote of confidence to the midfielder.",
      "“I have total confidence in the boy,\" he said. \"Whenever he’s been called upon, he’s always stepped up, including at the end of last season.",
      "\"His skill sets perfectly match those of Lobotka, which is exactly why we signed him. There wasn’t really a proper backup for Lobotka; finding another like him is very difficult. The others have different qualities; they are not natural playmakers, so, if needed, we’d have to adapt someone else. Hopefully, it won’t come to that.”",

      "Mark Chapman believes Manchester United will endure a \"miserable experience\" when they travel to Anfield to take on Liverpool this Sunday. The Northwest derby makes its return this weekend, with Ruben Amorim hoping to take advantage of Liverpool's recent dip in form.",
      "The reigning Premier League champions head into the clash off the back of three straight defeats. Arne Slot's side suffered a narrow 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace in late September, before enduring a 1-0 setback to Galatasaray in the Champions League. They also fell to a 2-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge, when Estevao Willian netted a last-gasp winner.",
      "Despite United heading into the encounter buoyed by a 2-0 triumph over Sunderland on home turf in their latest outing, Match of the Day presenter and United fan Chapman expects a gruelling afternoon for the Red Devils.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Speaking with Gabby Logan on his The Sports Agents podcast, he said: \"This is why I'm trying not to say anything, Gabby.",
      "\"Because Liverpool play United on Sunday; I'm doing Sunday's Match Of The Day. It has tended to be an utterly miserable experience for United going to Anfield.\"",
      "Responding to Logan's claim that losing to Liverpool has also historically led to United managers receiving their marching orders, Chapman added: \"Managers get sacked. Mind you, if you lose 7-0 at Anfield, you know... I mean, there have been some horrific ones,\" nodding to Erik ten Hag's horrific 7-0 loss to Liverpool in March 2023, which he retained his job after.",
      "Further explaining his hatred for the derby, Chapman then added: \"On Ruben Amorim's behalf, I hope that analysis works wonders on Sunday. But it's the worst, it's the worst game. It's the worst. It's a horrible game!\"",
      "It comes as Amorim's position at United has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. The Portuguese tactician has struggled to reverse United's fortunes since replacing Ten Hag last November.",
      "However, the boss insists he retains the complete confidence of the hierarchy, discussing his rapport with Sir Jim Ratcliffe during Friday afternoon's pre-match press briefing.",
      "Speaking about the support he receives, Amorim said: \"He tells me all the time, sometimes with a message after the games but you know, I know and Jim knows that football is not like that.",
      "\"The most important thing is the next game. You cannot control the next day in football so I know that but it is really good to hear that also because of the noise. Omar [Berrada] and Jason [Wilcox] tell me that all the time.\"",
      "He added: \"First of all I can feel it, it is not just that thing that people talk [about]. I feel the support every day. Sometimes the pressure I put on myself and the team is often so much bigger than them.",
      "\"I know it is going to take a while but I don't want to think like that, I said that last year. It is really good to hear that, I think it helps our fans understand that the leadership knows it will take a while but, at the same moment, I don't like that because it will give a feeling like we have time to work things out so I don't want that feeling here in our club. It is good to feel the support but we need to show people, at a big club, we are ready to win games.\"",

      "Manchester United icon Paul Scholes has launched a scathing attack on Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw and Casemiro, claiming the trio are no longer capable of meeting the physical demands of Premier League football. The Old Trafford legend-turned-pundit believes all three have declined to a standard that falls short of what's required, arguing they lack the necessary strength and pace.",
      "Both Maguire, 32, and Shaw, 30, were overlooked for Thomas Tuchel's England squad during the October international break. While concerns have persisted over 33-year-old former Real Madrid star Casemiro's fitness levels ever since his move to Manchester.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, via The Times, Scholes declared: \"Shaw, Maguire, Casemiro, they've all been great players but they're at a stage of their career now where you get found out in the Premier League if you're not physically good enough.",
      "\"Their bodies are not athletic enough, they're not strong enough, they're not quick enough. They've dropped to a level where they can't cope with what's needed in the Premier League.",
      "\"Every player in the Premier League is an absolute machine. They've got five per cent body fat, they can run, they're strong, they can head it. Manchester United are carrying two or three players that are just not capable of living with it.\"",
      "Ahead of Sunday's crucial clash with bitter rivals Liverpool at Anfield, Scholes has revealed he believes United were 'sucked into' acquiring the Brazilian midfielder, having splashed out £70million to secure his services from Real Madrid three years ago.",
      "\"We got sucked into that one, and there's been quite a few like that,\" Scholes admitted.",
      "His former United team-mate Nick Butt concurred, adding: \"Real Madrid don't let their best players go. [Raphaël] Varane and Casemiro were both unbelievable players [earlier] in their career.",
      "\"They've done more than I've ever done, so it's difficult to have a go at them, but Real Madrid don't sell their top players to a European rival in Man United.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Maguire is eyeing a fresh contract at Old Trafford, with his current agreement set to run out at the end of the season. It remains to be seen if he can convince the club's hierarchy to hand him another extension, although he does have boss Ruben Amorim in his corner.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "When former Blackburn Rovers academy coach Mike Sheron first became aware of Adam Wharton, the midfielder was just 12 years old and while it was far too early to make a judgement on what type of player he would become, there were already hints of the talent he possessed.",
      "\"I have been in and around Adam on a daily basis throughout his time at Blackburn,\" Sheron told MEN Sport this week. \"He has always been a fairly quiet young lad but he had an inner confidence about himself.",
      "\"He had a velvet touch, straightaway you were drawn to his ability to control a football and he used his body particularly well. His weight of pass was exceptional and as he got older you became more critical on how to build your team and you just had to go through him.",
      "\"He would never give the ball away, nine times out of ten he was picking the right pass out and it has been a joy watching him develop, it has been brilliant this last 18 months to see what he has been doing.\"",
      "When Palace paid £18million for Wharton in the 2024 mid-season transfer window, he was relatively unknown to most in the Premier League bubble, but at Ewood Park he had already become a firm fan favourite.",
      "Wharton grew up in a Blackburn-mad household with an incredibly supportive family and network surrounding him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reminiscing over one particular trip to Middlesbrough, it was easy to see why Sheron holds Wharton in such high esteem. \"From our point of view, as coaches, if you had a flaw in your set-up, in your session design, he would find it and he would exploit it,\" the 53-year-old who departed Blackburn in September explained.",
      "\"He would always find a solution to increase his chances of winning for his team and he made you a better coach as well, not just influencing the players around him, he made you a better coach and it was really enthralling to work around him. It is definitely rare [for a player to better you when you're a coach] and it is not something that you come across too often.",
      "\"I felt, as a coach, you never had to give him too many details, he would just figure it out for himself. Like everything else, there is more than one way to do things, so you don’t tell him what to do, you give him a broad landscape of: ‘This is the way that we are wanting to try and do things today, but overall it is down to yourselves how you go about it’.",
      "\"One story I do have of him is that we went to a day event at Middlesbrough, an Under-14s player-led tournament. Basically, all of the players would pick the teams, come up with the tactics and we just had to watch from afar.",
      "\"We actually went with an Under-13s set-up because we knew our group at the time at Under-13s was very good. It was Adam’s group, which also had Harry Leonard who is now at Peterborough and Kristi Montgomery who is in and around the first-team now, and they did exceptionally well, but I think Adam, again, was pivotal and was a major factor in us winning that tournament that day.",
      "\"He had that quiet leadership, he doesn’t shout, he doesn’t dictate but he has that inner belief about what he is doing and how to be successful. A lot of the time, he was right.",
      "\"He didn’t agree with everything that you would tell him, you would sometimes criticise his work ethic but he didn’t expend a lot of energy if he didn’t have to, and he was quite good at that. You see him doing elements of that now.",
      "\"You don’t see him running around everywhere, he just gets himself into good positions, he reads the game and that technical ability has ensured he has done fantastically well.\"",
      "A common theme of the conversation about Wharton was the midfielder's 'inner confidence and belief'.",
      "Wharton never needs to be the loudest voice in the room but he knows he can influence players and the game with his own ability. Sheron spoke with pride when remembering how Declan Rice and Harry Kane spoke so glowingly of him after his first England appearance.",
      "When quizzed about Wharton's best position in the midfield pivot, Sheron, who also worked in the youth set-up at Liverpool, insisted that the England international has the ability to suit whichever role the manager needs at any given time - even comparing him to a United favourite. \"Personally, I always felt he was best suited in and around the No.6 role,\" he continued.",
      "\"I like how they have done it at Palace as a lot of the time he is in with a Will Hughes or he is in with another player and there are two sitters. But in a team that is dominating possession, I don’t think there is much of a problem if he is the single pivot.",
      "\"His composure on the ball is second to none, he hardly ever gives the ball away, he can use both feet, read situations, he is so intelligent with his positioning to intercept but it has been a shock to see how well he is doing because you just never know.",
      "\"His game has really gone to the next level around more dynamic players and I would have him down as someone like a Michael Carrick who is really football-intelligent and composed, it really has been a joy to watch him develop.\"",
      "Such a talented player is exactly what United need to mix up their midfield next summer. The midfield department went untouched this previous window as focus gravitated towards the attack.",
      "The concern for the Reds is whether they would be able to attract Wharton without necessarily having the Champions League football which Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish suggested he would crave in the future. Fortunately for the Reds, Sheron believes that an immediate move to a Champions League club is not necessarily the be-all and end-all at this stage.",
      "\"We are all aware of United’s standing in the game and the frustrations they have had in the last couple of years, but who would have thought that going to Crystal Palace would have been a fantastic move?\" Sheron said.",
      "\"If a team sells the club to him and his family and advisors, and he feels that it is the right move for him, then I don’t think it is a case of him needing to go to Manchester City or Liverpool or Arsenal, I think it is a case of whether he gets the vibes that he is going to be valued, be a big part of the team going forward and we all know the animal that Manchester United can become. So I wouldn’t say it is a yes or a no on United, but rather whether the move is the right fit for him.",
      "\"I would put my faith in Adam, who has made a few good decisions, to make the right decision and if he thinks Manchester United is the right fit then it will be. Adam will make other players play better and other players will get their confidence up playing with him.\"",

      "Manchester United might have dropped a hint on who will start against Liverpool this weekend.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Matheus Cunha and Amad were among the players to miss full training, albeit club sources confirmed some of the absentees completed recovery work.",
      "Casemiro was absent from training because he played 90 minutes in away friendlies for Brazil against South Korea and Japan during the break. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will not be on Amorim's Christmas card list.",
      "Casemiro would have been a nailed-on starter against Liverpool, but his workload during the break raises questions over how ready he will be to start.",
      "It seems unlikely that Amorim will start the 33-year-old against Liverpool, given he has trekked halfway around the world to Asia and played the entirety of both friendly matches.",
      "That means Manuel Ugarte will be under consideration to start at Anfield. Ugarte was not included in the Uruguay squad for the international break and will be fresh compared to Casemiro.",
      "Ugarte was also a surprise starter against Manchester City when domestic football resumed following the September international break. He had last been seen on a pitch in the defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Casemiro was named on the bench against City and Ugarte performed well in the first half, although he didn't cover himself in glory when he made his next start against Brentford.",
      "Ugarte was expected to be a big winner from Amorim's appointment because he had thrived when they worked together at Sporting Lisbon, however, he has been unable to earn a consistent starting role.",
      "It did not reflect well on Ugarte that United looked at midfielders of his ilk in the summer transfer window.",
      "Ugarte was signed for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, in the summer of 2024, and United have already conceded they need a new signing in the same mould.",
      "Fernandes and Ugarte are the most likely midfield partnership at Anfield. Ugarte does not inspire confidence, but his performance at Anfield in January should provide some encouragement ahead of Sunday's clash.",
      "Ugarte started alongside Kobbie Mainoo in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at the beginning of the year. The pair worked brilliantly together and Ugarte looked like the player United thought they were signing.",
      "Perhaps another start at Anfield will spark another improved performance from Ugarte.",

      "\"He went, 'Do you know what Chaz, in the summer it was like between me and Lindelof, and they signed Lindelof.'",
      "\"I was like, 'You are joking!' I couldn't believe it, I was gobsmacked. There was talk of him going there, and then they have taken Lindelof instead.\"",
      "Licha is not available. Near but he is just returning. I don't know about Mazraoui. The international players are ready but we need to give them more time. The guys who are returning are ready to play.",
      "He tells me all the time, sometimes with a message after the games but you know, I know and Jim knows that football is not like that. The most important thing is the next game. You cannot control the next day in football so I know that but it is really good to hear that also because of the noise. Omar and Jason tell me that all the time.",

      "The Old Trafford pitch last underwent major improvements in the 1990s, and was elevated and bordered by a ditch. However, this has contributed to injuries over the years.",
      "According to The Sun, the club will look at changing the 'perimeter' of the pitch, to reduce the risk of injuries. During a United fans' forum held last week, a supporter highlighted that many injuries across the Premier League have been caused by players striking advertising hoardings at speed.",
      "During the meeting, a question was raised about whether the club would 'invest in transparent and soft materials to cover them,' to which a United spokesperson responded: \"The health and welfare of all players is of paramount importance.",

      "Wayne Rooney has provided a prediction for Manchester United's Premier League clash against Liverpool, when speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "Just with Liverpool losing three games, I think that pride kicks in and the fans will know, the fans are not stupid, they know and will get behind the team and push them.",
      "So for United, I think going there, if United come away with a point, I think that would be huge.",
      "I think the pressure for this game, I think purely because I don’t think United fans will be expecting three points in this game, where in other games they are.",
      "I think they’ll go in a say, if we can get a point we’ll be happy with that, where I think for Liverpool, if Liverpool lose four games in a row and they lose to Man United at Anfield, I think the pressure is definitely on Liverpool for this game.",
      "I think when you bring so many new players in, they’ve all probably got a bit of an ego in their own way, all wanting to do well and find that chemistry with each other.",
      "I think that hasn’t quite hit off yet, even though they won the first five games, I think the last three games has shown everyone and exposed those first five games. I think it’s a good reset time for Liverpool with where they are at the minute.",

      "However, that is certainly not the case with it made clear by Jacobs that he is categorically not back at the table.",
      "Manchester United takeover talk has been sparked into life again following a huge update that involves Eric Cantona.",
      "As revealed by Ben Jacobs, via United Stand, the United icon has held direct talks over being an ambassador that would see him back a prospective consortium in a bid for United.",

United will return from the international break against Liverpool at Anfield this weekend and Amorim was asked whether the game is a chance to show the gap between the two clubs is closing.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has previewed the clash with Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "United have not won at Liverpool since 2016 but they have secured two draws at Anfield in their last two visits. Amorim's side came from 2-1 down to pick up a point thanks to Amad's late goal last season.",
      "Sunday will be an opportunity for Amorim to record back-to-back league victories for the first time since taking over at United following the 2-0 win over Sunderland before the international break.",
      "The United boss gave an injury update in the first part of his press conference. Lisandro Martinez is the only player definitely out but his teammate Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Amorim also addressed the backing he received from Sir Jim Ratcliffe last week and there was further talk surrounding Senne Lammens following his impressive debut against Sunderland",
      "Take a look at everything Amorim had to say in his press conference below:",
      "That is the end of the first part of today's press conference.",
      "Sometimes things change really fast but if you see the history of both clubs, you can feel that sometimes you have one club that is winning, winning, winning and one club that is having a bad moment. That happened with Liverpool when Manchester United was winning everything and that happened with Manchester United when Liverpool was winning everything. We have to acknowledge that and be really honest with the fans. We can win any game, if we think about winning the next game, that is the most important thing, we can win the next game. If we are to be the same level as Liverpool in the future, that is the idea, I don't know how long it is going to take.",
      "I think we can always improve. I am not the best guy, because I have been here for nearly a year and our results have not been so good so I am not going to be the guy that says that the academy is not in a good shape. What I know is that, especially nowadays with the Financial Fair Play and the feeling of the club, the academy is really important. We need to take care of that and we also have to give the right conditions for all the right people here to do a better job because it is not just sometimes you are doing a bad job but we need to see what type of conditions they have to do a great job. We are paying attention to that. We are bringing people [in], we are always in contact with Travis, with the kids and bringing the right kids in for the training. Try to make that relationship with the academy. If you look at our club, we are trying to improve. We have a lot to improve, not just in the academy but in the whole aspects of our club.",
      "Nothing is impossible, you have to prove during the week but of course he did a great job. It is possible that he is going to start the game. The first impression in this club is really important, to maintain the level is even more important. He is not Schmeichel yet, he is a young guy with talent. He showed a lot of composure and the fans liked it but, again, we have to prove that is in the past and we need to prove it in the next game.",
      "Licha is not available. He is near but he is just returning to training with the team. Mazraoui, I don't know. The rest of the guys, the national players are ready but if you saw the games, some of the players played in Japan so we need to be careful to give more time. Bruno played 62 minutes so we give him one more day. We try to balance everything to get everyone ready but the guys who are returning from national teams are ready to play.",
      "Maybe the expectations when you have to win and the responsibility of winning, it is so much harder to play like that, that is why when you play for big clubs you need to win every match, especially when people are expecting you to win and we have some difficulties to deal with that when you guys expect Manchester United not to win that game, maybe it is easier for the players to perform and we need to change that. To change that We need to have more confidence to win games, gain more points and more free to play the game.",
      "I remember we played well, it was a draw, I was really upset at the end of the game because we proved that we could compete against any opponent. I know that isn't special for our club, I know that they are fighting all the time for the number of titles. I know what it means to the fans but again it is just one game where we need to prove we are playing better. I think we are playing better. We need to do better in both boxes so it is one more game that we need to win.",
      "First of all I can feel it, it is not just that thing that people talk [about]. I feel the support every day. Sometimes the pressure I put on myself and the team is often so much bigger than them. I know it is going to take a while but I don't want to think like that, I said that last year. It is really good to hear that, I think it helps our fans understand that the leadership knows it will take a while but, at the same moment, I don't like that because it will give a feeling like we have time to work things out so I don't want that feeling here in our club. It is good to feel the support but we need to show people, at a big club, we are ready to win games.",

Whilst we'll build a stadium that's great for our team and for the club and our fans, it's so much more than that. We worked really closely with the local authority and thought this would be a fantastic opportunity to create a once in a lifetime project that would build, in effect, a big sports and entertainment district that will then join to Manchester.",

      "In September, Rashford had been dropped to the bench for the La Liga game against Getafe for the same offence. It's claimed that Yamal's treatment has been branded as \"double standards.\"",

      "After being late to the team meeting last month, the 27-year-old was criticised by the Spanish press, but Deco insisted the club were \"happy\" with his start to life in Barcelona.",
      "\"He's on a simple loan, there's no penalty, and if we want him, we have an option to buy,\" the ex-Barca playmaker told Mundo Deportivo. \"It's too early to talk about decisions for next season, but what matters is that we're happy with him. What we thought he could bring to us, he's bringing.",

But we're happy with him - that's the most important thing.",
      "\"These aren't decisions for now. Now it's time to focus on the games to come. A decision will be made, but that's not being discussed right now. There's a contract between the clubs, but it [the future] has to be discussed.\"",

      "The 2-0 victory over Sunderland before the international break eased that pressure - and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's public backing has subsequently removed any doubt over his immediate future. The United co-owner indicated that he would afford Amorim three years to demonstrate his capabilities at Old Trafford, despite picking up just 37 points from his last 34 top-flight games.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast. \"That's where I would be. The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success.",
      "\"They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ahead of Sunday's showdown with Liverpool, Amorim welcomed Ratcliffe's backing. Fernandes, who has also been criticised for his performances this season, has become the first player to discuss the English billionaire's defence of Amorim publicly.",
      "\"We all know, and I think the manager has spoken about it, results make a manager stay or not. The manager is very aware of that. The players are very aware that we need to improve and to win games to help the manager be more stable and be more confident in what we can do in the moment and in the future.",
      "\"I think the club needs some stability, that's the main thing from Sir Jim that he wants to pass through everyone. We've always spoken about giving them time. I think sometimes you need to look at the bigger picture, and from the club side, they need to do that.",
      "\"As a player and as a group of players, we believe the manager can help this club get back to where it belongs.\"",
      "He added: \"I don't know what the aim of Sir Jim is to say that. I think [maybe] to pass some confidence on to the squad, to the staff, to make it look like we are on a good path, not the one we want, but on a good path.",
      "\"We want to improve that. If Sir Jim sees that - the same as the players - that the manager is the right one for the job, it makes it better. We have got two groups looking in the same way.\"",

      "Manchester United exited the summer transfer window with the fresh attack Ruben Amorim was desperate for.",
      "However, the combined issues of the cost of this transformation and the time in which it took to do it left United with little resources to focus their attention elsewhere. This, of course, was to the detriment of the midfield which remained untouched heading into the 2025/26 season.",
      "With the January transfer window starting to come into focus, attention is beginning to shift slightly towards what United need to do to bolster their midfield. Completing deals in the mid-season market may be difficult for the Reds, but Amorim will be looking to lay the groundwork for the summer.",
      "So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at what United's dream midfield could look like following a complete overhaul.",
      "If the 33-year-old was happy to stay on a lower wage, he would bring vital experience, even if he was not playing as often as he is now.",
      "United's captain has been endlessly linked with a move to Saudi Arabia. Next summer could be the time that the Reds pull the release cord considering their captain's age and the money which could be on the table for Fernandes.",
      "If a Saudi club was to offer £100m for Fernandes next year, it seems as though United would have to accept. Such a sum would be crucial in rebuilding the Reds' midfield and represents excellent business considering the midfielder's value will, sadly, only diminish further as time goes on.",
      "With Fernandes gone, this would be the ideal time to re-enter negotiations with Kobbie Mainoo. The Stockport-born midfielder requested an exit from Old Trafford in the summer window and while that was rejected by Amorim, Mainoo's playing time has yet to be noticeably improved.",
      "However, when not competing with the captain for a place in the squad, Mainoo could surely be afforded more playing time and United could bridge the gap on wages too. Keeping the 20-year-old would also prove popular with the fanbase, even if it meant missing out on Financial Fair Play (FFP) 'pure profit'.",
      "Fernandes' exit would see United need to splash the cash to fill gaps. The two signings we would look to make would be Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba. If United could get both deals done, this would be a vast improvement for the Reds.",
      "Wharton is one of the most eye-catching midfielders in the Premier League. His ability to play as both a '6' and an '8' would help create better squad depth and allow him to play alongside Mainoo on occasion. As for Baleba, while this season has started off slowly for him, there is no doubting that he is a major improvement on United's defensive midfield both now and for the foreseeable future.",
      "Both men are the calibre of signings that United need to be making to get back to the top.",
      "Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been warned he's setting Manchester United up to fail by constantly chopping and changing his backline.",
      "The Portuguese head coach has come under fire in the early stages of this season as he tries to revive United's fortunes following a disappointing 15th-place finish in their last Premier League campaign. Club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has claimed the former Sporting boss will be given three years to prove himself at Old Trafford, despite United registering just three wins from seven matches so far this term.",
      "However, former United goalkeeper Ben Foster has questioned Amorim's tactical approach, particularly his insistence on frequently substituting centre-backs during matches. The ex-England and Wrexham shot-stopper believes taking defenders off has been detrimental to the club, stressing that United have not been dominant enough during games to take that risk.",
      "Speaking during an appearance on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"You need a solid base as a football team to really get consistency. When you're constantly chopping and changing, not only the centre-backs, but the goalkeepers as well, it just sets you up for failure.",
      "\"You can't change your centre back at 60 minutes. You need them to play the whole 90 minutes. It's fine if you're two or three nil up at that point, you can bring somebody on. But Man United don't have that luxury. Up until the 90th minute in games, they're fighting or trying to hold on to a lead or or get back into the game.\"",
      "Foster is not the only former United player who has taken issue with Amorim's habit of making unenforced changes at the back. Club legend Gary Neville also pulled him up on it last month after he brought Mason Mount on at left wing-back against Brentford.",
      "\"You can't put Mason Mount at left wing-back,\" he said. \"I can't watch Mason Mount play at left wing-back in a football team. I struggle to watch him in his position. To actually put him out there is absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "Amorim was appointed to replace Erik ten Hag in November last year, but has had a torrid time in charge so far. He has secured victory in less than a third of his Premier League matches and oversaw United's worst-ever campaign last season.",
      "United spent more than £200million on new players during the summer transfer window, mostly in attack. However, their form has been inconsistent so far and they sit in mid-table, with Amorim still firmly under scrutiny.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He has been constantly criticised for his tactical inflexibility, leading many to question if he is the right man for the job. Despite this, Amorim still has the backing of United board members after Ratcliffe spoke out on The Times' Business podcast to call for patience.",
      "The Ineos chief said: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be. The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success.",

      "The youngster has one goal and one assist in five games at Premier League 2 level for United having impressed coming through the age-group sides.",
      "His form at Under-18 level prompted interest from Canada in the forward and Jesse Marsch called the teenager into a senior training camp during the summer in a bid to convince him to join the co-World Cup hosts.",
      "Marsch is a big fan of the United prospect, telling reporters in Canada in May: \"He's a dynamic player. He's very good around the goal. You can see he's an intelligent player.",
      "\"He's a version of Jonathan David. He's not exactly the same player but he's a striker that can play up on the backline and is also good at coming underneath and connecting plays and being part of the build-up phase.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with Gabe and his family. He has several options to think about in what country he wants to represent.",
      "\"I think it's really important that the family feels the connection to Canada.\"",
      "Biancheri subsequently made his debut for Wales Under-21s in September and has this week scored his first goal for his country in a fine 2-0 win over Austria.",
      "He opened his account in the 25th minute of his first start when he capitalised on a loose back pass from David Heindl to sit the goalkeeper down before rolling the ball into an empty net. Chris Popov snatched a second for the Welsh in the 90th minute.",
      "Biancheri's performance caught the eye in Austria and led to some speculating he could earn a call into Craig Bellamy's senior squad for the November internationals.",
      "Canada will likely still harbour ambitions of the youngster declaring for them while Biancheri is also eligible to represent Italy.",
      "Speaking in May, Wales boss Bellamy said he was happy for Biancheri to explore his options.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones is embarking on a journey towards management.",
      "The 33-year-old, who hung up his boots last year, has set his sights on securing a top position in the future but acknowledges he must still prove himself worthy.",
      "Jones is presently pursuing his UEFA Pro Licence and has been involved with United's academy players at Carrington during recent campaigns as he transitions from an injury-riddled playing career.",
      "The former Blackburn talent recognises there's considerable groundwork ahead before landing his inaugural managerial role.",
      "\"I don't think there's a right or wrong way,\" Jones told BetMGM. \"People say to me go and take an Under 18s, some say go and be an assistant somewhere.",
      "\"Do I think I'm ready to become a manager? No. I'm not naive and daft enough to think I'm just going to walk into a job. It doesn't work like that. I have to earn the right with steps and progression.",
      "\"But do I think I could add value into a team now? Yeah. I played under a lot of good managers and with good players, I've taken a lot of things from various parts of the game on and off the pitch. That's the goal. That's where I want to be. Let's see.\"",
      "Jones has been content to develop his skills within United's youth system and didn't wish to rush into securing a senior position elsewhere before he felt prepared. And he reckons he has gained from that approach.",
      "\"I didn't want to just come out of the game and say, 'I'll take that manager's job',\" he said. \"I wanted to go about it the right way. Just because I played at United for 13 years, you can't expect to get the biggest jobs.",
      "\"I was on the grass with the kids coaching, and you come away from a session thinking, 'How can I adapt, how can I change it, how can I make it better?'",
      "\"You start thinking about the game more. I don't just watch a game of football now, you're engrossed in patterns of play and systems and how they set up tactically in and out of possession.\"",
      "Looking back on his former club's management situation, Jones is encouraged by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's support of Ruben Amorim. Nevertheless, the coach reckons it will mean nothing if the Portuguese manager fails to deliver results.",
      "Jones reckons Sunday's clash with Liverpool could prove pivotal in determining the direction of United's campaign. The former Old Trafford favourite would be delighted to see Amorim claim silverware.",
      "\"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job? No, especially with the route I want go down now,\" he said. \"You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it's a results business. If you don't get results, I don't care what length of contract you're on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",
      "\"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I've seen from United this season in every department. But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don't win there, you've got Brighton coming up and that's not an easy game the way they're playing at the minute.",
      "\"If you get a draw against Liverpool and then go and beat Brighton at home, you've gathered a bit of momentum and can they really kick on and use it as a catalyst to do something? How many times have we said that over the last six years? Would I like to see Amorim succeed, do really well in the back end of this season and maybe win a trophy? Of course. I'd love nothing more.\"",

      "This term, despite over £200million being invested in their attacking options, familiar problems remain, and the side find themselves in mid-table having suffered defeats in three of their seven fixtures so far. Amorim's appropriateness for the position has come under scrutiny, particularly given his determination to maintain his philosophy and display minimal flexibility.",
      "However, he continues to enjoy support from the boardroom and Ratcliffe appeared on The Times' Business podcast to emphasise that any hasty decision-making is unlikely to yield superior outcomes. The Ineos chief declared: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "But ex-United shot-stopper Foster questioned whether the absence of meaningful progress is being properly considered. He said: \"If I was a Man United fan, I'd be a little bit worried about that because, a club like Manchester United, it's always about progression.",
      "\"You've got to be seen to be progressing and as it stands at the minute they are not progressing. 10th in the league at the minute. It's just the lack of consistency.",

It's that consistency that they need to find. If they can start to do the three, four, five games winning in a row, then they can really shoot up the table. But as it stands at the minute, it's so hit and miss.\"",

      "Cunha has improved that aspect of his game - Wolves' coaches challenged him to improve when not in possession - but he isn't known for working tirelessly backwards and forwards.",
      "That's not to say Cunha doesn't work hard. He has demonstrated his willingness to work his socks off since signing for United, but Mount may be seen as the better option for Anfield.",
      "United is such a big club that rotating a player for tactical reasons can feel like a story - especially if that player is a relatively new signing and was signed for a multi-million-pound fee.",
      "The truth is Manchester City and Liverpool have dominated the Premier League due to their strength in depth. They regularly rotate players and there is no hysterical reaction when a player is benched.",
      "It won't be a big deal if Cunha is named on the bench again this weekend, it would merely be a selection decision made by Amorim to give United the best chance of leaving Anfield with a positive result.",

      "Manchester United were on the brink of signing England Under-21s star Liam Delap before a last-minute change of heart saw him join Chelsea instead, it has been claimed. It's been suggested that the prospect of playing Champions League football was a key factor in his decision to join the Blues after suffering relegation with former club Ipswich.",
      "United were tantalisingly close to securing their own Champions League spot, only to lose out in the Europa League final against Tottenham in Bilbao. Despite this setback, they've managed to attract top attacking talent to Old Trafford, but Delap may well be the first big name they've missed out on due to their European disappointment.",
      "The Mail reports that United's deal for Delap was '90% done'. A £30million release clause was triggered when Ipswich were relegated, and Ruben Amorim's side looked set to sign him until Chelsea stepped in.",
      "The same source also claims that Matheus Cunha - another player with a release clause which removed the need for haggling over price - was United's primary target. They secured that deal early on, also bringing Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko into the fold, although missing out on Delap could have had wider implications for the club's transfer strategy.",
      "Delap wasted no time in making his mark at Chelsea, scoring in a Club World Cup group stage win over Esperance. However, an injury has since hampered his Premier League progress, and he hasn't featured since suffering a hamstring injury against Fulham in August.",
      "United's new frontman Sesko has been gradually introduced, despite a shortage of alternative choices. It took until the Slovenian's sixth outing for him to find the net in the Premier League, though three of those appearances came from the bench.",
      "Sesko built upon his close-range strike at Brentford with a second United goal in the triumph over Sunderland in the final match before he and a number of United colleagues went away on international duty. That success propelled Amorim's squad back into the upper half of the table, though the heat remains on before Sunday's journey to Liverpool.",
      "\"Of course, he was anxious for his first goal,\" Amorim said of Sesko between the Brentford and Sunderland clashes. \"The thing I like most in Ben is, even when things are hard for him with the ball, he is working hard in every minute of the game. That is the most important thing in the moment.\"",
      "While United's fixture away to Liverpool will present a significant examination, Chelsea appear to have what seems on paper a more welcoming encounter when they return from the international pause.

      "Sport Central Audience Writer",
      "Peter Schmeichel has claimed that Manchester United made the wrong decision by signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig and, in turn, offloading Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli during the summer transfer window.",
      "Sesko, 23, made the £66.26million plus £7.36m in add-ons switch to Old Trafford in August. After a difficult start to life at United, the Slovenia international has found the net in each of his last two appearances.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund, 22, joined Napoli on a season-long loan deal back in September. Antonio Conte's side have an obligation to buy the forward should they qualify for the Champions League. Since his move to Naples, Hojlund has scored four times in his first six games, forming a dangerous partnership with Kevin De Bruyne in the process.",
      "Allowing Hojlund to leave and bringing in Sesko, though, is a decision that doesn't make sense to Schmeichel, who has criticised United for making such a move and hit out at the club's creative players for Hojlund's woes.",
      "\"The signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have had Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years,\" Schmeichel told BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "\"You only have to see what he's doing at Napoli with Kevin De Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with - he's scoring goals. I've consistently said this for two-and-a-half years - Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goal-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "Schmeichel added that there were more pressing concerns at United that needed to be addressed first, such as sorting out their goalkeeper position and defensive midfield area.",
      "\"We let him [Hojlund] go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service. You have spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don't have the No.6 we should have, and there's the goalkeeping position as well.",
      "\"This season alone we've conceded nine goals from goalkeeping errors,\" he added. \"When I played, when Edwin van der Sar played, when David de Gea played, the brief was win 10 points a season, you don't give points away.",
      "\"Why did we bring someone in that we didn't need? Because the head of recruitment comes from RB Leipzig [also Sesko's former club] and he's got to make a mark.\"",
      "For me, Schmeichel is bang on in the fact that United had more pressing issues to sort out first and should have signed a new goalkeeper and a central defensive midfielder before addressing the striker position.",
      "It's clear that United had to fix the goalkeeper department and sign a new elite No.1 with Andre Onana struggling and Altay Bayindir failing to impress. Although the Reds managed to bring in Senne Lammens late in the transfer window, it would have been preferred if a more experienced campaigner was signed earlier in the summer months.",
      "The same applies for a new midfielder, though United didn't even manage to bring a new one in and have opted to stick with Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo as their four options in that position. That is something that could prove to be a major mistake for United, who lack real strength and steel there.",
      "While I agree with Schmeichel in that sense, I do think that he is wrong in the opinion that United should have kept Hojlund and not signed Sesko.",
      "At one point last season, Hojlund went through a 21-game goal drought which lasted more than 22 hours. However you dress that up, it's nowhere near good enough for someone that is playing for United.",
      "Across his United career, Hojlund scored just 26 times in 95 appearances. His Premier League return was particularly poor, hitting 14 goals in 62 outings - averaging almost one every five matches.",
      "Schmeichel has put the blame on United's creative players for Hojlund's shortcomings in a Reds shirt, but I think the finger should be pointed at both parties, including the forward who, at times, looked lost.",
      "There is no surprise that Amorim decided to pick Joshua Zirkzee ahead of Hojlund, before the former Bologna man suffered a season-ending hamstring injury. Zirkzee seemed to suit Amorim's system much better.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo may have helped Hojlund to score more, but neither have the creative ability of De Bruyne, who has been able to conjure up several high quality chances for the Dane at Napoli.",
      "Sometimes you need the striker to create opportunities for himself and that is what Sesko has the potential to do and more so, at least, than Hojlund who it felt like needed top class service instead.",
      "I have no doubt that Hojlund is going to score a hatful of goals for Napoli in Serie A, but sometimes the fit isn't right for the player and that is what I think it was for him at United. Therefore, the right decision was made for him to be offloaded out loan and the Reds brought in another centre forward in the shape of Sesko.",

      "Manchester United are confident that a deal can now be struck to secure land around Old Trafford which would, subsequently, pave the way for their proposed new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "United's plans for the new state-of-the-art venue - which is initially expected to cost around £2billion - have been complicated by an ongoing problem with Freightliner, who own an important bit of land behind the Stretford End.",
      "According to reports from The Daily Mail, United have offered around £50million to buy the land while Freightliner are seeking a more ambitious sum of £400million - a fee the Reds feel as 'unrealistic'. United feel that a compulsory purchase order could eventually be made, in which case the government would intervene to set a fair price.",
      "However, the report added that the club have held 'constructive' discussions with Freightliner - and are optimistic about striking a deal 'within the coming months'.",
      "Should a deal be struck up, it would mean that United can press ahead with plans, which were drawn up by Lord Norman Foster, for a new stadium complex to be built.",
      "Even though that would be another positive step, United still need to find funding for their huge project which is anticipated to cost £2bn-plus. Despite this, the club hope the new venue, dubbed 'Wembley of the North', can be finished in time for the start of the 2030/2031 season.",
      "In July, it was revealed that United are considering introducing 'Personal Seat Licences' - a method that would see supporters charged up to £4,000 for the right to buy a season ticket at the new stadium.",
      "Fans are being asked for their feedback on a variety of areas including facilities and cost.",
      "Once the new stadium is constructed and opened, United's existing home is, in turn, set to be demolished. United would likely continue to be playing at Old Trafford until they move into their new stadium, however.",
      "Architects at Foster and Partners said the new stadium would feature an umbrella design and a new public plaza that is 'twice the size of Trafalgar Square'. The design will feature three masts described as \"the trident\", which the architects say will be 200m high and visible from the Peak District.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "In the summer, Rashford joined Barcelona from Man Utd on loan with an option to buy for around £30m.",
      "Barcelona decided to take a punt on Rashford after failing to acquire Nico Williams and Luiz Diaz, with the England international’s versatility and return to form at Aston Villa helping him secure his dream transfer.",
      "This transfer is paying off for Barcelona and Rashford as the forward has three goals and five assists in his ten appearances this season.",
      "Therefore, it currently seems pretty likely that Barcelona will sign Rashford permanently next year, though a report from Football Insider has revealed that there is a ‘stumbling block due to the financial pressure’ at the Spanish giants.",
      "Despite this, Rashford will reportedly ‘quit’ Man Utd even if his move to Barcelona ‘collapses’, with former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown claiming that “there will be no shortage of interest in him”.",
      "“It’s a sad thing from Man United’s point of view that I don’t see him coming back, but I have no doubt there are a lot of clubs keeping an eye on his situation,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "READ: ‘Petty’ Amorim ‘hate narrative’ debunked as 50 more stars in extended England World Cup ladder",
      "“If he doesn’t stay at Barcelona, there will be no shortage of interest in him, especially if he can keep up the form he has shown.",
      "“But ideally I think he’s got his heart set on staying at Barcelona and hopes he can stay there long-term, and if he keeps performing I don’t see why they wouldn’t keep him.”",
      "Romano, meanwhile, claims Rashford “could be open” to having a “different kind of salary structure” to “facilitate a potential move to Barcelona”.",
      "“In all the conversations he has had with Hansi Flick and in all the conversation also internally at Barcelona with people at the club, Marcus Rashford is being very clear his desire is to be a Barcelona player beyond this season,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Rashford is doing very well. He’s very happy with the club, with the coach, with the city, with the teammates, Rashford is loving his life at Barcelona and the idea for Rashford is to try to stay at Barca if they decide to keep him and if they will be able to reach an agreement with Man United, either triggered by their buy option of close to €30 million or to negotiate with United.",
      "“We will see what happens in summer 2026 if Barcelona want to keep Rashford. In that case, my understanding is that Rashford could also be open to have a discussion on a different kind of salary structure compared to his current one at Man United in order to facilitate a potential move to Barcelona.",
      "“Rashford already changed his salary structure in order to join Barcelona, but United are not paying his salary. Barcelona is paying the main part of the salary and the other part is something that Marcus Rashford decided to accept not to take in order to be a Barcelona player this season.",
      "“It’s still very early to predict the future of Rashford, but there is a very good feeling between Rashford, Barcelona and Flick. Obviously we have to see in the second half of the season what happens.",
      "“Nothing will be decided now in October, in November, in December, this is not the time to reach agreements for summer 2026. But the feeling now is very good.”",
      "Keane, Rooney and Neville all believe Rashford should look in the mirror before criticising Manchester United, but his Manchester United was theirs in name only.",
      "Rooney say Rashford blaming Man Utd for his “inconsistent” displays is an “easy” excuse and told the England international to look in the mirror.",

The choice of Lacey and Biancheri seems more about their slight builds than anything, they are still teenagers though so perhaps that always be the case and you only have to look at Amorim favourite Bruno to see that if you’re good enough then size doesn’t matter to him.",
      "The academy does have many other promising players and some might be very well suited to the current system. Where are your comments on Kone, Scanlon, or Ibragimov. The Fletcher brothers could do very well and so too Mantato. Its almost like you chose a few very specific examples to help push your Amorim hating narrative.",
      "You don’t actually care about the progress of these lads at all. We can see this in the total absence of concern for all those previous academy lads that didn’t make it at United. I don’t recall your furious letters demanding United change how they play for the delicate Shoretire and where was your anger for Andreas Periera, James Garner, and Angel Gomes.",
      "When it comes down to it your base argument is backward. The academy exists to produce players that are good enough for the first team. The academy adapts to the first team requirements, not the other way around. If some players make it then great, if they don’t then I’m sure they will have good careers elsewhere, that’s the simple fact of every academy. Trying to twist this into a negative against the current manager who you don’t like is just petty.\nDave, Manchester",

      "Hi Mailbox,",
      "It’s my view that the pool of England qualified players is deeper than I can ever recall. 10 years or so ago I think it was probably hard to find 50 plausible players to fill the ladder. I thought to myself today – ‘all of those 50 (apart from Phil) are perfectly plausible contenders for an England squad, I wonder whether we can get to 100’. So I tried that.",
      "Short answer is, no I don’t really think there are 100 plausible options there, but there might be 75. I’d be interested to know what others think!",
      "Here’s the list:",
      "51) Liam Delap – given the paucity of non-Harry Kane striking options, Delap will leap way into the top 50 if he can get fit and scoring. Big if, but he has the tools.",
      "52) Mason Mount – we know Tuchel likes him, and understandably so given his excellence in Chelsea’s European Cup winning campaign. Presses well, consummate team man, but significant competition in the attacking midfield means he would need to up his game significantly . This might be difficult in such a dysfunctional side as Man Utd.",
      "53) Benjamin White – has he declared himself available? Not sure. And possibly not getting enough minutes, given the form of the exemplary Timber. But has a great relationship with Saka and can defend well, thus ticking a couple of Tuchely boxes.",
      "54) Rico Lewis – despite being just 20 he has 62 Manchester City appearances and 5 for England, however he hasn’t made a squad for more than a year. He’s a skilled, adaptable operator but the feeling persists that he may be too physically slight for both Tuchel and Pep for his preferred full back and defensive midfield roles.",
      "55) Eric Dier – with 49 caps, he could be a leadershippy, experiencey squad pick in the mould of Jordan Henderson. He’s somewhat versatile and is still playing regularly in Ligue 1 and the Champions League. In a 26 man squad, he wouldn’t be the worst 26th man.",
      "56) Tyrick Mitchell – unlucky to only have two England caps, but could be hampered by playing as wing-back in a back three system that England are unlikely to deploy. He’s been integral for Palace and might deserve a chance in a position that is yet to be definitively claimed.",
      "57) Angel Gomes – a key man for Lee Carlsey, who used his passing skills as a crucial midfield pivot. He’s been surpassed by Elliott Anderson and probably Adam Wharton too, but he is playing Champions League football at Marseille and could be a decent option if required.",
      "58) James Maddison – badly injured, but could he play his way into contention by getting fit and firing by the end of the season? Probably not.",
      "59) Joe Gomez – it’s hard to believe he’s still only 28, but he’s a dependable and versatile defender who rarely lets Liverpool down when called upon. He’s suffered a bit with injuries, but given the form of Konate, I could easily see him getting a run in the Liverpool side, which could precipitate a return to the England reckoning.",
      "60) James Tarkowski – he’s a really good defender, in the head it and block it mould of Dan Burn, and like Burn he’s probably an underrated distributor too. A substantial England career might have passed him by, but I wouldn’t be concerned if I saw him in the squad.",
      "61) Rio Ngumoha – if he were to nail down the spot on the left of Liverpool’s attack, his talent is such that he could challenge Gordon and Rashford for a spot. This will probably happen one day, but it’s unlikely to be this season given he’s just 17.",
      "62) Jamie Gittens – frankly it’s a bit odd that a player signed for nearly 50 million from Dortmund by Chelsea is this low, but I haven’t really seen him do anything much in a Chelsea shirt as yet. Perhaps he’ll explode into life in time to make a late run into squad contention.",
      "63) Tyrone Mings – was thrown into the England Team in Euro 2020 (2021, really) and let nobody down. I can’t really see a repeat happening, especially given Villa’s form, but you never know.",
      "64) James McAtee – the captain of the successful England U21 side in the summer, he’s not really found his feet at Forest yet. He’s a tidy and skilled player, but will have to motor to warrant consideration in such a stacked position.",
      "65) James Garner – playing really well for Everton under Moyes and could definitely be a thought if messrs Anderson, Henderson and Wharton were all to get caught in some sort of freak yachting accident.",
      "66) Alex Scott – same as James Garner, really.",
      "67) Jadon Sancho – what has gone on with him? Chelsea paid money to avoid signing him permanently. Clearly, there is talent there. He showed that when loaned back to Dortmund, but he’s never shown it in the Premiership and that looks unlikely to change at Villa, who clearly only signed him in desperation.",
      "68) Tyler Dibling – a fun player to watch and a sensational dribbler, but currently doesn’t have the end product to truly push himself into contention. I’m not sure that will change this season, but am hopeful it may in the future.",
      "69) Archie Gray – acquitted himself well while playing out of position in a dreadful Spurs side last season, but has only played 72 premier league minutes this time round. A talented player who may go onto win many caps, but I suspect that his time is still to come.",
      "70) Callum Hudson-Odoi – he was stellar for Forest last season, and may even have deserved a return to the England fold, but Forest being quite so poor this time around cannot he helpful. Has the kind of pacy direct profile that Tuchel seems to value.",
      "71) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – he’s a nice player and a good signing for Everton. I’d be surprised to see him picked given all the talent in his position.",
      "72) Max Dowman – a generational talent. Unbelievably good for his age. But his age is currently 15. So yeah, bit early.",
      "73) Marcus Tavernier – who is the most unfairly overlooked English player in the Premiership? This guy. Consistently a strong contributor for the excellent Bournemouth, he’s in the top 15% of Premier league attacking midfielders for progressive passes, tackles, and aerials won. Will this be enough to get him in the England squad? Not a chance.",
      "74) Jacob Murphy – on the subject of being overlooked… if it was ever going to happen for Murphy, it was probably last season, where he received no sniff of a call-up despite 8 goals and 12 assists. Unfortunate really, but it’s not going to happen.",
      "75) Jacob Ramsey – Newcastle spent big money on him in the Summer and have wanted him for some time. He moves with the ball very well. However, he’s not really played much in the black and white, so doesn’t seem a likely prospect.",
      "76) Lloyd Kelly – it feels a bit weird that a Juventus first-team central defender is English and yet he is nowhere near the England squad, but here we are.",
      "77) Brooke Norton-Cuffy – funnily enough, he’s also been linked with Juve, and he has been looking a fine prospect for Genoa and the England u-21s. He can certainly get up and down the right touchline with aplomb and might feature one day. But not soon.",
      "78) Max Kilman – he’s been closer to the England team at points in the past. Doesn’t help that West Ham are faintly rubbish.",
      "79) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – his England career is probably a thing of the past. But we aren’t exactly replete with back up strikers, so a decent run of form could drive him upwards on this list. Do I think that’s likely? No.",
      "80) Jobe Bellingham – the lesser Bellingham, but not lacking in talent. He probably needs to stop his dad from bickering with the powers-that-be at Dortmund and put a sustained run of form together. Even if he does, it’s likely too soon for him.",
      "81) Jack Hinshelwood – always looks pretty good at Brighton and quite versatile too. I’d be quite surprised to see that translate into England caps in the short-to-medium term.",
      "82) Fikayo Tomori – if it was ever going to happen for Fikayo, it’s not now. Shame really. He was born in Canada – might be worth exploring that.",
      "83) Josh King – an ever present for Fulham this season and a lovely, balanced dribbler. Definitely too soon for him.",
      "84) Charlie Cresswell – played well for England u21s and a strong player for Toulouse. Probably needed a move to a bigger club if he was going to contend for the World Cup squad.",
      "85) Tyler Morton – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Lyon and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "86) CJ Egan-Riley – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Marseille and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "87) Omari Hutchinson – Forest signed him for biggish money after a ho-hum season for Ipswich. Looked excellent for the u21s. Doesn’t feel a natural fit for Dycheball if that’s what Forest see-saw into next.",
      "88) Eddie Nketiah – hasn’t really done much for Palace, but it’s probably a little hard when Mateta is an imperious first choice. Still, as with a few on this list if he puts a run of goals together, there may be a squad spot for the taking.",
      "89) Ryan Sessegnon – has been deputising ably for Antonee Robinson and it’s great to see him back to fitness and form, however it’s hard to see how that translates into becoming an England player.",
      "90) Anthony Patterson – haven’t named a goalkeeper in the above. I’d like to have done so but couldn’t think of one. Patterson isn’t even number one at Sunderland. Where have all the good English keepers gone?",

      "Hi there,",
      "Keir Starmer has condemned the decision by West Midlands Police to ban away supporters from Aston Villa’s home game against Maccabi Tel Aviv . Now, this decision seems to have been taken a) because there is a legitimate fear that protests against Israeli clubs’ participation in sporting events, in a diverse part of an inner city in the UK, could have public order implications, and more importantly b) because the last time these supporters played a fixture in Europe, they committed serious public order offences in Amsterdam.",
      "There are allegations and counter-allegations about the nature of the supporters’ behaviour in Amsterdam, but it seems that Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were in some cases the victims of racially-motivated abuse and violence, but also, and this is not denied by anyone, also the perpetrators of racially-motivated abuse and violence.",
      "You can have an opinion about whether or not Israeli clubs should be banned from international sporting competition (for the record, there’s a fairly compelling case that Israel have repeatedly violated FIFA and UEFA statutes, and there is the clear precedent of Russia who have been suspended from international competition following their invasion of Ukraine) and you can have an opinion about whether or not this decision is particularly risk-averse, but linking this, as both the Prime Minister and LOTO have, with anti-semitism is prima facie absurd, and actually quite dangerous.",
      "If supporters of an English football club rioted in another European City, and a subsequent European city’s authorities decided that they couldn’t be doing with them, then I don’t believe that the Prime Minister or Leader Of The Opposition would have anything to say about it at all. So why are they making a stand on behalf of supporters of a club from another nation?",
      "Maybe it’s the politicians who should be keeping politics out of football, not footballers past or present?\nDara O’Reilly, London",
      "",
      "Apologies for this, but I need to put my thoughts across on another instance of politics crossing into football so please feel free to stop reading at this point if you’re not interested or cba with it all.",
      "Yesterday my club Aston Villa put out a statement to say that on the advice of the Safety Advisory Group, fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv would not be allowed to attend our match with them in the Europa League on 6th November.  As someone who will be attending the match myself, I welcomed this decision on the basis that it has been made on safety grounds – for those that have never been to Aston, it is a heavily Asian populated area with quite a few mosques so the introduction of a set of fans who have previously been known for racist and aggressive behaviour abroad doesn’t require a lot of mental gymnastics to see how this has got the potential to be a very dangerous situation.  For anyone that isn’t aware, this makes for some very interesting reading.",
      "Now we have various politicians including our very own prime minister chipping in to say that the decision is wrong and “antisemetic” – but is it? Antisemitism is defined as “prejudice or hatred against Jewish people, which can manifest as hostile actions or rhetoric toward individuals, their property, or Jewish community institutions”.  I’m pretty confident in saying that this decision wasn’t taken based on the fact that Maccabi fans are Jewish but instead that a number of their fans are savages that can’t control themselves.  Yes you can station more police at Villa Park but what’s going to happen to the people who live in the surrounding area? How are you going to police every nearby street to ensure public safety? Whether you agree with it or not, there are more than a few houses with Palestine flags hanging from the windows in Aston – how do you see this playing out if/when Maccabi fans on their way to the ground walk past?",
      "To those that say “banning all fans is unfair to those who just want to support their team”, I don’t disagree with you but the moronic element don’t exactly wear badges or uniforms so what else do you do? Matches behind closed doors is one option, but then you’d have to do that for every game Maccabi play in Europe so why even take part?",
      "I honestly and truly believe that this decision has been made in the interests of public safety and for no other reason.  As I type this email, the government are “trying to find a way to reverse the ban” – assuming they are successful in doing so, I expect each and every one of them to be back on TV the following morning to be held responsible for making it happen and the carnage that will undoubtedly follow, which of course they won’t.  This is the equivalent of holding a lit match over a bucket of petrol, it’s really not going to end well at all.\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (Wondering how many of these politicians will be at Villa Park to see the match in person….)",
      "",
      "With the news that the West Midlands Police have decided that no Maccabi Tel Aviv fans will be allowed to attend the Europa league match against Aston Villa for safety concerns, has football now got a major antisemitism problem?",

      "In a country where we debate microaggressions and perceived threat of a national flag, where does actually being barred from attending football sit? As we all know it starts with antisemitism (Jews being the smallest of minorities in England circa 300k) and then other groups will be next…",

      "The Red Devils have been heavily criticised at the start of this campaign as they have lost three of their opening seven Premier League games, while they have suffered a shock Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Therefore, head coach Ruben Amorim has come under huge pressure and he remains one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked after United’s 2-0 win against Sunderland.",
      "This means Amorim and Man Utd need to follow up this win with more positive results, potentially starting with Sunday’s match against arch-rivals Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "Ahead of this match, Man Utd are tenth in the Premier League and five points adrift of the Champions League positions, but Stam has backed his former club to finish in the top four and finish ahead of Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "“I would pick Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Manchester United for the top four, with Chelsea in close contention,” Stam said in an interview with Sky Bet.",
      "READ: Amorim will sacrifice three academy kids ‘on the cheap’ to Newcastle after Ratcliffe pop",
      "“These five have the squads and consistency to compete for the Champions League places.",
      "“Bournemouth or Crystal Palace could make a push, but it’s hard to maintain that level through the season.",
      "“The big clubs will end up there again because of the quality of players they have in their squad.”",
      "As well as “the quality of players” in Man Utd’s squad, Stam reckons another factor in their favour is that “it’s still early” in the season and a “few wins can change everything”.",
      "“At the start of the season, I said the top four should be the target for Manchester United,” Stam added.",
      "“They’re only a few points off that, so it’s not a disaster. It’s still early; a few wins can change everything. Momentum and confidence come from back-to-back victories.",
      "“If they can build that, they can finish in the top six, maybe even top five, though it’ll be tough. Winning games is always the best medicine.”",
      "Stam has also explained why he thinks Arsenal can beat Liverpool to win the Premier League this season.",
      "“Arsenal can win the league this season,” Stam insisted.",
      "“Mikel Arteta has built a team with quality and a clear playing style that’s hard to play against. The owners have backed him, and you can see the progress.",
      "“They’ve spent a lot to strengthen, which shows ambition. Now they need to make that next step and by spending the amount they have, they’ve shown they want to take that next step.",
      "“With their depth, they can rotate and keep up the quality. They’re consistent with how they’re playing; they are top of the league and now they need to keep it up until the end of the season.",
      "“I wouldn’t say Mikel Arteta’s job should immediately be on the line [if Arsenal don’t win any trophies], but there will be pressure.",
      "“When you’ve been backed and invested heavily, expectations rise. The club will expect progress and trophies. When you are the manager of Arsenal, that’s what you know and that’s what you’re there for.",
      "“If that doesn’t happen, of course questions come. That’s normal in football. But there’s still a long season ahead, and they’re in a strong position.”"

They have also suffered an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",

      "“We’re still at $16, $17, and even that includes a speculative element to it.",

I think it helps our fans to understand that leadership is going to take a while. But at the same moment, I don’t like that, because it will give a feeling that we have time to work things out.",
      "“So I don’t want that feeling here in our club. Again, the most important thing is the next game. It’s good to feel the support, but we need to prove in football and especially in big clubs that every weekend we are ready to win games.”",

      "“99% of players, when things aren’t going well for them, we understand that it’s fine as long as they work hard,” Nicol told ESPN. “But he seems to be walking around in a daze. Those breaks with Cucurella, Salah is not even thinking about him and why is that?",
      "“It surely cannot be that he doesn’t get it or understand it, and there is certainly no way Arne Slot isn’t telling him to keep an eye on Cucurella as he liked to get forward.",

      "Slot instead said that both Florian Wirtz and Dominik Szoboszlai “are expected to defend” despite being attack-minded midfielders, putting the responsibility on them to cover for Salah rather than putting the defensive burden on the guy he knows is Liverpool’s game-changer.",
      "There’s nothing quite like a game against United to break Salah out of a funk – he’s got 16 goals and six assists in 17 games against the Red Devils – and two goals to send Egypt to the World Cup while becoming the all-time leading goalscorer in African World Cup qualifying won’t have done his confidence any harm.",
      "But Slot’s apparent refusal to alter the defensive expectations of his star man offers United and Amorim an opportunity to prey on the same weakness which saw Alejandro Garnacho and Cucurella get so much joy at Stamford Bridge last time out.",
      "Amorim could plump for either Matheus Cunha or Mason Mount as his inverted winger on that side, but the key man for the Red Devils could be Patrick Dorgu, who has shown some promise this season as a raiding left wing-back and could get some real joy against whichever right-back Slot and Salah hang out to dry.",

      "“We’re still at $16, $17, and even that includes a speculative element to it.",
      "“So the comments from Turki Al-Sheikh are intriguing, but the club has responded with a fairly heavy ‘no’, and given that it’s listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it’s got to be cautious about what it says publicly.",
      "“So I think it’s a bit of a false flag that we’re seeing. If somebody wanted to get involved in a bid then Twitter’s not the best place to put out that information.",

      "Journalist Ben Jacobs gave a comprehensive update on the potential takeover earlier this week, insisting that the Glazers have yet to receive an offer from any party.",
      "Jacobs said on The United Stand: “So the latest is as follows: number one, the Glazers have not had an offer from anybody.",
      "“Could they be holding talks behind other people at the club’s back? Absolutely. Are they advanced? No. And then where does the money come from? Well, Turki Al-Sheikh confirms something that we broke on this show, that it’s not Saudi Arabia.",
      "“I don’t want to disappoint the chat, but Sheikh Jassim is not coming back to the table. There is no possibility, I am told. And in addition to that, the number the Glazers want is in excess of 5 billion pounds. And if you go back through the SEC filing to look at the different bids from shape, none of the offers were anywhere close to that number.",
      "“And what makes the number higher is if, whilst this drag on clause is valid, the Glazers do sell. So Jim Ratcliffe is guaranteed $33 a share, which takes the overall valuation of the club to something around 4.7 billion.",
      "“So again, not far off that 5 billion pound number. And all of this means, if someone’s to buy the club now, they’re going to have to pay a premium, and then Sir Jim Ratcliffe would have to go buy a wanted 100% so there’s a few variables here.”",
      "Jacobs added: “The last thing, and the most interesting thing that I can add, and I think this counts as a bit of a United Stand exclusive, is that within the UAE, one company in particular is involved in these talks.",
      "“It’s unclear whether they will front the consortium, but international holding company or IHC, which has been around for about three decades, have been part of talks to put together a perspective of a UAE-based Consortium.",
      "“We don’t know whether anything is going to materialise. And as we said on talkSPORT a few weeks ago, some ex-Manchester United legends have also been sounded out not to invest, but just to be ambassadors.",

      "Jacobs continued: “I would just stress one thing really, clearly, it is nowhere near as advanced as Turki implied, nor have the Glazers had any kind of direct contact.",
      "“Yet there’s no guarantee this even develops into anything. But Eric Cantona is one of the names that has been approached.”",

      "Rashford impressed for Aston Villa on loan in the second half of last season and has three goals and five assists for Barcelona so far this term. After some all too predictable knee-jerk media nonsense claiming the La Liga giants were considering sending him back to United after his first couple of appearances, a narrative about-turn now sees Rashford’s displays as proof of the rotten core of the football club he departed in the summer.",
      "That’s a far more difficult concept for your Roy Keanes, Gary Nevilles and Wayne Rooneys to accept though.",
      "Upon upping sticks for Barcelona in the summer, Rashford claimed United were in “no man’s land” and that “the transition hasn’t started”, which riled Neville.",
      "“Let’s ignore that,” Neville said. “Because I don’t want to go into Marcus Rashford comments tonight. He was there at the club for 10 years and had his opportunity to impact the club. Ruben Amorim, this year, I think will do a good job. Marcus should concentrate on Barcelona.”",
      "Keane then questioned whether Rashford had the “intelligence” to succeed at Barcelona, asking: “Do you reckon he’s got enough football intelligence to go over there and adapt to a different league, different football, different lifestyle? Has he got that intelligence on and off the pitch to make it work?”",
      "The evidence so far suggests that Rashford does indeed have the required football nous to thrive at Barcelona, and while we may feel the need to caveat that as a result of a career beset with false dawns and inconsistency, all of that instability coming while playing for Manchester United allows for an easy hypothesis, as drawn by the man himself in response to Thomas Tuchel’s claim that the only think preventing Rashford from being seen as a world class talent is his lack of consistency.",
      "“For sure, consistency is a massive part of it,” Rashford said. “I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time, so it is even more difficult to be consistent.",
      "“When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything, not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life and the way you train. We have just had so many changes so far in my career.”",

      "Neither Keane nor Wayne Rooney, both captains of Manchester United, who led by example through their work ethic as well as their quality at Old Trafford, can conceive of a situation where the environment at their football club has turned so sour as to cause a player like Rashford to not be putting in the maximum amount of effort week in, week out.",
      "“Towards the end of his time at United, there was obviously issues. He was part of the problem with the environment, especially one of the most experienced players at United,” Keane said in response to Rashford’s comments.",
      "“He should have been setting the standards and showing new people at he club what it’s like to be a United player. But that’s been well documented. What we have to look at is he’s got this chance now with England and he deserved it.",
      "“No doubt about his talent, he’s obviously fantastic. But the bit that would have frustrated fans is his body language, not running back or not pressing properly. That’s the things he needs to tidy up and if he does there’s no reason he can’t become a world class player.”",
      "Rooney agreed with Keane, claiming Rashford should look at himself in the mirror rather than blaming United.",
      "Speaking on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, he said: “I think the environment hasn’t been right but that is down to yourself.",
      "“If you are not playing well or you get left out of the team then I think it is easier to blame the environment and whether that is right or wrong. I think that comes from how you apply yourself.",

      "“I might be wrong here, I really like Marcus as a lad and as a person but I think that is an easy one to throw at people.”",
      "But none of these United legends, who won countless major trophies in an atmosphere where they all drove each other to excel and improve, experienced anything like the lethargy, mockery and bleakness that Rashford had to endure at the club. His Manchester United was their Manchester United in name only.",
      "And they’re perfectly willing to accept that when discussing results, performances, problems with the manager, the directors and the general ethos of the club. But weirdly can’t then see how all of that upheaval might result in a footballer struggling for consistency.",
      "It makes us wonder a) how consistent they might have been in the last decade at United rather than the two before, and b) whether any level of brilliance from Rashford at Barcelona will be enough for them to admit that United was the problem and not him.",

      "Anyhoo, answers on a postcard or BTL very welcome.",
      "If the answer is “they just have to wait until this guy is sacked” that’s fine, but Lacey is 19 and needs to get a path to senior football soon. Which has vibes of “ones that got away” when we sell him to probably Newcastle or Everton on the cheap.\nBadwolf",

And before anyone says “yeah but, these groups are a joke, full of part timers etc etc, just maybe have a word with your most accessible Sweden or Italy fan, and ask them how it’s going.",
      "Tuchel is quite clearly, a decent, educated, well spoken (even when not using his native tongue) and most importantly, very successful football coach. So, what’s the problem with him?",
      "So far with the media, he has been open, honest, forthcoming and, more importantly, consistent about what he is trying to do and how he is trying to do it. Why not take the man for his word? Don’t forget, he has a very short-term contract, with a very clear target.",
      "It almost seems that if some training cones went missing from St George’s Park at the moment, Tommy T would be served with a Search Warrant for his garden shed.\nAndy FTM (Some San Miguel glasses were lifted from my pub on Sunday, but know it wasn’t Tommy T so no need to ask him at the next presser)",

      "When Sven Goran Ericsson ran slap into 2002 Peak Brazil, he probably had England’s  best team to date. Not so much the Golden Generation as propaganda would have it but he had figured out a decent balance with all the players available.",
      "Tuchel has made them balanced on both wings and made them fly. Oddly he’s leaning intelligently on Newcastle’s team while Sven was stuck with Manchester United’s Ferguson dripping poison in the ear of his boys for the England squad. Howe is nurturing a good set of hard working players in his squad that compliment what Tuchel needs. Gordon running up the left wing is a pleasure to finally see happen. What might have been against Spain in 2024? And he scored! Woltemade is a perfect sort of striker for Gordon as a proxy for Kane.",

      "‘and Kilbane told Best New Bingo sites via the Metro ‘ has to be the most hilariously low cost and naff place to have a quote lifted from so well done Kevin .",
      "Onto the forwards to replace Kane theme.  A champion at under 21 level Cameron Archer was not on the list,  then there is the 2012 Spain playing a non striker as a striker option where Cole Palmer , Phil Foden , Harvey Elliot and Curtis Jones come to mind , even Bellingham on first half a season at Madrid evidence could work .",
      "Nevertheless Ollie Watkins is fine and Liam Delap will improve .",
      "No one saw Harry Kane coming through until he did so the hext generation striker is probably ripping it up in an academy somewhere.",

      "There have been an interesting range of comments in recent mailboxes on Harry Kane, some focussing on his goalscoring prowess whilst others felt his barnet required closer evaluation (…“he’s a nifty, 50’s binman !” (© Shooting Stars..)).",
      "So I thought I would jot down a few thoughts from an older England fan’s perspective.",
      "There can be no doubting of the man’s goal-scoring prowess – that is undeniable and he remains one of the most clinical finishers around, as he has been for a number of years.",
      "However, I start to feel slightly more uncomfortable with certain messaging that I hear from parts of the media when they eulogise about his build up play, with it almost being painted that he should be allowed to do that because … because he’s Harry Kane ! .. record England goal-scorer … he can do what he wants !",
      "The guy can clearly play some great, incisive passes (an aspect of his game that has come more to the fore in the last few years), but that doesn’t mean he should be given full licence to drop into those positions away from the forward line for England to attempt that. What was clearly evident at the last Euro’s (where there were lots of calls for him to be dropped from the starting 11 during the tournament, me being one) was that he stodged up our build up play by dropping deep.",
      "I also think we need to recognise that one of the areas where England have a high talent pool relative to the world stage is at the number 10 / attacking midfield position – Rogers has had the shirt in the last couple of games, with the likes of Palmer, Bellingham and Eze patiently waiting (Palmer is the pick for me – such an intelligent footballer in terms of his ability to find pockets of space and defining attacking patterns of play). It would be disappointing to me if all 4 of those names don’t make the plane to the US.",
      "So, back to the job demarcation point. For me, Tuchel should be telling Harry that he wants him to play as a number 9 that predominantly plays within the width of the penalty area and in the attacking line. That should be his job, to finish the chances created by others – think of it like a Gerd Muller role who was one of the best there has been in terms of finding the onion bag, but who had a very talented German team behind him to give him those opportunities.",
      "If Kane could adopt that narrower role for England, I think it will improve our overall chances of success.\nSparky, LFC (liking what Tuchel is doing .. refreshing to see the manner he has selected squads / teams in recent times .. regardless of reputation, everyone needs to earn their place .. I can get behind that).",
      "",
      "I understand that it’s the interlull and everyone is bored but I thought the Neville/Flag War debate would be over on Football365 even though it raves in elsewhere.However, the initial article was very left wing and condescending to right wing readers in order to stir the pot and encourage readers to react. So, as much as I held back, here’s my tuppence worth.",
      "Now, Neville has every right to say what he said. Also people have the right to disagree with him. What’s amusing is that Neville in his dramatic video appears to be using ‘mirror politics  i e. having a go at ‘angry middle aged white men’ causing division when that’s exactly what he is.and what he’s doing (especially in Salford). Can’t he just express his views rationally father than impersonate Richard Ashcroft with his remix of ‘Bitter Sweet Symphony? I think Jaap Stam sums him up in his autobiography by calling both the Nevilles ‘busy c**ts’ implying they are both angry people who complain about this, that and everything! Also, Neville’s timing of his comment linking it to a degree with a  terrorist attack on Jews was inappropriate and wrong",
      "Extreme left wing people and extreme right wing people are as bad as each other but people with moderate views on both sides are more diplomatic.",
      "Regarding the flying of the flag, why should we be embarrassed?  Long before this palavour, on my way to a party way out in the sticks in Essex, I came out of the train station and was walking past a dignified house that had a large Union Flag on a poll in the front garden. I was touched and turned and saluted it.\nChris, Croydon",

      "After whinging in this mailbox that Johnny Nic should advocate for a salary cap and now seeing the PL is about to vote on (a soft version of) one, I think I need to whinge more about the changes I want to see in football. Presumably someone in here has influence and takes mailbox ideas straight to shareholder meetings. So here goes:",
      "1. Remove heading from the game. We know it’s terrible for kids’ brains, it’s probably not great for adults’ brains. It adds so little. In fact, only ~15% of premier league goals are headers. I think taking away defenders’ option to head the ball clear would increase the number of goals, at least initially.",
      "2. Remove penalties from the game. Foul in the box is just like a foul anywhere else. If an obvious goal is stopped a la Suarez v Ghana, just award a goal.",
      "3. Stop the clock when the ball is out of play. Everyone whinges about time-wasting. I read article after article about the ball only being in play for ~54% of time blah blah blah. Just make the game 60 mins and stop the clock. Add a “restart play” of 15s for throw ins, 30s for corners/free kicks in the attacking half.",
      "4. Ditch automatic VAR. Give the manager “challenges” like tennis or NFL, but you lose a sub if you get it wrong. Let them challenge ANYTHING; absolutely believe that throw in was the wrong call? Bet a sub on it. No subs left but you’ve just conceded a final minute winner that you think is bullshit? Too bad, you should have managed your challenges/subs better.",
      "Anyway, that’s more than my 2 cents worth. Would love to hear why I’m an idiot or what other changes should be implemented.\nZiggy (really need the international break to be over)",
      "",
      "After a chastening few days, I’ve realised that being told you’re an asshole might not be such a bad thing.",

      "The Spanish football federation president Rafael Louzan is trying to convince us that Barcelona playing in Miami is for the good of the game. Is it f**k.",
      "Fewer people are watching Match of the Day than ever before (because fewer people are watching TV than ever before).",

      "The Premier League is back! Well done, everyone, another international break survived. And now very nearly a month to luxuriate in delicious Barclays before the next one comes along. Lucky us.",
      "The football gods have seen fit to grant us a special treat this weekend as Liverpool and Manchester United bring their current very real if very different crisis experiences to an Anfield showdown that can only end with at least one team in the very deepest despair, while there’s plenty of other good stuff to be found around the country and indeed continent.",
      "And look at that, Ange Postecoglou is still here, just about. Who’d have thought it? Not us.",
      "Big Weekends always feel that bit bigger after a whole fortnight away, but this one would be worthy at any time of the year.",
      "",
      "We don’t know much about the fixture computer. We like to think it is in fact a kind of giant piece of factory machinery. In our heads, it is basically Bertha. In reality, it’s probably just a laptop, isn’t it?",
      "That’s very boring. We prefer to think of Bertha spitting out the fixtures, thank you very much. What we do know, of course, is that the fixtures computer is a mischievous scamp with a keen sense of humour.",
      "And we wonder whether it has some kind of ‘post-interlull’ setting. Because, god bless it, the fixture computer always seems to deliver a proper big bastard of a Super Sunday primetime game as a little treat to us all for surviving the barren fortnight.",
      "It was the Manchester derby in September. Next month, it’s the North London Derby. And now, we get the really big one. El Crisico. Mini-crisis v maxi-crisis. Liverpool v Manchester United.",
      "Bertha, you are spoiling us.",
      "It really has come at an ideal time for absolutely everybody apart from Liverpool and Manchester United. Whoever loses, we all win.",
      "Either Liverpool’s mini-crisis gets upgraded, or Manchester United once again miss the chance to find that elusive second successive Premier League win in a row under a manager who has openly admitted the inability to do something as basic as win two Premier League games in a row is now living in their head. Not rent-free, Sir Jim would never allow that. But it’s there nonetheless.",
      "Or, and this feels most likely given Liverpool are suddenly quite unsure of themselves and Manchester United aren’t very good, neither of them get the perspective-altering win they need and it’ll be a draw like it has been in each of the last two seasons. And that’s no good for either of them, really.",
      "It is, in short, the perfect game to headline the first weekend back after the international break.",
      "",
      "Back-to-back home Premier League wins over Fulham and Burnley to go with a couple of welcome early successes in the Europa League have significantly lifted a previously gloomy mood at Villa Park.",
      "With Villa and Forest – about whom more later in the most obvious possible way – we’ve seen almost sarcastically perfect evidence of how the Europa League can work for good or ill for a struggling team.",
      "You can be Aston Villa, and see the Europa League help you get that winning feeling back, restore some confidence and watch that flow through rejuvenated players who suddenly see that Thursday-Sunday schedule as more opportunity than chore. Or you can be Forest, and have European competition simply represent the opportunity to be humiliated and embarrassed twice a week instead of just the once, exacerbating and further highlighting all the obvious and, let’s be fair, largely self-inflicted problems you currently face.",
      "It is definitely better to be Villa. Having thus been able to enjoy the interlull, as much as any of us can, on the back of a far more encouraging set of results than had previously been the case, now comes crunch time.",
      "Have Villa actually turned a serious corner, escaping from the funk that had enveloped them since such a costly missing out on Champions League football at the end of last season? Or have they just had a couple of winnable Europa games chucked in with a couple of quite gentle home Premier League games?",
      "Villa’s trip to Spurs on Sunday afternoon should tell us a fair bit about both sides. A pre-collapse Tottenham spangled Villa 4-1 at WHL 2.0 last November, but since that result they have a truly astonishing home record in the league. And not in a good way.",
      "They have won only three of 17 Premier League games at their own stadium in the 11 months since handing Villa that beating, with only teams as thoroughly outmatched as Southampton and Burnley or as thoroughly ridiculous as Manchester United failing to leave with anything at all.",
      "Even this season, one in which Spurs appear far less silly than in recent years, they have managed only four points from home games against Burnley, Bournemouth and Wolves while taking 10 points from their four away games.",
      "This is a big chance for Villa. There is perhaps no better fixture around at the moment for sitting right in the sweetspot of one where a positive result would feel like compelling evidence that things have decisively changed for the better while also being a game where such a result is relatively straightforward to obtain.",
      "",
      "It’s him until it isn’t. Still doesn’t have a win, still somehow does have a job, probably won’t if he can’t cobble together some kind of a result against Chelsea. Probably won’t cobble together some kind of a result against Chelsea.",
      "Watching Nottingham Forest this season has already reached that uncomfortable stage where you feel quite bad about even looking, like you’re intruding on something deeply personal.",
      "Maybe we really should all just… not watch. Let them work through whatever this is they’re going through in some kind of peace.",
      "Instead, we’re making Ange Postecoglou our manager to watch, again, because it is just so horribly fascinating to see, in real time, something go horribly wrong that everyone knew would go horribly wrong in the exact way – on, if anything, an accelerated timeline – it is going horribly wrong.",
      "",
      "There’s something about Gyokeres that is just unbeatably Modern Football. Not him as a player, but as a concept. In Gyokeres we have the clearest example yet of a player who had been judged, weighed and measured before he arrived at Arsenal. Battle lines were drawn, a culture war declared, and nobody will budge.",
      "He is either the final piece in the puzzle or a massive flop. No other outcome will be considered or tolerated, and most importantly nothing he actually does or doesn’t do on the pitch will shift anyone from the opinion that they formed and hardened and crystallised before he’d even worn the shirt.",
      "Goals he does score are either given far greater significance than they truly merit, or are ignored altogether, depending on your position.",
      "One criticism we’ve heard a bit already, and expect to hear more of, is that he scores the Wrong Goals. It’s entirely possible he’ll become the first Premier League flop to score 20 goals in his debut season.",
      "It’s a clever ruse, because initially it sounds quite reasonable when a Troy Deeney or some other such loud radio opinion-haver says he needs to score in a ‘big game’ or that Arsenal didn’t sign him to score late gloss-adders in 5-0 wins over Leeds.",
      "But it’s just guff, isn’t it? Sure, at some point it would be good to see him score in a ‘big game’ against ‘top opposition’. But the idea that Arsenal signed him specifically to do that and only that is, when given even a second’s actual thought, bumwash. Obvious bumwash at that.",
      "And this weekend’s trip to Fulham is in fact a textbook example of precisely the kind of fixture they also really need him to make a difference.",
      "Arsenal haven’t failed to win any of the last three league titles (only) because of not winning all the games against the best teams. It’s (also) because of points dropped at places like Fulham.",
      "Arsenal haven’t won here in either of the last two seasons, and Fulham haven’t lost here this season. Something to bear in mind there after Gyokeres’ winning goal this weekend is airily dismissed a fortnight down the line as the wrong kind of goal by those who’ve already made up their minds.",
      "",
      "The fact the three teams promoted into last season’s Premier League and then instantly sent packing back to the Championship were so very wretched was disastrous for last season’s top-flight relegation battle, but is already proving a significant boon for this season’s Championship promotion fight.",
      "Relegated teams should, very obviously, have a huge advantage when stepping back down in class. Off the field with your parachute payments and such, and on the field where even decimated squads will still contain the occasional gleam of Premier League sparkle.",
      "But none of the three teams who went down last season are in any kind of position to now set about dominating the Championship, with the result that an already unpredictable division is now more wide open than usual.",
      "Coventry and Middlesbrough are a pleasingly early Carling pair of potential Premier League returnees currently setting the pace, but there is only two points separating Leicester, who sit third despite themselves, and Bristol City down in tenth.",
      "Between them sit a whole bunch of clubs trying to get back to the top flight after absences of various degrees and those hoping to enjoy a delicious foaming pint of Barclays for the very first time since football was invented all the way back in 1992.",
      "The pick of Saturday’s lunchtime crop pits one from each camp against each other in a London derby as QPR host Millwall. Two places but a single point separate them going into the weekend, and for both sides there exists a tantalising chance to take first-mover’s advantage and jump through this currently tightly-packed bunch in and around the play-off spots.",
      "",
      "Der Klassiker is always a key moment in any Bundesliga season, but this one already carries significant weight. It’s very early but still feels very correct to say this is a game that will tell us whether or not there is any prospect of an actual title fight in Germany this year, or simply a Bayern Munich procession.",
      "Bayern have made a ludicrous start to the season, winning 10 straight games in all competitions and scoring a truly absurd amount of goals in the process. Luis Diaz has scored five goals in his first six Bundesliga games for the club, and that’s as many as anyone from any other club in the division has managed this season. It’s still not half as many as Harry Kane has plundered.",
      "Only three of the other 17 Bundesliga clubs have managed more than the 11 goals Kane has to his name, and Dortmund with 12 just about join that collective.",
      "More significantly, or at least Dortmund must hope, they have conceded only four goals in their six games. It’s not quite the unstoppable force meeting an immovable object, but it does represent a stiffer domestic challenge than a Bayern attack that has scored at least three times in each of its six straight league wins this season has thus far encountered.",
      "A win for Dortmund closes the gap at the top of the table to a single point and makes things interesting. The far more likely outcome, another goal-laden Bayern victory featuring a Kane penalty or three, will see the champions move seven points clear of Dortmund, at least six clear of anyone else, and disappearing once again over the horizon.",

      "Nottingham Forest boss Ange Postecoglou vented at a press conference about his future at the club and how he’s been treated since leaving Tottenham.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been working on a ‘secret’ Manchester United mission for ages but it’s public knowledge now, while Liverpool are always transfer geniuses.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe clearly doesn’t rate the Manchester United academy and Ruben Amorim has an inflexible system, so there is concern over three young stars.",
      "Big Ange is on very thin ice as reports reveal the details on the ‘decisive’ game, the players’ ‘mood’ at Forest and who Marinakis ‘favours’."

      "The pick of the fixtures this weekend is Manchester United’s trip to Anfield at prime time on Sunday, while we have our first relegation six-pointer.",
      "Here are five questions we want answers to this weekend:",
      "For the cricket fans out there, we are getting to the time pre-Ashes series where members on both sides of the Poms/Aussies divide gravitate towards a microphone to produce some quotes that may or may not have sounded funnier in their heads.",
      "Ange Postecoglou has never had to seek out the microphone, with his straight-talking ‘mate’ style making him the delight of some sections of the media, but by the time the first ball is bowled in Perth, Ange may be back on that beach he apparently hates.",
      "It’s not been an ideal start to life in Nottingham. Seven games with zero wins and five losses seems par for the course for a manager who finished 17th last year, but Mr. Marinakis wanted the Europa League-winning version of his fellow Greek.",
      "If Ange is not entirely to blame considering he was given a squad set up to play almost entirely the opposite of the way he wants to, it’s getting to the point where questions are asked of how long this can go on for.",
      "Forest are hovering dangerously close to the drop zone, just one point away from it, and with 18th-place Burnley playing Leeds this weekend, there is a good chance that come Saturday evening, Forest are in the bottom three.",
      "To prevent that, Postecoglou’s Forest will likely have to get some kind of result against Chelsea in Saturday’s lunchtime kick off. That’s the Chelsea that beat Liverpool last time out and the club Postecoglou has lost to all four times he has tried.",
      "Marinakis reportedly has options waiting in the wings, and if Postecoglou’s win rate remains at zero, he may well be back out of a job.",
      "The hot seats of management will feel extra warm at Anfield on Sunday afternoon when Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United arrive to face Arne Slot’s Liverpool.",
      "A month ago, this would have seemed like the easiest of home wins for a Liverpool side that has not lost against United at Anfield for a decade, but three defeats in a row have given Slot his first crisis since moving to England.",
      "Peeling away from the numbers, Liverpool may be one point off top, but they have looked unconvincing in the majority of their matches, with the form of Mo Salah a particular concern.",
      "Slot says teams have begun to play differently against his side, but that is the challenge of being a top-level manager. A title in your first season means you are safe from the sack for the foreseeable future, but another disappointing result on Sunday and there will be questions of whether the Dutchman has been found out.",
      "As for the other dugout, there are no such guarantees surrounding Amorim. This is the exact kind of match that you could see United somehow winning, but you can just as easily see them being hit — if they depart Liverpool off the back of a 5-0 thumping, Amorim’s position may well not be tenable.",

      "Things have picked up since then but only in the form of two points and Wolves are in real danger of being the first non-promoted side to be relegated since 2023.",

      "This weekend Wolves travel to Sunderland in a game that feels like an early six-pointer. The problem for Wolves is that the Black Cats have not got the memo about promoted sides going straight back down and are currently ninth in the table.",
      "Wolves’ first match against a promoted side saw them get thumped 3-1 at home by Leeds but we are getting to the stage of the season where you can start to be left behind.",
      "Anything less than a win will keep Wolves bottom with  more than one eye on the drop.",
      "The first Champions League win of the season coupled with a 2-0 home win against Forest left Newcastle with a lot of good vibes heading into the international break and yet, in one of the more unbelievable facts of the season so far, they are still somehow behind Manchester United in the table.",
      "A ‘disastrous’ summer transfer window that was actually quite good may have contributed to their slow start but with five points separating them and the top four, it is time for Newcastle to put a run together.",
      "They have a favourable run of fixtures coming up with Brighton, Fulham, West Ham and Brentford next while Nick Woltemade is not looking like an ‘idiotic’ signing.",
      "With Yoane Wissa still out, the giant German is Newcastle’s main goal threat but Eddie Howe has at his disposal one of the best midfields in the league and a solid defensive line behind them.",
      "Brighton have proven to be a bit of a bogey team for top four contenders so far this season, beating City and Chelsea while drawing to Spurs, so a win away would boost Newcastle’s Champions League credentials.",
      "Manchester City are about as confusing as they have ever been under Pep Guardiola.",
      "Up until about 12 months ago, you would have bet everything you owned on them being a title contender but a Rodri-inspired collapse has resulted in a lot more trepidation around them when heading into this campaign.",
      "That doubt proved fair when they lost two of their opening three games but since then, City have quietly been the form team in the league.",
      "Three wins out of four has been helped by having a Norwegian scoring machine up front with Erling Haaland finding the net in his last 10 games. City’s style has also clearly changed to get the best out of him. Whereas in the past, Haaland would have been fed in after a series of short, intricate passes, now they are not against pumping it long to the big man.",
      "Haaland’s ability was never in question so now it is a test of whether this new-look City side can pose a serious title charge. Bookies still have them as third favourites and they are fifth, three points off leaders Arsenal.",
      "City have a favourable few games ahead in the form of Everton at home and Aston Villa away which they should be winning comfortably if they want to set their stall out as genuine contenders.",

For all the problems at United right now, I think Baleba would have benefited from that step up. He really is going to be the next top player. I’ve watched him a few times, and I hope he has good people around to advise him.",
      "“He can play with both feet, and at his young age, what he needs to focus on is his decision-making. What we need to see is that he has the awareness and maturity to make the right decisions consistently. If he keeps up with that, he’ll be a very good player.",

      "But this is far from guaranteed, as Liverpool have shown a severe lack of balance following their £400m+ summer overhaul and most of their top stars are underperforming.",
      "Therefore, Man Utd have a decent opportunity of causing an upset if they turn up at Anfield, so supporters would have had a feeling of dread upon hearing that Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo and Casemiro ‘missed full training’ on Thursday.",
      "Certain scaremongering outlets have made it seem that these players have injuries and could miss Sunday’s match, but this is not the case at all.",
      "Instead, Man Utd have purely taken the precautionary measure of making their returns gradual after travelling back to England from international duty.",
      "The report adds:",

      "According to reports, there has been an “approach” to a Manchester United legend, who is in “direct talks” over his involvement in a potential takeover.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s minority takeover of Man Utd was initially met with huge positivity, though he has become an incredibly unpopular figure.",
      "The INEOS chief owns a stake in the region of 29% and has taken control of football operations at Old Trafford, while the Glazer family remain in the background.",
      "Ratcliffe has become unpopular by sanctioning a major cost-cutting programme to balance the books at Man Utd, but has brutally made staff cuts, reduced payments to club legends and hiked ticket prices.",
      "Therefore, a large portion of United’s fanbase got excited when Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh claimed that a new takeover is ‘advanced’.",
      "There have since been conflicting reports on a potential deal, but journalist Ben Jacobs has moved to clear up a few key details.",
      "Jacobs has confirmed that talks are not “advanced”, though a group from the UAE is interested, while a “few variables” set the full takeover price.",
      "“So the latest is as follows: number one, the Glazers have not had an offer from anybody,” Jacobs said on The United Stand.",
      "READ: Man City would face 23-point deduction as Man Utd, Chelsea also in breach of £546m PL ‘salary cap’",
      "“Could they be holding talks behind other people at the club’s back? Absolutely. Are they advanced? No. And then where does the money come from? Well, Turki Al-Sheikh confirms something that we broke on this show, that it’s not Saudi Arabia.",
      "“I don’t want to disappoint the chat, but Sheikh Jassim is not coming back to the table. There is no possibility, I am told. And in addition to that, the number the Glazers want is in excess of 5 billion pounds. And if you go back through the SEC filing to look at the different bids from shape, none of the offers were anywhere close to that number.",
      "“And what makes the number higher is if, whilst this drag on clause is valid, the Glazers do sell. So Jim Ratcliffe is guaranteed $33 a share, which takes the overall valuation of the club to something around 4.7 billion.",
      "“So again, not far off that 5 billion pound number. And all of this means, if someone’s to buy the club now, they’re going to have to pay a premium, and then Sir Jim Ratcliffe would have to go buy a wanted 100% so there’s a few variables here.”",
      "The “most interesting thing” revealed by Jacobs is that United legend Eric Cantona has held “direct talks” with the group and has been “approached” about “coming on board”.",
      "“The last thing, and the most interesting thing that I can add, and I think this counts as a bit of a United Stand exclusive, is that within the UAE, one company in particular is involved in these talks,” Jacobs added.",
      "“It’s unclear whether they will front the consortium, but international holding company or IHC, which has been around for about three decades, have been part of talks to put together a perspective of a UAE-based Consortium.",
      "“We don’t know whether anything is going to materialise. And as we said on talkSPORT a few weeks ago, some ex-Manchester United legends have also been sounded out not to invest, but just to be ambassadors.",
      "“And quite interestingly, some, I think they’ll be excited to others, I think they will almost feel the optics of this are not quite right because of the kind of personality he is. One ex-Manchester United legend in particular has held direct talks about maybe coming on board.”",
      "He added: “I would just stress one thing really, clearly, it is nowhere near as advanced as Turki implied, nor have the Glazers had any kind of direct contact.",
      "“Yet there’s no guarantee this even develops into anything. But Eric Cantona is one of the names that has been approached.”"

      "🔴 Amorim's system could trouble Liverpool💪 Merino showing his value to Arsenal🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Ruben Amorim's system continues to dominate the discourse around Manchester United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw but it might just work in his side's favour when they face Liverpool on Super Sunday.",
      "Arne Slot's side, on an uncharacteristic run of three consecutive defeats, tend to find playing against back threes more difficult.",
      "The issue has been most apparent against Crystal Palace, one of few other Premier League sides who habitually deploy a back three. Liverpool are winless in three games against them if you throw in the penalty-shootout defeat in the Community Shield in August.",
      "Even the five Premier League games Liverpool have won against back threes since the start of last season, away at Crystal Palace, Southampton and Burnley and at home against Wolves and West Ham, have been nervy affairs settled by one-goal margins.",
      "Manchester United have of course caused problems for Slot's side too, securing a 2-2 draw on their last visit to Anfield in January, when they used their wing-backs to create overloads in wide areas in a performance described by Gary Neville as their best under Amorim.",
      "They will return to Anfield as underdogs on Sunday. Amazingly, Manchester United are yet to win back-to-back Premier League games under Amorim. But their last visit offers a blueprint to follow and they typically fare better in these kinds of assignments.",
      "In fact, in Premier League games in which they have had less possession than their opponent under Amorim, Manchester United's win rate is nearly twice as high as when they have had more, while their loss rate drops from 64 per cent to 25 per cent.",
      "The numbers are of course influenced to some extent by game-state. A team holding a lead is more likely to relinquish possession, just as a team trailing is more likely to have more of it as they try to open their opponent up and find a way back into the game.",
      "But the trend is not unique to Manchester United.",
      "Since the start of last season, Premier League sides using back threes have had less possession, on average, in games they have won and drawn compared to the games they have lost.",
      "It supports the argument that a back three is a reactive system, and at its most effective, at least in most cases, when used as a means to absorb pressure and spring forward quickly using transitions.",
      "Whether it is the right approach for a club of Manchester United's stature in the long-term is debateable. On Sunday against Liverpool, though, it probably offers their best hope of getting a result.",
      "The 29-year-old made it six goals in four appearances for Spain with his double against Bulgaria on Tuesday. Only Erling Haaland and Memphis Depay have scored more times in European World Cup qualifying. Merino's tally is equal to Harry Kane's.",
      "His eye for goal is not new. Merino has scored 16 times in 35 games for club and country since his late double in Arsenal's 2-0 win over Leicester in February, when he was pressed into the role of striker for the first time following an injury to Kai Havertz.",
      "The positional change proved transformative for Merino, who had never previously played up front. But his goals for Spain have come from midfield and so did his latest for Arsenal, the headed equaliser in the late victory over Newcastle at St James' Park.",
      "Merino excels at timing his runs into the box. \"He can smell danger,\" said Mikel Arteta in February. But his extraordinary aerial threat, showcased again with his headed double against Bulgaria, is not his only weapon when it comes to finishing scoring chances.",
      "Spain's Luis de la Fuente uses the same term. \"He is so complete, we are lucky to have him,\" he said. Merino's value to Arteta is similarly clear. But it is fair to say perceptions externally are not universally positive. He continues to be mischaracterised as a defensive player, his selection seen by some as a symbol of conservatism.",
      "Merino is not a fleet-footed creator in the mould of Eberechi Eze or Martin Odegaard, that is true. But he would not be starting every game for Spain if he lacked technical ability and his off-the-ball qualities are invaluable in pressing opponents high up the pitch.",
      "Goals are of course the most important currency of all and, in Merino's case, it is worth noting context as well as volume.",
      "He counts Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle, Real Madrid, France and Netherlands among the teams he has scored against over the last eight months. His eight Premier League goals have won Arsenal twice as many points as any other player's.",
      "It all adds up to make him vitally important to both club and country, despite fierce competition for places on both fronts. It would be no surprise to see him show his value again at Craven Cottage.",
      "Donyell Malen was Aston Villa's match-winner as his double clinched a 2-1 victory over Burnley in their last game and he added another goal for Netherlands during the international break.",
      "He has had to be patient since arriving at Villa from Borussia Dortmund in January but looks ready to belatedly make his mark in the Premier League with Spurs next up on Sunday.",
      "Last week's column examined Mohamed Salah's dip for Liverpool and why he's missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. There was also a look at Arsenal's formidable defensive numbers this season and Graham Potter's unceremonious end at West Ham.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and sees value in backing Man Utd at Liverpool.",
      "Ange Postecoglou's arrival at Nottingham Forest came with big promises of high tempo, pressing and attacking football but so far what we've seen is a defence creaking under the pressure of playing Postecoglou's style. Forest are leaking goals at a rate of 2.1 per 90 minutes since the Aussie took charge.",
      "So my eyes are drawn to the anytime goalscorer market for Chelsea. Enter Alejandro Garnacho at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Chelsea under Enzo Maresca are looking to use wide players more than Garnacho was utilised at Manchester United - here, he can stretch defences and find more one-vs-one opportunities. Garnacho has already shown glimpses in his early appearances that he could be the next player to flourish away from the Old Trafford spotlight.",
      "Given the defensive issues at Forest and Garnacho's knack for getting in the right place at the right time, he looks great value to score with Sky Bet in a game that should sail past the over 2.5 goals line.",
      "Being ahead of a curve is the name of the game when trying to consistently beat the market. And betting against Brighton before it becomes trendy to do so is very much a tactic on my radar.",
      "Yes, they are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are. Brighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.5 expected goals per game over the last 14 Premier League matches - that's the worst per-90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.",
      "Their pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 19 Premier League games, too.",
      "The fact we can get a team as reliable and dangerous as Newcastle at 10/11 on the draw no bet makes this best-bet-of-the-weekend material.",
      "Every so often in the Premier League, a fixture becomes more than just three points. There's six points on offer here.",
      "Both clubs know a win shifts momentum, belief and in many cases season trajectories. And these 'six-pointers' very often produce open, high-intensity, attacking football - something which isn't portrayed by the market.",
      "The last 33 'six pointers' in the Premier League - a subjective definition of the fixture - has seen an average of 2.8 goals scored. When assessing the odds, the 6/5 being dangled by Sky Bet on over 2.5 goals being scored is hard to resist.",
      "Both sides have quietly made a habit of turning this fixture into a cure for insomnia. The last nine meetings between the two have all landed for under 2.5 goals backers with just a measly total of 10 goals scored in those nine meetings.",
      "And Palace are fast becoming a friend of the under-goals backer with Oliver Glasner building such a watertight defensive unit. Across their last 17 games in all competitions the average match goals sits at just 1.85 per 90.",
      "The market hasn't quite caught up with just how consistently dull this fixture has been. Under 2.5 goals should be shorter than it is at 10/11 with Sky Bet and represents the best angle into what looks set to be a tight, cagey contest.",
      "Jake O'Brien vs Jeremy Doku is shaping up to be a mismatch and one punters should be looking to profit from.",
      "If O'Brien emerges from this duel with clean shorts, his shoes on the right feet and a clean sheet, I'll tip my betting cap to him. But I'd rather side with reality and back him to get carded at 7/2 with Sky Bet, a price that screams value.",
      "Doku isn't just a livewire, he's a walking yellow card generator. The Belgian winger has been fouled 2.43 times per 90 in the Premier League this season and he is the reason why opposition right-backs and right centre-backs have picked up a card in six of City's seven games he's featured in.",
      "The numbers and the eye test both agree: Wolves are far better than their results suggest.",
      "There's a case to be made that Vitor Pereria's team have far more in the tank than the league table currently shows.",
      "Wolves have taken just two points from seven games but the expected points, based on their underlying metrics provided by Opta, show they should have seven points in the bag.",
      "That type of gulf usually evens itself out across a season and it is something to profit from.",
      "The chances are being created in attack and restricted to a good level in defence, so it's just the finishing touch of the Wolves strikers and very efficient finishing of opposition strikers that has been costing them in what is a fine-margin sport. When a little bit of regression to the mean kicks in, results will follow.",
      "Starting here, where they are 21/10 with Sky Bet for the away win.",
      "Arsenal have only conceded three goals in 10 games in all competitions - they are shipping the fewest goals per game of any team in Europe's major leagues. We shouldn't be surprised though as Mikel Arteta has been overseeing what has been one of the best defensive teams we've ever seen in the Premier League for three seasons now.",
      "That's why backing them to win matches along with the under 3.5 goals angle thrown into the mix at a juicier price is the smart way to boost Arsenal's outright win price here from 1/2 to 6/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "They dominate territory, limit chaos and once they get their noses in front, they manage games like a team with title-winning maturity. Across their last 18 wins in all competitions, 16 have landed for punters who have added the under 3.5 goal line into the equation. It should land again.",
      "The international break can be a problem for some managers - not Unai Emery.",
      "Aston Villa are unbeaten in the last 10 Premier League games after an international break, winning eight. Whatever Emery does in this fiddly time for managers is working wonders.",
      "Meanwhile, Spurs' encouraging start to life under Thomas Frank has been somewhat undermined by a pair of disappointing results in their last two Premier League home games after being battered by Bournemouth and only drawing with Wolves courtesy of a last-minute equaliser. It means Spurs have won just three of their 17 Premier League home games since November last year.",
      "Villa are an obvious play on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "The markets haven't quite woken up to just how sharp Amad Diallo has looked recently, nor how well he's linking up with Bryan Mbeumo, who's become his perfect foil in United's new-look attack.",
      "There's a real chemistry brewing here.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo might not have been the attacking duo many expected to define this United side, but their movement and understanding has been electric and could just be the catalyst for Ruben Amorim.",
      "At 9/2 to score with Sky Bet, the value's there on Amad.",
      "And against a Liverpool side that's been anything but watertight down their left flank, this looks the perfect storm for the United hotshot to make a big statement.",
      "Liverpool will, as always, dominate territory and possession but that only increases the space Amad can exploit on the counter. Pair that with his on-field connection with Mbeumo and United have the tools to create more problems for Liverpool, who do look short at 4/7 with Sky Bet for maximum points.",
      "West Ham are in 'season-defining' territory already.",
      "The Hammers are winless in eight home Premier League games, a run that played a huge part in Graham Potter losing his job. It's their longest winless run since moving to the London Stadium and, in its current miserable guise, the place feels a world away from Upton Park.",
      "When you're knee-deep in a relegation scrap, you don't need talk of 'underlying numbers' - you need street-fighting survival football. Nuno Espirito Santo brings exactly that.",
      "Call it what you want - reactive, pragmatic and at times boring - but it's effective when backs are against the wall. West Ham need points and Nuno will bag them plenty based on his body of work. The home win looks the call here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",

      "With Portugal set to qualify for next summer's World Cup, and with two years to go on his Al-Nassr contract, Ronaldo is projected to become the first player in recorded history to reach the 1,000-goal mark in October 2026 based on his current scoring rate.",
      "Ronaldo's opening goal against Hungary was his 181st with his weaker left foot. His second was his 608th with his right.",
      "His double demonstrated his all-round threat attacking threat and Ronaldo is of course similarly dangerous aerially, with 157 of his goals, roughly 17 per cent, having come with his head.",
      "His goals have been split relatively evenly between home and away and neutral venues. His tally includes 178 penalties but he has also scored 135 times from outside the box, including 64 direct free-kicks.",
      "By competition, the biggest share of his goals has come in LaLiga, where he scored 311 times across nine seasons with Real Madrid.",
      "He remains the top scorer in Champions League history with 140 goals and also found the net 103 times across two spells in the Premier League with Manchester United.",
      "His favourite opponents, in terms of which sides he has scored the most goals against, are all based in Spain, with Sevilla, in particular, grateful to have seen the back of him.",
      "Ronaldo smashed 27 goals in just 18 appearances against the Andalucian side, with Real Madrid's bitter rivals Atletico and Barcelona also featuring high up in the list.",
      "Tottenham rank as his favourite English opponent, with Ronaldo having scored 14 times in 20 games against them, while Luxembourg are his favourite opponent internationally.",
      "On 948 and counting, Ronaldo's quest for 1,000 goals continues.",
      "On the subject of goalscoring, Monday's Between the Lines looked at England's reliance on Harry Kane and the worrying lack of other options. Where are all the English No 9s?",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
