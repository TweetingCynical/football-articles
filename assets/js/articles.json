      "New Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens could have ended up at Aston Villa this summer but the Belgian star opted for Old Trafford, despite Villa reportedly agreeing a higher fee than the Red Devils.",
      "Lammens was United's only deadline day buy as Ruben Amorim finally bolstered his goalkeeping options with the exciting 23-year-old from Royal Antwerp.",
      "His arrival comes as a massive boost to the team after both Andre Onana and No 2 Altay Bayindir were guilty of high profile mistakes this season and Lammens will fancy his chances of becoming the new first choice.",
      "United ended up paying Antwerp around £18.2m for Lammens, with an additional £3.5m coming in add-ons. But the Belgian side actually accepted a higher offer from Villa at one point in the window, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "Lammens could have been a replacement for Emiliano Martinez if he ended up joining United, but Amorim opted for the younger man, who had his heart set on Old Trafford. It displayed the club still have huge pulling power, just as they did with Bryan Mbeumo did amid interest from Tottenham this summer.",
      "Benjamin Sesko also moved to United after snubbing advances from Newcastle, who offered his club Red Bull Leipzig around £78m. United eventually agreed a lower fee of £74m.",
      "Lammens explained after sealing his move to Old Trafford that he was drawn to the \"aura\" of the club after speaking to Antwerp team-mates who have played in England.",
      "\"In my team in Antwerp, there were some players who were also in England and, when I talked to them about Manchester United, you could directly see their face change,\" he said. \"The club alone, the aura of the club, it’s massive, and being here today, seeing it, it’s a different level.",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben [Amorim] and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "DIrector of football Jason Wilcox hailed the player's ability and said he could go on to become a top goalkeeper, praising him for snubbing the advances of rival clubs.",
      "He added: \"Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential. We are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.\"",
      "Lammens takes United's total summer spending to around £217m. The club sanctioned £71m on Mbeumo and £62.5m on Matheus Cunha, while defender Diego Leon also arrived for around £7m.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has been left concerned after learning Manchester United failed to include an obligation to buy clause in Jadon Sancho's switch to Aston Villa. The winger was one of several stars to secure a move away from Old Trafford on deadline day as Ruben Amorim successfully reduced his United squad.",
      "Sancho finalised a season-long loan switch to Villa, mirroring Marcus Rashford's path from last season. Rashford's stint under Unai Emery saw the 27-year-old earn an England recall and subsequently sealed a Barcelona loan move this summer. Sancho will be hoping to replicate his team-mate's achievements at Villa Park.",
      "Sancho was among several players wanting to leave the Red Devils this summer and attracted interest from other clubs before agreeing to his Villa switch on deadline day. It represents the third loan exit of Sancho's United career, having not appeared for the club since the 2024 Community Shield, but club legend Ferdinand was surprised to learn that Sancho could potentially return to Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking about United's departures, he asked on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube Channel: \"Ain't Sancho's got an obligation to buy at the end of it? No? Oh, don't like that.\"",
      "United included a £38m obligation to buy as part of Rasmus Hojlund's move to Napoli, which also saw the club receive a £5.2m loan fee. No such obligation was agreed as part of Sancho's departure, with Villa agreeing to pay 80 per cent of his wages, plus achievable bonuses. However, Ferdinand backed the club's strategy to move on unhappy players.",
      "\"I said this ages ago, if you're going to take massive losses on these players, take them. Just to get out,\" Ferdinand argued. \"I don't think you can think about the financials too much if you're going to have them around the place and let them be a bad smell around the place. No, get rid. I don't care.",
      "\"The squad is the most important thing. Keeping the harmony and ambience in the squad is the be-all and end-all if you're going to make strides to be a more positive football club, where you aren't going to have those distractions around.",
      "\"The last thing anyone needs is Garnacho, Rashford, Sancho, Antony, etc. being around the place and having to train separately. There's always going to be an undercurrent of a negative story hanging around the place, if they stayed. So I think it's good for everybody that they've got out.\"",
      "Sancho has reached the final 12 months of his United deal, though the club possess an option to extend his contract by another year. This means United could still recover funds for Sancho depending on his displays at Villa, instead of departing as a free agent.",
      "The England winger was considered one of Europe's most promising talents when he arrived at United for £72.8m from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. He struggled to meet expectations at Old Trafford, scoring 12 goals and registering six assists across 83 appearances.",
      "Sancho returned to Dortmund on loan last January and started the 2024 Champions League final, but no permanent move materialised. Last season, the 25-year-old scored five times and provided n 10 assists across 41 appearances for Chelsea as he helped the Blues secure a top-four finish and win the Europa Conference League. However, Chelsea chose to pay a £5m penalty after backing out of their £25m obligation to buy Sancho.",
      "While it remains uncertain whether Villa will become the winger's next permanent destination, he is excited about the prospect of working under Emery. \"When I spoke to the manager he gave me belief and confidence,\" Sancho told Villa's club website.",
      "\"He showed me the plan of what they want to achieve this year and it really inspired me. He definitely persuaded me, and I can't wait to work under him.\"",
      "Discussing how Rashford's stint at Villa swayed his choice, Sancho added: \"I spoke to him while he was here last season and I know he really enjoyed it. He said so many lovely things about the club, like how it's a family and you feel that friendly environment with great players and staff. I definitely felt that as I came in.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Manuel Ugarte has confessed he knows he has endured a poor start to the campaign, but insists he still sees eye-to-eye with Ruben Amorim. The Uruguay international is yet to be included in a Premier League starting XI this term.",
      "Following 85 appearances for Sporting CP during Amorim's tenure with the Portuguese giants, many expected Ugarte to become a cornerstone of the United head coach's team at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, his sole start so far this season was in the embarrassing Carabao Cup second round elimination to Grimsby Town.",
      "At Blundell Park, Ugarte did not even see the second half as he was hauled off at half time. Amorim's feelings on Ugarte's form were made even clearer when the Uruguayan was left on the bench for the entirety of United's tight 3-2 home win over Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Reflecting on his beginning to the new season, Ugarte was refreshingly candid. Speaking to El Observador, Ugarte said: \"We haven't started the season very well. My level wasn't the best either, we have to be realistic and honest.\"",
      "He then added, however: \"But I'm very confident, I have a very good relationship with the coach. I work well and I'm very excited and eager to earn a starting spot.\"",
      "Last campaign, Amorim particularly highlighted Ugarte as a player who has yet to adapt to the Premier League pace, despite his £42.3million summer 2024 switch from Paris Saint-Germain with potential add-ons of approximately £8.5m.",
      "The Portuguese boss singled out Ugarte for critique following his own goal during United's 3-1 triumph over Southampton at Old Trafford back in January. When pressed specifically about Ugarte's display, the Red Devils chief highlighted the struggles the United midfielder endured against Southampton pair Joe Aribo and Mateus Fernandes.",
      "Amorim said: \"Mateus [Fernandes] was with the number seven [Joe Aribo], creating a lot of problems for Manu (Ugarte), because Manu was running against two guys. So it's more my fault than his fault. He is going to get used to playing every three days.\"",
      "Looking at Amorim's team selections, it's apparent the Portuguese tactician doesn't feel the South American is prepared for consistent Premier League action. Amorim has deployed a central partnership of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro at the heart of his 3-4-3 system.",
      "The Red Devils chief also brought on Kobbie Mainoo as a substitute during the second period against Burnley, indicating Ugarte is presently fourth in the pecking order amongst the squad's midfield options. With United eliminated from the League Cup and absent from European competition, Ugarte's chances to feature in the engine room could prove limited.",
      "Whilst he has expressed confidence both his displays and the team's performances will develop, Amorim's earlier remarks suggest Ugarte can occasionally find himself experiencing periods of dejection. During the summer pre-season tour of the United States, Amorim spoke about the 24-year-old's challenges.",
      "The United boss said: \"The first thing is adaptation to a new team, a new country. Sometimes, you just look inside of the pitch but, off the pitch, you can have some trouble sometimes.",
      "\"He is more adapted and then he needs more confidence, it's also my job. If you look last year, take Bruno [Fernandes], who is always confident, and look at the team and the performance of the team if he doesn't perform well.",
      "\"We can see today, when they are confident in their play, it seems like everyone can touch the ball and have confidence. it is more a team thing than individual.\"",

      "The winger made just 17 goal contributions in 96 appearances across all competitions and spent the second half of last season on loan at Betis after Amorim decided to move him on. Antony impressed in Spain, netting five goals and providing five assists in 26 games, and he has now completed a permanent move to Betis.",

      "We are now three weeks into the 2025/26 Premier League season and VAR controversies are showing no signs of slowing down. Inconsistency in refereeing has been the biggest cause of fan frustration so far this season.",
      "Among the plethora of contentious decisions have been Eberechi Eze’s free-kick goal being ruled out on matchday one and James Tarkowski’s bizarre handball verdict. But despite repeated calls by fans and pundits to simplify refereeing and for less VAR involvement, this weekend produced arguably the biggest outrage yet.",
      "Saturday's early Premier League kick-off saw Fulham open the scoring in the 22nd minute at Stamford Bridge, with Josh King netting against west London rivals Chelsea. But the goal was chalked off due to an apparent foul on Trevoh Chalobah by Rodrigo Muniz, to the fury of the visitors.",
      "Referee Robert Jones declared to the entire stadium that Rodrigo Muniz had made a \"careless challenge\" and stepped on Trevoh Chalobah's foot during the build-up, a call many viewers considered extremely harsh. To add insult to injury for Fulham, the Blues' opener in their 2-0 win came nine minutes into eight minutes of added time at the end of the first half, leaving fans furious as the outcome of the game was very much decided by an unnecessary call.",
      "Referees chief Howard Webb contacted Fulham after the game and acknowledged the decision was incorrect. He admitted the call to disallow the goal did not reach the high bar of a VAR intervention as it was not a clear and obvious error by the referee, and should have gone down as a 'referees' call' instead.",
      "Referees' body PGMOL consequently replaced VAR culprit Michael Salisbury with John Brooks for Liverpool vs Arsenal on. However, that did little to quell the anger towards VAR and how it’s implemented.",
      "Fulham defender Antonee Robinson post-match called out the Premier League's VAR, calling the level of officiating in the Premier League \"shocking.\"",
      "In the 52nd minute of the same game, the referee overturned his original decision of no penalty to Chelsea after the ball was blocked by Ryan Sessegnon in the box. Sessegnon’s arm was raised away from his body and VAR’s decision to overturn Jones’ original call should have been an easy one.",
      "But they took three-and-a-half minutes to reach a straight-forward decision, only feeding the narrative of uncertainty and unease surrounding VAR intervention. The correct outcome simply took too long to reach.",
      "Referee Sam Barrott awarded a penalty to Manchester United in the 16th minute of their clash with Burnley, when Kyle Walker was judged to have brought down Mason Mount. It was checked by the VAR, Stuart Attwell, and the penalty was cancelled due to minimal contact.",
      "Lyle Foster of Burnley thought he had equalised in the 59th minute, but the offside flag went up. Semi-automated offside determined that most of Foster's upper arm was offside – a part of the body which is legal to play the ball with.",
      "In the second minute of stoppage time, at the end of the game, Amad went to ground inside the box, with Barrott ignoring United’s appeals for a shirt pull.",
      "However, VAR deemed that there was enough pulling on the United winger’s shirt to warrant a penalty, which Bruno Fernandes scored in the 97th minute to earn his side a crucial win. VAR on this occasion successfully did what it was brought into the game to do.",
      "Brentford were awarded a penalty against Sunderland around the hour mark when Nathan Collins went to ground at the back post during a corner, with referee Anthony Taylor pointing to the spot. Following the correct call by VAR to stick with Taylor’s decision, after Reinildo Mandava clearly held Collins, Kevin Schade’s effort was saved by Robin Roefs.",
      "Sunderland were then awarded their own penalty in the 82nd minute after Rico Henry pulled down Habib Diarra. VAR Darren England again stuck with Taylor’s decision to award a spot-kick, which although was softer than the first, was not enough of a clear and obvious error to be overturned.",
      "The two decisions demonstrated that PGMOL are still enforcing their clamp down on unfair grappling inside the box, which was a point raised ahead of the new season.",
      "Webb said about the rule’s implementation: \"What we've said to the officials is, if you get one of those extreme situations where one player is clearly dragging another one to the floor in an extreme non-footballing action, even if it's off the ball, we expect either the referee to see it or, if it's a clear one, then the VAR will will intervene and recommend the referee looks at it at the screen because it fits the criteria that we've laid out.\"",

      "Manchester United had a relatively quiet transfer deadline day on Monday – a far cry from some of the more drama-filled days they've experienced. One such time came on the last day of the window in September 2008 when United signed Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for £30.75m.",
      "A rare glimpse into the chaotic inner workings of deadline day came later via ex-United forward Fraizer Campbell. The now-37-year-old offered a fascinating insight into the ruthless world of last-ditch transfers and how players often have little control over their destiny when it comes to switches orchestrated late in the day.",
      "Campbell unwittingly became a key factor in the acquisition of the Bulgarian striker, after Spurs demanded Campbell join them on loan as part of the Berbatov switch, just as Manchester City were looking to hijack the deal. While hardly a household name at Old Trafford, Campbell ultimately played a major role in United securing one of their most successful last-minute signings.",
      "Speaking on United's official YouTube channel, Campbell revealed that he was all set to sign for Wigan Athletic until he received a last-gasp phone call from Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "\"I knew that I'm going on loan,\" Campbell began. \"I'm sat with Steve Bruce, who's at Wigan at the time, and he's sat with us like, 'Yeah I'm going on loan to Wigan,' whatever, just speaking to the people here, waiting for the faxes to come through so I could sign it and what not.",
      "\"So, anyway it's getting late and I'm like, 'What's taking so long?' Anyway, I get a call from a withheld number thinking, 'Who's this?' I'm like, 'Hello?' 'Fraizer, it's Sir Alex here.' [Campbell then said] 'Err, hi?'",
      "\"[Ferguson said] 'I'm going to ring you back in five minutes, you're going to have to give me an answer, but I've got a deal for Berbatov going for over £30m, but it's only going to go through if you agree to go there on loan. So I'm going to ring you back in three minutes or four minutes with your decision, speak to you in a minute.'\"",
      "Campbell revealed, despite him nearing an exit to the Latics, he felt compelled to agree to the Spurs switch under the powerful influence of Ferguson. He added: \"So imagine, Sir Alex is ringing me saying this deal is not going through unless you go the other way. I was hardly going to say no. I knew that I'm going on loan.\"",
      "Berbatov would play under Ferguson for four seasons. He scored 56 goals in 149 games and won two Premier League titles during that time. Campbell meanwhile made 10 appearances for Spurs and later went on to represent a host of clubs including Cardiff, Sunderland and Hull City.",
      "United took care of the majority of their summer business prior to transfer deadline day this year with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon made earlier in the window.",
      "However, they did secure the signature of Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens on Monday, but United failed in a late move for Atletico Madrid and England midfielder Conor Gallagher.",
      "As for outgoings on deadline day, Antony completed a move to Real Betis, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho joined Napoli and Aston Villa on loan, respectively. Tyrell Malacia's loan to Elche collapsed late in the day, however.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will already have an idea of his strongest team after welcoming six new players to the club this summer. United have spent more than £200million in the transfer window to help fix last season’s shortcomings, which ultimately saw the club miss out on European football.",
      "Amorim is quickly approaching his first anniversary as United boss, joining from Sporting CP last November, and will hope his new signings can be long-term solutions for the club. There was plenty of fanfare surrounding United’s potential new frontline of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The goalkeeping situation is one of the most intriguing puzzles in Amorim’s team. Bayindir has been preferred to Onana during the first few games, but United’s decision to pursue a new shot-stopper tells its own story.",
      "Lammens was United’s preferred choice, despite Emiliano Martinez’s desire to join the club. The Argentine reportedly had conversations with Amorim earlier this summer and was not involved in Villa’s defeat to Crystal Palace on Sunday, but no deal transpired as Lammens secured his move to United.",
      "The Belgian still represents a risk for the Red Devils. The 23-year-old is viewed as a player who can grow into being United's No. 1, but only spent last season as first choice at Antwerp.",
      "However, given United’s willingness to sign a new keeper, it seems Lammens would feature in the club’s strongest team.",
      "In terms of the defence, Amorim has already shown his preferred back three for his 3-4-3 formation, picking Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw in every league game so far this season.",
      "However, that back three could be altered at a later date when Lisandro Martinez returns from injury, while Harry Maguire has also performed well when called upon by Amorim.",
      "Wingback poses another question for Amorim. Patrick Dorgu would be a clear choice on the left side, despite being dropped for Diogo Dalot against Burnley at the weekend. In arguably United’s best performance so far this season against Arsenal, Dalot started on the opposite flank.",
      "However, Amad may ultimately be preferred on the right to provide the team with more attacking edge. Meanwhile, Dalot will be able to provide cover in both wingback positions.",
      "In midfield, Amorim has opted for a centre-midfield duo of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in all three league games, placing them ahead of Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in the pecking order.",
      "While there is a clamour for Mainoo, who submitted a loan request, to start more under Amorim, the United boss favours Casemiro’s experience and Fernandes’ creativity from a deeper midfield role.",
      "Further forward, Mbeumo and Cunha have shown encouraging early signs since joining United. Mbeumo has already claimed one of the three forward positions, while Amorim is also fond of Mason Mount, forcing Cunha into more of a centre-forward role.",
      "However, it seems logical that Mount will lose his starting spot when the manager begins to rely more on new striker Sesko. The Slovenia international scored 39 goals in 84 games at RB Leipzig.",
      "United signed Sesko in a deal worth up to £74m from Leipzig but Amorim has been patient with the forward. The 22-year-old has featured from the bench in all of the club’s league games so far, but is the best recognised centre-forward in the United squad.",
      "Man Utd’s best XI (3-4-3): Lammens; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Sesko, Cunha.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roy Keane was proved right with his brutal reaction to Manchester United signing Sergio Reguilon on deadline day in 2023. The ex-Tottenham left-back joined the Red Devils on loan, with then-manager Erik ten Hag requiring the Spaniard's services due to the injuries to Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Despite an initial bright start in north London, Reguilon lost his place under Ange Postecoglou and was subsequently sent on loan to Atletico Madrid. His second temporary stint saw him arrive at Old Trafford after the Red Devils failed to sign primary target Marc Cucurella.",
      "Explaining his position, the ex-United captain said: \"Tottenham have got so many average players. We talk about the pressure Spurs are under to get in the top four but if you take [Harry] Kane and Son [Heung-Min] out of that team they are average.\"",
      "When Redknapp claimed that Reguilon was a good left-back, Keane quickly responded: \"Is that why Real Madrid let him go? Why did Real Madrid let him go?\" The former Liverpool skipper doubled down on his take as he replied: \"Does that matter? Just because Real Madrid let him go doesn't make him a good player? He's a fantastic left-back.\"",
      "Despite being brought in as emergency cover, Reguilon failed to impress and made just 12 appearances for the Red Devils. Ten Hag opted to rotate Aaron Wan Bissaka and Diogo Dalot on the left flank for much of the season instead.",
      "Two years after Reguilon's arrival, United were once again active on deadline day as they confirmed the signing of Senne Lammens for £18.2million plus add-ons. The Belgian goalkeeper was recruited from Royal Antwerp, and Ruben Amorim was keen to bolster his ranks in this position following early-season errors by Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana.",
      "The 23-year-old made the trip to Manchester on Monday to complete the transfer as he penned a five-year deal with the Premier League side. Speaking after his official announcement, Lammens said: \"I'm extremely proud to be joining Manchester United, it's a real dream come true.",
      "\"The past few years have been an amazing journey, it’s now ended in an incredible destination and hopefully the beginning of something special. You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "While it remains to be seen whether Lammens will immediately begin his career at United as the club's number one goalkeeper, Amorim has quite the decision ahead of the Manchester derby at the end of the current international break.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United could've secured Gianluigi Donnarumma for just £9million more than what they paid for new goalkeeper Senne Lammens. The Red Devils were weighing up the options of Lammens and Aston Villa's Emi Martinez in the final days of the transfer window.",
      "The Royal Antwerp shotstopper ended up being Ruben Amorim's final addition on deadline day, signing a five-year contract in a move worth £18.2m. But just across the city, Manchester City secured the transfer of Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain for £27m, as the Champions League winner penned a five-year deal with United's rivals at the eleventh hour.",
      "The PSG 'keeper had reportedly been of interest at Old Trafford over the summer, despite Amorim's insistence that he was content with his options between the sticks. However, no bids were tabled and no discussions were had, leaving Pep Guardiola to benefit from Donnarumma joining the Cityzens instead.",
      "It wouldn't have cost United much extra to secure a far more experienced shotstopper in the Italian, who kept a clean sheet to win the Champions League final 5-0 with PSG in May. Although both he and Martinez were reportedly demanding wages in the region of £200,000-a-week.",
      "Given his youth and inexperience, Lammens garnered a considerably lower pay packet, with that financial motive influencing the call. Donnarumma, meanwhile, shared his initial joy at linking up with City for the 2025/26 season, stating he is joining a squad \"packed with world-class talent.\"",
      "Upon his official announcement on Tuesday, the 26-year-old said: \"To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me. I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola.",
      "\"This is a club every player in world football would love to join. I have admired watching Manchester City for many years - so to now be able to play for the club is a huge honour and a privilege.",
      "\"I cannot wait to meet my new team-mates, the staff and the fans. Playing at the Etihad Stadium will be very, very special for me. I am very excited for what lies ahead and can promise that I will give absolutely everything to try and help the club achieve even more success.\"",
      "United instead added to their goalkeeping ranks with the signing of 23-year-old Lammens after Amorim defended his options at the back after their tight 3-2 victory over Burnley at the weekend. Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have both been called upon this campaign, but neither have put forward a strong case for the No. 1 shirt at the club.",
      "Bayindir made mistakes against both Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League, shipping four goals so far and winning just one game. On the other hand, Onana was given the start against League Two side Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, and allowed the fourth-tier side to go 2-0 up against the Premier League team before half-time.",
      "While he did save one penalty in the eventual shootout, Onana was to blame for Grimsby's second goal in regular time and watched his team crash out of the cup competition. New signing Lammens is a young talent with plenty to prove at United, after being given the starting berth at Antwerp last season.",
      "He made 44 appearances in all competitions, keeping clean sheets in 10 of these games, and also saving four penalties, which earned him a call-up to the Belgian senior squad in March. Describing his excitement in joining United, Lammens said: \"I am extremely proud to be joining Manchester United.",
      "\"It is a real dream come true. The past few years have been an amazing journey; it’s now ended in an incredible destination and hopefully the beginning of something special.",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.

      "Grimsby Town have been slapped with a fine for fielding an ineligible player during their stunning Carabao Cup triumph over Manchester United. Ruben Amorim's side crashed out 12-11 on penalties at Blundell Park as Bryan Mbeumo fluffed the crucial spot-kick following a 2-2 stalemate.",
      "United found themselves two goals down at half-time due to a pair of blunders from Andre Onana, before Mbeumo and Harry Maguire netted to equalise. The match then went directly to penalties, where United were ultimately knocked out after Mbeumo blasted his shot off the bar, securing Grimsby's advancement to the third round.",
      "But now the Lincolnshire club have been hit with a penalty after registering Clarke Oduor just one minute beyond the EFL's mandatory deadline. Grimsby subsequently reported the clerical blunder themselves, prompting the EFL board to launch an inquiry.",
      "The EFL have penalised the Mariners and issued a statement confirming their rule violation. But it has led to questions over whether or not Dave Artell's team should be booted from the tournament for the breach - given similar cases in the FA Cup have seen teams expelled from the competition.",
      "For example, Barnsley were ejected from the FA Cup in 2023 following their use of an ineligible player during their first round replay victory against Horsham.",
      "However, the crucial detail is that the matter is now resolved, and Grimsby's progression to the third round appears to have been rubber-stamped.",
      "An EFL statement declared: \"Following a comprehensive review of all the evidence and considering prior decisions taken in respect of offences in the League Cup, the Board determined that the issuing of a fine followed precedent.\"",
      "It's significant to highlight that the FA and EFL operate under different regulations regarding this issue, with the FA treating the matter with greater severity. It's understood that, at this point, United are not looking to appeal the decision.",

      "Manchester United have preserved a tradition stretching back almost a century after Ruben Amorim stepped in to prevent Kobbie Mainoo's exit. The 20-year-old midfielder tried to push through an exit during the closing days of the transfer window, unhappy after missing United's first two Premier League matches of the new campaign.",
      "His request, however, was turned down. Concerned about a lack of regular minutes – and with the 2026 World Cup likely influencing his thinking – Mainoo asked to leave temporarily on loan. Reports also linked him with a £50m permanent switch to Napoli, though the Italian side never formalised their interest.",
      "Consequently, Mainoo remains part of United's senior squad, a position that carries added weight since he is now the only academy product left in the group. For 88 straight years, the Red Devils have had at least one youth graduate involved at first-team level.",
      "During Sir Alex Ferguson's tenure, academy talents frequently made up a large portion of the squad. In the years since his retirement, however, the numbers have slowly dwindled.",
      "This summer highlighted that decline further: Marcus Rashford went to Barcelona on loan, Alejandro Garnacho signed for Chelsea, and Jonny Evans retired. Had Mainoo departed too, United's historic policy of promoting from their own ranks would have been broken.",
      "In reality, United may have only delayed the issue. Mainoo's future remains unresolved. His current deal runs until 2027, yet talks over a new contract have been stalled for months, creating uncertainty for both player and club.",
      "If negotiations fail to progress and his appearances remain scarce, United might eventually be forced to sell, particularly before he reaches the final year of his contract, when transfer value usually decreases.",
      "That said, Amorim has publicly insisted that Mainoo is central to his plans, despite using him sparingly so far this season. \"I want Kobbie to stay,\" he said prior to United's 3-2 victory over Burnley on Saturday.",
      "\"He needs to fight for his place. And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "Mainoo initially broke through into United’s senior side in the 2022/23 campaign and has made 74 appearances, scoring seven goals. This term, though, he has featured just once in the league.",
      "Under Amorim's management, Mainoo has featured in roughly two-thirds of the 46 games the Portuguese coach has taken charge of, but has only started 16 times. Injury setbacks have been a factor, though Amorim's preference for a two-man midfield has made competition intense, with Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte all jostling for position too.",
      "Now, Mainoo must fight not just for a regular spot in Amorim's plans, but also to secure his long-term place at Old Trafford – with United's rich legacy of homegrown players partly resting on his shoulders.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rashford's move came after he made clear his desire for a new challenge away from Old Trafford. He didn't end up joining Villa permanently, but has now moved to Barcelona on a season-long loan with a £26million option.",
      "Sancho had been linked with a Serie A move earlier in the window, after Chelsea - where he spent last season - paid to get out of an obligation to buy. Juventus and Roma ended up looking elsewhere, though, leaving the winger with fewer options.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund star has now spoken about Rashford's role in his eventual decision. “I spoke to him while he was here last season and I know he really enjoyed it,\" Sancho said.",
      "“He said so many lovely things about the club, like how it’s a family and you feel that friendly environment with great players and staff. I definitely felt that as I came in.”",

      "United also signed Senne Lammens on the final day of the window, while Villa were busy themselves. Former United centre-back Victor Lindelof joined as a free agent, while Harvey Elliott arrived on loan with an obligation to buy next summer.",
      "“For me now, it’s about kicking on as a player,\" Elliott told club media after joining Unai Emery's squad. “The only way to do that is to play games and there’s no better place to do that than here, especially with the manager, his philosophy, the way he plays and his trust in younger players",
      "\"Not only that, his personal achievements as well, I was very drawn to it. I had a conversation with him and was blown away by the way he was towards me and how welcoming he was to me before I was an Aston Villa player. It made me want it a little bit more.",
      "“Coming to Villa Park, you see how passionate the fans are, how well drilled the team is, it’s really hard to play against. Having the opportunity to be part of it, I couldn’t say no. I’m just delighted to be here.”",

      "If someone asked you to describe the 2025 summer transfer window in one word, you wouldn't be short of options. Hectic, tantalising, dramatic, agonising - take your pick.",
      "But one word sums it up best, especially for the Premier League: expensive. Following a good, old fashioned frantic deadline day, the 20 clubs' combined spending surpassed £3billion, shattering the previous record of £2.44bn from 2023.",
      "The top flight also set a record for the amount of money brought in from player sales, recouping an eye-watering £1.8bn. That also made for an all-time-high net spend of £1.2bn.",
      "But which club had the best transfer window? And who had the worst?",
      "Best - Everton",
      "I really like what David Moyes has done this summer. With almost every deal they have improved on the squad they had last year. Under Sean Dyche they were often a difficult watch, but by bringing in players like Jack Grealish, Tyler Dibling and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall they have the potential to be really exciting for the neutral.",
      "Grealish in particular was the no-brainer transfer of the summer and I think almost every Premier League side would have been wise to go for him. I'm expecting a much-improved season for the Toffees, with a top-half finish more than attainable, with Europe not out of the question.",
      "Worst - Wolves",
      "It probably says a lot that the best work Wolves managed was keeping a player they had signed about a month earlier. Had they sold Jorgen Strand Larsen then you could have safely stuck the 'R' next to their name and moved on.",
      "Regardless, in contrast to Everton, I'm struggling to pick a position where Vitor Pereira's squad is demonstrably better at the end of the window, than it was at the start. Fer Lopez is an intriguing signing, Jackson Tchatchoua has all the traits, but it's a summer where they have failed to bring in ANY Premier League experience.",
      "Honourable mention to Manchester United. Spending all that money and still having THAT midfield? Definitely a choice.",
      "Which teams had the best and worst transfer windows? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "Best - Liverpool",
      "There's certainly been some mixed emotions for club bosses and executives over the summer, but it is hard to say Liverpool haven't conducted the best business. Their decision to spend as big as they have has surprised some, but they now have a squad to rival anything in Europe.",
      "If anything underlined their ambition it was deciding that a striker who cost £79m and scored in his opening three games wasn't enough, so they went and shattered records to get Isak. That alongside other stellar buys like Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Worst - Brentford",
      "The worst window would've been Newcastle had they not got two strikers through the door late on. Instead a club like Brentford is likely to be wondering if their top flight stay is now under serious threat. Losing their two main goal sources will potentially prove defining, especially with Yoane Wissa going so late in the day.",
      "Best - Arsenal",
      "It's easy to overlook them, given how early some of their big deals were done, but Arsenal have had what should be regarded as a fantastic window. Liverpool have been the big spenders, breaking the British transfer record twice, but sometimes you want to eschew the all-you-can-eat buffet in favour of the tasting menu.",
      "Arsenal have addressed key positions while offloading some of the players who are no longer needed in North London. They even got a fee for Albert Sambi Lokonga!",
      "Worst - Newcastle and Fulham",
      "On the other side of the coin, Newcastle's window has to be seen as a failure and not just because of the Alexander Isak saga. They have overpaid for Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa, though both could prove useful pick-ups, while missing out on enough first and second choices that it became a meme.",
      "In the era of baffling bragging about winning the transfer window, though, Fulham's fanbase might be the most frustrated. Just two new permanent signings, though the late dash for Kevin and loanee Samuel Chukwueze is better than nothing after Benjamin Lecomte was the only new face for a while.",
      "Best - Tottenham",
      "I was torn on which half of north London to go on, but after Arsenal's start to the season I'm swaying towards Tottenham. The biggest positive from Spurs' summer has been the appointment of Thomas Frank.",
      "He's potentially my favourite Premier League manager. A forward-thinking tactician but also someone who comes across as authentic and stands out compared to the vapid 'head coach' our pyramid has become full of.",
      "Frank is so good at coaching a solid defence that Tottenham haven't needed to prioritise their back line which was constantly leaking under Ange Postecoglou. In midfield, I really like the signing of Joao Palhinha - Manchester United should've gone for him.",
      "Xavi Simons is such a talent, too, and the comparison between how well he and Arsenal's Eberechi Eze do this season will be fascinating. Fortunately, Spurs had already signed a Premier League-proven playmaker in Mohammed Kudus, while I'm hoping that Randal Kolo Muani can show what he's made of after a decent loan spell with Juventus.",
      "Worst - Brentford",
      "My choice for the worst window is Brentford - again, partly because they lost Frank. Fulham are a popular pick but I think there's something to be said for keeping your squad and manager together.",
      "Regardless of how much money they've brought in, it's going to be extremely difficult to replace the 39 league goals of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. Less spectacularly, Christian Norgaard is a huge loss, especially when Keith Andrews could've done with that kind of character to keep things steady on and off the pitch while he gets his feet under the table.",
      "It's probably unwise to doubt Brentford because they always seem to recover from losing their best players, and club-record signing Dango Ouattara has started brightly. But this is their toughest test yet in the top flight, having been forced into a much busier summer than they'd have hoped for.",
      "Best - Sunderland",
      "Sunderland have seemingly had the best transfer window of the summer all things considered. Regis Le Bris knew stepping up to the Premier League that a major revamp was needed if the Black Cats had any real hopes to remain in the English top flight at the end of 2025/26 and Kyril Louis-Dreyfus has backed his man while Kristjaan Speakman has worked tirelessly in his recruitment drive.",
      "Sunderland have welcomed 14 fresh faces this summer if you include Enzo Le fee, and now have a squad which could finish mid-table if they are able to gel.",
      "Worst - Fulham",
      "The biggest losers are surely Fulham, given they've only welcomed Kevin and Benjamin Lecompte permanently, and Samuel Chukwueze on loan while losing the likes of Andreas Pereira and Martial Godo. They are also without Reiss Nelson, who will be a big miss.",
      "Best - Arsenal",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool were the pre-eminent spenders of this summer. The Reds splashed out on two British record fees to give Arne Slot a wealth of options but failed to acknowledge a key area when they were unable to secure a move for Marc Guehi on deadline day. That could prove costly.",
      "The Gunners meanwhile are completely renewed in terms of depth and now have a goalscorer. Things have not quite fallen into place just yet but Mikel Arteta now has a squad that will allow him few excuses come May.",
      "Worst - Fulham",
      "Fulham have acted with a couple of intriguing additions in Kevin and Samuel Chukwueze but certainly kept Marco Silva waiting for any progress.

      "Jamie Carragher has claimed that if Ruben Amorim \"wasn't so charismatic in press conferences\" and \"wasn't such a good looking man\" he may have already been given his marching orders at Manchester United.",
      "The Red Devils boss cut a frustrated figure for much of Saturday's win over Burnley, which only came courtesy of Bruno Fernandes' stoppage-time penalty. The victory was just days after United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby - the club's first-ever loss to a fourth tier outfit.",
      "It has continued the poor run of results on Amorim's watch and, as he nears his one-year anniversary in the job, the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss has shown little to suggest he can turnaround the club's fortunes.",
      "However he's continued to be incredibly engaging, open and honest in press conferences, which has made him great value for the media. Amorim has continued to come out with headline-worthy lines, claiming last week that sometimes he \"wants to quit\".",
      "And as a result Carragher has said on The Overlap: \"He's great in the press conferences but because he's not winning it's like 'shut up'. Stop speaking, keep your mouth shut. If he was winning we'd all be saying, 'what a character'.",
      "\"There is now a big clamour to get Jose Mourinho back in English football and the reason is because he’s box office, he comes out with stuff, but he was a winner. We always remember Brian Clough - when I was a kid and he was speaking you’d listen because he was a winner.",
      "\"I actually look at it and think if Amorim wasn't so charismatic in the press conference, if he wasn't such a good looking man, he might have actually lost his job a lot earlier. When you look at the results they are horrendous!\"",
      "Amorim was only weeks into his tenure when, after a lacklustre loss at home to Newcastle, he claimed he would rather be sacked than change his philosophy. He also said: \"It is a bit embarrassing to be Manchester United coach and lose a lot of games\".",
      "Not long after that, this time following a defeat to Brighton, he said his team was \"maybe the worst\" in the 147-year history of the club.",
      "The Portuguese boss was again front and centre with his decision to look away for Fernandes' late penalty at the weekend. He had also chosen not to watch their shootout defeat at Grimsby and claimed he instead wanted to see the fan reaction, rather than the spot kick itself.",
      "\"I like to see the image of the fans,\" he said. \"What has to be has to be. In that moment, I was thinking, it would be fair to win the game. And I did not think Bruno would miss a second in a row.\"",

      "Emiliano Martinez was desperate to secure himself a move to Manchester United but never got his wish despite holding talks with Ruben Amorim over a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "The Argentine was looking to leave Aston Villa and, even on deadline day, was waiting for a call. Martinez has proved himself to be one of Europe's top goalkeepers during his time at Villa Park, helping the club make the last eight of the Champions League.",
      "He's also won the World Cup with Argentina and he called on his compatriot, United centre-half Lisandro Martinez, to try and bang his drum with the senior figures in Manchester, which he duly did.",
      "The Athletic reports that Martinez also held talks with Ruben Amorim in June and July about the potential of a move to Old Trafford, where he would likely have become their No 1. The United boss was impressed with his character and experience.",
      "He felt that Martinez would be a worthwhile addition, but when the Red Devils eventually made their move it was a loan offer, which Villa had little interest in accepting. Club bosses then diverted their attention to Senne Lammens and Martinez was overlooked.",
      "The 23-year-old Belgian arrived from Royal Antwerp on deadline day and cost the club £18.1m. The issue for Martinez was that Villa were always going to demand a fee in excess of £30m and United had already spent big on their frontline this summer. The Argentine's wages would also have been a sticking point.",
      "Lammens joined with Amorim under pressure to add a new goalkeeper. Andre Onana continues to be error prone and has not convinced whilst his understudy Altay Bayindir made a mistake on the opening weekend which helped Arsenal gain all three points.",
      "Martinez hasn't played in two of Villa's three matches so far this term with summer arrival, Marco Bizot, going straight in and receiving the backing of manager Unai Emery. The Spaniard has not fully closed the door on the Argentine and claims there could still be a way back.",
      "He said: \"We have to fix it with him. Tomorrow the transfer window finishes, and we are expecting something hopefully to improve the squad. But we keep calm.",
      "\"One of the situations we are speaking about is Emi Martinez, but we will see tomorrow. Then we try to get the balance and try to work after the break and try again at Everton to recover our mentality.\"",

      "Manchester United will not get a Carabao Cup reprieve after Grimsby Town fielded an ineligible player against them in their second round giant-killing. A registration error around Clarke Oduor has seen The Mariners fined, rather than kicked out of the competition.",
      "Oduor signed for Grimsby on loan from Bradford City the day before the match against United. He made his debut against the Premier League side, missing a penalty in the shoot-out after coming on as a substitute during the second half.",
      "It later emerged that he was registered just a minute after the permitted 12pm deadline on August 26. In a statement, the EFL has recognised Grimsby reported the error themselves, and explained the punishment for the League Two outfit.",
      "\"The EFL Board, acting as the Management Committee of the Carabao Cup, has today fined Grimsby Town Football Club £20,000 - of which £10,000 will be suspended until the end of Season 2025/26 - for having breached the Rules of the competition,\" the statement read.",
      "\"The breach relates to the Club fielding an ineligible player against Manchester United in a Round Two tie on 27 August 2025. Grimsby Town progressed to Round Three following a 12-11 penalty shoot-out win at Blundell Park.",
      "\"The circumstances leading to this transgression are that Grimsby Town submitted the registration of Clarke Oduor at 12:01 pm on the day before the fixture i.e. shortly after the 12:00 pm deadline required in accordance with the 2025/26 competition rules. The Club self-reported the breach upon discovery the day after the fixture had been completed.",
      "\"Following a comprehensive review of all the evidence and considering prior decisions taken in respect of offences in the League Cup, the Board determined that the issuing of a fine followed precedent. The Board further noted the Club’s non-compliance was not deliberate with no intention to deceive or mislead.",
      "\"The Club has since implemented several actions to prevent a similar occurrence in the future. The Club will be liable for the suspended sum of £10,000, if they were to again field an ineligible player in any League Competition between now and the end of Season 2025/26.\"",
      "Grimsby issued a statement of their own on the matter. \"Grimsby Town Football Club acknowledges today’s decision by the EFL regarding an error in the registration of Clarke Oduor ahead of our Carabao Cup Round Two fixture against Manchester United,\" it read.",
      "\"The registration of Oduor was submitted to the EFL at one minute past the deadline and the issue was not immediately identified by the Club due to a computer problem being experienced at Grimsby. We accept the fine imposed and fully recognise the importance of adhering to competition rules and regulations.",
      "\"This mistake was not deliberate, and the Club acted transparently by self-reporting the breach as soon as it came to light. Since this incident, we have undertaken a thorough review of our processes and implemented strengthened measures to ensure it cannot happen again.",
      "\"We thank the EFL Board for recognising our co-operation and intent, and we remain fully committed to maintaining the highest professional and regulatory standards. The Club won’t make any further comment on the matter and now looks forward to focusing on preparations for our upcoming fixtures.\"",

      "United signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves, Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo for a possible £71m and Benjamin Sesko for £66.3m as Amorim was handed a new line of attack during the transfer window. Bringing goals to Old Trafford was a key target this summer after the Red Devils struggled to find the net last season.",
      "While Rasmus Hojlund has made his exit to Napoli, Cunha and Mbeumo have already established themselves in Amorim's starting line up. The Portuguese coach has been more hesitant in seeing Sesko lead the line, however - with Mason Mount taking that role.",
      "But, immediately after their miserable 2024-25 season, United had another target in mind. The club failed in their attempt to land Liam Delap from Ipswich as he chose Chelsea as his new club.",
      "And from there, United weighed up a move for former striker Welbeck, according to the Athletic. The Carrington product started his career at Old Trafford before moving on to Arsenal, Watford and Brighton.",
      "And even at 35, having finished last term as Brighton's top goalscorer, Welbeck was discussed. After failing to land Delap, United 'seriously' considered moving for a secondary striker.",
      "Erik ten Hag wanted Welbeck 12 months ago but the Red Devils did not make a move given uncertainty around his position. Welbeck returned to the frame in recent months however and chiefs considered a two-year offer, should they have been able to agree a fee with Brighton.",
      "The plan was for a low-cost signing to complement a marquee signing. United owner Ratcliffe felt United could not sanction a deal of that length, meaning a one-year deal with the potential for a further year was mulled over. An offer was never formalised for the ex-United striker.",
      "After renewing their forward options, United landed a new goalkeeper on deadline day in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. The Belgian joined on a five-year deal to challenge Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "A more surprising enquiry also emerged as the club attempted to land another of their priorities in a central midfielder. United approached Atletico Madrid over a loan deal for Conor Gallagher but the La Liga giants were uninterested in a temporary move.",

      "Four senior signings and four senior departures is a modest turnover for the worst United squad in 51 years, a reflection of the Ineos cabal's backing for head coach Ruben Amorim and the business they have hitherto overseen.",
      "United invested £225.32million to bring in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens. The word from well-placed sources is United did what they set out to achieve.",
      "Almost every player who was realistically expected to leave has left. Jettisoning Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho protected the long-term harmony of the squad and its performance culture.",

      "Tyrell Malacia has proven to be unsellable, never mind a tough sell. Like one of their custodians, United were caught short on the goalkeeper front. They now have more goalies than out-and-out central midfielders.",
      "United are comfortable with their midfield roster. The quintet of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount have been billed as \"versatile\" by sources. Only three are specialists.",
      "With the deadline three days away, director of recruitment Christopher Vivell was on the phone at the club's Carrington training complex and could be heard acknowledging that a planned move was viewed as a \"step down\" by an unnamed player. Jadon Sancho held out long enough to secure an unforeseeable move to a Premier League club.",
      "United intended to come out of the blocks, as a senior source put it, with two early deals in the window: Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap. Delap's decision to join Chelsea over United for £30million meant the club ended up paying more than double that for their new No.9, Benjamin Sesko. He is yet to start a Premier League game.",
      "Sesko was a fourth-choice target - at best - and his performances have been as unconvincing as Amorim's handling of the 22-year-old. Wilcox was quoted in the statement confirming Sesko's signing but Vivell is more closely attached to the Slovenian. The pair were photographed in a celebratory clinch when Sesko signed for RB Leipzig in 2022.",
      "United conducted a data-led review of their 2024-25 season to determine which area required the most attention and concluded that a lack of goals was the biggest contributing factor to their worst season since relegation in 1974. Basic maths could have concluded that, never mind a bespoke algorithm.",
      "Members of the bomb squad sought shelter in temporary accommodation. Antony relocated to the Marriott hotel in Hale Barns, so close to Manchester Airport that the take-offs may have interrupted his sleep. Sancho was in and out of his mansion in the same suburb. Garnacho switched to a flat in Hale but was still paying the rent on his mansion that his parents and brother moved out of last season.",
      "United did their utmost to put a positive spin on the £40m sale of Garnacho. He had angled to leave in public and the fee is the fourth-highest for a departure in the club's history. Even former academy staff toasted the money United had recouped for him.",
      "Yet United banked only £2.5m more than Ipswich Town did from Nottingham Forest for Omari Hutchinson. Garnacho is a United academy graduate, Premier League-proven winger and Argentina international. Chelsea have got him on the cheap.",
      "United sources claimed Chelsea's opening offer was £25m. Both sides have dabbled in mischief-making against each other over the summer, whether it be Chelsea linking United with their dead wood strikers or United adding Chelsea to the clubs that Bryan Mbeumo rejected. Chelsea denied that they moved for Mbeumo.",
      "Garnacho and his on-off partner, Eva Garcia, visited London almost weekly last season. Sources say they would not be surprised if Ms Garcia returns to England now that the father of her child has moved to the capital. United staff on the post-season tour knew there was no chance of a U-turn from Amorim on Garnacho amid the winger's surly behaviour in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.",
      "Agency sources said early in the summer that Amorim's 'bomb squad' strategy would cost United millions. Chelsea and Real Betis were the only bidders at the table for Garnacho and Antony, which drove their prices down.",
      "Antony is a huge loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. United insiders say the club have nevertheless - maintained financial discipline in compliance with PSR.",
      "It remains to be seen if director of football Jason Wilcox will now emerge from the shadows. Dan Ashworth reflected on United's summer transfer window two days after it closed last year in the Old Trafford boardroom with journalists.",
      "One fan who encountered Wilcox enthusiastically lobbied him to get the Sesko deal done. Wilcox cagily stressed that Newcastle were also interested. The fan reminded him, \"It's Newcastle.\"",
      "Senior figures at United repeatedly stressed a goalkeeper was not a priority but Amorim's assessment of that area evolved as Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir took turns to drop clangers. Amorim endorsed an enquiry for Emiliano Martinez but Lammens is more aligned with the data-driven model United are implementing.",
      "Patrick Dorgu was the first of that ilk. He has been overpromoted and overplayed to the point that Amorim resorted to starting Diogo Dalot on the left wing against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "United noted that Lammens had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe, made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Europe’s top ten leagues and made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23. That will all be irrelevant when he is in net for the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "United supporters of a certain vintage will recall that Royal Antwerp were the club's original feeder club in the Nineties. United farmed out 34 players to the Belgian side and never signed anyone from them. Lammens is the first.",
      "Sources say a goalkeeper was a secondary priority contingent on whether Lammens would become available. Funds had to be raised from sales and loans for United to have the headroom to execute the £18.2m deal.",
      "Lammens and Sesko are contradictions. Amorim all but admitted that United prioritised established Premier League recruits yet the two most important positions in the team - in goal and up front - have been taken up by Premier League novices.",
      "\"You watch every weekend Matheus doing things against the players that you are going to face,\" Amorim said in Chicago on July 25. \"That can help you to have more certainty when you choose players. So that was a policy that we tried to use this season.",
      "\"So I can say yes, it's not just that, because they have characteristics that we need, but we focus on getting players that can come here and to face this kind of pressure, like you said, since the first day.\" Club sources clarified there was a balance of recruits to immediately improve the team and younger players with potential.",
      "United will leave it to Amorim to clarify whether Lammens, not among the four goalkeepers in the Belgium squad this month, is their new No.1. Elsewhere in goal, there is no movement on any outgoings (at the time of writing). United have four senior 'keepers in a season where they could play as few as 40 games if they exit the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "The Turkish transfer window is open until September 12 but Jose Mourinho had no interest in Onana or Bayindir before his defenestration at Fenerbahce. The Süper Lig runners-up bought Mourinho's old scourge, Ederson, who tossed milk at the Portuguese after Manchester City won at Old Trafford in December 2017.",
      "A dressing room source said Amorim was wary that Bayindir's confidence could be \"killed\" if he was dropped after his costly 'keeping against Arsenal. By sticking by the Turk at Fulham, Onana's own self-esteem plummeted, though that does not excuse his chastening performance at Grimsby Town.",
      "Confidence in both goalkeepers has dwindled among the United players. \"Altay is a good 'keeper and has good skills,\" a source who works with the player said. \"But United is too demanding for him.\"",
      "United will go big for a midfielder next year as the area was not regarded as a priority in the recent window. They came up short with Carlos Baleba but have started the long game. Casemiro will not be at the club next season and his heir apparent, Manuel Ugarte, has been the poorest of the Ineos-era recruits.",
      "Ugarte played under Amorim for two years at Sporting Lisbon but has started this season where he ended last season: on the bench. The interest in Baleba would suggest some at United have already given up on him.",
      "No amount of spin can disguise that.",

      "Grimsby Town have been fined for fielding an ineligible player against Manchester United.",
      "United dramatically crashed out of the Carabao Cup on penalties at Blundell Park last week. Grimsby progressed to the next round after prevailing in the penalty shootout, following a 2-2 draw.",
      "However, it has transpired that a Grimsby player, Clarke Oduor, was ineligible to play in the game.",
      "Oduor was introduced to the contest to replace George McEachran in the 73rd minute. Oduor signed for Grimsby from Bradford City on a season-long deal a day before the game and the League Two club submitted his registration a minute late, which meant he was ineligible to feature against United.",
      "Grimsby reported themselves for the late registration and the EFL board launched an investigation.",
      "The EFL have fined Grimsby and released a statement to confirm their breach of the rules.",
      "The statement said: \"The EFL Board, acting as the management committee of the Carabao Cup, has today fined Grimsby Town Football Club £20,000 - of which £10,000 will be suspended until the end of Season 2025/26 - for having breached the rules of the competition.",
      "\"The breach relates to the club fielding an ineligible player against Manchester United in a round two tie on 27 August 2025. Grimsby Town progressed to round three following a 12-11 penalty shoot-out win at Blundell Park.",
      "\"The circumstances leading to this transgression are that Grimsby Town submitted the registration of Clarke Oduor at 12:01pm on the day before the fixture i.e. shortly after the 12:00pm deadline required in accordance with the 2025/26 competition rules.",
      "\"The club self-reported the breach upon discovery the day after the fixture had been completed.",
      "\"Following a comprehensive review of all the evidence and considering prior decisions taken in respect of offences in the League Cup, the board determined that the issuing of a fine followed precedent.",
      "\"The board further noted the club's non-compliance was not deliberate with no intention to deceive or mislead. The club has sinceimplemented several actions to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.",
      "\"The club will be liable for the suspended sum of £10,000, if they were to again field an ineligible player in any league competition between now and the end of Season 2025/26.\"",
      "United trailed Grimsby 2-0 at half-time at Blundell Park but forced a penalty shootout after goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire.",
      "When asked what went wrong, Amorim said: \"Everything. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened, it's a problem in our club, we should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans.",
      "\"I felt my players spoke really loud today what they want. I think it's easy for you [how to interpret it]. Let's focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through.",
      "\"Doesn't matter [that we lost on penalties]. In the penalties, the feeling is the same. I think football was really fair today. The best team won.",
      "\"I'm the manager. It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I'm really sorry for our fans. Let's focus on the next game. That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today.",
      "\"I would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I'm really sorry for our fans. It's too much sometimes.",
      "\"You cannot change so much. You cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance. I think this is a little bit the limit.",
      "\"I think something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.\"",

      "Villa agreed to cover 80 per cent of Sancho's wages, but the deal includes achievable bonuses which essentially means his full wages should be covered during his stint in Birmingham.",

      "Sancho sought Rashford's advice before completing his move and he was impressed by Villa boss Unai Emery.",
      "Speaking to Villa club media, Sancho said: “When I spoke to the manager he gave me belief and confidence. He showed me the plan of what they want to achieve this year and it really inspired me. He definitely persuaded me, and I can’t wait to work under him.”",
      "He continued: “As a player and especially as a team, we have to be achieving big things. We have to be looking towards that, and hopefully I can help the team to achieve some of those goals.",
      "“The team comes first, so whenever the manager needs me I’ll be ready. I’ve got individual goals, but my main goal is for the team. Achieving something as a team is much more special than individually.",
      "“I feel like all players have individual goals, but the team always comes first. ’ll be looking to achieve goals with the team first.”",
      "Speaking about Rashford, Sancho added: “I spoke to him while he was here last season and I know he really enjoyed it.

      "\"The Club self-reported the breach upon discovery the day after the fixture had been completed.\"",
      "According to The Athletic, Alejandro Garnacho told friends and family before the Europa League final that he was targeting a move to Chelsea in the summer. The report claims the Blues initially only offered United players in exchange for the winger.",
      "The Club World Cup champions eventually submitted a £25m bid, which the Reds negotiated up to £40m. Garnacho went on to sign a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge.",
      "United enquired about Carlos Baleba's availability, and Brighton priced the midfielder at around £100m. However, the Reds spent £215m on signings, making it difficult to finance a marquee midfield arrival.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are the options that Ruben Amorim has been left to work with.",
      "According to The Athletic, United agreed on personal terms with Carlos Baleba during the summer transfer window. The report claims that Ruben Amorim encouraged higher-ups at Old Trafford to sign the Brighton midfielder before the move collapsed.",
      "It's said that Baleba received positive messages from Andre Onana, Bryan Mbeumo, and Leny Yoro, but United couldn't justify the price. The Reds are reportedly expected to make another attempt to secure his signature in the future.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Aston Villa are happy to continue with Emi Martinez between the sticks this season after a move to United failed to materialise. The journalist claims that the 33-year-old goalkeeper isn't keen on a move to Turkey, and he's prepared to stay at Villa Park.",
      "It's said that United opened talks with Unai Emery's side over a potential deal, but they never sent an official bid. Martinez is not expected to leave the club this summer.",
      "Victor Lindelof, who left United following the expiry of his contract earlier this summer, joined Aston Villa on deadline day. Speaking to VillaTV for the first time, the defender said: \"It’s a massive club, and I was super excited when I heard that the club wanted me.",
      "\"I spoke to my wife, and we felt it was a good move for us as a family and for me as a player. I’ve been at the Premier League for many years, so I know what it’s all about.",
      "\"Hopefully, I can help the younger players with my experience, and also bring in the quality like I show on the pitch. I am super, super happy and thrilled to be part of this football club.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has revealed he recieved a message from Thibaut Courtois ahead of Senne Lammens' move to United. Speaking on his YouTube channel, the former Reds defender said: \"That voice note was Thibaut Courtois, by the way, just letting me know about Lammens because he’s a Belgian player.",
      "\"So he was just giving me the heads up as to what he’s like. He said he’s a huge talent, obviously not experienced yet, but he said he thinks his style will be suited to the Premier League big as well.",
      "\"That recommendation from probably one of the best free goalkeepers in the world, Thibaut Courtois, I’m taking that. I keep seeing people talking about their talent and whatnot, but the problem is, can Man United afford to wait for talent to develop at this point in time?\"",
      "Speaking to the club website upon signing for United, Senne Lammens said: \"I am extremely proud to be joining Manchester United, it is a real dream come true.",
      "\"The past few years have been an amazing journey, it’s now ended in an incredible destination and hopefully the beginning of something special. You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my teammates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "The Reds left it late to sign a new goalkeeper, prising Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for about £18m. Ruben Amorim will be hoping the 23-year-old, who kept the most clean sheets in the Belgian Pro League last season, can hit the ground running.",
      "Another year, another transfer deadline day has been and gone.",
      "Manchester United have had a busy day with the signing of Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "United also sanctioned the exits of Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Harry Amass on deadline day.",
      "We'll be back tomorrow to continue to provide the latest United news and gossip from Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Senne Lammens on a permanent deal from Royal Antwerp.",
      "United have signed the goalkeeper after agreeing a deal worth an initial £18.2million to bring the 23-year-old to Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United have confirmed that Jadon Sancho has completed a move to Aston Villa on loan for the rest of the season.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed that young midfielder Zachary Baumann has completed a permanent move away from the club.",
      "United kicked off the summer window by signing Matheus Cunha for £62.5million from Wolves, with Bryan Mbeumo joining him through the door from Brentford.",
      "The Reds then won the race for Benjamin Sesko, despite interest from Newcastle. Meanwhile, several notable names departed either on loan or in a permanent deal, including Marcus Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "And there are still more deals to be confirmed at Old Trafford over the next few hours..."

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be able to give extra training sessions to ten members of his first-team during the first international break of the campaign.",
      "United have had a mixed start to the campaign, with encouragement shown against Arsenal soon extinguished by the scoreline and a meagre draw at Fulham. Defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup rocked the Reds, but they managed to get back on track Saturday with a 3-2 victory over Burnley.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, any momentum he wishes to build from that victory over Scott Parker's side has been put on hold as most of his squad jets off around the globe for the September international break. For the majority of those who are with their national teams, the focus is on qualification for the World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico at the end of the season.",
      "However, there are ten players who are healthy and shall be remaining in Manchester for extra training sessions at Carrington. A notable inclusion comes in the form of Senne Lammens, who only arrived at United on deadline day and has missed out on the Belgium squad.",
      "Experienced defensive duo Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw missed out on Thomas Tuchel's England, as did midfielders Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount. They, along with Tom Heaton, Tyler Fredricson, Diego Leon, Noussair Mazraoui and Joshua Zirkzee, shall report to Carrington over the break to keep their fitness levels up for the return of the Premier League and a mouth-watering derby against Manchester City.",

      "Manchester United reportedly contemplated signing Brighton's Danny Welbeck before spending £200million on their attack this summer.",
      "The club's co-owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, allegedly put a stop to the move due to his dissatisfaction with the idea of a two-year contract for the 35 year old.",
      "United brought in Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m, Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo for a potential £71m and Benjamin Sesko for £66.3m, providing Ruben Amorim with new attacking options during the transfer window.",
      "Scoring goals was a priority for Old Trafford this summer after the squad had difficulty finding the back of the net last season.",
      "While Rasmus Hojlund has departed for Napoli, Cunha and Mbeumo have already secured their places in Amorim's starting eleven. However, the Portuguese coach has been more reluctant to let Sesko lead the attack, with Mason Mount taking up that role instead.",
      "But, following their disappointing 2024-25 season, United had another player in their sights. The club's attempt to sign Liam Delap from Ipswich was unsuccessful as he opted for Chelsea instead.",
      "From there, United considered bringing back former striker Welbeck, according to The Athletic. The Carrington product began his career at Old Trafford before moving on to Arsenal, Watford and Brighton.",
      "Even at 35, having ended the previous season as Brighton's top scorer, Welbeck was under consideration. After failing to secure Delap, United 'seriously' thought about signing a backup striker.",
      "Erik ten Hag had his sights set on Welbeck a year ago, but Manchester United did not pursue the player due to uncertainty surrounding his position.",
      "Despite Welbeck re-emerging as a potential signing in recent months, and club officials contemplating a two-year contract if an agreement could be reached with Brighton, no formal offer was made for the former United forward.",
      "The strategy was to secure a cost-effective signing alongside a high-profile one. However, United's owner Ratcliffe felt a deal of that duration could not be approved, leading to discussions about a one-year contract with the possibility of an extension.",
      "In addition to refreshing their attacking line-up, United secured a new goalkeeper on the final day of the transfer window, Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. The Belgian signed a five-year contract to compete with Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "In a surprising turn of events, the club also attempted to secure another key target, a central midfielder. United approached Atletico Madrid regarding a loan deal for Conor Gallagher, but the Spanish top-flight team showed no interest in a temporary arrangement.",

      "On deadline day, Senne Lammens followed them from Royal Antwerp to compete for the No.1 jersey. Over £215million was spent to correct last year's humiliating season but there remain alarm bells within the team.",
      "Bruno Fernandes rejected a move to Saudi Arabia earlier in the window and any chance of Casemiro leaving seemed moot throughout. The pair have been Amorim's first choice in the opening three Premier League games with Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte waiting in the wings for their chance.",
      "As was widely reported during the window, United enquired about Carlos Baleba and were swiftly put off from Brighton's £100m valuation. Morten Hjulmand, Ederson and Angelo Stiller were all also linked.",
      "Adam Wharton was the other star-studied name in the crop of No.6s on United's radar. Again, the valuation of the Crystal Palace star meant Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada had no chance in negotiating a move.",
      "The transfer window is now closed and United will have to work with four available to Amorim - or dip into the free agent market. January will present another opportunity for work to be done on the midfield but the winter market is traditionally a tougher period to conduct business in.",
      "However, between now and then, new names are set to be added to United's radar and Chelsea's Romeo Lavia is the latest. The Independent's Miguel Delaney has claimed that the former Manchester City academy starlet is emerging as a possible target just two years after his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"The end of the window of course means the start of speculation for January, mostly due to the business that didn't get done,\" he said in his Inside Football Newsletter. \"Manchester United still want a midfielder.",
      "\"Expect United to back in for Brighton's Carlos Baleba, although some insiders have wondered whether a deal could be done with Chelsea's Romeo Lavia.\"",
      "When he was at Southampton, Lavia was one of the most-exciting defensive midfielders. As a 19-year-old, he cost Chelsea an initial £53m and within two years, he has played just 23 times.",
      "Injuries have plagued his progress and have forced him to miss 73 games. According to Transfermarkt, hamstring injuries have been his biggest issue, keeping him out for 291 days. In total, Lavia has missed a whopping 490 days since moving to Chelsea.",
      "Unfortunately, muscle problems can become a constant issue for players. Right now, Lavia's injury record is enough reason for United to stay as far away from the midfielder as possible.",

The midfielder arrived on loan from Bradford City on August 26, the day before the fixture.",
      "Grimsby registered him at 12.01pm which meant he should not have been eligible to face Ruben Amorim's side. However, he was named on the bench, came on in the second half and missed a penalty in the shootout.",
      "It is understood that the Mariners self-reported the infraction and the EFL announced that they would be fined £20,000 for the incident. In a statement, the EFL explained: \"Following a comprehensive review of all the evidence and considering prior decisions taken in respect of offences in the League Cup, the Board determined that the issuing of a fine followed precedent.\"",
      "Previously, teams in the FA Cup have been booted out for fielding ineligible players.

      "The Denmark international moved to United for an initial £62m plus add-ons in August 2023 from Atalanta. He showed glimpses during his debut season at Old Trafford, scoring 16 times in 43 appearances.",
      "However, Hojlund's form nosedived last term. Indeed, the forward went, at one point, 21 matches without a goal before ending that barren run with a strike against relegation-bound Leicester City back in March.",
      "He ended his second season in Manchester with just 10 goals in 52 matches and it was clear that Ruben Amorim didn't view him as his long-term No.9. Joshua Zirkzee was even preferred, at times, last campaign.",
      "There had been talk earlier this summer that United were prepared to offload Hojlund but the player wanted to remain at the Reds and fight for his place because he felt he is better than incoming signing Sesko.",
      "According to The Athletic, a reason behind Hojlund's desire to stay at United was that he believed he is superior to Sesko, who made the £66m plus add-ons move to the Reds from RB Leipzig last month. He felt showing that in sessions might give Amorim pause for thought on his departure, despite Sesko's arrival.",
      "The potential end for Hojlund at United has left him 'heartbroken' over the realisation that his dream in Manchester was over after just two years, especially when he expected to continue at the start of pre-season.",
      "Speaking in July, Hojlund said: \"My plan is very clear. That is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me.",

You're not going to tell me I shouldn't be playing because I want to play every game. But obviously I could have done with some help in terms of sharing the games a bit, especially in the beginning.\"",

      "He made his senior debut for the club in November 2023. He was an understudy during 2023/2024, but earned first choice status the following season.",

Senne Lammens was the only addition in the final 12 hours of the trading period with the goalkeeper joining Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as new arrivals.",
      "Numerous exits from Old Trafford have also gone through with Alejandro Garnacho signing for Chelsea on a permanent deal and Marcus Rashford joining Barcelona on a season-long loan.",
      "Deadline day did not really kick off for United until the early evening when moves for Antony and Rasmus Hojlund to Real Betis and Napoli, respectively, were announced.",
      "United then made their fifth summer signing official with Lammens joining from Royal Antwerp in an £18.2million deal.",

      "Though United opted for the younger shot-stopper, a deadline day deal was still completed with Villa as Jadon Sancho, following in the footsteps of Rashford, moved to the Midlands club on loan.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Tyrell Malacia were heavily linked with late summer window exits but as things stand, will stay at United. The latter saw a temporary switch to Elche collapse but could still be moved on with the trading periods in Turkiye and Saudi Arabia still open.",
      "The three players to leave United had already been omitted from Amorim's matchday squads and therefore it is highly unlikely there will be drastic changes to the travelling group he names for the trip to Manchester City following the September international break.",
      "Following a mixed start to the 2025/26 season, it remains to be seen what Amorim believes his strongest starting XI actually is.",

      "Gary Neville was left frustrated when Manchester United dismissed David Raya because he's \"not good enough with his feet.\"",
      "That philosophy may have contributed significantly to United's carousel of goalkeeping disasters in recent seasons. The Red Devils moved for Royal Antwerp keeper Senne Lammens on deadline day for an initial £18million.",
      "Ruben Amorim will be hoping the 23-year-old Belgian can finally solve their goalkeeping crisis after Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have perpetuated the club's recent legacy of catastrophic keeping. Modern managers increasingly demand goalkeepers to confidently distribute from the back, and it appears as though United had that in mind when they supposedly snubbed Raya.",
      "Speaking on Stick to Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, Neville said: \"I'd mentioned Raya to someone at United. I'd watched him quite a bit for Brentford [and] thought he looked a good goalkeeper.",
      "\"And they said, 'Oh, he's not good enough with his feet.' The person I'd spoke to at United at the time... I remember thinking, 'I've watched Raya a lot. He's pretty good.'",
      "\"And you're thinking, 'He saves a lot of shots, quite good at dominating his box, he's quite brave.' And [Neville's contact] said, 'No, he's not good enough with his feet.'\"",
      "Some supporters were left puzzled when Arsenal opted to bring in Raya from Brentford in 2023, given that Aaron Ramsdale faced relatively little criticism at that point.",
      "The Spanish keeper initially arrived at the Emirates on loan, with an option to secure a permanent £27m transfer, which Arsenal exercised 12 months later.",
      "Despite some initial uncertainty following his arrival in north London, boss Mikel Arteta's decision has been vindicated. Most supporters would acknowledge that Raya's distribution skills frequently appear amongst his greatest assets, rather than any sort of limitation.",
      "It shows just how misguided some supposedly knowledgeable voices can prove, even at institutions with United's stature and reputation. Nevertheless, the Red Devils will be optimistic they've finally found the solution with promising Belgian prospect Lammens.",
      "Part of David de Gea's departure from the club also stemmed from concerns that his footwork and calmness under pressure weren't meeting required standards. Yet replacements Onana and Bayindir have both revealed their own significant shortcomings as of late.",
      "Meanwhile, Raya found himself rather red-faced after being beaten by Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai from a 35-yard free-kick on Sunday. That provided all the ammunition Neville required to brand the Gunners the \"same old Arsenal\" following another defeat in a pivotal title race encounter.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "\"The good days are coming,\" promised Ruben Amorim during his speech on the final day of last season.",
      "Manchester United finished 15th in the Premier League and needed to respond in the summer window. Many thought defeat in the Europa League final would damage the club's prospects in the market.",
      "Thankfully, the window did not unfold like that. Liverpool were the Premier League club to 'win' the summer with their impressive business, but United must be considered among the sides who have conducted fine deals after a productive three months in a difficult market to manoeuvre.",
      "United overhauled their attacking line after scoring a dismal 44 league goals last season, adding Premier League-proven players and a striker, and completed the signing of a goalkeeper.",
      "The only blemish was the failure to sign a new midfielder, which could be a major problem area.",
      "But it's worth focusing on the positives to begin with. Matheus Cunha was the first signing of the summer for £62.5milliion from Wolves, which was a straightforward deal to complete.",
      "United triggered Cunha's release clause at Molineux and personal terms were not a problem. It was the perfect start, but fans began to raise concerns during the pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Brentford are notoriously tricky to negotiate with and hung tough in discussions for Mbeumo. United entered talks by bidding £45m, with £10m in add-ons, and they finally walked away from the table with an agreement to sign Mbeumo for £65m, plus £6m in add-ons, over a month later.",
      "United are not the only club to be stung by the Bees' tough negotiating this summer, as Newcastle signed Yoane Wissa in a £55m deal on the final day of the window after a dogged pursuit of the forward.",
      "Mbeumo was signed in time to travel to the United States for the pre-season tour. He got off the mark against Grimsby and scored his first Premier League goal against Burnley.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo should be terrific additions. They have already demonstrated their quality in their short time at the club, and supporters are desperately hoping for a positive injury update on Cunha after the Brazilian was forced to be substituted with a muscle injury in the first half against Burnley.",
      "In comparison, Benjamin Sesko has looked rusty, although he does possess the potential to become one of the finest strikers in Europe. Ideally, United would have signed a frontman with experience, but they had to play the cards they were dealt and Sesko was attainable.",
      "United moved with impressive speed to wrap up a deal for Sesko, beating Newcastle to his signature. The Magpies are in the Champions League this season, but Sesko always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "The only slight negative with Sesko is that United needed a striker who could hit the ground running, someone who would make an immediate impact and score goals in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim has not started Sesko in the league since his arrival, preferring Mason Mount down the middle instead.",
      "Speaking after the win over Burnley, Amorim explained his decision not to bring the Slovenia international on earlier against Scott Parker's side.",
      "\"So he finished the [Grimsby] game with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties,\" explained Amorim.",
      "\"And today was that reason also, because (Joshua) Zirkzee is also a striker, he's an international striker. But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a division four team, he did that on Wednesday. And with the problem of Cunha, you don't know if that full game in the middle of the week has something to do with the injury today.",
      "\"With the problem with Mason Mount (injury), I was not risking another player, not knowing if they are able to play so many minutes. So everything was connected. The penalty, the game on Wednesday, and the number of minutes that I was thinking to put Ben today.\"",
      "In the same press conference, Amorim defended his goalkeeper options, but it was crucial that United pushed in the final days of the transfer to strengthen that department.",
      "Altay Bayindir has made mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League this season. Andre Onana was recalled against Grimsby Town and made an error for their second goal.",
      "United sources consider Senne Lammens to be an exciting young goalkeeper with a bright future. The 23-year-old was called up to Belgium's senior squad in March and has a huge opportunity at United.",
      "It is hoped the £18.2m fee to sign Lammens from Royal Antwerp could prove to be a bargain in a few years. Diego Leon and Enzo Kana Biyik were also exciting young additions for the club's future.",
      "United explored signing a midfielder in the window. Brighton valued Carlos Baleba in excess of £100million and planned to keep him for another season, which killed the hope of adding him to the squad.",
      "The 21-year-old has developed a strong reputation in a short space of time at Brighton, but would Baleba have been an instant success? He is a young midfielder and Brighton's valuation was daunting.",
      "Nonetheless, it is disappointing that United ended the window without strengthening in the centre of the pitch. Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are poor options and Amorim felt he needed a fresh face.",
      "United will have to make do for the first six months of the season. Midfield could be a problem and United would have overseen a perfect transfer window if they had signed a top player in the ilk of Casemiro.",
      "Ineos chiefs will have to settle for 'an almost perfect' window instead. The members of the 'bomb squad' proved hard to shift, but United eventually got there in the end, with the exception of Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona on loan and there is an option to make the move permanent for £26m. Barcelona are covering Rashford's wages, which is estimated to save United around £12m this season.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was sold to Chelsea for £40m. That felt like a low fee for a player whose value was much higher 12 months ago, but the wider context must be considered",
      "United received £19m, with a potential £2.6m in add-ons, for Antony, while Rasmus Hojlund joined Napoli on loan with a view to it becoming permanent for £38m next summer when certain obligations are met.",
      "Aston Villa will also cover at least 80 per cent of Jadon Sancho's wages during his loan.",
      "United will be pleased with the business they have conducted.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United received three ‘enquiries’ from Premier League clubs for Kobbie Mainoo after the midfielder asked to leave on loan.",
      "He then started against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup and came off the bench at half-time against Burnley on Saturday, helping Ruben Amorim’s side record their first win of the campaign.",
      "United fans were aghast at the prospect of Mainoo leaving, whether it was permanently or on loan, but the 20-year-old stayed put beyond Monday’s transfer deadline.",
      "There was plenty of interest in Mainoo from clubs in England and abroad, and the Daily Mail has revealed the six clubs that were in the race for his signature.",
      "Indeed, it’s claimed that Italian champions Napoli ‘were leading the chase’ ahead of Serie A rivals AS Roma and French giants Marseille.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Kobbie Mainoo to Real Madrid? How very convenient…",
      "In the Premier League, United reportedly received ‘enquiries’ from Everton, Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa.",
      "However, Amorim’s side ‘wanted him to stay and fight for his place’, as his chances of a departure were severely reduced after injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Burnley.",
      "Let’s have a look at the six clubs the England midfielder could have joined on deadline day, shall we?",
      "One of the biggest losers of the 2025 summer transfer window, Unai Emery did get his paws on Harvey Elliott on deadline day, but Mainoo would’ve been an outstanding addition, even if it was a straight loan.",
      "We like this a lot, considering Villa’s England contingent of Ollie Watkins, Morgan Rogers and Ezri Konsa, on top of Amadou Onana and Boubacar Kamara’s injury problems.",
      "Out of all three English clubs, this strikes us as the best fit for Mainoo. I guess we’ll never know.",
      "We love this. The best team in Serie A. Managed by Antonio Conte. In the Champions League. But mostly, there are some players in Naples that Mainoo is familiar with.",
      "Scott McTominay was named Serie A Most Valuable Player after leading Napoli to the title last term, proving that the grass is very much greener on the other side. McTominay was officially joined by Rasmus Hojlund on Monday, but that deal was agreed long before.",
      "In terms of midfield competition, Mainoo would be battling for game time with the Scot and his international team-mate Billy Gilmour, as well as Frank Anguissa and Stanislav Lobotka. And if Conte viewed him as a more advanced midfield option, he’d be competing with Kevin De Bruyne…",
      "Thomas Frank’s attacking is looking strong and the deadline day addition of Randal Kolo Muani has done him no harm in that department.",
      "But in midfield, there was room for more recruitment, especially if Yves Bissouma is to remain out in the cold. Champions League football is on offer at Spurs, who do feel like a good fit for Mainoo.",
      "Everton are becoming exciting to watch following the addition of Jack Grealish, who complements Iliman Ndiaye very well. His quick renaissance under David Moyes should be a positive sign for any player looking to get their career back on track, and while Mainoo’s too young to worry about his career falling by the wayside, it would’ve been in his thinking had the Toffees’ interest intensified.",
      "James Garner and Idrissa Gana Gueye are fine midfielders, but there’s no doubt that Mainoo would be an upgrade on both. We just couldn’t see him going for it, with European football on offer everywhere else.",
      "Again, Mainoo will be familiar with one player at Marseille, Mason Greenwood. But they signed Matt O’Riley from Brighton instead of pushing for the United man.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi is another head coach a player like Mainoo could benefit from working with. The Italian does have some solid Ligue 1 midfielders already, like Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Angel Gomes, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Arthur Vermeeren.",
      "Not as sure about Roma, but working under Gian Piero Gasperini is an exciting proposition. Their midfield is significantly thinner, though Manu Kone is a super player.",
      "Real Madrid are now ‘one step away’ from completing the signing of Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo on deadline day, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will only allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford before the deadline if they can bring in a replacement first, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been dealt a significant blow as a £25m ‘offer’ is ‘withdrawn’ despite reports of an ‘agreement’, while Mainoo doubles down.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists he wants Kobbie Mainoo “to stay” at Old Trafford and “fight for his place” this season.",

      "Aston Villa are reportedly ‘bitter’ after Manchester United won the race for Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, despite offering more money for the 23-year-old.",
      "Unai Emery’s side had targeted Lammens on deadline day amid uncertainty surrounding the future of first-choice goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Man United had registered interest in signing the Belgian shot-stopper earlier last month but didn’t agree a deal until the final hours of the summer transfer window.",
      "There was the possibility of Martinez ending up at Old Trafford and Villa replacing him with Lammens, but the former has stayed at Villa Park despite making it clear he wanted to leave back in May.",
      "He’s been left with egg on his face, while the Red Devils have improved their goalkeeper depth with the addition of Lammens, who’s not expected to come straight into Ruben Amorim’s starting XI.",
      "F365 SAYS: Man Utd and Man City are signing goalkeepers ill-suited to who and where they are",
      "Andre Onana has been the club’s first choice since the start of 2023/24, but Amorim has preferred Altay Bayindir at the start of the season, keeping faith in the Turkish international after a mistake led to the only goal of the game in their Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "Bayindir started at Fulham and then against Burnley on Saturday as United earned their first win of the season.",
      "It’s unclear who Amorim’s long-term No.1 will be, but the expectation is that Lammens will have to work for the shirt.",
      "He might not have to work that hard, though. Amorim clearly doesn’t rate Onana and Bayindir is worryingly error-prone.",
      "United’s first game after the international break is away to Manchester City, which does suggest he won’t be thrown straight in.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, are searching for their first goal and win of the season after drawing with Newcastle United and losing against Brentford and Crystal Palace.",
      "It’s been a miserable start to 2025/26 for them, and their transfer business hasn’t given the fans much to be excited about.",
      "The goalkeeper deadline day debacle rubbed salt in the wounds for the club’s supporters, with Lammens joining United for a fee below what the Villans offered Antwerp.",
      "That’s according to the Daily Mail, where it’s claimed that Lammens joined United for £18.2m plus £3.5m in add-ons, and pushed for his ‘dream move’ to Old Trafford that left Martinez in limbo and Villa feeling ‘bitter’ after making a ‘higher’ bid.",
      "It all comes down to ‘pulling power’, which still gives the Red Devils ‘a crucial advantage in the transfer window’, despite back-to-back all-time worst Premier League seasons.",
      "Other examples cited are Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, who both snubbed interest from elsewhere to move to Old Trafford.",
      "After joining the Red Devils, Lammens said: “In my team in Antwerp, there were some players who were also in England and, when I talked to them about Manchester United, you could directly see their face change. The club alone, the aura of the club, it’s massive, and being here today, seeing it, it’s a different level.”",

      "Manchester United reportedly decided to sign Senne Lammens over Emiliano Martinez for two key reasons, while one star ‘will go’ in the coming days.",

      "Man Utd and Man City are both set to sign goalkeepers ill-suited to who and where they are. Any chance of a deal sheet Lammens, Donnarumma swap?",
      "Man Utd have reached a ‘total agreement’ to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeper Senne Lammens ahead of the deadline, according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein.",
      "Man Utd have now ‘agreed personal terms’ to sign Emiliano Martinez as their Aston Villa ‘make approach’ for Senne Lammens, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘leaning towards’ a deal for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez over Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens, according to reports."

      "Alexander Isak joins new Liverpool team-mate Florian Wirtz in our top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "There are so many honourable mentions. We have many players we really like, but couldn’t find space for.",
      "Transfers like Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal, Gianluigi Donnarumma to Manchester City, Granit Xhaka to Sunderland, and Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool all miss out, but are all fantastic deals in our eyes. It’s just that these ten are a little bit better.",
      "Anyway, let’s get to it. Here are our top ten Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "We loved this move before Grealish registered two assists on his Everton debut against Brighton. And then another brace of assists away to Wolves, heavily contributing to two wins in a row for David Moyes’ side.",
      "Fans across the country will agree that it’s bloody fantastic to see Grealish playing regularly and enjoying his football again. After becoming a robotic player under Pep Guardiola, he can now express himself and be the player we all know and love. Moyes will give Grealish the platform to succeed and influence a side in need of more flair. Iliman Ndiaye can only do so much. Speaking of which, that’s one exciting duo.",
      "Signed on a season-long loan, the 29-year-old has given him the best chance of making Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for next summer’s World Cup. And if all goes to plan, Everton will view his £50million buy option as a no-brainer.",
      "",
      "One of the most promising wingers in the world, it’s a breath of fresh air to see a genuine Brazilian wonderkid make the jump to the Premier League, rather than Real Madrid or Barcelona. The hype might not be the same as it was for Neymar, but that’s probably because he hasn’t made the traditional move to one of La Liga’s juggernauts.",
      "A warm-up injury to Cole Palmer on matchday two saw Estevao come into the Chelsea starting XI against West Ham, and he looked very, very dangerous. The 18-year-old assisted compatriot and fellow new signing Joao Pedro and his scary pace, confidence and dribbling ability will make him a nightmare for full-backs. And he’s only going to get better.",
      "Bought from Palmeiras for under £30m, Estevao will prove to be one of the biggest bargains of a crazy 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Cunha is a great player who Manchester United might destroy. They’ve got previous. Lots of it.",
      "Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season, earning a move to the biggest club in England, to play as one of Ruben Amorim’s ‘wide 10s’, a position he seems perfectly suited for.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling at Old Trafford because he’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "Pedro’s brace against his boyhood club Fluminense at the Club World Cup left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed out £55m, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive philosophy with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves registered 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances for the Midlands side, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Will Liverpool signings Ekitike and Wirtz fall victim to the dreaded Bundesliga tax?\n👉 Emi Martinez takes the gloves in our post-transfer window Premier League Stuck Man XI\n👉 Liverpool extend lead as the world’s 10 biggest spenders of 2025 summer transfer window after Isak\n👉 Guehi ‘screwed’ by Palace and why Liverpool spending £400m is different to Chelsea and Man City",
      "",
      "Just like with Cunha, the fact that Mbeumo has joined Manchester United means we have reservations.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal for United.",
      "",
      "This is a big upgrade on Arsenal’s previous No.6, with Zubimendi bringing a calming presence and outstanding levels of consistency to Mikel Arteta’s midfield. He might not reach Rodri’s level, but he can reach Rodri levels of influence on this Gunners side.",
      "His first three games against Manchester United, Leeds and Liverpool have shown promise, and the fact Zubimendi will help Martin Odegaard get back to his best, while Declan Rice continues to be an attacking threat, makes him a priceless addition.",
      "",
      "A lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. It’s already started.",
      "Wirtz’s start hasn’t been the best, but he’s allowed a settling-in period, even if his transfer fee was a club-record signing.",
      "When the German does settle into his Liverpool role, we’re expecting him to be one of the best attacking midfielders in the league, if not the best. He’s one of the main reasons the Reds are the biggest winners of the window.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "",
      "Nico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality. He’s more of an Ilkay Gundogan successor.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside to this deal.",
      "",
      "The saga to end all sagas. We’re delighted it’s over, and pretty surprised it took until Deadline Day for it to be finalised.",
      "Isak cost Liverpool a British record £135m and while new team-mates surround him, the settling-in period is probably limited to one or two games, having broke that record, and come from another Premier League team. For Newcastle, the Swede scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances. He’s joined the champions and a team that wants to attack, attack, attack, so we can see Isak joining the 100 Club before or during 2027/28.",
      "There is a lot of pressure, especially considering how Isak manufactured his move to Anfield. We’re fairly confident he’ll be just fine, and his addition makes Arne Slot’s side the favourites for every competition they’re in this season.",
      "READ NEXT: The most expensive XI in Premier League history passes £1bn after Liverpool finally spend Coutinho money",

      "Did Florian Wirtz look like a British record transfer player as Liverpool played Newcastle? Plus, Unai Emery sack chat.",
      "Wirtz’s bow, the start of Chelsea’s title challenge and Sesko v Gyokeres before calls for Arteta’s sacking. The Premier League is back and we could not be more giddy…",
      "Arne Slot said Liverpool’s huge moves in the transfer window this summer have been justified by player sales, suggesting the club has done nothing new.",
      "Chelsea and Liverpool have both found value in the transfer market by underpaying for a couple of players each, while Arsenal have a bargain of their own."

      "Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “world-class” dream team at Manchester United are making mistakes as their “very poor” recruitment continues…",
      "",
      "Was the summer transfer window positive for Man Utd? It’s certainly debatable, but we’re leaning towards yes. Just about.",
      "Did United sign the wrong goalkeeper on deadline day? Probably, but at least the late arrival of Senne Lammens means the days of Andre Onana and/or Alter Bayindir starting regularly for the Premier League giants are over.",
      "They have also overhauled their attack with the additions of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for around £200m combined, with the early indications that the latter two should be relatively successful at Old Trafford, while we’re unsold on their £74m man.",
      "And perhaps most importantly, all but one member of the back seat on the school bus crew left the club, with only Tyrell Malacia remaining following the summer exits of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "So not too bad overall, though the continuation of last season’s misery under Ruben Amorim in the early weeks of this campaign suggests they are still miles off the leading pack and have no chance of meeting Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s set target of winning the Premier League by 2028.",
      "To put Man Utd on track to achieve this aim, Ratcliffe has been a busy man as he’s alienated himself to the point where he’s rivalling the Glaser family in terms of unpopularity at Old Trafford following several brutal and/or needless decisions, notably the so-called implementation of a “world-class” recruitment team after years of “very poor” transfer business.",
      "Ratcliffe is right in saying that Man Utd’s recruitment, overall, has been extremely dour post-Sir Alex-Ferguson, though he and his supposed dream team of experts, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, are far from perfect.",
      "This has been exposed in The Athletic‘s annual exposé of Man Utd’s business via their ‘inside the transfer window’, which has revealed a couple of gems from this summer.",
      "Firstly, we have Wilcox’s verdict on Man Utd’s top priority for the summer window.",
      "‘The choice at that stage was to go for a No 6 or a No 9. Some at the club believe a midfielder should have been the priority, but Wilcox advocated to sign a scorer, after United’s record of 44 Premier League goals last campaign, and Ratcliffe backed that call.’",
      "There is a semblance of logic to Wilcox’s stance, with the lack of goal threat needing to be addressed after Man Utd became especially toothless in attack following the implementation of Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "But as poor as Joshua Zirkzee and especially Rasmus Hojlund were last season, a contributing factor to their woes was the absence of a creative spark in Man Utd’s side to forge chances.",
      "The arrivals of Mbeumo and Cunha ease this issue, and while an upgrade in the No.9 position was needed, it was a mistake to spend £200m on attackers and completely ignore the No.6 department, which is equally in need of fixing.",
      "Carlos Baleba would have been the perfect solution and he could still prove to be that in January or next summer, though United’s period of punishment is to continue as long as they are without a selfless protector and well-rounded midfield partnership.",
      "Further forward, the return of a proven Premier League striker to take some of the pressure off Sesko, Hojlund and/or Zirkzee, but Ratcliffe wasn’t playing ball.",

      "A Stuck Man? A stuck man. The transfer window is closed and that always, always, always catches certain clubs and players by surprise. Twice a year you’re always left with some unfortunate players in seatless limbo when the music stops.",
      "This year, thanks in large part to Emi Martinez’s heroic tragicomic antics they exist in sufficient numbers and of the requisite types to fashion an entire semi-coherent team of players waking up this morning thinking ‘now what?’ and hoping beyond hope that – like a balding Essex man in his mid-30s – Turkey might provide some hope.",
      "Yes, the good old late-closing Turkish transfer window – and that in Saudi Arabia – means escape routes might yet materialise for some, but for now here’s the current Premier League Stuck Man XI.",
      "",
      "Thought he’d wangled himself a move to the Manchester United circus, but instead is left inside the tent p*ssing here, there and everywhere at Villa, where his final meaningful on-field act still really might be the red card at Old Trafford on the final day of last season that played such a key role in Aston Villa missing out on Champions League qualification.",
      "It already looks like a massive sliding-doors moment for both player and club. In a bad way. We’d imagine Villa will still want him gone if there’s any way of doing so, meaning Turkish and Saudi clubs might be sniffing a bargain.",
      "",
      "The right-back’s January arrival was somewhat overshadowed by Villa’s flashier winter loan moves, but with his path to the first team blocked by Matty Cash there was plenty of talk in the summer about some pretty eye-catching teams across the continent weighing up moves that never materialised for a man whose main chances of Villa action will likely be restricted to Europa League and domestic cup competitions.",
      "We don’t imagine he’s heartbroken to still be at Villa, but with Sevilla, Real Betis and top-flight clubs in both Germany and Italy interested it would be surprising if his head hadn’t been at least slightly turned by the prospect of more regular football in some of those places.",
      "",
      "Look, we’re not going to just try and make all of these ‘maybe a Turkish club saves the day’ but this is another one that really does look like it might need a Turkish club to save the day after a proposed loan move to Elche collapsed as the clock ticked down.",
      "Some unwanted Stuck Men scream Turkish big three. Malacia, we would suggest, screams ‘whichever club is currently trying to muscle in and disrupt that big three’. Trabzonspor or some such. We don’t know, we’ve not looked into it. But Tyrell probably should.",
      "",
      "Spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but now returns to his previous status as a fully paid-up member of the Chelsea Bomb Squad.",
      "Plenty of reports suggest Disasi had Premier League options late in the window, but they were more of the Bournemouth and Wolves and West Ham variety. Personally, we’d have been pretty keen to explore that Bournemouth option but we can see why the other two carried less appeal than sitting around collecting pay-cheques at Cobham with Raheem Sterling.",

      "We do feel sorry for him, but not that sorry. It must be desperately hard to think that big dream move to the Premier League champions and current favourites is happening only for the rug to be pulled at the last minute, but the idea that Palace did anything unreasonable here is a daftness.",
      "Liverpool started the summer complaining about Trent Alexander-Arnold and ended it complaining that Palace didn’t simply let them have their captain without a suitable replacement being sourced first, and spent their time in between those two events bullying all manner of smaller clubs into all manner of stunning transfer successes for the Reds.",
      "They – and Guehi – will simply have to accept this rare defeat. And on Guehi’s part, the disappointment should be tempered by knowing he’s been a model pro who gave his all for Palace until the very end – something, ultimately, not even Eberechi Eze was prepared to do – and there will be no humiliating and difficult reintegration process to be completed here.",
      "And in January and especially next summer, Guehi will have full control of his future while also almost certainly being England’s first-choice World Cup centre-back.",
      "There are people in this team in a far worse pickle, is what we’re saying here.",

      "P*ssed off Thomas Frank from the very start with his shoddy timekeeping leading to an internal ban from the Super Cup against PSG, and despite now being available he appears to have dropped firmly to the very bottom of a midfield pecking order that also features Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur, Pape Sarr, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.",

      "Former club Leeds were inevitably credited with early-summer interest, but any they did have was understandably caveated by those injury doubts, which simply didn’t clear in time for anything to go beyond the hypothetical anyway.",
      "Phillips, who at 29 still has a faintly absurd three years left on his City contract, now faces four months at least in the wilderness and suffering the indignity of being stripped of his shirt number entirely and not being registered in either City’s Premier League or Champions League squads despite them having the space to do so.",

      "This creates a scenario whereby Sporting may be left with a player they can only use in Champions League fixtures until January. And that is if he has indeed joined Sporting at all, which farcically doesn’t appear at all clear at this time with no official announcement from either club.",
      "So he’s either stuck at Forest, where he’ll hardly play. Or stuck at Sporting, where he’ll hardly play. Or both. Or neither. He is Schrodinger’s winger, playing for both Forest and Sporting yet also neither.",

      "Spurs belatedly managing to pull their finger out and bring in Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani before the deadline denied us one of the funniest of all possible moves.",
      "We’d foolishly daydreamed our way into fully convincing ourselves after the Eze Fiasco of a deadline-day panic move for Sterling that would allowed him to tick off a fifth member of the Big Six before finishing the set with a successful stint in the Championship with Manchester United in 2026/27.",
      "Alas, Spurs have cruelly denied us this dream scenario with a rare and unhelpful display of transfer competence. But it does seem awful careless of Chelsea not to have found someone to take Sterling off their hands for a bit. There were enough desperate Premier League clubs still stumbling blindly around on deadline day waving their chequebooks at anything that moved for something to have happened, surely.",

      "Can you be stuck at a team you only joined on a permanent deal two months earlier? Yes. Yes you can. Larsen proved himself a solidly reliable Premier League striker last season with 14 goals on loan from Celta Vigo last season more than enough for Wolves to trigger the buy option in that deal.",

      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund ‘considers himself better’ than summer signing Benjamin Sesko after signing for Napoli on loan, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils chose to sign a new striker over a midfielder in the final month of the transfer market with Sesko arriving from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m.",
      "Hojlund joined his boyhood club Man Utd in 2023 for £72m from Serie A side Atalanta but he failed to hit the ground running at Old Trafford.",
      "The Denmark international managed a very respectable 10 Premier League goals in 30 appearances in his first season but the 22-year-old could only manage four goals in 31 matches last term.",
      "Hojlund was linked all summer with a move away from Old Trafford and he pushed back on leaving during the transfer window as he looked to remain at Man Utd.",
      "He told reporters during pre-season: “My plan is very clear. That is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.",
      "READ: Villa and Newcastle among transfer window losers as idea of a Big Eight suffers fatal blow",
      "“Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I’m more than ready. I’m feeling sharp so I welcome everything that comes.”",
      "Hojlund added: “When I came, [Anthony] Martial was there as well but he had a lot of injuries, so I obviously had to take a lot of the game time",
      "“You’re not going to tell me I shouldn’t be playing because I want to play every game. But obviously I could have done with some help in terms of sharing the games a bit, especially in the beginning.”",
      "Hojlund continued to plead his case for staying at Man Utd, he said: “I’m still very young. People forget that sometimes. I’m only 22. Not every striker scores 100 goals by that age.",
      "“But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see it in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "“Last season was tough on us all. I should have done better, everybody knows.",
      "“But it’s also a team thing. We’re going to be better now. We are progressing in the right way and looking forward to what’s coming.”",
      "Napoli eventually agreed a loan move for Hojlund with the Danish striker staying until the end of the season and Man Utd included a  €44m buy option which will turn into an obligation if the Serie A side qualify for the Champions League.",
      "And now The Athletic have revealed that one of the reasons he was looking to stay and fight for his place was his belief that he is better than new signing Sesko.",
      "The Athletic wrote: ‘Part of Hojlund’s motivation, it can be revealed, was that he considers himself better than the centre-forward United have agreed to pay €85million for. He felt showing that in sessions might give Amorim pause for thought on his departure, despite Sesko’s arrival.’",
      "The potential end of his time at Old Trafford has been a sad time for Hojlund, the report added: ‘Hojlund was said to be heartbroken over the realisation his Old Trafford dream was over aged 22, especially when he started pre-season expecting to continue. The episode demonstrates how Ratcliffe, Berrada, Wilcox and Amorim are operating without sentiment.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United had a last-minute ‘approach’ for a former Chelsea star ‘rejected’ on deadline day for one key reason.",
      "Manchester United’s current woes are being left at the feet of pretty much everyone. Can this all be Ruben Amorim’s fault?",
      "Only Andre Onana was rated lower than the £74m signing who waited until the very end to take his penalty in the shootout.",
      "Manchester United losing to Grimsby has prompted all manner of responses, but most want Ruben Amorim out of the club.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund is likely to move to Serie A giants Napoli ‘within 48 hours’ in a loan with an option to buy, according to reports.",

      "Real Madrid have ‘generated great anger’ at Man Utd following one of their purchases in the summer transfer market, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils brought in five new players in the summer transfer window with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon all joining.",
      "The signing of 18-year-old Leon went under the radar a bit at Old Trafford with the Paraguay Under-20 international signing from Cerro Porteno in a deal worth an inital £3.3m, which could rise to £7m.",
      "Man Utd were also linked with other left-sided defenders with former Spain Under-21 international Alvaro Carreras, who they allowed to join Benfica in 2024.",
      "The Red Devils retained a €18m buy-back clause in the left-back’s deal with rumours that they could buy Carreras just to sell him for a profit to Real Madrid earlier in the summer.",
      "However, that didn’t happen and his boyhood club, Real Madrid, ended up paying Portuguese giants Benfica €50m for the Spaniard’s services in July.",
      "READ: Villa and Newcastle among transfer window losers as idea of a Big Eight suffers fatal blow",
      "His brilliant start at the Bernabeu has made some at Man Utd reportedly unhappy with Carreras already producing some solid performances for Los Blancos.",
      "Spanish website Defensa Central claims that ‘this great version that the Merengue youth player is showing at Real Madrid has generated great anger at Manchester United.’",
      "The report adds: ‘The English are seeing his performance at the white club and still can’t understand why they weren’t more insistent in keeping the player , when he had a buy-out clause with Benfica.",
      "‘At Old Trafford, who are not exactly flush with talent, they maintain that they have lost a great player and that they have ended up ‘giving him away’, something that confirms the crisis that the Mancunians are currently experiencing, both on and off the pitch, and that has very close to sacking Rúben Amorim, who still hasn’t found the key, despite having spent surprising amounts of money in the transfer market that has just closed.’",
      "After their 2-1 win over Real Mallorca over the weekend, Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso commented: “I had followed him and was very happy that he joined us. He already knows the club a bit and I expected a good adaptation, but he’s been extraordinary.",
      "“He does almost everything well, he’s very focused throughout the match and he’s a very good addition for the present and the future.”",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has rated the Red Devils’ transfer window as an eight of ten after investing around £200m on new attacking players.",
      "Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel: “Cunha coming in, Mbeumo, Sesko. £223 million pounds spent in this window. So, no one can sit here and say INEOS aren’t putting their money where their mouth is.",
      "“If I’m going to give this transfer window a mark out of 10, I’m going to give it an 8 based on the players they have got out of the club because those players had the potential of affecting the ambience if they were hanging around.”",
      "But the former Man Utd defender also heaped praise on Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS for doing a good job after being “hamstrung” by previous transfer windows.",
      "Ferdinand added: “INEOS are working from a hamstrung position. I think the recruitment that’s been done in the past has really hampered the way that INEOS have been able to attack the market. But I think INEOS have done a good job this window.",
      "“We could see sit here and go could Man United have gone got a midfielder, that was a position people think that Man United needed to strengthen.",
      "“I think in yesteryear, in the regime before, Man United would have gone out and blown 80, 90, million pounds on that player and paid over the odds, 30-40 million pounds and had to pay him probably double the wages that they would have got anywhere else. That’s why we’re in the position we’re in now.",
      "“We’re hampered with transfers. We’ve got players on far too much money. They’re sitting here and saying, ‘I’m not going anywhere.’ And I’ll make the players right. They’re in a great position. Why am I going to leave Man United or why am I going to leave any club when I’m sitting on 200 to 300 pounds a week.”",
      "A report in Spain has revealed who is likely to be Xabi Alonso’s fourth signing as Real Madrid boss following his return to the La Liga giants.",
      "Man Utd and Real Madrid are plotting a deal for Benfica defender Alvaro Carreras which could benefit both clubs, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid are closing in on their third signing under Xabi Alonso as they prepare for the Club World Cup."

      "Jamie Carragher has argued that there is a one reason behind Manchester United’s decision to stick with head coach Ruben Amorim amid a “big clamour”.",
      "Amorim is under immense pressure at Man Utd as he is currently the second-favourite to be the first Premier League manager sacked this season.",
      "The 40-year-old had a torrid time after replacing former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag towards the end of 2024 as he struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Under Amorim, the Red Devils plummeted to 15th in the Premier League and they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final, while their problems have carried over into this campaign.",
      "Man Utd invested around £200m to overhaul their attack by signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, but they are still ineffective in forward positions and easy to play through.",
      "READ: Villa and Newcastle among transfer window losers as idea of a Big Eight suffers fatal blow",
      "Carragher has commented on Amorim’s situation, claiming he would have “lost his job earlier” if he “wasn’t such a good-looking man”.",
      "“There is now a big clamour to get Jose Mourinho back in English football and the reason is because he’s box office, he comes out with stuff, but he was a winner. We always remember Brian Clough – when I was a kid and he was speaking you’d listen because he was a winner,” Carragher claimed on The Overlap Fan Debate.",
      "“The problem with Ruben Amorim is that he’s great in the press conferences but because he’s not winning, people are thinking, ‘Oh, shut up. Stop speaking.’ But if he was winning, we’d all be thinking he’s a great character and personality.",
      "“If he wasn’t so charismatic in the press conference, and wasn’t such a good-looking man, he might have lost his job a lot earlier. When you look at the results, they are horrendous.”",
      "Carragher also credited Amorim for his achievements at Sporting Lisbon, though he did name two other Premier League managers who are “better” than the current Man Utd boss.",
      "“He said something in the press conference – ‘I will nail this system down so the players can play it with their eyes closed’, I think he said – I don’t think he’ll get the time to do that if he doesn’t start getting results,” Carragher added.",
      "“He’s still a very young manager – what he did at Sporting Lisbon, we shouldn’t write off because that was a brilliant achievement when you think of Benfica and Porto in that league. To win the [Portuguese] league a couple of times with Sporting is a huge achievement.",
      "“Take Unai Emery and Eddie Howe. They’re not managers that are going for the league, but they are good managers.",
      "“To think this guy [Amorim] has got all the answers to get Manchester United back to the top when there are managers that aren’t even going for the league and are more experienced, there are a lot of better managers in the Premier League, and I think it’s going to be tough for him to turn it around.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been labelled an “absolute disgrace” with the Red Devils tipped to sack him over the international break.",
      "Jamie Carragher has revealed the Liverpool attack that he would favour playing for the rest of the season after Alexander Isak signed on deadline day.",
      "Losing at home to West Ham has left Nuno Espirito Santo in some quite considerable trouble. Even more than Ruben Amorim.",
      "Jamie Carragher has slammed Mikel Arteta after Arsenal’s defeat to Liverpool: “Heavily reliant on set-pieces, don’t create anything in open play.”",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Amorim could resign or be sacked but as we all struggle to come up with a solution to a broken Manchester United, there’s one obvious fix."

      "Danny Welbeck has been sporadically linked with a potential return to Man Utd after he progressed through the ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "The 34-year-old has enjoyed a late-career renaissance at Brighton as he scored ten Premier League goals in 2024/25.",
      "According to The Athletic, Welbeck’s impressive form last season sparked fresh interest from Man Utd, who ‘considered making a proposal of a contract until 2027 should they agree a fee with Brighton’.",
      "It is indicated that certain figures at Man Utd ‘felt he would add experience, technical quality, and heritage to the squad after spending 16 years at Old Trafford, graduating from the academy’.",
      "Despite this, INEOS supremo Ratcliffe decided to pull the plug on a deal as he was concerned about the player’s age.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘He would have been a relatively low-cost arrival to complement a marquee signing.",
      "‘But Ratcliffe was known to feel United could not sanction a two-year deal for a player who is 35 in November and instead a one plus one was discussed, but the offer was not formalised.’",
      "The report has also revealed two more Premier League stars who were on Man Utd’s radar in the summer.",
      "‘United had Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the background as a candidate on a free, with Wilcox feeling he could be a useful deputy, but United declined to make a proposal.",
      "‘As an alternative to Mbeumo, United held talks on Antoine Semenyo, but Bournemouth’s £70m valuation was seen as too high.’",
      "Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “world-class” dream team at Manchester United are making mistakes as their “very poor” recruitment continues…",
      "Manchester United are back. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ‘masterminded’ a big spend, ‘rebuilt’ everything and even won the Alejandro Garnacho transfer situation.",
      "Manchester United have put forward plans for their new stadium which they aim to open in 2030.",
      "Man Utd are not budging on their valuation of Bryan Mbeumo this summer even if it means moving on to different targets, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will seal a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford as talks continue between the two clubs, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is running the risk of falling out with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim over Bruno Fernandes, according to reports."

      "When you’ve already placed yourself so firmly hostage to fortune by announcing the transfer window winners, it’s only right and proper to repeat that by pointing and laughing at the ‘losers’ before they go on and enjoy enormously successful seasons at the far more trivial business of actual football.",
      "You can read all about the winners here if you’re interested in that sort of thing and the full exhaustive club-by-club list of Premier League transfers this summer is here too.",
      "If, like us, you’re far more in your element foretelling misery and despair than happiness and rainbows, then you’re in the right place…",
      "The problem for any club that gatecrashes the elite is that the efforts of a few years can all so quickly fall apart in a few weeks of poor decisions and mild panic.",
      "Even when that club is one of the size of Aston Villa. The last few years under Unai Emery have produced rapid and exciting progress, but also delivered that progress in a way that – on the field at least – has felt incredibly and now worryingly perhaps deceptively sustainable.",
      "Good players working hard for an excellent manager with a clear plan shouldn’t be revelatory but it has been for Villa.",
      "Until now. This feels like a summer that has seen the sands shift beneath Villa’s feet. Even those members of the old Big Six who’ve had questionable summers have had demonstrably better ones than Villa, whose deadline day panic buying spree is all the worse in many ways for feeling so much like a planned deadline day panic buying spree.",
      "They simply had no choice but to wait and see what was left on the shelf when everyone else had finished.",
      "It was, inevitably, a mixed bag. We’re genuinely interested to see just what Harvey Elliott can achieve now he’s got the chance to play club football with the kind of responsibility that brought the best out of him for England’s Under-21 side but we’re no longer remotely as sure as we would have been a year – or even six months ago – that Villa represent the right environment for that to happen.",
      "What little else they’ve managed to achieve is either underwhelming at best or just so absurdly on brand it feels like a joke. If you’re a club with an infamously unsustainable wage bill you simply cannot go around on deadline day signing Jadon Sancho on loan and expect to be taken seriously.",
      "And on top of the uninspiring ins comes the failure to get Emi Martinez out the door. A club in Villa’s financial position simply cannot afford to have a player like that hanging around on the outside p*ssing into the tent before we even consider the potential impact on such vagaries as team spirit and morale.",
      "Not for the first time a Premier League club finds itself in the position of hoping a Turkish team might come along and solve their problems.",

      "Villa’s d*ckhead is now just a d*ckhead.",

As long as you kind of ignored the acrimony and order of how things all panned out.",
      "But really it’s been a summer that has served as a gloomy reminder for Newcastle that even Champions League football doesn’t give them enough pull to consistently beat even the smallest or stupidest members of the Big Six on transfer matters and that stings.",
      "Time and again this summer Newcastle have been beaten to key targets by clubs they consider direct rivals, while another was able to eventually bully them into selling their prized asset, one they had spent all summer briefing to anyone who’d listen would not be sold.",
      "Newcastle fans are entitled to feel hurt at the way Alexander Isak went about getting his move, but no more so than Brentford fans are about the way Yoane Wissa went about getting his.",
      "And there will be less sympathy from the wider football community for the real reason this summer of regression feels so pointedly painful at Newcastle; that they believed so certainly when selling the very soul of the club to Saudi Arabia they were leaving all this kind of frustration behind.",

      "Daniel Farke and his squad and the fans have been let down by owners who promised the earth and have failed to deliver the surely attainable tools that Leeds needed to launch a viable survival bid in a Premier League that suddenly looks distinctly survivable.",
      "Leeds have already shown plenty in the win over Everton and goalless draw with Newcastle that they can go toe-to-toe with established Premier League sides – even if the hammering at Arsenal shows they’re way short against the very best. But they have also scored one goal – a penalty – in three games and barely looked like scoring at all in those last two.",
      "Leeds are not your regular promoted club and while nobody expects them to be competing for top talent with the Big Six/Seven/Eight the fact the’ve entered September appearing to have been outmanoeuvred by the other promoted clubs feels like an enormously avoidable error.",
      "The late collapse of an attempted deal for Harry Wilson is unfortunate, but also precisely the kind of misfortune you risk falling victim to when you leave something that has been in obvious need of attention all summer until the very last minute.",
      "",
      "Just not in any way the summer Palace would have planned and hoped for when lifting the FA Cup at the start of it.",
      "A Europa League place became a Europa Conference League place with an underwhelming slate of incomings coming nowhere near covering for the predictable, understandable and long-feared departure of Eberechi Eze for Arsenal.",
      "Palace were at least able to pull the plug on Marc Guehi’s move to Liverpool when their own hunt for a replacement turned up nothing suitable after a move for Igor collapsed. And there’s little doubt that Palace are stronger with Guehi than they would have been with Igor or anyone else they’d managed to land at such short notice.",
      "Guehi has also been a complete pro throughout a protracted transfer saga, playing a full – and spectacular goalscoring – part for Palace throughout. There will be disappointment there for sure, but no need for awkward and potentially destabilising reintegration of a player who had shown his hand.",
      "But when the big positive of your transfer window is that you’ve had to deny one of your best players a move they clearly wanted because everything else fell through at your end, then you’ve not come out of it looking great.",
      "The biggest fear for Palace now may be what happens if and when (far more likely the latter) some bigger club or other comes sniffing around the elite manager who has taken Palace further than any manager before yet not been given anything like the help he needs to go further still.",
      "",
      "Absolutely shouldn’t feel too gloomy when the initial pangs of regret fade. He’s still in the final year of his contract, he will have far greater control over his future in January and then total control of it next summer.",
      "He has burned no bridges at Selhurst Park and is still odds-on to end the season as England’s starting centre-back. There are worse ways that things can go wrong.",
      "Still, though. It’s just got to sting, hasn’t it? To have a move to the reigning champions and favourites to win it again this season agreed to the point of passing a medical only for it all to be snatched away at the last moment?",
      "",
      "Let’s start with the positives. Getting Caoimhin Kelleher was smart business, wasn’t it? The best number two in the Premier League now gets the chance to establish himself as a number one. He’s likely to be busy.",
      "Beyond that, though, this must go down as one of the most brutal ‘know your place’ summers any member of the ‘Other 14’ has suffered. Losing Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, two players who truly did light up last season, is horrible even without coming on the back of losing the inspirational manager who might just have been the one man making all of what’s happened to Brentford in recent years possible anyway.",
      "It’s the combination that makes you fear so keenly for Brentford. To have the guts of the team ripped out might have been survivable had Thomas Frank still been the manager. But he isn’t, and it really might not be something Brentford can get through with a rookie manager trying to navigate a situation that would test a seasoned firefighter to the very limits.",
      "",
      "We’re already seeing the difference it can make if your team gets picked off by the bigger boys but the manager remains with the example of Bournemouth.",
      "It is frankly absurd that you can lose almost your entire (excellent) defence at a club like Bournemouth and then produce the sort of performance the Cherries turned in at Tottenham at the weekend, when the hosts had simply no answer and created literally nothing against a team that could easily be forgiven for still licking their many wounds.",
      "Andoni Iraola is probably a genius. That’s the good news for Bournemouth. The bad news is that after the loss of Milos Kerkez and Ilya Zabarnyi and Dean Huijsen he pretty much has to be.",
      "",
      "Really is mad to think of the giddy optimism of that springtime run of six straight wins that lifted Wolves once and for all out of relegation bother. It’s only five months ago, but the mood now is wildly different.",
      "The loss of Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester was always going to be tough to ride out, but there just hasn’t been anything like enough subsequent movement the other way to feel like Wolves have a chance.",
      "We’ve been here before. This is a club that is no stranger to disastrous starts and swift course corrections through the second half of the season.",
      "But this particular disastrous start is already feeling like something more for a club that has performed the troubling trick of emerging from the summer having spent more than they’ve recouped yet with a weaker team and squad to show for it.",
      "",
      "We really do struggle to think of another example of a side spending so much money and having so little to actually show for it. Spending over £70m on Jean-Clair Todibo and Mateus Fernandes is wild behaviour, and only in part countered by getting as much as they did for Mohammed Kudus, a man who had clearly grown disillusioned with life as a Hammer and didn’t really fit with Graham Potter’s plans anyway.",
      "Perhaps our favourite bit about  West Ham’s summer business, most of which looks so very, very daft on paper, is that in Callum Wilson and Kyle Walker-Peters they might just have picked up two of the canniest free transfers of anyone along the way.",
      "",
      "Oh, mate. Look, even Mediawatch at its cynical, snarky, sarcastic worst will always acknowledge that reporting transfer news is hard. Things change all the time. What’s correct one day can be completely and entirely wrong the next.",
      "It’s the nature of the beast. Absolutely nobody – at least nobody acting in any kind of good faith – expects any football journalist to have a 100 per cent accuracy rate on transfers. Nobody really cares or will remember the times you get it ‘wrong’.",
      "Unless, of course, you make the insistence that one particular transfer cannot possibly happen your entire personality, for an entire summer, and then when that transfer duly does happen write a long ‘I’m not owned’ post about how you were right actually and that spending your summer arguing about it in a weirdly confrontational manner with randoms on twitter rather than spending time with your family is something to be proud of.",
      "But beyond the silliness of it all, there is a serious point here. Edwards’ big error, apart from becoming just way more invested in a specific transfer saga than can ever be healthy for anyone, was in fundamentally misunderstanding the journalist’s role. He said ‘I only reported what I was told’ as a boast, when it is in fact a startling admission.",
      "When everyone else tells you it will almost certainly rain but Saudi Arabia tell you it definitely won’t, it’s your job to call everyone on Twitter carrying an umbrella a simpleton.",

      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund all departed Manchester United on final day of summer transfer window; after fortnight of negotiations, Senne Lammens joined club in deal worth £18.2m as goalkeeper chosen over Aston VIlla's Emi Martinez",
      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 13:06, UK",
      "Manchester United finally offloaded most of their 'bomb squad' as Antony completed a permanent move to Real Betis, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho joined Napoli and Aston Villa on loan respectively.",
      "The club had begun Transfer Deadline Day with Antony, Hojlund, Sancho and Tyrell Malacia exiled from Ruben Amorim's squad - with only the latter remaining at Old Trafford until January at least.",
      "Antony's return to Betis ended a summer of speculation over whether he would end up back in LaLiga, having spent the second half of last season at the club and racking up seven goal contributions in 17 games.",
      "He joined them for £21.7m, a loss of £64m from when Man Utd paid Ajax £86m for him in 2022.",
      "Jadon Sancho, who had been a target for Roma, joined Villa as one of a number of late additions to Unai Emery's squad, with Rasmus Hojlund making a temporary move, which could become permanent, to Napoli, who have been seeking further striking reinforcements all summer.",
      "Few incomings were expected after Brighton rejected an offer for Carlos Baleba last month, with Senne Lammens the only arrival in an attempt to solve the ongoing goalkeeping issues at Old Trafford.",
      "Andre Onana has not featured for Man Utd in the league all season and was at fault for one of Grimsby's goals in their shock Carabao Cup defeat last week, with Altay Bayindir also faltering in his place in United's opening three Premier League games.",
      "Lammens joined from Royal Antwerp on a five-year deal for a fee of around £18.2m, including add-ons. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez had been discussed, but it was decided internally that Lammens was a better option.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",

      "Antony had made no secret of his desire to avoid returning to Old Trafford at the end of last season, including a tearful interview while on loan at Betis where he said he had fallen out of love with football at United.",
      "In the end, he got his wish - but he had to wait right up to the end of the transfer window for it to happen. He leaves Old Trafford having played 62 Premier League games across three seasons, but contributed just eight goals and assists.",
      "He arrived at the club in 2022 as one of the major signings of the summer, following former boss Erik ten Hag from Ajax, but never managed to recreate his Eredivisie form for United.",
      "A number of clubs had been interested in bringing in Sancho this summer, including Chelsea, where he spent last season on loan and featured heavily in their run to the Conference League title. But, having failed to agree terms with the Blues, he returned to Old Trafford - and they paid a £5m fine as per the terms of his loan.",

      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",

      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",

      "In a record-breaking summer, spending by Premier League clubs on forwards vastly outweighed other positions. The rush to add firepower was led by the elite clubs. Manchester City were the only member of the so-called big six not to sign a striker having started the resurgence with Erling Haaland.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £200m on Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. Chelsea invested £90m in Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. Arsenal and Manchester United went for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko at £63.5m and £73.7m respectively. Spurs struck a late loan deal to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Newcastle finally sanctioned the departure of Isak to Liverpool as they completed the £55m signing of Yoane Wissa from Brentford having already brought in Nick Woltemade for £69m from Stuttgart.",
      "Further down the league, Wolves kept Jorgen Strand Larsen and added another target man in Tolu Arokodare from Genk for £23.4m. Brighton spent £31.4m on Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos, while Nottingham Forest and Everton spent similar sums on Arnaud Kalimeundo and Thierno Barry.",
      "The No 9 is back in fashion.Nick Wright",
      "It was the summer of striker statements, Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both speaking out - one of them in the hope of leaving Newcastle United and the other in the hope of joining. Ultimately, both got their wish, reminding us all that player power still exists.",
      "\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way,\" announced Wissa of Brentford's stance. \"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship cannot continue,\" argued Isak. Newcastle were quick to respond that no promise had ever been made.",
      "There are those who would gladly have refused Isak his move to Liverpool and allowed the Swede to sit out his contract, effectively putting his career on hold. The logic goes that this would have sent out a strong message that Newcastle could not be bullied.",
      "Given the vast resources of the Saudi owners, this would have been an option. But profit and sustainability rules mean that while they could afford it, they could not afford to have their budgets slashed, damaging the ability of the club to compete as it might.",
      "And so, player power endures. With that in mind, spare a thought for Jorgen Strand Larsen, the Wolves striker wanted by Newcastle who was not able to get his move. \"I know him very well,\" said Vitor Pereira, the Wolves boss. \"He will never force [a move].\"",
      "The result is that while Strand Larsen faces what looks likely to be a relegation battle, Wissa is preparing to take on Barcelona in the Champions League. The actions of those players who withhold their labour might be distasteful. But they can certainly pay off.Adam Bate",
      "The Premier League clubs outside the traditional top six recognise they are unable to compete with the financial power of those in it. They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.",
      "Brentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.",
      "So-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.",
      "Bournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.",
      "Brighton sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, Crystal Palace let Eberechi Eze go to Arsenal for £67.5m and Wolves made £95.8m selling Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.",
      "The buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.",
      "And as long as the smart recruitment continues, the cycle will go on.Dan Long",

      "Given that three Everton players were among the scorers at Molineux, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall picking up an assist to go along with his fine goal, some might be surprised to see Jack Grealish named player of the match again but he just stands out.",
      "He assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.",
      "But it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.",
      "Asked about Grealish's improvement, David Moyes said: \"Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.\" He added: \"The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.\"Adam Bate",
      "But Liam Delap's injury will undoubtedly sour the mood at Stamford Bridge in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against Fulham.",
      "Enzo Maresca confirmed the striker would be sidelined for weeks after limping off in the first half with a hamstring problem - and now they must navigate a difficult return to the squad for Nicolas Jackson.",
      "The player was in Germany to complete that move and will now need to come to terms with returning to west London, after his head coach had previously sanctioned his exit.",
      "The start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.",
      "Difficult games against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton are on the horizon in the Premier League. Not to mention the first Champions League game of the season against Bayern Munich on September 17, too.",
      "Jackson will likely be playing at the Allianz Arena in the near future - but he'll be wearing blue not red.Patrick Rowe",
      "Amid clear challenges for Manchester United, one name stands out as a potential beacon of light: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "He was consistently brilliant for Brentford and has wasted no time in slotting in perfectly in Ruben Amorim's formation. Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.",
      "For a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.",
      "His ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.",
      "United have been in search of a player who can bring more dynamic attacking options to the table and in Mbeumo they may just have found him.Lewis Jones",
      "This 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth was a reality check for Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank.",
      "After the highs of winning at Manchester City, Spurs put in a dreadful display against Bournemouth that has punctured the air of optimism under the Dane, with the full-time whistle met by boos.",
      "One fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.",
      "Those wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.",
      "On the day Spurs found out their fixture dates for the Champions League, you would have thought Bournemouth were the team to be facing Villarreal at home on September 16, such was the dominance and slickness in their display.",
      "A toothless Spurs had just five shots against the Cherries, while Frank's side failed to have a single shot in the first half of a Premier League home game since February 2020.",
      "How Frank could have done with his new £51m signing Xavi Simons on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Frank said of Simons at his post-match press conference: \"Sometimes you need a player that can do something a little bit out of nothing, go past a player, produce a cross, a shot, a pass, with that extra quality that you need on the day, and that's what I think he can bring.\"",
      "Spurs will desperately be hoping the Netherlands international can add some sparkle and guile, because the boos will only get louder if Tottenham put in more performances like this.Declan Olley",
      "It would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.",
      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",

      "Manchester United beat Burnley 3-2 in a game Ruben Amorim defined as \"must win\" following their cup exit at Grimsby; United led twice but were pegged back by Scott Parker's team; Bruno Fernandes netted a stoppage-time winner from penalty spot",
      "Sunday 31 August 2025 12:30, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim said he loves his players when \"they put effort in\" following Manchester United's dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley in a \"must-win\" game.",
      "Twice United led, twice they were pegged back by Burnley on Saturday, but Fernandes stepped up in stoppage time after VAR spotted a shirt pull on Amad Diallo and dispatched the penalty kick. United did create 3.54 worth of expected goals from 26 shots as they did put Burnley under significant pressure.",
      "In midweek, Amorim fuelled speculation over his future saying \"something had to change\" after their embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby, before later adding he \"sometimes wants to quit - and sometimes wants to stay at Man Utd for the next 20 years\".",
      "Speaking after their win over Burnley, he said: \"When they [his players] put the effort, I will always love them.",
      "\"Even when Amad is missing that goal - I love Amad, if he's giving everything.",
      "\"We need to understand that we always need to be at this level of effort. Because even in the game, we played well in the beginning. I think we struggled when we changed the characteristics of the players because the match is not so perfect and you can feel the players struggle a little bit, even in the second half but the effort was always there.",
      "\"We tried to put people in the box. We tried to put more people inside the box, not just around the box to play the ball. Some of the things we were doing during the week and spoke about they were doing that and were focused on the game. So that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Amorim says his side need both Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha to be competitive after admitting his concerns over their respective injuries.",
      "Cunha went straight down the tunnel, midway through the first half, appearing to clutch his hamstring. Mount didn't emerge for the second half with Kobbie Mainoo replacing him during the break.",
      "Asked for an injury update, Amorim said: \"I don't know [what their injuries were]. We will check them. We need those guys really bad. We need them to be really competitive.\"",
      "United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir conceded two goals from Burnley's six shots at goal and was at fault for Jaidon Anthony's goal after spilling a shot following a long throw-in.",
      "Andre Onana was at fault for both Grimsby goals in midweek, allowing Charles Vernam's 22nd-minute strike to go through him at his near post before missing his punch at a cross which gave Tyrell Warren a tap-in eight minutes later.",
      "Amorim has admitted it's difficult to be a Manchester United goalkeeper such is the scrutiny on the club.",
      "\"They are humans. At Manchester United everything is the news. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper and you can see even when I change the goalkeeper these situations happen. We are in that moment. It's hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "\"If you look at the goal, we can defend better the box. We suffered a similar goal against Fulham because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"These things don't have anything to do with the goalkeeper. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. Players are struggling a little bit with all the things that are happening around the club, that is normal. It's not just the goalkeepers; everybody has to improve.\"",
      "\"Is it really important? In the future, we are going to find out.",
      "\"These three points, I think, if you look at the game, we should solve the game right in the first half and then control the game. But it's never easy.",
      "\"We have to try to fight until the last minute, things that we overcomplicate. But for me, the most important thing is that it doesn't matter what happens, we try. During the game, we try in every moment, sometimes playing well, sometimes playing too open, too fast, losing possessions.",
      "\"But the effort was there.",
      "\"I think if you look at the first half, we have so many chances to score a goal and then that can help us to control the emotions, the game, to involve the fans.",
      "\"But we are always doing this and then you have the feeling you can control the game and I think you control it well. But then one throw-in, one set-piece in this moment is really hard for us. But I was shaking my head because sometimes things are really easy.",
      "\"I don't like to see penalties, but I like to see the image of the fans. But I was just thinking sometimes one moment can change a lot of things.",
      "\"But in that moment I just was thinking that it's fair to win this game. I was not expecting Bruno to miss two penalties in a row. So I was really confident.\"",
      "Amorim also offered an explanation as to why after starting in midweek, summer signing Benjamin Sesko returned to the substitutes' bench.",
      "Sesko started the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby, also taking part in the penalty shootout. After questions were raised due to Sesko taking United's 10th penalty on the night, Amorim revealed the 22-year-old had been suffering with cramp after completing his first 90 minutes of the season.",
      "\"So he finished the game (against Grimsby) with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties. And today was that reason also, because Josh is also a striker, he's an international striker.",
      "\"But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a four-division team, he did that on Wednesday.\"",
      "When asked if there will be planned talks during the international break regarding his future, Amorim said: 'I'm always talking with the board and I understand the context, the feeling, everything. So I understand that sometimes I say some things.",
      "\"Again, I will say it again when we have these kinds of moments. Today was a good day, but it was just a win. For me, it's to look at the game, we should have won in a different way.",
      "\"We should not suffer. And we return a little bit our level against Arsenal, a little bit against Fulham. And today was more or less the same.\"",
