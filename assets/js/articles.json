      "Manchester United seem to have dropped a major hint that Bryan Mbeumo will be available for Monday's clash with Bournemouth. The Cameroon star was featured in training photographs with his teammates ahead of the match despite uncertainty around his involvement.",
      "United have kept quiet about the availability of Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui as they gear up to face the Cherries at Old Trafford. The trio are due to jet off to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) next week, but doubt remains over whether they'll take to the pitch against Andoni Iraola's side.",
      "FIFA established Monday, December 15, as the release date for clubs to free up players for the tournament, which kicks off on Saturday, December 21, but this created complications for United as their match with the Cherries falls on Monday.",
      "It's believed that United officials have been in discussions with the football associations of Cameroon, Ivory Coast, and Morocco regarding all three players in an attempt to negotiate an extension and enable them to play against Bournemouth before departing for the AFCON.",
      "However, United now appear to have given the strongest indication yet that Mbeumo, specifically, will line up against Bournemouth. United shared a photograph of Mbeumo in training on Instagram on Sunday morning.",
      "Accompanying three images of Mbeumo grinning during training with his teammates, United wrote in a caption: \"BM19 [beaming face with smiling eyes emoji, white love heart emoji].\"",
      "Supporters rushed to the comments section to share their predictions about Mbeumo's performance against Bournemouth, should he turn out for United on Monday. One supporter said: \"Goal and assists tomorrow [fire emoji].\"",
      "Another posted: \"Last dance for Mbeumo and Amad [raised hands emoji].\"",
      "A third commented: \"Sign off with goals tomorrow, before going for the AFCON.\"",
      "A fourth chimed in: \"Mbeumo to score a hat-trick tomorrow.\"",
      "Speaking ahead of the Bournemouth clash, United boss Ruben Amorim revealed discussions are ongoing regarding Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui: \"We are still in conversations with national team, the games in Monday, they are training and we are trying to prepare all scenarios.",
      "\"It's frustrating but at the same time nobody knows who is going to play, so it's a good thing. We have players to cope with everything. With a long week you can work on several stuff to prepare the game.\"",
      "Amorim suggested on Friday that United could exploit the uncertainty to their benefit, stating: \"Every national team has their ideas about when they want the players. I expect today [Friday] or maybe tomorrow [Saturday] to have a decision but we are waiting until the last moment to choose the best team.\"",
      "Victory against Bournemouth would lift United into fifth place in the Premier League standings. The Red Devils, who thrashed Wolves 4-1 in their previous outing, have suffered just one loss in their last nine league matches.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "At this time of the year, it is always nice to see a smiling face and you can normally be guaranteed one when Ruben Amorim walks into the room. Whatever you think about his 13 months in charge of Manchester United, it cannot be denied he has been a charming addition to the Premier League’s managerial ranks.",
      "And he has had to put up with a lot of critical flak, some of which has strayed into ridicule territory. His record has warranted close scrutiny because it has not been brilliant, winning only 23 of his 58 matches as United manager.",
      "But it has not warranted some of the mockery that has gone his way. Yet still, he almost always remains pleasant, polite and eminently cheerful. No snarling, no sarcasm, no snideness. He is a nice guy.",
      "But after the last Premier League game at Old Trafford - when West Ham United grabbed a late equaliser - Amorim was probably as angry as the regulars in the Old Trafford media theatre have seen him. He was not throwing things around but he was quietly seething.",
      "As an illustration, he did not take kindly to a question about him not trusting the United academy - and Amorim usually takes kindly to all questions, no matter how challenging. But he was seething for a reason. United had blown the chance to erase some of the pain inflicted by 10-man Everton recently and they had blown the chance to begin December with a statement win.",
      "Rightly, and admirably, Amorim has been supported by the Old Trafford hierarchy, despite regular attacks from pundits, including some very high-profile ex-United players.",
      "Only a few days ago, Paul Scholes said: “I don’t think the manager gets this club, full stop. I just don’t think he’s the right man.”",
      "There will be no excuses if United are not, with regard to a top-four place, in a strong position by mid-January. Injuries will not be an excuse, losing players to the Africa Cup of Nations will not be an excuse.",
      "Amorim admitted as much in his press conference ahead of Monday night’s game against Bournemouth, saying: “We have players to cope with everything. With a long week, you can see a lot of things and work on stuff to prepare for any situation.”",
      "After Bournemouth, United travel to Aston Villa, before home games against Newcastle United and Wolves are followed by trips to Leeds United and Burnley. Villa will clearly be tough but United will be facing a team that will have played six more matches this season. That should be significant.",
      "This United team should be one of the freshest in the country over this festive period. In Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui, they will miss important players but Amorim has plenty of cover.",
      "And even though it was against a team that is comfortably the worst in the division, Monday’s thumping of Wolves will give them momentum. It is not a make-or-break festive fixture period for Amorim but if he does not give United a happy Christmas, then it will finally be time to ask some serious questions.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "As the January transfer window creeps up, fans will be hoping for deals to be done to strengthen the squad for the second half of the season.",

      "Due to this, the 23-year-old's name has now cropped up alongside a host of clubs including United. A report from BILD in November stated that the Red Devils had made contact with Adeyemi's agent, Jorge Mendes.",

      "Vin Diesel has claimed that Cristiano Ronaldo has had a role written for him in the next instalment of the Fast film franchise. The Hollywood star shared a snap of himself with the Portuguese footballing idol on Instagram this week, showing them smiling as they gave a thumbs up.",
      "And captioning the snap, Vin Diesel - real name Mark Sinclair - wrote: \"Everyone asked, would he be in the Fast mythology...I gotta tell you he is a real one. We wrote a role for him...@cristiano.\"",
      "And it didn't take long for social media to go into a meltdown as a result of the photograph, with many users taking to the comments section to share their excitement of seeing Ronaldo swap the pitch for the silver screen. One joked: \"We got Cristiano in Fast x before GTA 6 TOO, this is wild,\" while a second added: \"When legends meet expect greatness.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "The next instalment of the Fast series comes in the form of Fast & Furious 11, which is expected to be billed as 'Fast Forever'. It is also expected to be the final movie of the saga, which initially launched back in 2001 and starred Vin Diesel, alongside Michelle Rodriguez and the late Paul Walker.",
      "The street racing series is set to launch the next instalment in 2026, despite recent delays, and movie lovers could see Ronaldo play a part, if Vin Diesel's claims are true. It comes as Ronaldo has already announced that he will be dipping into the world of cinematography earlier this year.",
      "Back in April, the 40-year-old revealed that he had launched his very own film studio alongside British film producer and director, Matthew Vaughn. A statement on his X account at the time read: \"Cristiano Ronaldo loves movies; Matthew Vaughn loves sport - and they both love a good story.",
      "“Both have been disruptive champions at their game and will now combine the world of sport and storytelling through the launch of UR MARV, an independent joint venture film studio embracing innovative technology, with a nod to tradition.",
      "\"Through UR MARV, Ronaldo and Vaughn have financed and produced two action films together and are about to start a third in the same series. They look forward to announcing the first release soon.\"",
      "It comes as Ronaldo is seemingly winding down an illustrious footballing career which has cemented him as one of the greatest to ever play the beautiful game, enjoying legendary stints with Sporting CP, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Al-Nassr.",
      "Currently under contract with the latter until 2027, football fans expect next summer's World Cup in North America to be his final major tournament with the Portuguese national team. However, the forward's participation at the event was cast into speculation last month when he received a straight red card for an elbow on Dara O'Shea during a qualifier against Ireland.",
      "While violent conduct usually carries a three-match ban, Ronaldo has had his second and third match bans suspended for a year. After sitting out Portugal's final qualifier with Armenia, it means that he will not miss any of his nation's group stage games at next summer's competition unless he commits a similar offence.",
      "A statement from FIFA read: \"If Cristiano Ronaldo commits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period, the suspension set out in the disciplinary decision shall be deemed automatically revoked and the remaining two matches must be served immediately.\"",

      "Mohamed Salah overtook Wayne Rooney's single-club goal involvements record during Saturday's clash between Liverpool and Brighton and Hove Albion. The Egyptian started on the bench for the match for a fourth consecutive Premier League outing, after falling out of favour under Arne Slot.",
      "However, midway through the first-half, the 33-year-old was called upon to replace a struggling Joe Gomez, as Liverpool fans inside of Anfield greeted him with an ovation. Already 1-0 up at the time thanks to Hugo Ekitike's first-minute opener, Salah assisted the Frenchman for his brace in the second-half to take his total number of single-club goal involvements in the Premier League to 277 (broken down into 188 goals and 89 assists).",
      "The assist also saw him cruise past Rooney's longstanding record of 276 goal involvements, made up of 183 goals and 93 assists during his stint with Manchester United. However, he still remains third on the list in terms of multi-club goal involvements, with Alan Shearer's 324 and Rooney's 311 total at United and Everton still a way off.",
      "It comes as Liverpool fans made their feelings clear on Salah's current situation crystal clear on Saturday afternoon. The Egyptian unleased a scathing assessment of his relationship with Slot in the wake of the Reds' 3-3 draw with Leeds United last weekend.",
      "Tensions were already high ahead of kick-off, given the fact that it came as the third consecutive Premier League match that Salah had been demoted to the bench for. And in the aftermath of the match, Salah told reporters of his frustrations as he pulled no punches.",
      "He said: \"I don't know what to say. It's kind of funny, I couldn't believe it. It's a disappointing result for us as a team. We conceded silly goals. I could not help my team-mates because I am on the bench. I could not believe I was sitting on the bench for 90 minutes.",
      "\"That's the third time. It's the first time in my career I think. I am very disappointed, I have done so much for this club over years, especially last season, It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.",
      "\"That's how I feel it. Someone wants me to get all the blame. The club promised me a lot in summer. Now, I'm on bench, so I can say they haven't kept those promises.",
      "\"I used to have a good relationship [with Slot]. Now we don't have any relationship and I don't know why. [It] seems like someone does not want me in the club.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Salah also hinted that the Brighton match could be his last game as a Liverpool player, despite only signing a contract extension with the club earlier this year. He added: \"I called my mum and dad and told them to come to the Brighton game.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if I play or not. I'm going to enjoy it. I am just going to be at Anfield and say goodbye to the fans before the Africa Cup of Nations, because I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"It's not acceptable to me to be fair. If I was somewhere else, every club would protect its players. Now it's, 'Throw Mo under the bus because he is a problem in a team'. I don't think I am a problem.",
      "\"I am not fighting for my position every day because I have earned it. I am not bigger than the club. I am not bigger than anything. But I have earned it.\"",
      "Salah is now set to team-up with his national team-mates to take part in AFCON, which runs until mid January. And with the January transfer window right around the corner, it is unknown whether or not the forward, who has dedicated the last eight years of his career to Merseyside, will remain with the club come February 1.",

      "The latest figures show a significant improvement from the £6.9m loss recorded in the same period last year due to reduced costs. United's minority owner, Ratcliffe, has been trying to save money since taking control of football operations in February 2024.",
      "The Ineos founder has been open in his belief that United must drastically reduce expenditure and has made around 450 staff redundancies since taking over. The petrochemicals billionaire has also taken away staff benefits and increased ticket prices at Old Trafford.",
      "And The Sun now report that Ratcliffe has asked bosses to find a company that the M16 club can pay to provide all food and drink from hospitality rooms to stadium kiosks in the hope of saving more money.",
      "It is said that a potential deal could lead to a menu overhaul, with prawn sandwiches potentially being axed.

      "\"The catering staff are concerned that any potential change could see them lose their jobs,\" a source said.",
      "\"The club have been at pains to explain that by law, any outsourcing deal has to guarantee them their jobs, but some take great pride in being employed by Manchester United. It's a worrying time for them.\"",

      "He said: \"Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans.",

      "Manchester United's notorious hierarchy boasted one of the most fearsome reputations the Premier League has ever witnessed. Sir Alex Ferguson commanded the club for nearly three decades, and his iron-fisted approach to management was legendary.",
      "Upset Fergie and you might find yourself permanently benched. The results spoke volumes, with an incredible 38 major trophies secured under his leadership.",
      "Yet Dimitar Berbatov has revealed that standards weren't applied equally behind the scenes at Old Trafford. The Bulgarian striker has previously shared that four United stars enjoyed \"special treatment\" from the Scot, something every player in the changing room could see.",
      "Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo were all singled out by the former United forward as players Ferguson trusted implicitly to deliver when it mattered most.",
      "Speaking to the Mirror in 2022, Berbatov said: \"The hierarchy in football, it's always there with the players. It doesn't matter when anyone tells you. When you are a star in a football team and you deserve to be one, of course, from time to time you will have special treatment from the manager.",
      "\"I remember Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville when we used to train, they trained a bit differently so they could save themselves for the games, and there is nothing wrong with that. This is normal in football.",
      "\"So it was the same with Cristiano Ronaldo, and in the end, we saw the results.\"",
      "Despite this favouritism being apparent to the rest of the squad, Berbatov maintained that it never created any divisions. He added: \"When you are a great football player sometimes the manager is going to give you more special attention. As long as you help the team win the game, this is normal in football.",
      "\"Sir Alex was very good at making a point to speak to everyone individually, so you didn't feel left out. Even if you didn't play he would know how to speak with you.\"",
      "The special attention these four legends received clearly delivered remarkable results, as they collectively secured 88 major trophies during Ferguson's reign at United. Neville dedicated his entire playing career to Old Trafford and earned his place in the Premier League Hall of Fame.",
      "Apart from two brief outings for his son's side, Royton Town, in 2018, Scholes remained loyal to United throughout his career and frequently features in discussions about the Premier League's greatest ever midfielder. Giggs devoted his entire playing days to Manchester and claimed more Premier League titles than any other player in the competition's history.",
      "Ronaldo's reputation precedes him, having evolved into arguably one of football's most exceptional talents of all time. Ferguson's preferential approach towards these four United icons undoubtedly delivered extraordinary returns for both their individual careers and the club's overall achievements.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Barcelona manager Hansi Flick has heaped praise on Marcus Rashford for his mature response to reduced game time. The on-loan Manchester United star has been restricted to substitute roles in four of his past five fixtures.",
      "Following his fall from grace at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim, Rashford secured a loan switch to Aston Villa in January before embarking on another temporary move this summer, heading to Spain.",
      "There, he has proved himself a useful squad member under Flick, netting six goals to date, with four of those strikes coming in the Champions League. His time on the pitch has diminished in recent weeks as other first-team regulars have returned from injury, but Rashford's response to this has impressed his boss.",
      "Rashford's attitude was frequently questioned at his boyhood club, United, particularly by Amorim, who raised concerns about the England star's commitment in training. He was also benched by Flick after turning up late to a September team meeting.",
      "However, Flick now has nothing but admiration for Rashford regarding how he has accepted a reduced role. It has been Brazilian star Raphinha who has effectively replaced him in the starting line-up after recovering from a hamstring problem, with Robert Lewandowski the preferred option up front.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Flick said: \"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected and the last time I checked with him he replied to me, 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions. The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important.'",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I am so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad,\" he continued.",
      "\"What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",
      "Rashford himself opened up last week about his loan spell at Barcelona. The 28-year-old was enthusiastic about his time with the Spanish giants so far.",
      "He said: \"I don't see anything here as like a pressure. It's just, I'm here to play football,\" and \"It's been amazing. I feel welcome, I feel at home.",
      "\"I've just been enjoying every step of the way. It's a new language of football. I've always been, like many people in the world, an admirer of Spanish football.",
      "\"To play for the biggest club in Spain is a huge honour. I'm looking forward to playing more games here, and I'm just doing my best and try to help the team to win.",
      "\"It's a club that demands this,\" he continued. \"The environment is always pushing us to be the best players we can be, so it's perfect to be in a place like this as a player.\"",

      "Manchester United chief Collette Roche has revealed that the club are closing in on a 'milestone' moment in plans to redevelop Old Trafford. United unveiled scale models and images of what their new stadium, which is expected to cost £2billion, will look like at a London event earlier this year.",
      "But a number of issues have arisen during the development phase and have led to delays. Now, though, Roche is confident that the new year will mark the next phase of the project, with the launch of a Mayoral Development Corporation set to take place in January.",
      "\"We're currently in several conversations with local landowners to make sure we can secure the best piece of land that we wanna put this stadium on that will hopefully be there for over 100 years. And in the background, we're doing a lot of work with the local authorities to make that happen.",
      "\"They're gonna launch Mayoral Development Corporation, formally, in January and I think that will be a good sort of milestone if you like, in terms of the wider regeneration. We're really, really ambitious, a lot of work is happening - albeit behind the scenes - and hopefully soon we'll be able to come forward with some bigger news.\"",
      "One hurdle that United must overcome is with Freightliner, which owns the railway depot that surrounds Old Trafford. Securing that portion of the site remains vital to the project, with club sources said to be confident that an agreement will be reached.",
      "In February, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe suggested that the stadium could be open as soon as 2030. No Government money will be put towards the stadium itself, although they're backing the regeneration project in the Trafford area.",
      "Speaking on The Added Time podcast, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said: \"It's not about giving them money because we have a really clear principle here at the start of this journey with the Mayoral Development Corporation.",
      "\"Manchester United will be paying for the stadium. There will not be a penny of public money going into that.",
      "Do you like the proposed design? Let us know your opinion in the comments section.",
      "\"But we have absolutely a role to play in making everything around the stadium as good as it can be because of the economic benefit that brings. If you think about it, there is a train station behind the stand there and it's not been used for a number of years for safety reasons.",
      "\"Part of it would see that station relocated a little bit, maybe a bit nearer Lou Macari's chippy or somewhere near there, and that would then reopen and massively benefit existing communities; Gorst Hill, Stretford and the people who live there, so the public benefit of this would be massive.",
      "\"Thousands of new homes, thousands of new jobs, so it's much wider than the ground itself.\"",

      "The confusion doesn't appear to be dampening Mbeumo or Amad's mood, though. On Friday evening, the Cameroon international posted a photo taken by Amad featuring himself and Leny Yoro on his Instagram stories.",

      "The 23-year-old went on to net 22 goals and provide six assists in all competitions during his first campaign with the French Ligue 1 side. Greenwood has not played for United since January 2022, after an internal club investigation led to the conclusion that he wouldn't play for them again following charges of attempted rape, coercive control and assault brought in early 2022.",

      "Ruben Amorim STILL remains in the dark over whether Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will be available to take on Bournemouth on Monday as Manchester United await clarity on when they must depart for their Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) duties. FIFA recently set December 15 as the release date for players participating in the tournament, but with United scheduled to play Bournemouth that same evening, it has created uncertainty over whether the trio will feature against the Cherries.",
      "Just three days before kick-off, Amorim still doesn't know if he can rely on those players for the Bournemouth clash and has been compelled to prepare multiple tactical approaches for the match, based on their potential availability. He's optimistic that the confusion might also unsettle Bournemouth, who cannot prepare for which United side they'll encounter.",
      "\"We are still in conversations with national teams, the game is Monday, they are training and we are trying to prepare all scenarios,\" he explained. \"It's frustrating, but at the same time, nobody knows who is going to play, so it's a good thing. We have players to cope with everything. With a long week you can work on several stuff to prepare the game.\"",
      "Mazraoui is set to kick off his AFCON campaign on the tournament's opening day (December 21), with Morocco facing Comoros, while Amad and Mbeumo won't see action until Christmas Eve when Ivory Coast take on Mozambique and Cameroon go up against Gabon.",
      "It was speculated that the release dates for the players could vary based on their tournament start dates, but Amorim stated that this wasn't certain and he hoped to have clarity by Saturday at the latest. \"I don't know if it's going to be the same situation,\" he commented.",
      "\"Every national team has their ideas about when they want the players. I expect today or maybe tomorrow to have a decision, but we are waiting until the last moment to choose the best team.\"",
      "United defenders Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt remain absent for the game against Bournemouth. But striker Benjamin Sesko could play for the first time since sustaining a knee injury at Tottenham five weeks ago.",
      "“Maguire is out, De Ligt is out,” said Amorim. “Ben we have to see.",
      "“We have to see if he’s available. He had some (food) poisoning but we’ll see. Let’s wait. We have two training (sessions) still. Benjamin we will assess.",
      "“(De Ligt) has something in his back. I don’t know for sure. Sometimes you see it’s not a big injury because he finished the game quite well against Crystal Palace, but he has some pain.",
      "“So, you sometimes think that it’s going to solve during this week but sometimes he feels a little bit of pain and we have to be careful with that.”",

      "Jadon Sancho appeared visibly upset on Thursday night after being substituted during Aston Villa's 2-1 victory over FC Basel in the Europa League. The 25-year-old joined Villa on a season-long loan from Manchester United in the summer amid widespread speculation about his future.",
      "Since his move to Villa Park, the winger has only started five matches, with all seven of his Premier League appearances coming as a substitute. On Thursday night, Sancho was in the starting line-up for Unai Emery's side in Switzerland as they aimed to secure their spot in the last 16 of the Europa League.",
      "The United loanee has now started four matches in the competition for Villa, including their previous three victories against Maccabi Tel Aviv, Young Boys and Basel. However, Sancho seemed noticeably annoyed when he was substituted.",
      "With Villa leading 2-1 thanks to goals from Evann Guessand and Youri Tielemans, Emery decided to replace Sancho as part of a triple substitution. Amadou Onana and Emiliano Buendia were also taken off, with Boubacar Kamara, Morgan Rogers, and Ollie Watkins brought on.",
      "As the change was made, TV cameras captured Sancho approaching the substitutes' bench, clearly disappointed to be leaving the pitch. After acknowledging Emery, Sancho hit an empty seat in the dugout before taking his place on the bench.",
      "Despite his frustration, Sancho put in a solid performance on Thursday night and was unlucky not to provide an assist for Guessand. This follows speculation that Villa remain uncertain about Sancho and his long-term prospects at the club.",
      "Sancho's United contract is due to run out at the season's end. It is currently unclear what the future holds for the ex-Borussia Dortmund star",
      "Earlier this year, Villa struck a deal worth £10.5million with Gremio for Brazilian winger Alysson. A medical is scheduled before a January transfer, with the left-footed right winger bringing additional options to Emery's attacking ranks.",
      "Previously, reports suggested Villa were already contemplating making Sancho's switch permanent, but his limited game time in the Midlands plus Alysson's arrival has cast doubt on that possibility. \"When Leon Bailey left, it was a moment for us to assess the players we had identified through our scouting,\" Emery explained when questioned about the decision to recruit the winger.",
      "\"We then had the opportunity to make a signing, and one of the players on our list was Jadon Sancho. He's capable of playing on both the right and left wings, and he provides something different. He's a good player - 25 years old - and I felt he performed very well last year at Chelsea.",
      "\"Yes, he had some problems at Manchester United, but during his time at Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic. He's also played 25 times for England. He's still young, still hungry, and has the ability to show his skills and qualities.",
      "\"Hopefully, we can bring out the best in him here. In the last few years, he's played more on the left, but at Dortmund, he was more often on the right. Here, I see him being able to play in both of those positions.\"",

      "Manchester United cult hero Andrei Kanchelskis was welcomed back to the club for a tour of the Carrington facilities this week - and he looked completely different from his playing days.",
      "The Russian winger was hugely popular at Old Trafford, a key figure in helping the club end a 26-year wait for the league title, and is widely remembered for a famous hat-trick in a 5-0 win over rivals Manchester City in 1994.",
      "The club posted wholesome content of the 56-year-old receiving a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season whilst on a tour of the facilities, a season in which he played a crucial part in achieving the domestic double.",
      "Kanchelskis was known for his explosive speed and agile dribbling; his slim, tall frame caused defenders’ nightmares throughout his time in the top flight.",
      "Now, nearly 20 years on from his playing career he still confidently boasts a full head of hair, albeit slightly more slicked back than the curtains he wore whilst in his playing days in Manchester.",
      "The tricky winger enjoyed an illustrious playing career, representing the Soviet Union and Russia at international level whilst playing for Everton, Southampton, Rangers and Fiorentina.",
      "Kanchelskis is currently coaching Russian Second Division side Dynamo Bryansk and after his retirement, he took up the sporting director role at First Division side FC Nosta Novotroitsk before settling as a manager with various sides across central Europe.",
      "The Man United legend will be using his visit to England to gain inspiration and new ideas ahead of their domestic season kicking off in March.",
      "After enjoying a standout campaign for the Red Devils in 1994/95, winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, a shock move to Merseyside saw Kanchelskis join Everton for a club record £5 million fee and he has enjoyed somewhat of a cult status at both clubs since, a testament to his quality as a player.",
      "Kanchelskis and his son Andrei, who is a big supporter of Everton, also visited the Toffees’ training ground this week to meet David Moyes and to see their win over Nottingham Forest in the new stadium.",
      "When asked about his memories at the club, he said: “Every name is a big name at Man United, it was an excellent time. I remember the big boss, Sir Alex Ferguson he helped me a lot. A lot of criticism for me also when I played bad crosses.",
      "“He was always angry for me and (Giggsy) Ryan Giggs. But it was an excellent time and thank you very much Man United, it is still in my heart.”",
      "An early Christmas present from the club to one of their greats and a trip down memory lane for those who watched Kanchelskis play.",

      "Manchester United's Ayden Heaven is currently one of the most promising young talents at the club, having seen a swift rise since his transfer from Arsenal earlier this year.",
      "The youngster had stints at both West Ham and Arsenal's youth academies before making the move to United for a nominal fee in February. Upon joining, Heaven inked a four-and-a-half-year contract with the Red Devils and was immediately integrated into the first-team squad.",
      "Since his arrival, the 19-year-old has made 11 appearances for United, notching up one assist in the Premier League victory over Brighton in October. Heaven has started two Premier League matches under Ruben Amorim this season, including the recent 4-1 triumph over Wolves, where he lined up in a back three alongside Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Heaven is the second highly-rated youngster to make the move from Arsenal to United within four-month time frame, with forward Chido Obi-Martin also making the switch, albeit to United's academy, toward the end of 2024. However, there was a clear reason why Arsenal were willing to let go of such a promising prospect, and it boils down to another rising star in their academy.",
      "During the midweek Champions League victory over Club Brugge, Salmon was brought on from the bench as Mikel Arteta faced a shortage of defensive options amid a mounting injury crisis. The report highlights that Heaven's switch to United was internally accepted at the Emirates due to the strong faith they have in Salmon's abilities.",
      "Following the Wolves victory, having appeared in consecutive league matches, Heaven reflected post-match: \"There's so many great defenders at this club that he's trusting you to be at the middle of that defence.",
      "\"He [Amorim] is trusting me a lot. I feel like I'm working hard every day in training and I'm showing he can trust me in the games that I'm playing.",

      "Napoli have Mainoo’s former teammate Scott McTominay and current United loanee Rasmus Hojlund within their squad. The Italian club’s sporting director Giovanni Manna has responded to speculation that Mainoo could be the next player to join from Old Trafford as Napoli battle an injury crisis.",

      "Manchester United have announced a £13.3million operating profit in their first quarter financial results. Last year, the club had built up a £6.9m loss over the same period.",
      "The financial change is due to reduced costs, following Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s financial review after purchasing a minority stake in 2024.

The latest figures show United’s total revenue was £140.3m, despite their absence from European competition this season.",

      "Ruben Amorim was spiky when he spoke to journalists after drawing against West Ham at the beginning of the month. Amorim was furious after dropping points at Old Trafford and became notably irritated when he fielded a handful of questions about his handling of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Amorim was asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, and said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "The United boss was asked if players departing for the Africa Cup of Nations would open the door for Mainoo to be involved, and he said: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Asked whether he understood why Mainoo was of interest, he responded: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim laughed at the suggestion that his substitutions were conservative and Mainoo should have been brought on. He laughed because he had been asked about Mainoo again, but the optics were not good. It looked as if he was laughing at the idea that the 20-year-old would have been a good substitution.",
      "His response went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. Then Mainoo liked a post on Instagram from a media outlet that had posted the quotes with a surprised emoji. Mainoo subsequently unliked the post, presumably after a private word from a United communications staff member.",
      "That has been the only public sign of frustration from Mainoo this season. He has done everything he can to win a starting role again, working with private coaches during international breaks and changing his personal chef at home in an attempt to improve his game, but Amorim has continued to overlook him.",
      "Tom Heaton, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Mainoo are the only senior United players not to have started in the Premier League. Malacia was reintegrated in September after being placed in the 'bomb squad', Martinez has just returned from a 10-month injury lay-off and Heaton is 39 years old.",
      "Mainoo is only human for being frustrated with his situation. The youngster started for England at Euro 2024, but his career has regressed since Amorim's appointment from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "The Stockport-born lad requested to leave on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window. That request was blocked, but Mainoo has hope of leaving in the January window.",
      "At the end of last month, Amorim was asked whether requests to leave from either Mainoo or Joshua Zirkzee would be entertained in January, and he said: \"The first thing is that the club comes first, so we have to think about the club and the team, and then everything can happen.",
      "\"I was a football player, I understand everything. And I want to help my players in every situation, so I don't know what is going to happen. I want my players happy, I understand the frustration of some players, seeing that the World Cup is there.",
      "\"And I know what it means for the World Cup, but Manchester United comes first, so if I can help the club and the players, I will be happy, if not I have to think about the team.\"",
      "Mason Mount could play in a deeper midfield role, but he has exclusively played in one of the No.10 roles in Amorim's system, which means Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte and Mainoo are the only midfield options.",
      "United would leave themselves light in the centre of the pitch if they allowed Mainoo to leave, although the key to possibly unlocking his exit has returned to Carrington: Toby Collyer.",
      "Collyer signed for West Brom on a season-long loan, but he recently picked up an injury and is receiving treatment at Carrington. His spell at the Hawthorns hasn't gone to plan, raising the possibility of the break clause being activated for Collyer to play for United in the second half of the campaign.",
      "That would allow Mainoo to leave and potentially represent a good result for Collyer.",

      "Ruben Amorim thought Manchester United had cracked it at Old Trafford. Four successive home wins in the Premier League was the best run of form there since the end of the 2022/23 season and hinted at brighter days ahead. Burnley, Chelsea, Sunderland and Brighton were seen off between the end of August and the end of October and a weight looked to be lifted.",
      "The atmosphere was excellent in those matches and it did look like something was building at Old Trafford. Amorim certainly felt it. After the fourth of those wins, when Brighton were beaten 4-2, he spoke about the atmosphere after Bryan Mbeumo had scored to put United 3-0 up just after the hour mark.",
      "\"I think, after the third goal, the noise of the stadium was not normal. It was like a different moment,\" he said. \"It was the first time that I felt that sound within the environment. So it was a very good moment for me. \"Of course, we are focusing on the game but there are something things in this club, in this stadium, that you feel. And that was really strange. The sound of the stadium was incredible.\"",
      "There was no reason to think that positivity would suddenly come to a halt. United went a month without playing at home, but when they returned against Everton, Amorim was confident of continuing that run of form. Before the match, he touched on how difficult it had been for United to play at Old Trafford in recent seasons and suggested he felt that those challenges might now be over.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",
      "“That is the best thing, because in the recent past it was hard to play at home,\" he said. \"But nowadays you miss playing at home, that is a feeling we should have in our club. I’m really excited to be back playing at home and the players also. We need to continue winning at home.”",
      "Only United didn't continue winning at home. Home fixtures against Everton and West Ham should have produced six points rather than one and the manner of the defeat to 10-man Everton was particularly galling. It felt like all that positivity built up at Old Trafford had been eroded in one dismal 90-minute display.",
      "West Ham was little better. Amorim's side conceded a late equaliser but produced a flat attacking performance. While the atmosphere remains excellent at times, the players need to fulfil their end of the bargain, and the noise will never be sustained in games like that one.",
      "Now, United are back to the drawing board at home. Their record stands at four wins, two defeats and a draw and it leaves them 13th in the Premier League home table. Last season, they had the 14th-best home record in the league, and the season before that, the eighth-best. It's nowhere near good enough for what United want to achieve.",
      "Playing in the biggest club stadium in England should be an advantage that United can drive home, but the fear factor of Old Trafford has long since vanished. It is those wearing red who now find it tricky.",
      "Just look at Bournemouth for evidence of that. The Cherries have won two successive league fixtures at Old Trafford, both 3-0, which would have once felt unimaginable.",
      "Perhaps this month is an opportunity for the momentum to return. United have won only three of their last nine home games in the month of December but fixtures to finish the year against Bournemouth, Newcastle and Wolves should be seen as an opportunity.",
      "Three wins are clearly achievable, and with Aston Villa away sandwiched between those first two fixtures, a couple of victories might well be needed. Improving their home form is vital if United are to return to the Champions League and the festive period is an ideal chance to bring the cheer back to Old Trafford.",

      "The 20-year-old only joined the newly-promoted club from Union Saint-Gilloise in the latest summer transfer window but he is yet to drop out of his new team's starting XI this season, and his performances in midfield are said to have caught the eye of Old Trafford and Chelsea chiefs.",

      "United have kept tight-lipped over the involvement of Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad for Monday night's meeting with Bournemouth.

      "Still, Ruben Amorim is going to be without the three players for an extended period of time starting this coming week. Will the club need to dip into the transfer market for reinforcements, or can they hold out until all of them have returned?",

      "United have been placed in the running alongside Chelsea, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur for a player rated around £25m.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, United chiefs are 'increasingly open' to selling club captain Bruno Fernandes in the near future.",
      "He may have the most combined goals and assists of any player at the club this season, however at 31 years of age a lucrative sale would allow for reinvestment in potential transfer targets such as Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "The report suggests 'strong interest' will arrive from Saudi Arabia, in particular from Al-Hilal and Al-Ittihad.",
      "Catch up on your latest United headlines this Sunday morning:",

      "Diogo Dalot was recently asked to name the teacher's pet in Manchester United's dressing room, and he named Mason Mount. Ruben Amorim has not hidden his affection for Mount and he heaped further praise on the midfielder when he spoke at his pre-Bournemouth press conference on Friday.",
      "United have lost just one game in the Premier League when Mount has started this season. \"It's a fact,\" Amorim responded when asked about the team's record with him in the starting XI.",
      "\"But it's not just that. We have to look at the way the game was, but he's a very, very smart player, he's really technical. Because sometimes being a technical player is not just about having fun with the ball. It's the quality of the pass, the reception, how to receive the ball, and with these things, he's really smart. He can balance our team well, so he's a very good player.\"",
      "It was the second time Amorim had praised Mount to the press in a week, having described him as \"really important\" for United following the victory against Wolves at Molineux.",
      "Mount scored his third league goal of the campaign against Wolves, volleying home in the 62nd minute to make it 3-1, which was an important strike to give United a two-goal cushion.",
      "The 26-year-old's goals against Sunderland and Crystal Palace were important for different reasons. Mount's goal against the Black Cats eased nerves at Old Trafford after the Brentford defeat, while his matchwinner at Selhurst Park ensured United did not end November without a victory.",
      "Mount finally has momentum in Manchester, two and a half years since his arrival from Chelsea, and he appears set to return to the starting team against Bournemouth on Monday.",
      "Benjamin Sesko could return to the squad if he recovers from food poisoning in time, but he is coming back from a knee injury, so Amorim is expected to pick a striker-less attack again.",
      "Amorim has previously said he \"loves\" Mount because he can see how much he \"wants it.\" Mount has endeared himself to every manager he's played for because he is a dream to coach each day.",
      "He is a model professional, and the only thing that has held him back at Old Trafford has been fitness concerns. Mount has picked up the occasional muscle injury and Amorim, speaking after Wolves, admitted that he needs to be carefully handled to prevent losing him for a spell of matches.",
      "Mount could achieve undroppable status if he continues in his rich vein of form, but the quirk is that there is a higher chance of picking up an injury if Amorim selects him to start every game.",
      "\"We need to take care of him,\" explained Amorim. \"Sometimes you need to protect them in training, and in games, but when you build, that is going to happen the same, the same thing with Luke Shaw.\"",
      "Amorim will have no choice but to bank on Mount's condition over the next few weeks, as United are braced to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations. Mount is already important in the dressing room - and he will become even more important during AFCON.",
      "United need Mount to be available throughout the busy festive schedule. And if he manages that, he could earn a recall to the England squad when the Three Lions meet up in the March international break.",
      "England manager Thomas Tuchel is another coach who has spoken glowingly about Mount after their stint working together at Chelsea. Mount has been a \"teacher's pet\" for more than one manager.",

      "It felt inevitable that Manchester United youngster JJ Gabriel would score when he made his debut at Old Trafford earlier this week. Gabriel is widely considered one of the most exciting prospects in the world, and it took him just 21 minutes to find the net with a brilliant finish in front of the Stretford End.",
      "The likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo have all represented United in the FA Youth Cup before achieving their dream of breaking into the first-team.",
      "Gabriel has participated in first-team training sessions at Carrington, despite being just 15 years old, and there is a growing expectation that he will become United's youngest player to debut in the Premier League.",
      "The teenager celebrated his 15th birthday in October, meaning he cannot feature in the topflight this season, but it would not be a surprise to see Gabriel break United's record next term.",
      "Those who have coached Gabriel believe he could shatter plenty of other records during his career. There is currently a buzz within youth football circles about what Gabriel could achieve. Some academy followers suggest he could be the best talent United's academy has ever seen.",
      "Understandably, United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on his development, but sources close to the youngster are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, who don't let him get ahead of himself. He is simply just JJ to them.",
      "However, there was a reason why United rolled out the red carpet in the summer to persuade Gabriel to stay: the special talent they have on their hands doesn't come around often.",
      "United were informed that Gabriel was set to leave to join a European giant, which led to an eleventh-hour meeting being held at Carrington in an attempt to keep the youngster.",
      "Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held. United reiterated he could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company to sign him.",
      "The teenager has the talent to fire United to FA Youth Cup glory this season. Alejandro Garnacho used the competition as a springboard just a few years ago, and Gabriel is expected to do the same.",
      "The road to making a senior debut can be complicated for players in academy systems, but Gabriel is not an ordinary teenager.",

      "As long as Benjamin Sesko overcomes a bout of food poisoning, the Slovenian striker could be back in the Manchester United team for the first time in five weeks when they face Bournemouth. The question is are United better without a striker in the team?",
      "Sesko has had a slow start to his Old Trafford career since a £73.7million move from RB Leipzig, scoring just twice in 12 games for the club before injuring his knee against Tottenham in November. He has had just 18 shots in 11 Premier League games, with six of them coming in the 3-1 defeat at Brentford.",
      "It hasn't been easy for Sesko, but it wasn't easy for Rasmus Hojlund either last season. It is clear that this United team often struggles to create chances for a natural No. 9, and it can lead to them looking detached from the team.",
      "Go without a proper striker and things look up. Matheus Cunha might have been signed from Wolves for £62.5million to play one of the No. 10 roles - and with one goal in 13 appearances, his scoring rate is worse than Sesko's - but when he has played as the striker, United have looked more fluid.",
      "On six occasions in the Premier League, Ruben Amorim has asked the Brazilian to lead the line, and the only defeat was the opening day of the season against Arsenal. There have been draws against Fulham and Tottenham and victories over Burnley, Liverpool and Wolves.",
      "Cunha might not be scoring the goals, but there could be an argument that the way he interprets his role is allowing the attack to look more cohesive. Those five unbeaten games mentioned above have produced 12 goals, although four of them did come against a woeful Wolves team.",
      "In his six games playing as the centre-forward, Cunha has managed 19 shots, which is more than Sesko has managed in double the matches. Again, Cunha had eight of those against Wolves and perhaps Sesko will rue his luck at not being able to face a team so obliging to opposition attackers.",
      "If the 22-year-old does return to the team at Old Trafford on Monday, it is likely Cunha will slot in as one of the two behind the striker, presumably alongside Bryan Mbeumo if the Cameroon international has avoided AFCON duty for another day. That is the £207.2million attacking trident that Amorim has pinned his goalscoring hopes on.",
      "So far, they have started just three games together: a defeat at Brentford, a win against Brighton and a draw at Nottingham Forest. It is far too short a sample size to draw conclusions from, and even if they are reunited against Bournemouth, it will be temporary given Mbeumo's upcoming international commitments.",
      "Amorim will certainly want to see more from Sesko, having also made it clear he wants more from Cunha. Mbeumo is the only one to really hit the ground running. The Portuguese head coach will hope United's improved attacking outlook will provide Sesko with the chances that weren't there earlier in the season.",
      "But if the return of a natural striker backfires then it could prompt the question of whether this United side are better with a little more freedom around the box, and how then best to integrate Sesko.",

      "Manchester United have an opening to finally secure one of Louis van Gaal's dream signings amid reports they are interested in Sergio Ramos.",
      "The Real Madrid icon, 38, joined Liga MX side Monterrey in February earlier this year after spending a year at boyhood club Sevilla. Ramos' stint in Mexico lasted 10 months, as he announced his departure from the club earlier this month.",
      "Showing no signs of calling time on what has been an incredible 21-year football career, the Spaniard has yet to choose the next step of his journey, with United one of many clubs linked with signing the most capped player in his national team's history.",
      "That's according to Spanish outlet Cadena SER, but ESPN have since reported that the Premier League side have no interest in signing the defender. Should Ramos make the shock move to the Premier League for the first time in his career, it would have been 10 years in the making.",
      "He was high on Van Gaal's wishlist upon his appointment at Old Trafford in 2015, with the Dutchman revealing he had plans to pair Ramos up with ex-Germany international Mats Hummels.",
      "Speaking to FourFourTwo about the targets he missed out on at United, Van Gaal said: \"I wanted Lewandowski, but when this proved difficult I tried to get Gonzalo Higuain instead. Before I had arrived, I also spoke with the board about Neymar. If you are at United, you have to think big.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",
      "\"He was also interesting for the club in terms of selling shirts, and I wanted to have quick wingers. For that reason, I also tried to get Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez. Thomas Muller was on my wish list, too, and in central midfield I wanted N’Golo Kante.",
      "\"I even tried to sign James Milner, who was already quite old but very multi-functional and possessed leadership skills. For the defence, I wanted Ramos and Mats Hummels, because ours wasn’t the strongest in building from the back.",
      "\"Those were my top targets, but we couldn’t get any of them. I don’t know why, because as the manager I wasn’t involved in any negotiations. After I left, players like Mahrez and Kante ended up at Manchester City and Chelsea, while United couldn’t get them. I found that very odd.\"",
      "With the January transfer window coming up, a defensive acquisition could be on the mind of Ruben Amorim, who has had to contend with injuries to Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "The fitness record of the recently returning Lisandro Martinez, meanwhile, certainly doesn't make for good reading, with the Argentine making just 61 Premier League appearances despite signing for United in 2022.",
      "Speaking about possible plans to add to his squad, Amorim recently said: \"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United.",
      "\"We are not just buying one guy because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now. We want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen. But of course, we think about how we can improve the team, and in January, the window is open, we can do something.\"",

Anti-Glazer fans have encouraged supporters not to buy official United merchandise, but the club have banked an increase of £3.7m from the same period last year.",
      "United announced their latest financial figures on Thursday afternoon. Club sources have said the increased retail and merchandise revenue is due to the impact of a full three months’ trading under their new ecommerce model, compared to only one month in the prior year quarter.",
      "However, the increase will not be received warmly by anti-Glazer fans, who have protested against the American family and encouraged others to hurt their pockets by boycotting merchandise.",

      "That means sponsorship revenue has dropped by 9.3 per cent due to changes with the club's sponsorship agreements, following the expiration of the training kit deal with Tezos.",
      "Tezos replaced AON as the club's training kit sponsor when they struck a £24m per season deal in 2022. The Tezos-branded training kit had been worn by United's first-team squad across the last three years, and the logo had also featured on the training kit worn by the women's team.",
      "Matheus Cunha was pictured in a Tezos-sponsored hoodie in unveiling pictures when he signed from Wolves, but the deal had expired by the time of Bryan Mbeumo's arrival.",
      "Although the sponsorship revenue has decreased in the latest figures, United sources have stated that sponsorship revenues were up slightly, if the training kit blow is excluded.",
      "United are braced for further sponsorship uncertainty, though, because their sleeve sponsorship deal with DXC Technology will expire at the end of the season.",
      "In the summer of 2022, DXC began to sponsor the sleeves of United's kits under an agreement believed to be worth £20million per season, but the deal will conclude after 2025/2026.",

      "The Premier League permitted sleeve sponsorship from the start of 2017/18. United announced the first sponsors of their sleeves, Kohler, for the following campaign under a multi-year agreement. That deal ended in 2022, which led to DXC coming in and sponsoring the sleeves.",

      "Discussions have taken place regarding the youngster's future, and United are willing to make concessions to allow Mather to leave as early as possible after his summer move collapsed.",
      "The fee and buyback clause were agreed, and it's understood personal terms were also verbally agreed with the forward. United outlined a time for an agreement to be finalised and sign-off by the board was required, but the club eventually decided they did not have enough time to facilitate the transfer.",
      "Mather's options for an exit were limited following the closure of the European transfer windows, which led to talks taking place with UAE club Al Wahda FC at the end of September.",
      "United insisted on including a buy-back clause during discussions to sell Mather, which is common practice for departures from the academy, but the UAE club did not agree.",
      "Mather was forced to deal with the disappointment of missing out on a fresh start. He has continued to train with the first-team and has made appearances in four academy fixtures to keep ticking over.",
      "The winger scored a brace against Norwich in his first appearance of the campaign, but he has outgrown academy football and is hungry to leave his boyhood club to further his career.",

      "The Russian winger, who was instrumental in ending United's 26-year wait for a league title, is fondly remembered for his hat-trick in a 5-0 victory over local rivals Manchester City in 1994. The club shared heartwarming footage of the 56-year-old receiving a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season during his tour, a campaign in which he played a pivotal role in securing the domestic double.",
      "Known for his blistering pace and nimble footwork, Kanchelskis' lean, tall physique often gave defenders a lot to deal with during his time in the Premier League. Almost two decades after hanging up his boots, he still sports a full head of hair, albeit styled more slickly than the curtain hairstyle he wore during his playing days in Manchester.",
      "The skillful winger had a successful footballing career, representing both the Soviet Union and Russia internationally. He also played for Everton, Southampton, Rangers and Fiorentina.",
      "Kanchelskis is currently coaching Russian Second Division team Dynamo Bryansk. After retiring, he served as sporting director at First Division side FC Nosta Novotroitsk before transitioning into management with various teams across central Europe.",
      "Upon his return to Manchester, the ex-winger was gifted a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season and enjoyed a trip down memory lane as he toured the training facilities.",
      "The United icon will be using his trip to England to gather fresh insights and inspiration before his side's domestic campaign begins in March. Kanchelskis had an exceptional 1994/95 season with the Red Devils, during which he claimed the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",
      "The attacker then made a surprising switch to Merseyside when Everton secured his signature for a club record £5million. Since then, he has maintained cult hero status at both clubs, a reflection of his exceptional ability on the pitch.",
      "Kanchelskis was accompanied by his son Andrei - a devoted Everton supporter - and also dropped by the Toffees' training complex this week. He met up with David Moyes and witnessed their victory against Nottingham Forest at the new ground.",
      "Reflecting on his time at Old Trafford, he said: \"Every name is a big name at Man United, it was an excellent time. I remember the big boss, Sir Alex Ferguson he helped me a lot. A lot of criticism for me also when I played bad crosses.",

      "United unveiled Leon as a first-team signing alongside Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko in August. The defender was included in the United States pre-season tour squad in the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has named Leon in matchday squads against Grimsby Town, Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland this season, but he has not made his senior debut.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, to sign the young defender.",
      "Before Leon travelled to Manchester, he spoke to local journalists at an airport in Paraguay, saying: “I’m going to kill it in the pre-season, and within one or two games, I’ll already be playing with them [first-team].\"",
      "The youngster's transfer made headlines in his homeland and Leon discussed the impact of his move.",
      "\"For Paraguay, to have a player playing here at United is huge,\" he told club media. \"I think for Paraguayans, they’re very proud to have someone from there playing in a club as big as Manchester United.",
      "\"It is an amazing, unique feeling to represent your country for all the people of Paraguay. I don’t know, it has no explanation - for my family it is an immense sense of pride to see me play with my national team.\"",

      "JJ Gabriel became the youngest player to represent Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup on Tuesday. The forward started against Peterborough and scored the match winner in a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Gabriel started aged 15 years, two months and three days, which meant he broke the record previously held by United academy graduate Omari Forson (15 years and four months).",
      "The online records tracking United's Youth Cup appearance makers began from the 2006/2007 season.",
      "Gabriel recently trained with the first-team. It's unusual for a player so young to be given the opportunity to train with the first team, but Gabriel is one of the most highly-rated talents to come through the academy.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Amorim at Carrington.",
      "Amorim was given a closer look at the youngster when he took part in training. \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"You could see the Under-21s had a game and we had fewer players and tried to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow, but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",

      "The 2025 Africa Cup of Nations comes at a terrible time for both Manchester City and Manchester United. Both teams have endured their wobbles in the Premier League this season but have each made strides compared to last year.",
      "Ruben Amorim is set to be hit particularly hard by the tournament's selection, with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad both big losses. They'll link up with Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, respectively, while Noussair Mazraoui will represent hosts Morocco.",
      "The tournament hosts have made it to at least the semi-final stage of the past two AFCON competitions. This is worth bearing in mind given Morocco tend to be a perennial contender and enters their own competition as favourites this year.",
      "It's also worth highlighting that in addition to being absent for fixtures, those venturing deeper in the tournament won't return to club duty straight away. And any players that get their hands on the title may be entitled to a few extra days to lap up their achievement before coming back to England.",
      "Morocco are the clear frontrunners with the bookmakers to win a first AFCON crown since 1976, while seven-time champions Egypt are second in the stakes. The Atlas Lions are heavily backed to top Group A ahead of Zambia, Mali and Comoros, while Egypt appear to have a slightly harder line-up against South Africa, Angola and Zimbabwe in Group B.",
      "The competition doesn't get underway until December 21, although players will start to link up with their sides imminently. The tournament will conclude in Rabat on January 18, meaning some players could be away for a full month.",
      "During that span, there are six rounds of Premier League action due to be played. This includes a particularly demanding three-week period between December 20 and January 8, across which each top-flight club will play five times.",
      "Some of those Premier League outfits missing players over the next month face more testing periods than others. At least on paper given the current table and how teams are performing at present.",
      "For example, Aston Villa will face United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Crystal Palace (in that order) between December 21 and January 7. Brighton also has a testing run of fixtures over the next month or so, with Sunderland, Arsenal, City and Bournemouth each on the agenda while the AFCON is on.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Selling Zirkzee would leave Man Utd short for cover in the forward areas but now Italian website Calciomercato claim that Roma sporting director Frederic Massara ‘has received the green light from the Friedkins to negotiate directly’ with the Premier League side for Zirkzee.",
      "Zirkzee’s agent, Kia Joorabchian, has told Roma that his client ‘would be thrilled to return to Serie A’ and the report adds: ‘Are negotiations on the table? Not exactly; Roma must reach a financial agreement with the player (he earns €4 million net per season) and with the Red Devils. But trust is there and growing significantly day by day. The parties are negotiating on the basis of a loan deal with favorable terms, triggering an obligation to buy for a total package worth €35 million.’",

Manchester United’s Mainoo is much more than a whisper, as sporting director Manna has been in frequent contact with the staff of the 20-year-old Three Lions international talent for days.’",

But United are in dire straits and Ruben Amorim, the highly controversial Portuguese manager, has put up a wall against his sale, despite his use being used sparingly.’",
      "The report continues: ‘The reality is that Red Devils fans are threatening fire and brimstone if one of their jewels leaves. So, it’s not easy. But Mainoo has said yes, he’s even open to leaving in January: the World Cup is upon us, his place in the England team is secure, but he wants to arrive in America after a season as a protagonist.

      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has hit back at Rio Ferdinand for getting in a dig about his Mohamed Salah comments after the Reds beat Brighton.",
      "Salah hit out at Liverpool last weekend for “throwing him under the bus” as a scapegoat for their poor form after Arne Slot put him on the bench for three consecutive matches.",
      "Slot and the Reds hierarchy made a joint decision to drop him from the squad for their 1-0 win over Inter Milan in their midweek Champions League match.",
      "However, after talks with Slot on Friday, Salah was back in the Liverpool squad to face Brighton on Saturday and the Egpytian got an assist after coming off the bench in the first half, replacing an injured Joe Gomez.",
      "The Liverpool legend added: “The one line that stands out for me is ‘thrown under the bus.’ He’s thrown the club under the bus twice in the last 12 months. With the manager right now, he should be doing as much as he can to help the club get out of the worst run they’ve had since the 1950s and he hasn’t done that.",
      "READ: Liverpool’s best striker Ekitike proving Isak was a luxury signing as Salah returns vs Brighton",
      "“When we are talking about throwing people under the bus, he’s thrown every Liverpool right-back under the bus for the eight years. Can you imagine playing behind him for eight years? But we accept it because he’s a superstar and he’s scored 250 goals and he’s given me as a Liverpool supporter some of the greatest nights of my life.”",
      "“You weren’t a big star before you came to Liverpool, you haven’t really won much for Egypt, no matter how big you are, you need help from your team-mates, your manager and fans, it’s important that he remembers that. When he talks after Leeds, it’s all about me, me, me.”",
      "In a dig at Carragher’s comments, Ferdinand commented on a video of Salah being serenaded by the Kop at Anfield following their win against Brighton.",

      "The 20-year-old still hasn’t started a single Premier League match this season. As far as his World Cup prospects go, it’s not looking good.",
      "He’s far from alone. A number of Premier League players are in the same position – too good to be warming the bench, or too talented to be stuck at struggling clubs – with West Ham’s Lucas Paqueta among those who might need a change of scenery in January.",
      "Here’s our Premier League XI of World Cup hopefuls who could really use a move in the winter transfer window.",
      "If Chelsea have any sense, which they don’t, they will sign a goalkeeper in January. Mike Maignan is right there, lads.",
      "Should Maignan – or any other new No.1 – join the Blues, Jorgensen would drop to third in Enzo Maresca’s goalkeeper pecking order.",
      "Given his reputation, his place in the squad might be safe (if Denmark qualify via the play-offs), but there’s no chance he starts at the World Cup.",
      "Even without the addition of a new goalkeeper, it’s difficult to see Jorgensen breaking into Chelsea’s starting XI, even if his competition is only Robert Sánchez. With all due respect…",
      "",
      "Malo Gusto’s chances of making Didier Deschamps’ World Cup squad look slim, but a January move could change that.",
      "Staying at Chelsea might work out given Reece James’ injury record, but Gusto has struggled when given minutes – poor against Nottingham Forest when pushed into midfield, before picking up a needless red card.",
      "He was in the most recent France squad and while Jules Kounde is nailed on, the back-up role behind the Barcelona right-back is there for the taking.",
      "",
      "It’s early days for Bornauw at Leeds, but two Premier League minutes played so far is hardly encouraging.",
      "The four-cap Belgian international hasn’t featured for his country in over a year, and there’s little chance he returns to the fold while sitting on the bench at Elland Road.",

      "If playing time doesn’t improve, Mainoo has no chance of going to North America. A move to Napoli could reignite his career. Scott McTominay’s success in Serie A should be all the proof he needs that Italy might just be the place to be.",
      "",

      "He was linked with an exit in the summer, but nothing materialised, and his goal celebration in West Ham’s only league win at Nottingham Forest was supposed to end speculation. His next one, if it ever comes, should probably involve him searching for a phone to answer a call from elsewhere rather than throwing it away.",

      "Rashford joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy for around £26m from Premier League giants Man Utd in the summer.",
      "The England international secured his dream move to the Spanish giants after returning to form during his loan spell at Aston Villa at the end of last season.",
      "Barcelona were linked with alternatives, but they opted to take a punt on Rashford after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams, with the forward’s versatility attracting head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "Rashford was only expected to be a bit-part player for Barcelona, but his great form has forced Flick into playing him consistently, as he has sparkled this season. He has six goals and eleven assists in his 21 appearances across all competitions.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Sunderland v Newcastle, Aston Villa, Xavi Simons, Oliver Glasner",
      "Therefore, it feels pretty likely that Rashford will join Barcelona permanently, though a new report from an outlet in Spain claims they have an ‘unexpected alternative’ in mind.",
      "Instead, Barcelona are said to have an outlandish plan to sign and offload Rashford in the same window, with the club reportedly including him in a £61m [70 million euros] swap deal with Atletico Madrid to sign former Manchester City star Julian Alvarez.",
      "Will this happen? No. But who would we be if we faulted their imagination?",
      "The report goes onto say that the ‘conditions are set’ for this deal, with a £61m fee and Rashford said to be used by Barcelona to acquire Alvarez.",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n*  Gallagher for Mainoo at Man Utd is swapping one Bruno Fernandes backup for another\n*  Arsenal title, Wolves proper start, Man Utd top six – revisiting our 25/26 Premier League targets\n*  Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers as Gyokeres falls below Wirtz",
      "The report explains: ‘Atlético Madrid haven’t ruled out signing the English striker if Julián Álvarez ultimately ends up at Barcelona. Diego Simeone greatly appreciates Rashford ‘s profile, particularly his speed and directness in exploiting space from any attacking area. For the Argentine coach, acquiring a player of that calibre would be a way to compensate for such a significant loss as that of the Argentine striker.",
      "‘Thus, Atlético has set its conditions. They value Julián Álvarez at €120 million and Rashford at around €50 million, which is why they are demanding an additional €70 million for the deal to move forward and be finalised.’",
      "Regarding Rashford’s resurgence over the past year, former Man Utd player West Brown has explained why he was “always going to do well” after leaving the Red Devils.",
      "“Marcus Rashford was always going to do well after moving away from Manchester United. He’d been at the club for so many years and not all those years would have been enjoyable for Marcus, particularly the final couple,” Brown told BetWright Casino.",
      "“He got a lot of stick from people towards the end of last season, so I don’t blame him for making a change, and I think his departure suited United as well. No one thought that he was going to leave and be shocking, but he just wasn’t in the right headspace to perform at United – it wasn’t working.",
      "“It’s great to see how well he is doing now at Barcelona, he’s absolutely flying and he deserved to get back into the England squad. I’m sure he will have a great World Cup.”",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has suggested Spurs are “scraping around for players” amid links to Marcus Rashford, who he wouldn’t sign given a lack of loyalty.",
      "Spurs legend Chris Waddle has explained why he thinks his former club should snub Marcus Rashford, but he would actually be a no-brainer signing…",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford could now return to Old Trafford as Barcelona are ‘not convinced’ by the England international, according to reports.",
      "Barcelona are uncertain about signing Marcus Rashford permanently and could send him back to Manchester United, according to reports in Spain.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford has been ‘offered’ a swap deal involving Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",

      "A new No.6 will be their next marquee signing after sorting the goalkeeper problem and strengthening in attack, with their failed summer move for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba opening the door for an alternative to be signed in the winter or next summer.",
      "Elliot Anderson stands out as the best potential alternative to Baleba as he continues to shine for Nottingham Forest and England, while Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton has also been mentioned.",
      "READ: Gallagher for Mainoo at Man Utd is swapping one Bruno Fernandes backup for another",
      "Wharton is arguably the superior player of these three, but this does not mean that he will, or even should, be signed by Man Utd.",
      "This has not stopped Fichajes from talking up the prospect of this deal happening, though.",
      "Their latest on Wharton claims Man Utd are ‘preparing to complete a blockbuster signing’, with the club having ‘activated one of the most ambitious moves in their sporting planning and are preparing to launch a €100 million bid [£87.5m] for Wharton’.",
      "Regarding Palace’s supposed demands, the report adds:",
      "‘With a contract until 2029, the club is holding firm and would only consider negotiations for an extraordinary sum. The aforementioned offer of 100 million is the minimum they would accept to open serious talks.",
      "‘Manchester United knows it’s not alone in the race for Adam Wharton. Manchester City and Arsenal have shown genuine interest in the midfielder, while Tottenham have also inquired with Crystal Palace.’",
      "There are a couple of reasons why this is incredibly unlikely.",
      "Firstly, why on earth would Crystal Palace accept £87.5m for Wharton when a World Cup is approaching, and there are multiple Big Six sides in the market for a centre-midfielder?",
      "To put it simply, they would not and it would actually take an offer above £100m to get Palace, who have remained firm in the past regarding Marc Guehi, to the negotiating table.",
      "Also, Wharton is capable of playing in the No.6 role, but he is far from specialised in this position, as he is better used as a No.8, so Baleba and Anderson are far more obvious fixes to Man Utd’s defensive midfield problem than the Palace star.",
      "It is not unusual for Fichajes to talk utter nonsense, but the one truthful suggestion in this report is that Man Utd’s supposed swoop for Wharton is the ‘most ambitious move’, because it is not going to happen…",
      "The agent of Crystal Palace star and Manchester United target Adam Wharton has spoken openly about a future transfer.",

      "READ: Gallagher for Mainoo at Man Utd is swapping one Bruno Fernandes backup for another",
      "“It`s quite ironic actually, that Zirkzee is now playing more because Sesko is injured, but I think Zirkzee would rather want Sesko to be ready and play ahead of him, so he can get his loan move away in January. He might miss out on it now because of Sesko’s injury.",
      "“I don’t like what I am seeing from Zirkzee at all. Everything about him is trying to be flashy and it just doesn’t work. He has to be frustrated, because nothing works out for him. He looks like he is frustrated, and I totally get it, but at the end of the day it is his own fault.",

      "Signing a new central midfielder for Ruben Amorim is at the top of INEOS’ 2026 plans, but Manchester United’s “try before you buy” interest in Conor Gallagher is as underwhelming as it is baffling.",
      "Casemiro proving that the football hasn’t left him quite yet has made the requirement for a new midfielder feel less urgent than it did a few weeks ago, and may very well have saved Amorim from the sack, but it remains the area of the squad the Old Trafford hierarchy want to strengthen as a priority.",
      "Director of Football Jason Wilcox insisted in October that recruitment will be focused on “the right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure”.",
      "“They have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team,” he added.",
      "And while Gallagher – who swapped Chelsea for Atletico Madrid for £34m in the summer of 2024 – unquestionably meets that first requirement and arguably the second too, quite how he would fit into Amorim’s team is a mystery.",
      "It’s claimed the Red Devils were interested in Gallagher as the summer transfer window was coming to a close having asked about the availability of Carlos Baleba and been told by Brighton he would cost them £100m.",
      "But Gallagher is no alternative to Baleba, Elliot Anderson or the other midfielders Man Utd have been linked with of late.",
      "He’s played just three of his 72 games for Atletico Madrid as the defensive midfielder Amorim covets and at Chelsea was far more regularly used in an attacking midfield role, with protection always afforded to him by Enzo Fernandez or Moises Caicedo. Gareth Southgate played him in that deep-lying role for England at the start of Euro 2024 and it was a disaster.",
      "And yet, according to transfer expert Ben Jacobs, United could revisit their interest in Gallagher in a ‘try before you buy’ deal with Atletico Madrid ‘open’ to an initial loan.",
      "Speaking on The United Stand, Jacobs said: “Man United see Conor Gallagher as a good ‘try before you buy’ option, if Atletico are open to a loan deal next month.”",
      "It would be an underwhelming signing. Gallagher was very good in a very bad Chelsea team before departing for La Liga, but he’s a workhorse; a ‘safe pair of hands’ who’s started just seven games for Atletico Madrid this season.",
      "And while he’s ‘the sort of player every manager wants in their team’, he isn’t – and this is the only point that matters here – a composed, deep-lying screen for the back five. What they need as an Adam Wharton and what they would be signing is another, arguably inferior, Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The wantaway academy graduate isn’t playing as he can’t provide the foil for Bruno Fernandes to thrive like Casemiro or – ostensibly – Manuel Ugarte can.",
      "And although Amorim wouldn’t have the same apparent concerns over Gallagher’s ability to “get round the pitch” that he apparently has with Mainoo, signing a player – even on loan – knowing that they’re going to be something of a square peg in a round hole makes very little sense.",
      "We understand Amorim’s desire for hard-working fighters in midfield, but what currently looks like a very wide net they’ve cast to find one needs to be narrowed to only include those who can dovetail with his captain. If Kobbie Mainoo isn’t that man, then neither is Conor Gallagher.",

      "The Premier League giants are better this season than last term, but they are still miles away from winning the Premier League title and/or Champions League.",
      "So, Man Utd need to make further additions in January and next summer, with a new No.6 among their priorities.",
      "Club legend Louis Saha has also explained why they should re-sign Welbeck in the winter window.",

      "READ: Arsenal title, Wolves proper start, Man Utd top six – revisiting our 25/26 Premier League targets",
      "“He’s not just very talented, but he’s very efficient and he’s experienced.",
      "“When I came to the club, there was Van Nistelrooy and Solskjaer, but we had more than that. We had Tevez and Alan Smith, and there was depth, there was a variety. We all learned from each other.",
      "“I think Sesko and other forward players would benefit by having someone like Welbeck to challenge them, to make them learn more about the game, more about positioning.",
      "“Welbeck’s experience would give an example for them to all learn from, and I think if Danny arrives in the winter transfer window, he could make a huge difference to results on the pitch.”",
      "Saha has also revealed what he has made of Sesko at the start of this season.",
      "“I think Sesko has done okay because he’s coming from a new league,” Saha added.",
      "“He showed his talent in Germany with RB Leipzig, and now he’s starting to show it in the Premier League.",
      "“His potential is enormous. People may think that it’s easy to just join a team in transition like Manchester United with the pressure and all that.",
      "“I can see that he’s got all the qualities to improve – he just needs to score one or two goals in some big games and I think his United career will really take off. I’ve seen enough of him to think that he’s a very impressive lad. He’s done well enough so far.”",
      "Man Utd summer signing Benjamin Sesko has been likened to “an academy player” by Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler after his poor start to the season.",
      "England head coach Thomas Tuchel has named one Premier League star who is “very close” to a call-up, while he has made a fresh claim about Jude Bellingham.",
      "Jamie Carragher has explained why he feels Thomas Tuchel decided against picking a striker with 16 England goals, and what he’ll therefore do if Harry Kane becomes unavailable.",
      "Thomas Tuchel’s latest bold selection decision proves that he knows England are doomed without Harry Kane and he actually “needs to be nervous”…",
      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney reckons the Red Devils should have re-signed Danny Welbeck in recent years with the striker going through a “purple patch”.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”."

      "A new report has revealed why Arsenal decided to offload talented defender Ayden Heaven to Premier League rivals Manchester United.",
      "Heaven progressed through the ranks at Arsenal, but he opted to leave the north London outfit and join Man Utd at the start of this year.",
      "The Red Devils paid an undisclosed fee to sign the 19-year-old, who penned a four-year contract with an option of an extra year.",
      "This was viewed as a coup at the time, as Heaven was highly rated at Arsenal, with the centre-back joining fellow youngsters Chido Obi Martin, Sekou Kone, Diego Leon in joining Man Utd.",
      "Speaking on the move in January, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano said: ‘The next one could be Ayden Heaven, a talented 6 ft 3 centre-back born in 2006 who’s out of contract at Arsenal at the end of the current season.",
      "‘Arsenal have offered the “remarkable” youngster a new deal, while Eintracht Frankfurt and Man United made an approach with United clearly seen as favourites to land Heaven at the end of the season.",
      "‘He was in attendance at Old Trafford on Thursday for Europa League game against Rangers and sources say Barcelona also called to be informed on his situation. However, Man United are confident to make it happen in the next months.’",
      "READ: Arsenal title, Wolves proper start, Man Utd top six – revisiting our 25/26 Premier League targets",
      "Man Utd were right to feel confident as the deal did go through and Heaven has impressed in the first team under head coach Ruben Amorim over the past year.",
      "The teenager has already made eight Premier League appearances for Man Utd and he recently paid tribute to Amorim for “trusting” him “a lot”.",
      "“There’s so many great defenders at this club that he’s trusting you to be at the middle of that defence. He’s trusting me a lot,” Heaven said on Amorim.",
      "“I feel like I’m working hard every day in training and I’m showing he can trust me in the games that I’m playing.",
      "“I thought I was a good player but I knew that I first had to gain the trust of the manager and slowly I know I’m doing that. I feel like I’m doing well at the moment, but I’ve just got to keep working.”",
      "He added: “I’m enjoying it because knowing you have that experience around you, you are not scared to go on the front foot and not scared of what you leave behind either. They’re always there when I need them.”",
      "Now, a report from The Daily Mail claims Arsenal were not too disheartened at losing Heaven because 16-year-old Marli Salmon is viewed as a ‘baby William Saliba’, while a ‘path to the first team is already marked out’.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘So much so, Daily Mail Sport understands that the departure of Ayden Heaven, 19, to Manchester United in February was accepted internally because they knew what they had in Salmon.’",
      "Regarding Salmon, a source for the outlet said: ‘On the ball he’s excellent, and physically for his age he’s strong.",
      "‘Typically, you get chances as a centre back at first-team level later on as you then grow into an adult, but he could well be one of the players that breaks through and gets an early opportunity. He was outstanding against Bayern Munich’s Under 19s and put in some great tackles.’"

      "“My information, guys, remains that there are several names, and we will discuss all of them in the videos these days. But I keep telling you that Man Utd want Carlos Baleba and Baleba wants to go to Man Utd.",
      "“The conversation with the player and his agency is very good. In August, Brighton didn’t want to sell the player. In January, it is likely to be a difficult deal again because Brighton insist on not selling the player. But for the summer, let’s say for 2026, Man Utd see Baleba as a priority target.",
      "“I gave you a video last summer saying Baleba will remain a target if the deal doesn’t happen now. Man Utd want to insist on the deal in 2026, and that remains the case. Man Utd still want Baleba and Baleba is still very keen on a move to Man Utd.",
      "“So, Baleba is a name we have to keep very high on Man Utd’s shortlist for the midfield.”",
      "A new central midfielder is at the top of INEOS’ 2026 transfer plans, but Man Utd’s “try before you buy” interest in Conor Gallagher is as underwhelming as it is ...",

      "We’ve surprised ourselves this week by discovering we were apparently just so damn keen to move on from 2024/25 that before it even ended we’d already reeled off one of our favourite summer features of setting a target for each and every Premier League club in 2025/26.",
      "So early did we go that we didn’t even have Sunderland in there because they weren’t even a Premier League club yet. Which, let’s be entirely honest, almost certainly prevented us showing our entire arse with some kind of ‘Beat Derby lol’ nonsense.",
      "Really, though, the reason we truly like this particular feature is that when we get a club right we get to say ‘Hurrah, we were right’ and award ourselves two ego puff points, but when we get a club wrong we just go ‘Silly club didn’t do what it was told’. Perfect.",
      "Anyway. Here’s a look back at what is an inevitably mixed bag of not-even-summer targets for the year ahead, and an updated one for whatever new reality each club now finds itself in.",
      "",
      "There will be plenty of self-flagellation to come later so please allow us a small amount of early smugness here, even allowing for the fact the striker they signed has not yet been a particularly pivotal figure in the whole caper.",
      "If Arsenal get the summer right, which means bringing in at least one proper goalscoring striker and in an ideal world two, there should be more doubts about everyone else – including Liverpool – than the Gunners.",
      "There really is no compelling evidence to suggest a De Bruyne-less Man City are going to suddenly destroy the field again, while Liverpool still have to prove this season was the start of something new and not the last hurrah of the old.",
      "They bought a striker, they are top of the league, there are fewer doubts about them than everyone else. Ignore how much Viktor Gyokeres has actually contributed, the main point is: we were right.",
      "Now Arsenal just need to finish the job. Easy-peasy lemon squeezy. Unless they make it difficult, difficult lemon difficult but for goodness’ sake, when has any Arsenal side ever done that from a really promising position at this stage of the season?",
      "",
      "After a troubling start to the season, one where Villa were winless after five games and even goalless after four, they have ticked this off and then some. A run of nine wins in 10 Premier League games – including victories over both teams that are now apparently their title rivals – has transformed Villa’s season.",
      "It really could now be a spectacular season, but we still suspect that Villa’s actual level sits somewhere between the two absurd extremes we’ve seen thus far. But also that it’s definitely closer to the ‘nine wins in 10’ bit than the ‘no wins in five’ part.",
      "A sustained title challenge would be spectacular, but qualifying for the Champions League still feels like a far fairer and realistic ambition.",
      "Worth remembering here, of course, that there are two ways Villa can achieve this and either would be entirely acceptable. A top four/five finish would represent serious progress and show ability to sustain themselves in that part of the table in a way no outsider in the Big Six era has managed for more than a couple of seasons in succession (looking at you, Newcastle) but winning the Europa League would probably be more fun. They do have the Premier League’s most ridiculous trophy drought.",
      "And they almost certainly won’t have to finish 17th to do it.",
      "",
      "So perfectly on track that they’ve actually made the first bit that bit easier by continuing the Andoni Iraola trait of being an outrageously streaky team that is always in either Champions League form or relegation form but never under any circumstances anything in between.",
      "Bournemouth won five and drew three of their first nine Premier League games, losing only at Liverpool long before anyone knew that was embarrassing.",
      "Their subsequent six games? Two draws and four defeats.",
      "And this is absolutely nothing new. Last season Iraola’s side followed an 11-game run featuring seven wins and four draws, culminating in back-to-back 4-1 and 5-0 eviscerations of Champions League-chasing Newcastle and Nottingham Forest, with a run of one win and five defeats in their next eight.",
      "Even the one win was at Southampton, which doesn’t really count.",
      "The year before, they won none of their first nine Premier League games and then won seven of the next nine. Then none of the next seven. Then four of the next five.",
      "They’re just great fun, is what we’re saying here, but while those good streaks will always see Iraola linked with whichever Big Six/Seven/Eight club is currently committing a bed-sh*tting, the bad ones mean he really might never actually end up metaphorically boil-washing the besh*tted Man United/Spurs/Wherever bedsheets at all.",
      "",
      "Unlike your Bournemouths and the Crystal Palaces of this world, Brentford were unable to keep hold of the manager who’d shifted the entire idea of what the club could be, with Thomas the Frank Engine choo-chooing off to the debatably greener pastures of Tottenham.",
      "Brentford then chose to gamble on a rookie continuity candidate in Keith Andrews in a summer otherwise devoid of continuity. Frank took several other members of his coaching team with him to Spurs, while the playing squad lost key players in Yoane Wissa, Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard.",
      "Remarkably, though, the ‘finish mid-table’ part remains absolutely bang on as a reasonable target with Brentford approaching the always-pivotal Busy Festive Period at a fascinating crossroads; six points away from the bottom three, six points away from the top five.",
      "",
      "Almost everyone outside the most stifling heat of the relegation fight has had a go at bothering the top six this season. For several weeks now it’s felt like all the positions between fourth and 14th are simply being handed out on some kind of rota basis at the end of each round of matches, and Brighton have certainly had their turn.",
      "Such is the congestion below the top three that you could certainly argue half the division are hitting a target of ‘bothering the top six’ but it’s nevertheless a ‘yes, this is fine, continue being fine’ half-term appraisal for a Brighton side currently eighth and two points below the top six.",
      "There are also two ways to take ‘bother the top six’.",
      "Reading what we wrote in May, it’s very clear we meant in terms of your own league position. But beating three of last season’s top six in the space of your first eight games of this season must surely also score ‘bother the top six’ points? It’s our feature and our rules, anyway, and we say it does.",
      "",
      "You can tell just how weary we had grown of the naff efforts made by promoted clubs over the previous two seasons with this one, our assessment also featuring the words ‘dread prospect of a year of ritual Premier League humiliation’ and also – truly incongruously now just seven short months later – the words ‘Sheffield’ and ‘United’.",
      "It doesn’t feel like Burnley are in fact embarrassing themselves like last time. They’ve been competitive more often than not and been unfortunate to come out on the wrong side of some close finishes.",
      "But they are also 19th and on track to finish the season with 25 points. Last time they were in the Premier League they finished 19th with 24 points.",
      "",
      "Would have seemed absurd just a couple of weeks ago, this one, with Enzo Maresca manoeuvring Chelsea nicely onto the shoulders of the leaders as well as being crowned actual world champions in the summer.",
      "But those nagging ‘small-time’ concerns are re-emerging, with the fear after ropey results domestically and in Europe over the last couple of weeks that the manager has once again succeeded in self-fulfillingly talking Chelsea out of contention for things by insisting that little old them could never be in contention in the first place.",
      "Particularly maddening on this occasion given that just before this latest wobble Chelsea had so compellingly displayed their bona fides by battling to a point against Arsenal having played the last hour with 10 men.",
      "It’s now looking like two seasons in a row that Chelsea’s title campaign is going to hit the rocks at the exact moment it began to look truly compelling and, for a manager who – despite that Club World Cup bauble – does need to prove he can challenge for the actual top honours in the game it is worrying for it to become something that starts to look like a trend.",
      "",
      "Not even finally breaking through the 50-point ceiling could get Palace higher than 12th last season, something that quite literally nobody cared about when they also went on to win the FA Cup. Which was absolutely correct of everyone.",
      "They’re trending for an even better return than last year’s 53 points but a top-half finish would still represent success in a season where they’ve also had to juggle Conference League commitments.",
      "That’s been a challenge for them and they still have work to do just to make the knockouts of the Conference, but any English side in that competition has to have winning it as an obvious and achievable season target, even if in this specific case more silverware one year after your first ever silverware feels kind of greedy.",
      "Palace are currently fourth in the Premier League which makes Champions League qualification a perfectly acceptable stretch target but, as we’ve said, you do have to remember that all positions between fourth and 14th are currently being allocated at random week-by-week. They don’t actually mean anything, and Palace are still only four points above the bottom half right now.",
      "",
      "Our argument back in the summer was that the unknown quantity of a move to a new stadium, even (especially?) one as spectacular as the Hill Dickinson, could nullify home advantage for Everton and thus that standing still and remaining clear of any kind of relegation unpleasantness would represent progress.",
      "Everton’s change of address will in time be one that requires more than mere comfortable survival, but for now that does feel like enough. It will likely take a while for Everton – fans, players, everyone – to get used to the new environment and that loss of the familiarity that’s so important to the idea of home advantage could easily counter or even outweigh the sheer buzz of it all.",
      "Seems fair, then, with the scale of that upheaval and the inevitable unknown quantities involved that a smooth ‘more of the same’ on-field transition be the primary target here.",
      "Seems fair now to note Everton have overshot that target already. They’ve even flirted at times with the idea of being actual fun. Love that for them.",
      "Even if we remember that at this time all league positions between fourth and 14th are the same thing, we still can’t help but enjoy the fact they were fifth for a bit at the weekend. Fifth! Everton! Like it’s the 80s or something! Marvellous.",
      "",
      "Been quite sh*t for a lot of this season, really, and at times it’s looked like it really could threaten the nice quiet life they’d carved out for themselves as the Premier League’s mid-tablest club.",
      "Back in the summer, we wanted more from a team that when you asked how much more mid-table they could the answer was none. None… more mid-table.",
      "Especially as all those mid-table finishes had been accompanied by slow meandering finishes that gave the game away a bit about survival still being the main target and Fulham simply becoming a club that was able to achieve that easily and quickly without ever really feeling it necessary to explore any loftier ambition.",
      "We still think They’ll Be Fine, but, while defeats to Man City and Crystal Palace need not signify the imminent falling in of the sky, they have left Fulham in some danger of dropping out the back of the mid-table peloton that absolutely feels like it’s their natural habitat and into a relegation dogfight. Especially as, unlike recent years, it does look like at least one of the relegation places is going to involve an actual meaningful fight.",
      "",
      "Back in May our concern really was not so much what Leeds would do as who they could realistically drag in to a relegation battle.",
      "The difficulty lies in identifying the clubs they can overhaul, and this is where the growing gulf becomes such a problem. Leeds have been the best side in the Championship, but a look at the clubs just above the relegation zone this year should terrify them.",
      "Fine, Spurs and Man United will probably be less stupid next season and can surely be ignored, but above them are your West Hams and Wolves and the Evertons of this world. And Leeds have an awful lot of work to do before their squad is anything like ready to compete with what those lads already have.",
      "Leeds, West Ham and Wolves have all played their part here. Leeds are currently outside the bottom three and with every chance of remaining there. And that should still constitute a perfectly acceptable first season for any promoted team, even one of Leeds’ size where it can quite rightly only ever be stage one of a grander plan of establishing yourself as a top-flight force.",
      "",
      "Ah. Here’s what we said in May:",
      "Will obviously start the season as favourites given the way they’ve destroyed the competition this year, but rightly or wrongly we still have our nagging doubts about Liverpool’s ability to turn this season’s domination into a team that defines a Premier League era and hoover up multiple titles.",
      "It’s undeniable that this season’s success was Arne Slot winning with Jurgen Klopp’s team – all due respect to the sizeable contribution of Federico Chiesa – and while that does in so many ways make the achievement all the more impressive it does also raise questions.",
      "Was this just a wonderful coming together, a bottling of lightning in which Slot’s coaching style and Klopp’s squad were able to achieve the spectacular? Can Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah go again or will the years start to catch up with them? And who picks up the slack then? And we’ve not even started on TAA.",
      "There will, obviously, be more comings and goings this summer than last and while it isn’t necessarily as straightforward as Liverpool MUST defend their title to prove they are here to stay, they absolutely do need to be right in there and involved to the end to convince us this is the start of a Liverpool dynasty and not just one stunning season.",
      "That’s all looking uncomfortably accurate for a Liverpool squad also trying to cope with the unspeakable tragedy of Diogo Jota’s death.",
      "We’ve all had our fun with Liverpool’s on-field crisis this season, but the elephant in the room throughout it all is the fact this is a group of players, a club, still working its way through a grieving process in the full glare of the Premier League spotlight.",
      "Perhaps not even Slot or his players themselves would be able to accurately weigh how big a factor it’s been in their on-pitch struggles.",
      "But the reality is that Liverpool do find themselves in precisely the sort of place we feared for them, one in which 24/25 starts to look like a freakish one-off season where a new manager working with the old manager’s squad was able to bottle lightning.",
      "Salah and Van Dijk have looked old and tired this season, with the former now at loggerheads with the club where his legendary status has long been assured. The yearning to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold’s unique right-back skillset has seen Dominik Szoboszlai thrown in there more than once just to try and capture that playmaker’s spirit from such an unusual area of the field.",
      "Their title defence is already over with the gap to Arsenal a yawning 10 points. But the gap to Crystal Palace in fourth is only three. There remains absolutely no reason why Liverpool can’t go on the kind of run that, while coming up short of propelling them into the title race, leaves them nevertheless well clear of the remaining European chasers.",
      "",
      "We’re not entirely sure quite how they’ve done it, but being second and somehow only two points behind Arsenal after 15 games isn’t just ‘title challenge’ areas for Pep Guardiola Manchester City but tremendously familiar title challenge areas for Pep Guardiola and Manchester City.",
      "They’re actually better off than they were 15 games into either the 2022/23 season, when they trailed the Gunners by five points at this stage, or 2023/24 season when the gap was six points.",
      "",
      "This target was actually for us back in May by Manchester United themselves. We thought it a silly target and took the p*ss.",
      "Not what we’d have gone for, because there currently appear to be – at a rough estimate – 15 teams better placed to achieve this but it is apparently the target United’s brains trust has set Ruben Amorim and his merry band of dafties, so there it is.",
      "And where are they now? Sixth. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Brutal, but Newcastle will remain the flimsiest contender for Big Eight status until they can stitch two good league seasons together.",
      "And they haven’t yet managed it, with the current pattern from an admittedly small sample size being qualifying for the Champions League, then struggling with the added workload, then qualifying again with a reduced workload, then struggling again.",
      "Obviously – as has become a recurring theme throughout this update – we must not become too distracted one way or the other by current league positions. Unless you’re in the top three or bottom five it’s all basically the same.",
      "Newcastle are 12th, which is bad, but also three points off a probable Champions League position, which is fine. At some point, the current mid-table gridlock will disperse with obvious winners and losers, with no reason Newcastle can’t be among the former. Though they might want to stop chucking away points.",
      "In the Champions League itself, it’s been better than their last effort with a play-off spot almost certain and a strong likelihood of being seeded in that play-off round. Two wins and it could still be a top-eight finish, but that does require winning away at PSG.",
      "",
      "Of all the teams who simply didn’t listen to our sage early-summer advice, Nottingham Forest are among those who didn’t listen the hardest.",
      "Did we say fall out with the manager who made you good? No. Did we say then appoint the manager who took Spurs down to 17th to get you out of a nascent relegation fight? No. Did we say to then sack that manager and bring in Sean Dyche a few weeks later? Well, to be fair, by that point yeah we did kind of think that was probably for the best. But bloody hell.",
      "The only way to avoid one-season-wondering themselves now is to steer sufficiently clear of relegation trouble that they can laser-focus on the Europa League across the last four months of the season a la Tottenham.",

      "It’s not going well in Rome for the young Irishman, who has only registered one goal and one assist since joining on loan from Brighton.",
      "Reports suggest Roma are hoping to end Ferguson’s loan spell prematurely, though there is no clause allowing them to do so unilaterally. However, they can negotiate a termination, and if they do, Roma will likely push to sign Zirkzee from Man United.",

      "The Dutch international cost the Red Devils around £35m and has scored just eight goals and provided three assists in 58 matches.",
      "He has only started three games this season, all in United’s last four Premier League matches, but has made a positive impact during that run.",
      "Zirkzee knows he must be playing regularly to stand a chance of making Ronald Koeman’s squad for next summer’s World Cup. And when Benjamin Sesko returns from injury, there’s a chance Amorim starts overlooking him again.",
      "Sesko hasn’t done enough to convince Zirkzee that he won’t play once the Slovenian is back fit, but managers can show bias towards players they sign, which applies to Sesko, not Zirkzee.",
      "As for Ferguson, it’s not clear what the future holds or whether he’ll ever come close to realising the potential he once seemed destined for.",
      "Not long ago, there was talk of him commanding a £100m fee and Brighton cashing in yet again on a player they bought for peanuts.",

I’m quite sure a lot of these young players don’t want to be labelled anymore. They did all that when they were kids playing FIFA. When it gets to the real world, you see that they want to get about. In my opinion you want midfield players like a Roy Keane, a Paul Ince, a Bryan Robson – players who can and want to do everything.",

      "Spurs legend Chris Waddle has explained why he thinks his former club should snub Marcus Rashford, but he would actually be a no-brainer signing…",
      "Few could have foreseen Rashford‘s summer move to Barcelona going as well as it has, with the Manchester United outcast being one of the window’s best signings across Europe.",
      "The 28-year-old has featured far more consistently for Barcelona than most imagined he would, with his tally of six goals and eleven assists in 21 appearances a stunning return in his first six months.",

      "READ: Xavi Simons clicking Spurs attack into gear to become Frank’s biggest undroppable",
      "In that context, Spurs would be one of the contenders to sign him as they have previously been linked with the forward, while his relationship with Man Utd is likely beyond repair.",
      "Given how well Rashford has performed for Barcelona and Aston Villa over the past year, Spurs, especially for the fee involved, should snap Man Utd’s hands off if gifted the opportunity to land the England international.",
      "Spurs legend Waddle is against this potential signing, though his reasoning is somewhat flawed.",
      "“Spurs have failed to replace Harry Kane. They now seem to be too interested in only signing young players like Archie Gray, Lucas Bergvall and Wilson Odobert and trying to develop them. It’s about time they started signing ready-made players,” Waddle said in an interview with WhichBookie.",
      "“They have been linked with Marcus Rashford and although he’s better than what they’ve got, I’m not too sure they really need another left-winger.”",

      "So, Rashford is “better than what they have got”, but Spurs do not “need another left winger”… Eh?",
      "Spurs are not short of options in wide areas, but their current options are at a certain level and certainly worth being replaced with an upgrade if a player of Rashford’s ability becomes available.",
      "Rashford’s versatility is another positive. He should not be deemed a replacement for Kane, but he would be a great option for the No.9 role and increase Tottenham’s output from up front/out wide.",
      "He also fits the bill as a “ready-made player”, even though Waddle thinks otherwise…",
      "“He’s not shown enough in the Premier League for Manchester United. He had one good season a few years ago, but apart from that he’s been quite inconsistent. I personally wouldn’t be trying to sign him,” Rashford added.",
      "“Spurs should be looking at somebody who is proven in this league. They shouldn’t be put off trying to sign players from other Premier League clubs who have performed well.",
      "“I know they’ll be doing their scouting far and wide across Europe and elsewhere, but sometimes I think they just need to buy somebody who is ready-made for the league and is already performing week in, week out.”",
      "There is no doubt that he had plenty of dips in his career, but he showed what he is capable of in his 30-goal campaign for Man Utd and during last season’s loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Very few of Tottenham’s realistic alternatives would be quite as “ready-made” and a sure-fire upgrade as Rashford, who would be a no-brainer signing if the opportunity arose.",

      "Amorim made it clear publicly that Mainoo would be fighting it out with captain Bruno Fernandes for a position in the Man Utd starting XI this season.",

      "However, Mainoo hasn’t started a Premier League game this season and there are rumours he now wants to leave Man Utd in search for regular game time before the 2026 World Cup in the summer.",
      "Richard Keys claimed earlier this week that he knows the real reason why Amorim isn’t playing Mainoo, he said in his blog: “I learned at the weekend why Amorim won’t play Mainoo, who sadly will leave United now – probably in January.",

I’ve heard some baffling nonsense from this generation of coaches (I give you Wilfried Nancy after Celtic’s defeat to Hearts) and this is right up there. Not mobile enough? So Amorim picks Casemiro instead? If it wasn’t so sad it would be laughable.”",

      "Compared to other rumoured interested clubs, Tottenham and Man City, Bayern Munich’s structure ‘could guarantee him a more direct path to a starting position, something crucial for a player who needs consistent playing time immediately’.",
      "The report adds: ‘For Kobbie Mainoo, choosing his next destination is crucial. He wants a project where he can grow, compete, and take on responsibilities, and that’s where Bayern Munich has the advantage. The German club is seriously considering turning its interest into a formal offer, convinced that the Englishman could become a key midfielder in the coming years.’",

      "He started up front against West Ham on December 14 and was a late substitute in the 4-1 win at Wolves four days later.",
      "Amorim is short of forward options given a recent injury to Benjamin Sesko, although Matheus Cunha has returned from a spell on the sidelines.",
      "United are set to lose Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations in the coming week, with the tournament starting on December 21. The final takes place on January 18.",

      "Zirkzee has made three starts in the Premier League this term and named in Amorim's first XI in three of United's last four games. He has played a total of 345 minutes, scoring once.",
      "A glance at Joshua Zirkzee's numbers this season, or indeed since he arrived at Old Trafford in the summer of 2024, would suggest that allowing him to leave in January would be no great loss to Manchester United.",
      "Clearly, the forward has not managed to do much to impress Ruben Amorim. United's elaborate £207m spend on three new forwards in this most recent transfer window tells you as much. In total, Zirkzee has scored eight goals in all competitions across a fairly underwhelming 18 months in United colours. Physicality has been an issue, and productivity under pressure hard to come by.",
      "But, and this is important, United at this juncture cannot spare him. His smart equaliser from a tight angle in last month's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace showed glimpses of what he's about and why United signed him in the first place. Amorim singled him out for praise after that performance.",
      "Besides, options are few. The loss of Bryan Mbeumo surely necessitates he stays beyond January, even if he's only used from the bench. United do not have the same bounty of forwards with Mbeumo gone and Sesko injured as many of their closest rivals, and that alone is perhaps argument enough for Zirkzee to stay put.",

      "Their fate appears sealed already even in December.",
      "What lies ahead for Amorim's United this season remains a mystery.",
      "Wolves equalled their longest-ever losing streak in league history, also losing eight in a row between December 1981 and February 1982.\n\n\nWolves’ haul of only two points in the Premier League this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers, level with Sheffield United in the Premier League in 2020-21, Southport in 1975-76 in the Fourth Division and Barrow and Newport County in 1970-71 in the Fourth Division.",
      "Fellow playmaker James Maddison praised Fernandes in the Monday Night Football studio. \"Bruno Fernandes is underrated for the consistency he shows regularly,\" said the Tottenham player. \"Every time he is on the ball, he can just see it all.\"",
      "Fernandes showed that with his assist for Mount's goal. He punished Wolves and now has 15 goal involvements in his last 14 Premier League games for Manchester United against sides starting the day in the relegation zone - six goals and nine assists.",
      "\"I thought some of the combinations going forward were crisp, were sharp and that's what we can do.",
      "\"We know we can do that. It's about us creating as many chances as we can as forward players and trying to get on the scoresheet. I thought going forward we were solid, and as a defence it's about defending as a team and not letting them have any chances to get back into the game.\"",
      "\"We scored four but had a lot of shots. I cannot make that connection with being more clinical. We improved a lot.",
      "\"If you compare last season and this season, we are creating so much more chances and scoring more goals and having more real situations of danger. I am really pleased with that.\"",
      "Manchester United mustered 27 shots in the game, their most in the Premier League under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"I get the anger and the frustration completely. They haven't seen their side win in ages.",
      "\"If I was a supporter I'd be angry myself because we all want to see our team competing, and at the moment, we aren't doing that.",
      "\"I can't control that [about whether the protests will continue]. I can only look after the team and try to help build some confidence and belief.",
      "\"They are the only things I can concentrate on.\"",
      "\"I think Wolves are going down. I thought they would do at the start of the season but I thought they'd be a lot more competitive than this. They've made a managerial change as well and it hasn't had the desired effect.",
      "\"They were maybe green shoots against Aston Villa where they had a really good performance. I thought if they replicated that they could give Man Utd a game but when you see some of the defending against an average Man Utd team. Wolves are going down - it's just how much of a fight they put up between now and the end of the season.\"",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",
