      "Further question marks over Liverpool's two most expensive summer signings in Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz have been raised after Arne Slot's side fell to a fourth consecutive defeat against Manchester United on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Isak, 26, was the final - and most expensive - acquisition of an unprecedented summer of spending from the Premier League champions, who broke the British transfer record twice to land the former Newcastle striker and Wirtz, the latter joining in a deal worth £116m from Bayer Leverkusen back in June.",
      "Unfortunately for Liverpool and Slot, both Isak and Wirtz have failed to hit the ground running in the early weeks of the season, with scrutiny growing on both players in the wake of another loss for the Reds.",
      "Wirtz has failed to register a goal contribution in his first 10 appearances in a Liverpool shirt and started a second successive Premier League game on the bench against United. Isak, meanwhile, looked off the pace after taking no part in pre-season for Newcastle. But while Slot says now is the time to judge Isak after stressing that the Sweden star is now up to speed, Wayne Rooney believes the former Real Sociedad star should not currently be first-choice ahead of Hugo Ekitike, who has impressed since moving to Anfield.",
      "“I wouldn't play Isak, he hasn't looked ready since coming from Newcastle,” the former England and Manchester United forward said on The Wayne Rooney Show. “He hasn't trained, hasn't had a pre-season. It's so important. While Newcastle were training he was probably sat at home on the phone to his agent for six hours a day trying to get a move.",
      "“It's so difficult when you don't have a pre-season. He might've done stuff by himself but he's paying the price of it.",
      "“On performances, he doesn't deserve to be playing ahead of Ekitike.”",
      "While Isak's latest display has been scrutinised, Wirtz has also been singled out by pundits; Emmanuel Petit claimed ahead of Sunday's big game against United that the Germany playmaker is not worth the £116m that Liverpool paid back in the summer.",
      "Isak at least has the benefit of being a proven Premier League player but Wirtz is a different entity and Jamie Carragher conceded that question marks over the former Leverkusen star are likely to continue, with some maybe even wondering if signing him was a mistake if he is unable to hit top form before the early months of 2026.",
      "“But, if I’m being honest, if I think of the great foreign signings - Sami Hyppia, Mo Salah, Sadio Mane, Luis Suarez, Didi Hamann - they all hit the ground running.",
      "“I can’t think of many, who had an average, poor start - I’m not talking seven games by the way but if you’re getting to Christmas and January and being like ‘oh’. History doesn’t tell me that foreign signings coming into England take a year.”",
      "He continued: “Seven or eight games is too early [to judge] but once we get to January, February, March when is the time we can start saying ‘maybe this was a mistake?’",
      "“Especially at Liverpool, players who are great foreign signings for the club hit the ground running.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The son of England football legend Stuart Pearce has been killed in a tractor crash at the age of 21. Harley Pearce died last Thursday after losing control of the farm vehicle on a country road near his family home in Wiltshire.",
      "It is thought that the tractor sustained a possible tyre blow-out which caused him to veer off the road. Gloucestershire Police confirmed a man in his 20s died at the scene in Witcombe.",
      "Harley was the youngest of Pearce’s two children with his ex-wife, Liz. They also share an older daughter, Chelsea, from their 20-year marriage, which ended in 2013.",
      "Harley didn't follow his father into football and instead ran his own company, Harley Pearce Agricultural Service, and worked on farms across the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire border. He lived near Marlborough in Wiltshire.",
      "However, he also appeared to be a football fan, with Stuart, who enjoyed a long football career playing for the likes of Nottingham Forest, West Ham and Manchester City, once sharing a touching story about how he helped Harley win his school’s Fantasy Football League when he was just eight years old.",
      "During his tenure as the England U21s head coach between 2007 and 2013, Stuart once rang former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson to ask whether he was planning to play Phil Jones or Chris Smalling, under the guise that he wanted the information for his England team.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT, Pearce explained how his son was just one point behind his school headmaster in the popular game with only one game left to play of the season.",
      "After Ferguson gave him the answer, Pearce's son signed that player for his Fantasy Football side (he could not recall whether it was Jones or Smalling), and the subsequent clean sheet points United earned during the game saw him win the league.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Pearce said: \"I done Fantasy Football with my son Harley, he was eight years old at the time, and they done it at the school with all the kids and all the teachers.",
      "\"We worked our way up the league to that final week where it was my son Harley and the headmaster were neck and neck at the top of the table.",
      "\"I think we were one point behind. I picked the phone up to Alex Ferguson on the Wednesday before this game on the Saturday and I asked him the question under the guise of the England under-21 manager 'who are you going to be playing - Jones or Smalling in the back, because I'm thinking of coming to the game to watch them?'",
      "\"He told me which one he was going to play. I transferred a player, that player went into our Fantasy team and we won.\"",
      "Pearce added: \"All I can say in my defence is Campione, campione!\"",
      "Following the announcement of Harley's death, a family tribute read: \"Our family is truly shocked and utterly heartbroken at the loss of our cherished son and devoted brother, Harley. A soul who left an unforgettable imprint on all who knew him.",
      "\"He was a golden boy with an infectious smile, and this shocking tragedy will leave a huge hole in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to have known him.",
      "\"With a quiet, understated strength and deep kindness, we are so proud of the young man he had become, exhibiting a wonderful work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit in the farming industry.",
      "\"He will always be our shining star. Rest in Peace, our beautiful son and brother. You will never ever be forgotten.\"",
      "Emergency services were called at around 2.30pm on Thursday to a report of a collision involving a tractor on the A417, Old Birdlip Hill in Witcombe. A source told the Daily Mail: \"From what we've been told is Harley's tractor had a blow out and he lost control.\"",

      "Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones still considers his old employers to be the biggest club in England - if not the world - despite their recent struggles on the pitch. The Red Devils had their lowest ever Premier League finish under Ruben Amorim last season and haven't won the league in more than a decade, but Jones - part of that last title winning squad - claims on-field success isn't the only factor.",
      "United have picked up some big wins under Amorim, including at Manchester City last season and away at Liverpool on Sunday. However, they remain in mid-table and suffered a shock early Carabao Cup exit at Grimsby.",
      "Even before the latest victory, though, Jones was making the case for United still leading the way in the 'big club stakes. \"People say... United's not the biggest club any more - it is,\" he told Stadium Astro pitchside at United's September win over Chelsea.",
      "\"It is, unfortunately and you don't realise that, and people think 'How?' and 'Look where you are' and no, it doesn't work like that,\" he added.",
      "\"Man United is the biggest club, and for me the only other club that's comparable to Man United is Real Madrid. The only other club that's comparable. And I don't mean to sound biased... that's just how it is, that's just facts.\"",
      "United boss Amorim found himself under significant pressure after a return of just seven points from the first six games of the season. Things have improved since, though, with wins against Sunderland and Liverpool in back-to-back games.",
      "It's the first time the club have won two in a row in the league since the end of the 2023/24 season. Harry Maguire was the match-winner on this occasion, delivering a crucial late goal after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's early opener.",
      "\"It is really important for me that is back-to-back, it doesn't matter about the opponent it is just the feeling of winning. The important thing is to think three in the row and that's the focus,\" Amorim told BBC Sport after the latest win.",
      "\"Sometimes we struggle to choose the right time to press. We didn't start well after the equaliser but we controlled the momentum and pushing them to their half when they had the ball is important and that is where we won the game.\"",
      "With United having no European responsibilities this season, their very next game will provide an opportunity to earn three league wins on the spin for the first time since February 2024. They're back at Old Trafford, with Brighton the visitors - nine months on for a Seagulls win which prompted Amorim to claim his United squad might have been the worst in the club's history",

      "Carlos Baleba says he's returned to top form ahead of Brighton's showdown with Manchester United. The 21-year-old midfielder, who was linked with a move to Old Trafford in the summer, will be eager to show Ruben Amorim exactly what he can do when they meet this weekend.",
      "Baleba commemorated the Seagulls' victory over Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon with an Instagram post. Captioning a collection of images from the Amex Stadium, the Cameroon international wrote: \"Good team win and I'm feeling like myself again. #areyouabaleba.\"",
      "United players Leny Yoro and Andre Onana featured among the thousands of users who 'liked' the post. Baleba endured a rocky beginning to the campaign, with Fabian Hurzeler openly demanding he raise his game, but he impressed at the weekend.",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of the Magpies fixture, the Brighton manager challenged him to 'step up and show personality'. Hurzeler said: \"I think we're getting to a time now where it's up to him, where he has to take responsibility as well.",
      "\"He can't change the noise around him, he's a player for Brighton. No matter what the rumours are, he will be a player for Brighton until [at least] the end of the season. But now he has to take responsibility.",
      "\"Now he has to make a step up and show personality, that's his next step in his personal development for sure. Like I said in the last weeks, there are waves in development, but you can only get out of it if you take ownership and if you take responsibility, there are some moments where nobody can help you.",
      "\"You have to be your own support, your own help. He has the best environment here he can get, he has great teammates who are there for him and support him.",
      "\"But now it's also up to the player that he steps up, that he shows personality and takes ownership of his development. That's what I demand from him in the future.\"",
      "Tony Bloom recently spoke about Baleba's future, confirming that United had indeed shown interest in securing a deal. Speaking to The Argus, the Seagulls' owner said: \"I don't think Baleba was a saga.",
      "\"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past.",
      "\"But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",
      "United didn't see bolstering their midfield as a pressing need, hence the signing of three high-profile forwards in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Baleba stayed put at the Amex Stadium, but it seems the Red Devils are ready to make another attempt to secure his signature.",

Harry Maguire netted a late winner for the Red Devils, inflicting a fourth consecutive loss on Arne Slot's side and first home defeat to their fierce rivals since 2016.",

      "The Englishman's net worth currently stands at a reported £300million. Beckham retired in 2013 whilst playing for PSG and by the time he called it quits, Business Insider claims he had earned a staggering £580m.",
      "He was the highest-paid player globally at one stage and the groundbreaking five-year contract he signed with LA Galaxy in 2008 would be worth around £190m in total these days.",
      "But the 50-year-old added to this fortune through various endorsements and brand deals. Beckham has worked with the likes of Emporio Armani, Gillette, PepsiCo, H&M, Breitling and Adidas.",
      "Beckham has also put his name to various products over the years, including his own fragrance line, video games and some signature sunglasses.",
      "An eponymous Netflix documentary that aired in 2023 reportedly earned him roughly £20m and in that year alone he raked in just over £72m from various products and brand deals.",
      "Beckham also signed a 10-year contract to serve as an ambassador for Qatar, reportedly earning around £125m in total from the country. Besides generating enormous income from his various ventures, Beckham is known for his lavish spending.",
      "He has a portfolio of over a dozen properties valued at approximately £70m. This includes a luxury penthouse in Miami purchased for £17.5m and a London townhouse estimated at about £30m.",
      "His wife, Victoria, famed for being a member of the Spice Girls, has a net worth of £200m. If combined, the power couple has an accumulative fortune of over £500m. Though none of this will go into the consortium's potential bid.",
      "Beckham has merely been asked to be an ambassador, and other legendary United players such as Wayne Rooney and Eric Cantona have been considered too.",

      "Ruben Amorim hit back at Jamie Carragher's forecast that he'd be sacked from his Manchester United role before Christmas after securing a crucial triumph over Liverpool. The United manager secured his first Premier League away victory in seven months as his team emerged 2-1 victors at Anfield on Sunday.",
      "United claimed their first triumph at the reigning champions' fortress since 2016 courtesy of strikes from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire. Beyond handing Liverpool a brutal loss, Arne Slot's outfit have now suffered four consecutive defeats across all competitions for the first time since 2014.",
      "While Amorim achieved successive league victories for the first time since assuming control nearly 12 months ago. During his post-match media briefing, Amorim specifically mentioned predictions that he would be dismissed by Christmas - an opinion put forward by Carragher earlier this month.",
      "The Portuguese tactician declared: \"It is really important. I don't have many wins in Manchester. It is really important back to back, every detail of this game, the spirit when we suffer a bad moment or control, all the small things was perfect.",
      "\"Let's try to do that next week. It is really important for our fans, they struggle against Grimsby and Brentford and today they saw a different team.",
      "\"I think it is not normal, it is hard to find something like this, so many bad moments and to have the fans always supporting the manager when every one of you (the media) is saying he is gone before Christmas.\"",
      "Despite United's 2-0 triumph over Sunderland before the international break, it didn't prevent Carragher from predicting that Amorim will be given his marching orders within the next two months.",
      "\"It's inevitable that this is going to happen before Christmas. His stats are unbelievable for a Manchester United manager. Fifty games as Manchester United manager, he's only scored two more goals than he's conceded.\"",
      "Amorim didn't downplay the significance of the Anfield victory but was quick to shift attention to their upcoming home match against a high-flying Brighton side this weekend.",
      "\"We fought for every ball, we lost our composure in the second half but the spirit was there and that is the most important thing, if you have the spirit you can win any game. It was a good day and now I am concerned about Brighton. I will enjoy it but let's focus on Brighton.\"",

      "Senne Lammens confessed Manchester United's triumph over Liverpool was the most significant match of his career.",
      "Lammens secured a clean sheet against Sunderland prior to the international break, but featuring against Liverpool at Anfield was certain to pose different challenges for the keeper. And the 23 year old rose to the occasion.",
      "Lammens wasn't fazed by the Anfield atmosphere and delivered a pivotal performance in a memorable triumph, producing several vital stops and easing the pressure with his distribution.",
      "\"I think it was like ten seasons ago we won here [in 2016], so you can feel it as well with the fans. This atmosphere was one of the biggest games I was looking forward to when I came here, so I'm so happy we could win today.\"",
      "Lammens was questioned whether it represented the most important fixture of his career. \"Yeah, it has to be, I'm not even close, I think,\" he said, before outlining how his preparation remained largely unchanged from any other encounter.",
      "\"I think you just try to be like yourself, don't really overthink it, it's just a game, to be honest, at the end of the day. Just in my preparation, the same as usual. I concentrate on the pitch.",
      "\"Not really looking or hearing what's going on outside of the pitch, and I think with this team today, how we fought, it feels so good that we got what we deserved, I think. So it's really good today.\"",
      "Mason Mount heaped praise on Lammens for easing the pressure with his lengthy clearances following the Sunderland triumph, and the tactic proved incredibly successful against Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"We know how they press, they're gonna go man-vs-man, so I think being realistic, coming into Anfield, it's quite difficult to build up, I think, so from the beginning on with the defenders, I think I made the decision that we should get more of a long ball and do it with the second ball,\" Lammens said.",
      "\"Even though we didn't really have a target striker. But I think even though we didn't have one, the second ball we did quite good, so that's how we could still push them away, and how we also scored the first one, I think, it was because of the long ball, second ball and then a counter.\"",
      "When questioned whether that was his own choice, he responded: \"No, it's also the team, the coach, they try to give you as much information as they can, but yeah, you have to be realistic as well, especially in the beginning of the game, if it really works like this, then you should just stay with this tactic, and I think today it worked out.\"",
      "Lammens went on: \"Like I said, it was ten seasons ago since we win in here, so that's kind of special, and also, I don't know for sure, but two [league wins] in a row is also something we've been looking forward to, to get the momentum going.",
      "\"I think that was a big part of what the coach showed us this season, get the momentum going, and there's been quite some disappointments this season, some games that we wanted to take momentum but we couldn't, and I think today could be a start of a good momentum, and we should next week at home as well (against Brighton), so with the fans behind us we should try to win that game as well.\"",
      "United displayed tremendous spirit to net a decisive goal following Cody Gakpo's leveller.",
      "\"Yeah, I've not been here a long time, but you can feel it. With the team, we've all got players who are really experienced, and we know that even if they score we've still got a chance,\" he said.",
      "\"I think last year as well and this season we scored some goals after the opponent scored, so we knew with the crosses on Harry [Maguire] and stuff, he scored quite a lot of them.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"So you never want a game like this, but especially defending in the last 20 minutes, defending the box and how we throw ourselves in front of the ball, also the players who came in, it's not difficult in this environment, and the type of game it was, so I'm really proud of the team today.\"",
      "When asked about blocking out external pressures, he replied: \"Yeah, I try my hardest, I think I'm quite OK at this, trying to keep the noise out from outside, like I said, just prepare the same way as I've always done, treat it like any other game, of course you have to be realistic, it's not like any other game.",
      "\"But you still try to prepare like this, and I think just from the first minute on you be realistic, and like I said with the game plan we did as well, I think we executed it quite good, so we knew before the game it was going to be really difficult, and we had to defend with 11 people, and we did, so it was really good.\"",
      "Speaking about Ruben Amorim, Lammens stated: \"For me, he's always the same, I haven't been here as long as I said before, so maybe it's different for other guys, but for me as a coach he gets a lot of pressure.",
      "\"You can feel it from the outside, you can read it, you can hear it, but I think he does his best, and he does really good, try to keep the pressure on him and not on the team, he takes a lot of the pressure from us, and that's also what the great managers do.\"",
      "Lammens' life has taken a dramatic turn since his move to Old Trafford. \"Of course from the outside I try to keep my best friends close, my family and the rest is a little bit like outside noise, now I'm doing good. So it's all praise, I know, and I'm realistic, if it goes not so good it will be all bad commentary,\" he expressed.",
      "\"I think my social media has exploded, but they told me before the transfer, I already knew it a little bit, but it's just a really good feeling that you get the praise, also with the wins, it's a really nice feeling.",
      "\"It's [Manchester] really nice, I've been in my apartment now a couple of weeks, so it's quite easy.\"",
      "Will Lammens celebrate the victory?",
      "\"I think I'm going to go quite easy tonight,\" he smiled. \"One of my best mates is here, so I'm going to spend the evening with him a little bit, enjoy this.",
      "\"But I think we've tasted it and now we want more, that's the most important, so this is not the end station, so now we just have to keep going.\"",

      "Previously he was the skipper on the red side of Manchester, but was stripped of the armband by Erik ten Hag with Bruno Fernandes now leading the side. His leadership style has proved divisive though, whilst Maguire has earned plaudits for how he's handled himself throughout his career at Old Trafford.",
      "The centre-half, the world's most expensive defender following his move from Leicester in 2019, has endured a mixed time at the club but has overcome a number of challenges to become a starter under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He's continued to come up with big goals, scoring a last minute winner to down Lyon in Europe last term, and was the man on the spot to head home the winner at Anfield on Sunday.",
      "Schmeichel insists he is the ideal man to be wearing the armband for the Manchester outfit, lauding his personal qualities and claiming that Fernandes' antics are not always that of a captain.",
      "He told Viaplay: \"I can’t praise him enough. I want Harry Maguire to play every game. I want him to be the captain, he’s got all the attributes of a good Manchester United leader.",
      "\"He’s not the quickest, I’ll agree with that, and he’s got some trouble on the turn, but Man United have had defenders like that before. But what they always had next to them were quick players and that’s what we don’t have at the moment.",
      "\"I think he should be the number one defender and he can organise everybody. He talks to everybody and gives them confidence, and I think that is important. Somebody who stands out all the time and takes responsibility, because I think that has been a problem in this team.",
      "\"I think Bruno is a fantastic player, plays maybe in the wrong position, but sometimes I don’t like his body language. I know he talks really well to all the players but sometimes he has reactions that can be mistaken for something else.\"",
      "When the news previously emerged that Maguire was having the captaincy taken away from him the England international said he was \"extremely disappointed\" but will \"continue to give my all\" in the shirt, declaring it a \"privilege\".",
      "Maguire was previously linked with a sale to West Ham but underlined his determination to stay and fight for his place, despite being snubbed. He's enjoyed a renaissance, continuing to come up with big moments.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee revealed his true character after Manchester United's 2-1 triumph over Liverpool. The 24-year-old striker has recently been touted for a potential departure, but was amongst the first players to revel in the victory at Anfield on Sunday evening.",
      "Despite remaining on the bench throughout, Zirkzee dismissed any notion of discontent when he sprinted onto the pitch at the final whistle. As the Netherlands international approached his colleagues, Bruno Fernandes playfully attempted to put him in a headlock before chest-bumping with Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "One supporter posted on X: \"Love the guy. I feel bad that he's not playing more but that's the situation we're in. Hopefully we can string together a few wins/momentum and he'll be able to get more minutes. He's a joy to watch.\"",
      "\"His time will come, he might have to be patient and I know that's hard but he's what we need in the squad right now,\" commented another, whilst a third added: \"Zirkzee is such a good team player. Look at how happy he is for his teammates. Amazing personality he has.\"",
      "Zirkzee, who United snapped up from Bologna for £36.5m last year, has endured a rather uncertain period of late. Ever since Ruben Amorim took over from Erik ten Hag in the hot seat, the forward has found it tough to cement his place in the starting XI.",
      "This campaign, he's managed just three Premier League appearances, with each outing coming as a substitute. Despite clocking up merely 82 minutes across all competitions, Zirkzee seems determined to fight for his United future amid speculation over a January departure - and clearly hasn't lost any passion for the club.",
      "The Dutchman, who's evidently well-liked amongst his teammates, will be desperate for a chance when United take on Brighton at Old Trafford this weekend. Prior to the Liverpool encounter, Amorim was quizzed about whether he understood why Zirkzee, along with Kobbie Mainoo, might feel frustrated by their limited playing time.",
      "The United chief responded: \"That is normal. I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. You have to have news. Players are not playing. They want to play. Like you said, there's a World Cup.",
      "\"There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So I understand that, but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",
      "Amorim has previously stated his desire to retain Zirkzee, though he's yet to follow through on those words. Chatting to talkSPORT at the beginning of the year, the Reds manager revealed: \"I want to keep Josh because he gives everything and he's trying in training but we don't know.",
      "\"The window is open and we will see what happens. We just need to focus on training and to take this for the other games. It's just one point so let's focus on the performance for the next games.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Back in April, Amorim sang Zirkzee's praises.: \"Yes, he's doing a great job. Also a very important thing was the way the fans react after that incident.",
      "\"So if you see, every time, even if Josh is not playing, every time he gets on the pitch or just warming up, our fans sing the Josh song. So that is massive for the player, so it's 50-50. Fifty per cent part of the fans and 50 per cent of Josh.\"",
      "Speaking about supporting Zirkzee as he settles in, Amorim continued: \"I explained the situation because, as a former player, I wanted to hear some explanation sometimes from the coaches and I am really open that.",
      "\"I just want to help the team and then work with him. With all the work that all the staff is doing with him he's improving, and then I put him to play. This is the only way to show confidence to the player.\"",

      "Jurgen Klopp has revealed that he rejected the Manchester United job. The former Liverpool manager has acknowledged that particular elements of the position put him off and believed the timing wasn't right for him.",
      "Klopp eventually took charge at Anfield, steering Liverpool to prolonged triumph. During that spell, he assisted Liverpool in surpassing their North West adversaries but things could have been vastly different had he accepted the position after departing Borussia Dortmund.",
      "It was previously reported that he was viewed as David Moyes's replacement after the club contacted him in 2014, before Klopp chose to stay in the Bundesliga. Speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast, Klopp disclosed that he harboured doubts following discussions with the United leadership.",
      "\"It's difficult, we're not in a private space but there are some reasons but the people in that conversation that I didn't like,\" he said. \"So, United was that big 'we get all the players we want, we get him, we get him, we get him' and I was sitting there like 'huh?'.",
      "\"It was not my project, it didn't feel like my project, it was the wrong time but on top of that, it was not my project. I didn't want to bring back [Paul] Pogba, Pogba is a sensational player my god, but these things don't work usually.",
      "\"Or Cristiano [Ronaldo] my god we all know he's the best player in the world together with [Lionel] Messi. Bringing him back never helps, in that time in 2013, it was not about Cristiano, maybe Paul I'm not sure but the idea was, 'we bring the best players together then let's go'.",
      "\"Not at all [about the football] then I sat there like it wasn't for me. Then the pure football project comes up and a sensational talk to Mike Gordon [Fenway Sports Group president] that's really important as well.",
      "\"He's the owner but John [Henry] and Tom [Werner], after the talk I wanted to be Mike's friend, he was such a nice guy. After that, it was pretty special.\"",
      "Explaining his thoughts on United's struggles in the last decade, the 58-year-old added: \"I haven't thought for a second since joining Liverpool what United did right or wrong. I went to Liverpool and in that moment you became our opponent, not my enemy, but an important opponent, one that is much more fun to beat.",
      "\"Always in football, like in life, you only find a solution now knowing you have two day later another problem. There's no long term, 'we have to deal with that for another two day then we can sort it'.",
      "\"We would have to deal with it for a year or two then we can make a big step, in a football case, contracts are running out, player goes anyway, sell him but because you're in such a rush all the time just because you have to win the next game.",
      "\"For United, in the years when they were not happy they would buy the time, Jose coming second, no one was happy. Remember that? In that time second was not good enough and now you're not even close to that but that's not a Man United story, it's a football story.",
      "\"You win, you're the greatest, you lose, you know nothing about the game, you draw, you're boring, it's only your idea and where you want to go. Everything in life is about development, you are not the same as you were 10 years ago, it means the time between then and now counts.",
      "\"I have to plan my own life, medium and long-term, and the future of a football club. A footballer can score five goals but will not sort the problem.

      "Harry Maguire's match-winning goal for Manchester United against Liverpool arrived just days after Paul Scholes claimed he lacked the athleticism for top-flight football. The 32-year-old defender soared above the Reds' defence to meet Bruno Fernandes' cross and guide his header beyond Giorgi Mamardashvili into the far corner.",
      "His crucial goal sealed a stunning 2-1 triumph at Anfield - United's first success on Merseyside's red half since 2016. The moment proved particularly sweet for Maguire, who had squandered a glorious chance to down Liverpool at Anfield in January, when he blazed over with the goal gaping.",
      "United's players swarmed around their defender, who was labelled as United's 'weak link' by United icon Roy Keane, in celebration of what ranks among Ruben Amorim's most significant victories. Yet Maguire's heroics also served to silence Scholes' and Keane's harsh assessments.",
      "Before United's journey to Anfield, the Old Trafford icon had suggested Maguire, alongside Luke Shaw and Casemiro, no longer possessed the physical attributes required at the highest level. Speaking on 'The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast', Scholes said: \"Shaw, Maguire, Casemiro, they've all been great players but they're at a stage of their career now where you get found out in the Premier League if you're not physically good enough.",
      "\"Their bodies are not athletic enough, they're not strong enough, they're not quick enough. They've dropped to a level where they can't cope with what's needed in the Premier League.",
      "\"Every player in the Premier League is an absolute machine. They've got five per cent body fat, they can run, they're strong, they can head it. Manchester United are carrying two or three players that are just not capable of living with it.\"",
      "Despite this, Amorim evidently disagrees, as Shaw, Casemiro and Maguire all started against Arne Slot's team. Of the trio, only Maguire played the full match, with Casemiro being replaced by Manuel Ugarte and Shaw substituted for Leny Yoro.",
      "Maguire's 90-minute stint, solid defensive performance and winning goal - a powerful header into the far corner - would have been particularly gratifying given Scholes' critique. However, in his post-match interview, the former Leicester City defender refrained from hitting back at any detractors.",
      "\"It has been a long time coming, coming to this ground and picking up three points. It is the old cliché that it is only three points but it is definitely not, it means a lot more than that to the boys, the club, the fans.",
      "\"I have been here for seven years now and coming to this ground every time and not get three points has been tough. It is for the fans and I hope they have a great night tonight because, of course it is only three points on the table, but to come here and get it over Liverpool, as they have been a top team over the years and they have been a lot better than us in recent years, it is good to get one over them.",
      "\"Football is all about memories and creating special memories and I am sure all the fans will have a memory that they will never forget. We will all go home happy.",
      "\"We won't get carried away because we know this club is not in a position to get carried away. We need to use this as motivation to reach levels that they have reached in recent years because that is where this club should be at.\"",

      "Dermot Gallagher has backed Michael Oliver's decision to allow play to continue in the build-up to Manchester United's opening goal against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday evening. The controversy arose just before Bryan Mbeumo broke the deadlock for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "Bruno Fernandes pounced on a loose ball in the middle of the park after Virgil van Dijk collided with Alexis Mac Allister. The Liverpool midfielder fell to the ground in a heap, but Oliver waved play on, and the Red Devils mounted an attack.",
      "Gallagher said: \"Is there a foul? No, because it's Van Dijk who comes in behind Mac Allister. Michael Oliver assess it and says 'no foul' and play goes on very quickly.\"",
      "\"He's forced to break with it and so is the assistant, so neither see Mac Allister behind them. Within five seconds, the ball is in the net. The first time they see Mac Allister down, the ball is in the net so that's the first time they can go back [and check him]. It's just an unfortunate incident.\"",
      "After the game, Arne Slot was asked about his views on the validity of the goal. The Liverpool boss said: \"I think the main thing we should do now, I should do now, is not complain, blame or do these kind of things.",
      "\"We could have done much better after Macca was on the floor, we should have done better. But the healthcare of a player is something that is important and if a player needs to have four stitches, you would hope that everybody understands that he needs immediate treatment.",
      "\"But it didn't happen. But, again, we could have done better, so that's not the reason why we lost this game today - the reason is because we missed far too many chances to win a game of football.\"",
      "Slot continued: \"Again, I've said it here many times and I'm hoping that I'm not just saying it to you but everybody understands this a bit better, we are not a team - which I see a lot in football - that goes to the floor pretending it's a head injury so they kill the counter-attack.",
      "\"That's not who we are. We never go to the floor, we always are a fair team. So if a player of us is then on the floor you would hope everybody would say, 'It's Liverpool, they don't do these kind of things, so let's blow a whistle.'",
      "\"But, again, that's not an excuse for us conceding the goal and that's not an excuse for us losing this game of football.\"",
      "\"I was just thinking about getting to first base, 20 to 25 minutes in, but those United fans are delirious to our left. Amad and Mbeumo connect, and there's something here that's really unusual.",
      "\"There's a challenge in midfield where Mac Allister goes down - watch Van Dijk, that's the thing that stuns me. Mbeumo runs off the back of Van Dijk - I don't think he sees him. [Ibrahima] Konate can't get across. But just watch Van Dijk here. The big surprise.\"",
      "During the half-time break, Jamie Redknapp echoed Neville's sentiments. The ex-Liverpool midfielder said: \"From Man United's point of view, it's brilliant but I think Van Dijk makes a big mistake. He has to sprint back.",
      "\"Yes, there was a collision but you still have to think for yourself. You can't pass it onto Konate. You have to sprint back as quick as you can and make sure that run doesn't go in behind you. So fundamentally, they've made a mistake.\"",

      "Amorim opted to place Leny Yoro amongst the substitutes and Maguire justified the choice to field him, defending courageously throughout the encounter and emerging in the 84th minute to head home the decisive goal.",

      "Maguire has reached the final year of his deal, and he confessed finding the net was made even sweeter by clinching victory on what could potentially be his farewell Anfield appearance with United.",
      "\"I've been here seven years now, so it's been tough for the seven years not getting that win,\" he said.",

But more importantly, a big win for our fans because it's been tough for them.",

      "\"We need to build on it. We need to build momentum. We need to build positive performances. Performances breed results in the end and that's the most important thing. Take the positives, take the confidence, but we've got to make sure against Brighton at Old Trafford we perform and get the win.\"",

      "Manchester United ended a near decade-long wait by beating Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday - a much needed win for Ruben Amorim and his ambitions. But this isn't the first time he's secured a statement result at the home of one of his rivals.",
      "Early in his tenure the Portuguese head coach secured derby victory at the Etihad. It had all the hallmarks of a win that would inspire confidence and serve as a springboard for his time as boss. Two late goals, the winner from Amad, stunned Manchester City.",
      "Much in the way Liverpool were stunned by Harry Maguire's late header at the Anfield Road end. Sunday's win is, remarkably, the first time Amorim has secured successive wins in the Premier League since he took charge nearly a year ago.",
      "The first 12 months of his tenure has seen dark clouds gather over Old Trafford with his job constantly in question. His methods have been ripped apart and the promise that came from that early win over their local rivals did not act as a sign of things to come.",
      "Instead they endured a horror run that included Amorim confessing a relegation battle was something they had to face head on, such was their slide down the table.",
      "After beating City Amorim claimed: \"Our club needs to win these kinds of matches, I understand the happiness of our fans but we need to continue.\"",
      "Continue they did not. Days later and United's momentum was quickly halted by Tottenham in the Carabao Cup. A seven-goal thriller appeared close at the final whistle, but Amorim's side found themselves 3-0 down before a late rally. A week after their derby win and, upon their return to Premier League action, Bournemouth would complete a remarkable double - winning 3-0 at Old Trafford in December for the second year in a row.",
      "The familiar issues with United were apparent, largely their inability to defend set pieces as the Cherries enjoyed a day out in Manchester.",
      "The loss wasn't a blip though and a Boxing Day defeat would make it a Christmas to forget. Andre Onana, who already had a growing list of doubters, would be beaten direct from a corner at Molineux as Wolves secured victory. It was only their fourth win of the season, lifting them out of the relegation zone.",
      "A fourth defeat on the spin would come four days later as Newcastle secured a win at Old Trafford, but the performance was perhaps the most damning thing for Amorim. His side hadn't been outclassed like that during his tenure.",
      "The Magpies were 2-0 up by half-time and, whilst they didn't add to that total, the dominance of their display was alarming. Newcastle's midfield bossed the contest as the flaws of Amorim's system - which are still being discussed - were particularly highlighted.",
      "Lost 4-3 at Tottenham",
      "Lost 3-0 to Bournemouth",
      "Lost 2-0 at Wolves",
      "Lost 2-0 to Newcastle",
      "Afterwards Amorim delivered the frank honesty for which he's become known. Adamant he wouldn't change his approach, urging the club to axe him if they wanted to see a different style and suggesting a battle to avoid the drop was on the cards.",
      "Not since Sir Matt Busby's days, in September 1962, had United lost five times in the league in a calendar month, but Amorim would do just that last December.",
      "And so just shy of a year on and there is scepticism over whether their win at Liverpool is a bright day in an otherwise gloomy season or really a sign that the tide is turning. The likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, two summer signings, showed their class and continue to suggest good things are coming.",
      "United's next four games see them host Brighton before back-to-back away trips at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. Everton at home come after November's international break. Last year those fixtures yielded a return of three points from a possible 12. If Liverpool is to prove a turning point, they'll need considerably more.",
      "Amorim admitted: \"I think that was the biggest win in my time at Manchester United. It means a lot today but tomorrow it won't mean a lot. It's three points and it's a good victory.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim guided Manchester United to a landmark victory on Sunday as they beat rivals Liverpool. The Portuguese head coach had been under immense pressure this season but some of the new rules he has introduced at the club might now be working.",
      "A late Harry Maguire header handed United a pivotal 2-1 victory after Cody Gakpo cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's early effort. United's new goalkeeper Senne Lammens impressed at Anfield but was unable to keep a second consecutive clean sheet, despite last week's emergence of a 'ban' he places on family and team-mates.",
      "Lammens is somewhat superstitious and in the build-up to games has stopped any mention of clean sheets before he takes to the field. The unusual ban reportedly applies to both family and team-mates.",
      "After some high-profile incidents involving the likes of Marcus Rashford disappearing on holiday when not picked for England, a ban has been imposed by Amorim that prohibits players from jetting off if their nation doesn't select them.",
      "The manager's thought behind such a ban is based on rest and limiting travel. He spoke out about the standards the club must keep, which have slipped before, when this change was introduced.",
      "Amorim said: \"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It's my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly.",
      "\"This is something that us as a club have to decide,\" he continued. \"So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Another rule that aims to bolster physical fitness is a ban on bringing food into the dressing room on matchdays. This was introduced as part of a push on elite conditioning.",
      "This order was revealed last December, when Amorim was asked about his squad's fitness and made a telling statement regarding physical fitness.",
      "\"You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won't win,\" he stated in December of 2024. \"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won't win.\"",
      "A new rule that has been introduced ahead of this season is one that aims to foster accountability. When the team splits into two sides during a training ground match, the losing side must pick up all of the equipment.",
      "This was installed after United's dismal 15th-place finish last campaign and players have spoken out about it and a significant rise in standards.",
      "Speaking about the rule, on-loan United youngster Toby Collyer told The Athletic: \"Everyone wants to be the team that wins. You don't have to get the gear in then. It's a jeopardy if you lose! All the other teams have to get the gear in.\"",
      "Diogo Dalot also added that pre-season standards have risen compared to last year, hinting earlier in August that the new rule may be working. He said: \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you.\"",
      "During his first few weeks at the club Amorim made it crystal clear that his coaches were not to give overly complex instructions to his players. This was done in order to ease communication.",
      "He had aimed to bring with him the style he adopted at Sporting CP, which was intricate and involved specific players knowing and playing their particular roles.",
      "And by not having coaches bog players down with difficult-to-understand orders, they can learn their roles perfectly and act with instruction on the pitch.",

      "Lammens was not intimated by the Anfield atmosphere and played a crucial role in a special victory, making some important saves and releasing pressure with his goal kicks.",
      "\"I think it was like ten seasons ago we won here [in 2016], so you can feel it as well with the fans. This atmosphere was one of the biggest games I was looking forward to when I came here, so I'm so happy we could win today.\"",
      "Lammens was asked whether it was the biggest came of his career. \"Yeah, it has to be, I'm not even close, I think,\" he said, before explaining his approach was more or less the same as every other game.",
      "\"I think you just try to be like yourself, don't really overthink it, it's just a game, to be honest, at the end of the day. Just in my preparation, the same as usual. I concentrate on the pitch.",
      "\"Not really looking or hearing what's going on outside of the pitch, and I think with this team today, how we fought, it feels so good that we got what we deserved, I think. So it's really good today.\"",
      "Mason Mount praised Lammens for releasing pressure with his long kicks after the Sunderland win, and the approach was hugely effective against Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"We know how they press, they're gonna go man-vs-man, so I think being realistic, coming into Anfield, it's quite difficult to build up, I think, so from the beginning on with the defenders, I think I made the decision that we should get more of a long ball and do it with the second ball,\" Lammens said.",
      "\"Even though we didn't really have a target striker. But I think even though we didn't have one, the second ball we did quite good, so that's how we could still push them away, and how we also scored the first one, I think, it was because of the long ball, second ball and then a counter.\"",
      "When asked if that was his own decision, he said: \"No, it's also the team, the coach, they try to give you as much information as they can, but yeah, you have to be realistic as well, especially in the beginning of the game, if it really works like this, then you should just stay with this tactic, and I think today it worked out.\"",
      "Lammens continued: \"Like I said, it was ten seasons ago since we win in here, so that's kind of special, and also, I don't know for sure, but two [league wins] in a row is also something we've been looking forward to, to get the momentum going.",
      "\"I think that was a big part of what the coach showed us this season, get the momentum going, and there's been quite some disappointments this season, some games that we wanted to take momentum but we couldn't, and I think today could be a start of a good momentum, and we should next week at home as well (against Brighton), so with the fans behind us we should try to win that game as well.\"",
      "United showed immense character to score a winner after an equaliser from Cody Gakpo. \"Yeah, I've not been here a long time, but you can feel it. With the team, we've all got players who are really experienced, and we know that even if they score we've still got a chance,\" he said.",
      "\"I think last year as well and this season we scored some goals after the opponent scored, so we knew with the crosses on Harry [Maguire] and stuff, he scored quite a lot of them.",
      "\"So you never want a game like this, but especially defending in the last 20 minutes, defending the box and how we throw ourselves in front of the ball, also the players who came in, it's not difficult in this environment, and the type of game it was, so I'm really proud of the team today.\"",
      "Asked about shutting out the noise, he responded: \"Yeah, I try my hardest, I think I'm quite OK at this, trying to keep the noise out from outside, like I said, just prepare the same way as I've always done, treat it like any other game, of course you have to be realistic, it's not like any other game.",
      "\"But you still try to prepare like this, and I think just from the first minute on you be realistic, and like I said with the game plan we did as well, I think we executed it quite good, so we knew before the game it was going to be really difficult, and we had to defend with 11 people, and we did, so it was really good.\"",
      "Discussing Ruben Amorim, Lammens said: \"For me, he's always the same, I haven't been here as long as I said before, so maybe it's different for other guys, but for me as a coach he gets a lot of pressure.",
      "\"You can feel it from the outside, you can read it, you can hear it, but I think he does his best, and he does really good, try to keep the pressure on him and not on the team, he takes a lot of the pressure from us, and that's also what the great managers do.\"",
      "Lammens' life has changed dramatically since moving to Old Trafford. \"Of course from the outside I try to keep my best friends close, my family and the rest is a little bit like outside noise, now I'm doing good. So it's all praise, I know, and I'm realistic, if it goes not so good it will be all bad commentary,\" he said.",
      "\"I think my social media has exploded, but they told me before the transfer, I already knew it a little bit, but it's just a really good feeling that you get the praise, also with the wins, it's a really nice feeling.",
      "\"It's [Manchester] really nice, I've been in my apartment now a couple of weeks, so it's quite easy.\"",
      "Will Lammens celebrate the victory? \"I think I'm going to go quite easy tonight,\" he smiled. \"One of my best mates is here, so I'm going to spend the evening with him a little bit, enjoy this.",
      "\"But I think we've tasted it and now we want more, that's the most important, so this is not the end station, so now we just have to keep going.\"",

      "Diogo Dalot could feel \"positive energy\" in Manchester United training in the days leading up to the Liverpool game.",
      "Ruben Amorim became the first United manager since Louis van Gaal to win at Anfield, and the victory meant he claimed back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time.",
      "Amorim granted additional time off for the players who had been travelling for international duty or trained throughout the break, meaning United had just a few days to prepare with a full squad to face Liverpool.",
      "That didn't prevent United from securing the biggest win of Amorim's tenure at Anfield.",
      "\"To be honest, it's hard, especially when you come from the national team to prepare for a game like this,\" said Dalot after the game. \"You have the full squad for two or three days, no more than that, but the lads who stayed... and the last few days we had were really good.",
      "\"Even the players who were not going to start, you could feel the energy and the positive energy they were giving to those who were going to start, because at any moment they can be important.",
      "\"You saw the substitutes, they came on and they had to help us defend the game and go after the result again. I'm really proud of everyone, the boys and everyone involved.\"",
      "Dalot continued: \"You can imagine the feeling inside the dressing room, it took me eight years to win at Anfield, so obviously really proud of everyone involved, the players, the staff, everybody on the bench. Great feeling, a beautiful day for us and the fans. Everybody has to enjoy today.\"",
      "When asked if it was one of the biggest wins of his time at the club, Dalot said: \"Probably, yeah, I could say so because of the moment, the pressure that everyone created on us to have back-to-back wins, coming here against a team that was going through a difficult phase.",
      "\"So a game like today can go both ways. The team that wins today will come on top, so very important for us, but again, I don't want to get too carried away because next week we have to keep going.",
      "\"At a club like this, you're always expecting two, three or four wins in a row. It was important for us to know we're capable of doing it. We know already, but we needed to prove it on the pitch and to do it against a team like Liverpool, there is no better way for a Man United fan, a Man United player, to do that.",
      "\"So really happy. Today is a very good day for the club. We've been through a lot, some difficulties, but today is to enjoy.\"",
      "Dalot added: \"It's part of our job [to deal with outside noise], I've been here long enough to understand everyone will have opinions, everyone will have something to say about Man United.",
      "\"You just have to be ready for that. You're playing for the biggest club in the world and you need to be ready to have bad opinions about you, good opinions about yourself.",
      "\"But it's the way you show it, the way you work every day, sometimes, especially this season, we've been doing really good in training at Carrington, but then the results are not coming on.",
      "\"But that's what everybody sees. They don't see what you do every day. So ultimately, they will judge what you do on the pitch on the weekend, and we have to win games, that has to be the mindset.\"",

      "Amorim won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time as United boss, emerging with a victory in Merseyside after a late headed goal from Maguire.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo drew first blood when he opened the scoring within two minutes. Liverpool pushed hard to score an equaliser and finally found a breakthrough thanks to Cody Gakpo in the 78th minute.",
      "Gakpo struck the post three times before finding the back of the net. The noise at Anfield increased, sensing the prospect of a late winner, but it was United who scored next to seal an away victory.",
      "Maguire headed brilliantly beyond Giorgi Mamardashvili and received praise from Amorim when the United boss spoke at his post-match press conference. \"It is really important and we have a club that has a lot of pressure,\" said Amorim about the defender's mental strength.",
      "\"It's not easy to play here, but all of them have an opportunity to play for us and then they leave and life is like that. Harry Maguire is really important for us and was today. He is a great example, everything he has been through, a great example of every kid.\"",
      "Maguire was recalled to the starting team against Liverpool - with Leny Yoro dropped to the bench - after losing his place against Sunderland before the international break.",
      "Lammens built on a confident debut against the Black Cats to make important saves at Anfield.",
      "\"He was really important and then sometimes it is a little bit of luck. Two shots on the post, that can change the narrative but he show a lot of character, a lot of quality,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim was asked about Amad next and responded: \"Amad is doing so well in that position [right wing-back], he was perfect for that position. He was upset when I made the sub, but he had a yellow card, if not he will continue in the game, he struggled these weeks but we are here for him.\"",

      "Manchester United supporters have had too many disappointing journeys home on the M62 in the last decade but not on Sunday night.",
      "The Reds were good value for their 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. Bryan Mbeumo set the tone early as he fired home thanks to an excellent Amad through ball. Cody Gakpo hit the post twice in the first half and again in the second before his luck eventually turned. He scored from close range to level proceedings and the momentum looked to have turned.",
      "But up stepped Harry Maguire. He rose highest at the back stick to divert Bruno Fernandes' cross in and spark jubilant scenes in the away end.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at some moments you may have missed from the game:",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Maguire reaction speaks volumes",
      "The long-lasting image in the minds of United fans after that victory will be of Maguire with his arms aloft being adored by the travelling contingent. However, a more important image was the centre-back repeatedly thumping the badge after the game.",
      "For too long United have been accused of having some players in their ranks who don't show the commitment expected of the fans. Maguire isn't one of those players and the Reds should ensure that a new contract is prepared for him.",
      "Slot confusion",
      "With the benefit of hindsight, Ruben Amorim mastered Arne Slot before a ball was even kicked. There were a couple of positions up for grabs heading into the game but few thought that Benjamin Sesko would be dropped.",
      "The decision even caught Slot by surprise as shown in his pre-match interview. He was left guessing when asked how United would line up in the forward area and that confusion paid dividends inside two minutes as the Reds scored on their first attack.",
      "Schmeichel transfers his powers",
      "As United's players exited the team bus at Anfield, Senne Lammens was greeted by Peter Schmeichel who gave the Belgian a big hug.",
      "Lammens oozed confidence between the sticks and he was not worn down by the intimidating atmosphere at Anfield. Amorim said the goalkeeper was not Schmeichel yet but the away end reinvigorated that chant again in the first half when he stood up to Alexander Isak and made a huge save.",
      "Two legends",
      "It was a blood-and-thunder atmosphere at Anfield and there was no love lost on the pitch. But in the stands, two club legends managed to move rivalries to one side to enjoy some Chocolate Buttons.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Kenny Dalglish shared a snack at half-time. Whether Ferguson would have shared his chocolate if United were losing at the break, we will never know.",

      "Harry Maguire scored the winning goal, heading home Bruno Fernandes’ cross with six minutes to play to spark joyous celebrations on the pitch and in the away end.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo had given the visitors the lead inside the opening two minutes before Cody Gakpo brought the score level after 78 minutes. The win comes amid fresh takeover speculation in the last week, with claims that David Beckham and Eric Cantona have been approached to back a bid by a consortium from the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes has described Harry Maguire's winning goal as a sloppy one for his side to concede.",
      "He said: \"I think we conceded a very sloppy second goal. We worked so hard to get back into the game and we created great opportunities to score the winner but if you concede a second goal like that, that is the disappointing part.",
      "\"If you look at the game as a whole, we were far too rushed. I think they were very patient they didn't press us high but they didn't let us on the ball. We still created many opportunities to score but the reality is that we lost.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes believes Manchester United's first-half performance at Anfield resulted in Liverpool supporters turning on their side.",
      "The win was United's first at Anfield since 2016 and gave head coach Ruben Amorim back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since arriving last November. Bryan Mbeumo fired his side ahead after just 63 seconds before Cody Gakpo restored parity 12 minutes from time.",
      "However, United were excellent during the first-half and had numerous opportunities to double their lead. And Fernandes has claimed his side's approach to the game resulted in some Liverpool supporters turning on their side. He said:",
      "It's always good to win games. We know what this kind of games means for our club and fans and also for ourselves in the moment we are right now. It's really important because we needed three points.",
      "We know what it means for the fans and for the club to play this kind of rivalry. It's been a long time since the club won at Anfield. It's very important and happy to do it today.",
      "We knew we had to win our duels. In the first 10 to 15 minutes, we knew they would try to start the game very strong.",
      "During the first half, we knew they were under pressure when they had time on the ball. Their fans were putting themselves in a difficult position because they were booing a little for them to play a bit quicker. That's how Liverpool likes to play.",
      "Manchester United could financially benefit again from the sale of Mason Greenwood - more than a year after he left the club.",
      "The forward joined Marseille in the summer of 2024 with United receiving a fee rising to £26.6 million. As part of the deal, United added in 50% a sell-on clause.",
      "Should Greenwood move on from Marseille any time, it means that United could be due a sizeable sum of money. The player was linked with a move away in the summer transfer window with clubs in Saudi Arabia interested, but he remained with the French side.",
      "Barcelona are now the latest club said to be keeping an eye on the player. TBR Football report that scouts were in attendance to watch Greenwood in Marseille’s 6-2 win over Le Havre on Saturday.",
      "Greenwood would have impressed those watching on, scoring no fewer four of his team’s six goals. The scouting trip comes as Barcelona assess their forward options ahead of next summer.",
      "Dermot Gallagher has backed referee Michael Oliver's decision not to halt play ahead of Manchester United's opening goal against Liverpool at Anfield. The incident occurred just before Bryan Mbeumo broke the deadlock.",
      "Bruno Fernandes intercepted a lax header from Virgil van Dijk, who collided with Alexis Mac Allister while jumping to win a header. The Liverpool midfielder fell to the ground in a heap, but Michael Oliver allowed play to continue.",
      "Gallagher said:",
      "Is there a foul? No, because it's Van Dijk who comes in behind Mac Allister. Michael Oliver assesses it and says 'no foul' and play goes on very quickly.",
      "He's forced to break with and so is the assistant, so neither see Mac Allister behind them. Within five seconds, the ball is in the net. The first time they see Mac Allister down, the ball is in the net so they can go back. It's just an unfortunate incident.",
      "Harry Maguire's winning goal for Manchester United against Liverpool came a few days after Paul Scholes said he was \"not athletic enough.\" Maguire, 32, rose above the Merseysiders' backline and directed Bruno Fernandes' lofted volley back across Giorgi Mamardashvili and into the far corner.",
      "In the build-up to United's trip to Anfield, Scholes said Maguire, Luke Shaw and Casemiro are no longer physically up for the task and below Premier League level.",
      "However, Amorim clearly doesn't see it that way, with Shaw, Casemiro and Maguire all starting against Arne Slot's side. Maguire was the only one out of the trio to play the full 90 minutes, with Casemiro making way for Manuel Ugarte and Shaw coming off for Leny Yoro.",
      "Eric Cantona has been mentioned in the latest Manchester United takeover claim following fresh investment talk from the Middle East. The Glazer family recently opened the door to outside funding with Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquiring a minority stake in the club last year.",
      "Even though he only recently made an investment, takeover rumours were sparked over the international break when Saudi official Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for United. He was later forced to clarify that he was not the potential investor, with talkSPORT stating the belief was they are UAE-based.",
      "Their report added that some United legends had been approached over being involved in any potential bid, with some clarity on exactly that and specifically one name that was approached, being revealed.",
      "According to The Guardian, Cantona has held talks over potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him back a prospective consortium in a bid for United. Other former players have also been contacted.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee showed his true colours following Manchester United's 2-1 win over Liverpool. The 24-year-old striker, who has recently been linked with a move away, was one of the first players to celebrate the victory at Anfield on Sunday evening.",
      "Despite being an unused substitute, Zirkzee squashed suggestions that he's unhappy when he darted onto the pitch at full-time. As the Netherlands international approached his teammates, Bruno Fernandes jokingly tried to put him in a headlock before bumping chests with Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "One fan wrote on X wrote: \"Love the guy. I feel bad that he's not playing more but that's the situation we're in. Hopefully we can string together a few wins/momentum and he'll be able to get more minutes. He's a joy to watch.\"",

      "While the £80million man dominated the headlines, Shaw also put in an outstanding display on the left-side of Ruben Amorim's back three. Injuries have troubled the ex-Southampton star for many years, but he reminded his fans and critics of his quality.",
      "Paul Scholes recently claimed he was not athletic enough to star for United a matter of days before the game. After the match, McTominay praised Shaw's display on social media.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Scot took to Instagram and made a three-word comment, saying: \"What a player\" beneath Shaw's Instagram post.",
      "Shaw started the match and was substituted in the 85th minute for Leny Yoro, as Liverpool looked to get more crosses into the box. It was a brilliant evening for Shaw and the rest of their players, who had to withstand numerous Liverpool attacks in the final moments of the clash",
      "Unfortunately for McTominay, it was not a great weekend for him and his Napoli team-mates. The Scot picked up an injury before the contest and had to watch on from the side-lines as his team-mates were beaten 1-0 by Torino, in what was their second league loss this season.",
      "Their defeat saw them slip down to third position, where they are trailing league leaders AC Milan by one point. Meanwhile, Amorim was chuffed with his side's display, having recorded one of his biggest wins at the club.",
      "It also meant they had put together back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time under his premiership. In his post-match interview, the Portuguese boss said: \"Every day is special [as United boss].",
      "\"But this was a very special win. To see our fans singing during the game, in a moment that the biggest rivals are champions, on their field and at their stadium, this win is all about our fans and the spirit of the team.",
      "\"I believe we can play so much better. We will analyse the game in the same way we analyse the other ones, try to see the good things and bad things. But, for me, the togetherness they [the players] showed during this game, that is special for me.\"",
      "The result lifted United into the top half of the table. After losing three of their opening six matches, their brace of Premier League victories means they are only two points of the top four.",

      "Baleba marked the Seagulls' win over Newcastle United on Saturday with a celebratory post on Instagram. Captioning a selection of pictures from the match at the Amex Stadium, the Cameroon international wrote: \"Good team win and I’m feeling like myself again. #areyouabaleba.\"",
      "Leny Yoro and Andre Onana were among the thousands people to 'like' the post. Baleba had a shaky start to the season, with Fabian Hurzeler publicly calling on him to improve his performances, but he caught the eye on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of the Magpies clash, the Brighton boss urged him to 'step up and show personality'. Hurzeler said: \"I think we’re getting to a time now where it's up to him, where he has to take responsibility as well.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"He can't change the noise around him, he's a player for Brighton. No matter what the rumours are, he will be a player for Brighton until [at least] the end of the season. But now he has to take responsibility.",
      "\"Now he has to make a step up and show personality, that's his next step in his personal development for sure. Like I said in the last weeks, there are waves in development, but you can only get out of it if you take ownership and if you take responsibility, there are some moments where nobody can help you.",
      "\"You have to be your own support, your own help. He has the best environment here he can get, he has great teammates who are there for him and support him.",
      "\"But now it's also up to the player that he steps up, that he shows personality and takes ownership of his development. That’s what I demand from him in the future.\"",
      "Tony Bloom recently commented on Baleba's future, confirming that United were in fact interested in wrapping up a deal. Speaking to The Argus, the Seagulls' owner said: \"I don’t think Baleba was a saga.",
      "\"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past.",
      "\"But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",
      "It's also understood that United did not consider strengthening their midfield as a priority, hence the arrival three marquee forwards: Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Baleba remained at the Amex Stadium, but the Reds appear set to go again and try and sign the player.",

It was deep into the second half when Cody Gakpo levelled, but a trademark Harry Maguire header shortly afterwards won the three points for United.",
      "Amorim entrusted Senne Lammens with a second start in goal ahead of Altay Bayindir, after an assured debut against Sunderland. The young Belgian keeper looked calm once again in the most high-profile match of his career to date, making a case to continue as the No. 1.",
      "Some fans think that Lammens is exactly the transfer that Manchester United needed to make this summer. Reader Tt84 says: \"Lammens is the signing we have been missing, isn't he? I know it has only been 2 games, and that he is a young lad and will no doubt make mistakes.",
      "\"But he is organising the defence, they are listening to him, he is doing his job. A solid line of defence with a solid keeper behind them - we have been missing that.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Commenter Noni87 agrees: \"The difference a reliable keeper makes to everyone's confidence is immeasurable. I'm not saying he's the best keeper in the world or anything like that, but him being solid in goals makes us more solid throughout. This win doesn't change everything that has happened over the past year, but it can be the starting point if we push on now.\"",
      "Brav3339 writes: \"I was reading about Lammens recently. His old coaches were saying how calm he is at all time. He faced the firestorm of Anfield and was totally unfazed by it. He brings calm to the defence which the previous two had not done. Early days of course, but he looks like an absolute bargain so far!\"",
      "Faimu says: \"I have said many times that everything start from the keeper, and this time we got it right. Those constant long ball took the pressure out of the defence.\"",
      "FreddiePayne writes: \"Nice to see a confident keeper for a change, he’s off to a good start. Defenders look way more comfortable with him back there, and he can catch the ball too!",
      "\"Maguire was Man Of The Match, not only for his winning goal, but his really strong performance overall. De Ligt was really good too. For me, our worst performer was Bruno. Gave away the ball so often there. He’s not suited for that midfield role. He should be further forward where he’s at his best.\"",
      "Fayfromalgeria says: \"Cunha deserves more — he managed to hold onto the ball at crucial moments and in difficult situations. I can’t wait for his first goal; it’s coming soon. He, Mbeumo, and Šeško are going to be devastating this season. And having a reliable goalkeeper behind them changes the whole dynamic.\"",

      "As he has done on a number of occasions in recent years, Maguire rose highest to spark jubilant scenes as United bagged a memorable victory at the home of their rivals.",
      "It perhaps wasn't so much Maguire's inclusion that had fans talking after the team news had dropped but more the omission of the player he had replaced. Leny Yoro has quietly gone about becoming arguably United's best defender yet the Frenchman had to make do with a place on the bench in a game that could well prove to be a turning point in United's season.",
      "Amorim cited set pieces as the reason behind Maguire's inclusion and the decision to start United's former captain was vindicated. Not only did Maguire play brilliantly at Anfield, his late header ensured United left Anfield with all three points for the first time since the Louis van Gaal era.",
      "The Sky sports cameras gave a rare insight into the United dressing room shortly after Maguire had addressed the media for his post-match interview. The 32-year-old received rapturous applause from his teammates as he entered the dressing room, with a warm embrace from Bruno Fernandes and Matthijs de Ligt.",

      "Turki Al-Sheikh initially claimed that discussions had started with a potential bidder, later clarifying that it was not Saudi Arabia showing interest. Now, an undisclosed consortium from the UAE is reportedly gearing up to make an offer for the Glazer family's majority shares.",
      "They want Beckham to act as an ambassador for the bid, rather than support it with his substantial wealth. Beckham has accumulated a significant fortune from his time on the pitch and his ventures off it.",
      "He currently holds stakes in both Inter Miami and Salford City. The Englishman's net worth is reportedly around £300million. Beckham hung up his boots in 2013 while playing for PSG, and by the time he retired, Business Insider reports he had earned a staggering £580m.",
      "At one point, he was the highest-paid player worldwide, and the groundbreaking five-year contract he signed with LA Galaxy in 2008 would be worth approximately £190m in today's money.",
      "However, the 50-year-old has added to his wealth through various endorsements and brand deals. Beckham has collaborated with brands such as Emporio Armani, Gillette, PepsiCo, H&M, Breitling and Adidas.",
      "Over the years, Beckham has also lent his name to various products, including his own fragrance line, video games, and a range of signature sunglasses.",
      "A Netflix documentary bearing his name, which aired in 2023, reportedly netted him a cool £20m. In that same year, he pulled in just over £72m from various products and brand deals.",

      "Manuel Ugarte was not included in the Uruguay squad and he is fresh in comparison. Amorim hinted that Casemiro could be rested during his press conference, but he should start if he is physically ready to play. Ugarte has been disappointing, albeit he did emerge with credit from the first half against Manchester City.",
      "I prefer Harry Maguire on the left side of the back-three, while I would also bring Patrick Dorgu into the side at the expense of Amad. Liverpool have superb attacking quality and starting 'defenders' at wing-back is logical.",

      "Manchester United visit Liverpool on Sunday with Ruben Amorim looking to record back-to-back Premier League victories.",
      "The head coach has yet to win back-to-back games in the league at United. When picking his team this weekend, Amorim will surely not hesitate in keeping Senne Lammens in goal. The Belgian oozed confidence between the sticks against Sunderland and that reassurance will be vital on Sunday.",
      "The back three is unlikely to change considering how stable it seemed against the Black Cats but there could be alterations to the wing-backs. Amad, who started against Sunderland, may drop to the bench due to the attacking threats that Liverpool pose.",
      "Instead, Diogo Dalot could switch from the left flank to his more favoured right with Patrick Dorgu filling in on the other side. Should Casemiro come through his back-to-back 90 minutes for Brazil unscathed, he could partner Bruno Fernandes in the centre.",
      "This of course means no place for Kobbie Mainoo once again in the United starting line-up. Mainoo has yet to start in the Premier League this season.",
      "In the front three, we can expect to see Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko joined by Mason Mount. Mount's determination and commitment to the team can never be questioned and if he remains injury free, he could play a key role under Amorim.",
      "Predicted XI: Lammens; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Mount; Sesko",

It isn't a light switch. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",

      "When former Blackburn Rovers academy coach Mike Sheron first became aware of Adam Wharton, the midfielder was just 12 years old and while it was far too early to make a judgement on what type of player he would become, there were already hints of the talent he possessed.",
      "\"I have been in and around Adam on a daily basis throughout his time at Blackburn,\" Sheron told MEN Sport this week. \"He has always been a fairly quiet young lad but he had an inner confidence about himself.",
      "\"He had a velvet touch, straightaway you were drawn to his ability to control a football and he used his body particularly well. His weight of pass was exceptional and as he got older you became more critical on how to build your team and you just had to go through him.",
      "\"He would never give the ball away, nine times out of ten he was picking the right pass out and it has been a joy watching him develop, it has been brilliant this last 18 months to see what he has been doing.\"",
      "When Palace paid £18million for Wharton in the 2024 mid-season transfer window, he was relatively unknown to most in the Premier League bubble, but at Ewood Park he had already become a firm fan favourite.",
      "Wharton grew up in a Blackburn-mad household with an incredibly supportive family and network surrounding him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reminiscing over one particular trip to Middlesbrough, it was easy to see why Sheron holds Wharton in such high esteem. \"From our point of view, as coaches, if you had a flaw in your set-up, in your session design, he would find it and he would exploit it,\" the 53-year-old who departed Blackburn in September explained.",
      "\"He would always find a solution to increase his chances of winning for his team and he made you a better coach as well, not just influencing the players around him, he made you a better coach and it was really enthralling to work around him. It is definitely rare [for a player to better you when you're a coach] and it is not something that you come across too often.",
      "\"I felt, as a coach, you never had to give him too many details, he would just figure it out for himself. Like everything else, there is more than one way to do things, so you don’t tell him what to do, you give him a broad landscape of: ‘This is the way that we are wanting to try and do things today, but overall it is down to yourselves how you go about it’.",
      "\"One story I do have of him is that we went to a day event at Middlesbrough, an Under-14s player-led tournament. Basically, all of the players would pick the teams, come up with the tactics and we just had to watch from afar.",
      "\"We actually went with an Under-13s set-up because we knew our group at the time at Under-13s was very good. It was Adam’s group, which also had Harry Leonard who is now at Peterborough and Kristi Montgomery who is in and around the first-team now, and they did exceptionally well, but I think Adam, again, was pivotal and was a major factor in us winning that tournament that day.",
      "\"He had that quiet leadership, he doesn’t shout, he doesn’t dictate but he has that inner belief about what he is doing and how to be successful. A lot of the time, he was right.",
      "\"He didn’t agree with everything that you would tell him, you would sometimes criticise his work ethic but he didn’t expend a lot of energy if he didn’t have to, and he was quite good at that. You see him doing elements of that now.",
      "\"You don’t see him running around everywhere, he just gets himself into good positions, he reads the game and that technical ability has ensured he has done fantastically well.\"",
      "A common theme of the conversation about Wharton was the midfielder's 'inner confidence and belief'.",
      "Wharton never needs to be the loudest voice in the room but he knows he can influence players and the game with his own ability. Sheron spoke with pride when remembering how Declan Rice and Harry Kane spoke so glowingly of him after his first England appearance.",
      "When quizzed about Wharton's best position in the midfield pivot, Sheron, who also worked in the youth set-up at Liverpool, insisted that the England international has the ability to suit whichever role the manager needs at any given time - even comparing him to a United favourite. \"Personally, I always felt he was best suited in and around the No.6 role,\" he continued.",
      "\"I like how they have done it at Palace as a lot of the time he is in with a Will Hughes or he is in with another player and there are two sitters. But in a team that is dominating possession, I don’t think there is much of a problem if he is the single pivot.",
      "\"His composure on the ball is second to none, he hardly ever gives the ball away, he can use both feet, read situations, he is so intelligent with his positioning to intercept but it has been a shock to see how well he is doing because you just never know.",
      "\"His game has really gone to the next level around more dynamic players and I would have him down as someone like a Michael Carrick who is really football-intelligent and composed, it really has been a joy to watch him develop.\"",
      "Such a talented player is exactly what United need to mix up their midfield next summer. The midfield department went untouched this previous window as focus gravitated towards the attack.",
      "The concern for the Reds is whether they would be able to attract Wharton without necessarily having the Champions League football which Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish suggested he would crave in the future. Fortunately for the Reds, Sheron believes that an immediate move to a Champions League club is not necessarily the be-all and end-all at this stage.",
      "\"We are all aware of United’s standing in the game and the frustrations they have had in the last couple of years, but who would have thought that going to Crystal Palace would have been a fantastic move?\" Sheron said.",
      "\"If a team sells the club to him and his family and advisors, and he feels that it is the right move for him, then I don’t think it is a case of him needing to go to Manchester City or Liverpool or Arsenal, I think it is a case of whether he gets the vibes that he is going to be valued, be a big part of the team going forward and we all know the animal that Manchester United can become. So I wouldn’t say it is a yes or a no on United, but rather whether the move is the right fit for him.",
      "\"I would put my faith in Adam, who has made a few good decisions, to make the right decision and if he thinks Manchester United is the right fit then it will be. Adam will make other players play better and other players will get their confidence up playing with him.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Matheus Cunha and Amad were among the players to miss full training, albeit club sources confirmed some of the absentees completed recovery work.",
      "Casemiro was absent from training because he played 90 minutes in away friendlies for Brazil against South Korea and Japan during the break. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will not be on Amorim's Christmas card list.",
      "Casemiro would have been a nailed-on starter against Liverpool, but his workload during the break raises questions over how ready he will be to start.",
      "It seems unlikely that Amorim will start the 33-year-old against Liverpool, given he has trekked halfway around the world to Asia and played the entirety of both friendly matches.",
      "That means Manuel Ugarte will be under consideration to start at Anfield. Ugarte was not included in the Uruguay squad for the international break and will be fresh compared to Casemiro.",
      "Ugarte was also a surprise starter against Manchester City when domestic football resumed following the September international break. He had last been seen on a pitch in the defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Casemiro was named on the bench against City and Ugarte performed well in the first half, although he didn't cover himself in glory when he made his next start against Brentford.",
      "Ugarte was expected to be a big winner from Amorim's appointment because he had thrived when they worked together at Sporting Lisbon, however, he has been unable to earn a consistent starting role.",
      "It did not reflect well on Ugarte that United looked at midfielders of his ilk in the summer transfer window.",
      "Ugarte was signed for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, in the summer of 2024, and United have already conceded they need a new signing in the same mould.",
      "Fernandes and Ugarte are the most likely midfield partnership at Anfield. Ugarte does not inspire confidence, but his performance at Anfield in January should provide some encouragement ahead of Sunday's clash.",
      "Ugarte started alongside Kobbie Mainoo in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at the beginning of the year. The pair worked brilliantly together and Ugarte looked like the player United thought they were signing.",
      "Perhaps another start at Anfield will spark another improved performance from Ugarte.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Man Utd legend Dwight Yorke reckons Ruben Amorim’s side can start looking towards a possible top-six finish after beating Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "The Red Devils won at Anfield for the first time since 2016 with Amorim victorious in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since taking over last season.",
      "Amorim is still under pressure if he doesn’t keep up current form after picking up just 40 points from his first 35 Premier League matches in charge at Man Utd.",
      "And Yorke has now urged Man Utd and Amorim to build on their shock result on Merseyside and warned them not to now “fall back into the decline”.",
      "Reacting to the win over Man Utd, Yorke exclusively told Football365 on behalf of Escapist Magazine: “Massive win. I think a lot of people didn’t probably give United any chance of getting three points there, despite, you know, Liverpool not really being on song with the three defeats prior to that game. Man U getting the first win [at Anfield] for a while.",
      "“But it was never going to be an easy task with it at Anfield, we know that we haven’t won there in 10 years either, so the likelihood of getting the result, I think it was very slim. However, the boys have turned up and delivered another fantastic performance and a result that not too many people had given them a chance. And on top of that, winning two games back to back, which they haven’t been able to do. So it’s been a real uptick, and a lot of happy United fans including myself yesterday.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim, Slot, Man United, Liverpool, Arsenal and so many more",
      "“Is this the kind of result that can change United’s season? You should hope so, beating one of your rivals. We know the City derby is huge, but nothing like Liverpool. The history between those two clubs, and so you would have thought that will.",
      "“If that doesn’t give you the incentive and the additional confidence to go forward, I’m not so sure what will. So I hope that with this result and the back-to-back wins will then inspire the players that it can be done, and that will inspire them and give them the extra confidence going into the rest of the campaign.",
      "“The one thing they’ve got to be safeguarding against is the fact that after they win against Liverpool, everyone is coming after them, and you have to have a reaction for that. So what you can’t afford to allow to happen is getting these two good results, which are huge results against Liverpool, and then falling back into the decline. So it’ll be interesting.",
      "“All eyes will be on them the next game that they play. And you don’t want to make one step forward and two steps backwards. I hope they don’t fall into that old cliché one and get carried away and think that’s it and they could live on the back of just the Liverpool results. They need to kick on.”",
      "When asked what the target is for the rest of the season, Yorke added: “I think top four, it’s usually the usual standard. They’ve got to get back to the top six. Top four will be a remarkable return.",
      "“No one envisaged that, even myself, who is obviously a United fan. I’ll be happy with top six considering where we finished last season, because that’s an uptick. It’d be an uphill task. But what we see is that everybody can beat each other at any given time and United certainly can do that. But they gotta get back on a much more consistent base.",
      "“I always revert back to just beat the teams around you. Beat the teams who you are supposed to beat on paper. It’s when you’re getting beaten against those teams that it’s a bit worrying. We know they can produce these kinds of performances against Liverpool and City in the past, and you’ve got to roll your sleeves up and get results against the lesser teams.”",
      "Man Utd should make move to re-sign former Red Devils midfielder Paul Pogba as they can’t “afford not to consider a move”, according to Dwight Yorke."

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "As a United fan, that win at Anfield felt straight out of Blackadder. Amorim clearly pulled a Baldrick: score early, suffer bravely, then let Maguire deliver the punchline. Slot’s Liverpool had all the flair but none of the plot. If this is Amorim’s “cunning plan,” long may the chaos continue.",
      "Still, that opener came from a proper Van Dijk-led muddle — Mac Allister takes a heavy knock, play rolls on, and United pounce. Great for us, worrying for him. The kind of thing that should make the league review concussion protocols again. If that sort of head clash doesn’t stop play, then what’s the point of concussion protocols? Football can be gloriously daft, but not at the expense of someone’s memory.\nGaptoothfreak, Man. Utd., New York (Baldrick 1, Slot 0)",
      "",
      "My that was glorious. Just imagine the salty tears from all the Scousers who thought the league was wrapped up before a ball was even kicked, after signing Isak and Wirtz. Bring back Darwin!",
      "And take a bow Ruby – tactics, team and subs absolutely spot on.",
      "Simply marvellous.\nGarey Vance, MUFC",
      "",
      "There will be a lot of very happy United fans, and many Amorim fans pointing vigorously at the result and shouting “see!”. Well, maybe. And while 3 points is great, especially at Anfield, a sensible head will note that we could easily have conceded 4 if Gakpo and Salah didn’t seem to have been paid off. Honestly, Gakpo’s missed header near the end, you have to wonder how. While also worth noting United could have scored a couple more too with Bruno missing quite badly.",
      "Aside from that, Mbeumo continues to look lively, while Dalot and Maguire seemed intent to provide Liverpool with an in (I really enjoyed Dalot’s air shot mid first half). Thankfully, this is the worst Liverpool team in a long while so they got away with it.",
      "And finally two back to back wins for Amorim, in the most unexpected of settings. Now he just needs to reintegrate Mainoo, ditch Dalot for Dorgu and play Yoro instead of Maguire and we good.\nBadwolf",

      "",
      "Great win this weekend. Nice to have something to smile about!",
      "The last two games have really shown what a difference a reliable keeper makes. As keepers go he seems fine. Could be good, but most importantly he appears to be calm and unobtrusive. Does keeper stuff, gets the game going again, and the whole team seems more relaxed for it.",
      "Onwards and upwards!\nAkillies (Malawi)",
      "",
      "Bottle the tears of Liverpool fans whinging about the Amal ‘handball’ and the early play on call which lead to Mbeumo’s opener. They’re giving me life.",
      "Reds fans, you lost because you were t good enough on the day – not because a couple calls didn’t go your way. It wasn’t a penalty, the referee shouldn’t have stopped United’s attack post Van Dijk’s contact with Mac Allister, you didn’t play well enough to win the game. Accept it and move on.",

A Man U team consisting of Diego “The Portuguese Training Cone” Dalot, “Lead Legs” Casemiro, Luke “Old Sleepy Joe Permacrock” Shaw, and Harry “The Oil Tanker” Maguire, all while being managed by the worst performing Man U manager in decades.",
      "The Liverpool team meanwhile, were all players that played a significant part in winning the league last year, with the only exceptions being Milos “Best PL Left Back Last Year” Kirkez replacing Andy “Has Been” Robbo, and Alexander “Most Expensive PL Transfer Ever” Isak replacing Darwin “All Barn Doors Are Safe, Couldn’t Finish a Sandwich” Nunez.",

Especially after LFC supporters were writing in pre-season, proclaiming the new era for Liverpool was upon us and it was time to knock Real Madrid off their fckn perch because league titles weren’t ambitious enough. It really is too funny.",

      "A team losing a wonderful player needs to come together around that loss to work through it.  Instead team buys lots of new players who don’t feel the loss.  Wirtz may come good.  Isak and Kerkez should be sold immediately.  Ekitike is a god-damn star so play him as your #9 all the time.  Frimpong is different so just admit Bradley is a great backup and get used to Salah learning a new trick cutting inside (oh wait, that’s his main trick) as a space opens up like never before.  Or push your most lethal weapon out to the wing as the middle gets clogged up with the Wirtz-Isak sh*t sandwich.",

      "The fact that Sesko gets far more scrutiny than Isak and Wirtz combined says more about the bias coming from those who are supposed to be reporting objectively on the game than they really want.",
      "All its shows is that there is a LONG list of football writers, ex players, and pundits who everyone can easily name who still remain broken over United and the twenty six years of Sir Alex Ferguson.\nIsrael (not getting carried away, but its great to beat a rival) MUFC since 1977",
      "",
      "Does Slot ever stop moaning? Spent the entire international break crying about set pieces, is always moaning about opponents changing their line-ups (the audacity of opposition to adjust tactics against Liverpool!), loves going about how other teams play low block (it’s called defending, maybe Slot can learn what it is) and always has an excuse for why opposition goals / tactics are massively unfair for Liverpool.",
      "The cherry on top was him going about how Liverpool players couldn’t possibly fake head injuries and how the officials should have checked the badge on the shirt before making the decision, despite his own players taking each other out! Yes, because if it’s one thing Liverpool have lacked this season, it’s the officials not favoring them like letting Salah volley the ball into the net with his hands. Maybe if he actually had an ounce of integrity and believed in what he said, he should have made a concussion sub immediately instead of letting Alexis play on?",
      "What the 4 losses in a row has shown is how immensely soft Slot and this Liverpool squad is. The tiniest bit of pressure (most of that being self inflicted after spending HALF A BILLION of the king’s finest) has seen them panic. It shows what a massive fluke last season was where every team was decimated with injuries and Liverpool won by default by being able to field a mostly fit XI all year with Salah playing out of his mind on a contract year.",
      "This is a club that has been media darlings all year, avoiding all the noise that other clubs have to deal with and still spend most of their time and energy obsessed with other clubs instead of focusing on fixing their glaring weaknesses. Salah looks to be pulling a post contract Aubameyang, Isak looks like he’s never played in the league before, Kerkez can’t defend, Frimpong can’t start and Wirtz has been so poor its expected for him not to start Liverpool’s biggest game of the season despite being a British record breaking transfer! I guess that’s what ZERO G/A in ELEVEN games does.",
      "Liverpool losing on a set piece after denigrating them for weeks (despite having set pieces to thank for beating the league leaders and multiple other games) was justice done. The longer Slot keeps the excuses up instead of taking accountability like Arteta, the longer this spiral is going to continue.\n– Falooda in NY (more to defending than simply elbowing and kicking attackers)",

      "I don’t personally know any Liverpool fans complacent enough after winning the league to be spitting as much hatred out as I read in the mailbox today.",
      "There are obvious challenges but in the game I watched, Gakpo was millimetres away from a hat trick, a good performance from Szobs and our keeper did well, our subs Ekitike, Jones, Wirtz, Chiesa and Frimpong injected pace and threat.",
      "I don’t feel the need to have a dig at united, incredible first time volley from Bruno for their second goal.",
      "There is a lot to be hopeful about,(not so much the current defensive record, maybe, not even the league) but we might be a settling in period and a Guehi away from success. Hate LFC all you like but don’t pretend to be a Liverpool fan, that’s just a bit silly (even if it has taken 10 minutes out of my life that I am not getting back).\nDermot Kildare (ooh, I see what you did there, provoking a reaction out of me!)",

      "Dear Ed",
      "On another day Gakpost would have had a hat-trick against United, maybe even 5. We created the opportunities but we didn’t score them.",
      "We look like we need two weeks off to go train at Marbella and get some cohesion going. The problem is that the games continue coming. For Klopp, he found the solution by bringing TAA more central when we were in possession, halting the losses. Slot now needs to find solutions as well.",
      "Fortunately I can offer him a solution without needing to rip it all up. This would be my team for the next game:",

This man is the future of our defence.\nVVD – doesn’t trust Kerkez, so he’s overcompensating to the left. Which has an effect on Ibou’s positioning.\nRobbo – get him back in, what harm can it do.\nMacca – slowly getting back up to speed but very far off it at the moment.\nGravenberch – one of the few that has been excellent.\nSzoboszlai – wants to be captain. Let him play in the centre of the field.\nWirtz – has an excellent understanding with Frimpong, so put them both on the right.\nGakpo – between him and the Grav as our player of the season thus far.\nEkitike – should be starting while his form and fitness is clearly better than Isak’s.\nKerkez – looking lost at the moment. He’s still young, some time studying Robbo would do him well.\nSalah – should swallow his pride, work on his game, come back stronger. I love Mo but he needs to be benched.\nIsak – just looks angry at the moment. Shouting at Newcastle, shouting at Sweden. He’s earned his big move and now needs to start enjoying it.",

      "A stunning weekend for Manchester United and their manager, with victory in El Crisico plunging his opposite number at Liverpool into a deep and salty funk.",
      "Arsenal were big winners both from the Anfield silliness and their own pointedly unsilly approach to the game at Fulham, while Man City are now the Gunners’ biggest title rivals again.",
      "Elsewhere, Tottenham’s home form remains an absurdity, Sunderland grow ever giddier by the weekend, Leeds find themselves right back in the soup and then there’s Nottingham Forest. Bloody hell, lads.",
      "",
      "It was a huge win for Manchester United, but a bigger one for Ruben Amorim specifically. For the first time since the very earliest days of his United reign, back in the far-off dim and distant days of late 2024 where his biggest problem was Ed Sheeran gatecrashing post-match interviews for some reason, Amorim has one precious gift: time.",
      "For the first time all season he is not among the most conspicuously under-pressure managers, and not solely because all the other under-pressure managers have been sacked.",
      "Given the public backing he received during the darkest moments, this statement win is one that gives him plenty of cover.",
      "And even the league table now looks so much less appalling. It was easy, and fun, to joke about previous Man United corner-turning victories lifting them all the way to, say, 10th. But while they do remain in mid-table, that mid-table has become incredibly congested thanks to the weekend’s results at Anfield and elsewhere.",
      "Ninth place is still historically bad for Manchester United in the Premier League, but three points behind second place sounds a lot better.",
      "",
      "We are not about to go declaring a corner has been turned, because Manchester United have turned approximately 873 corners over the last 12 years under several different managers and always ended up back where they started. Or worse.",
      "But what a win. What a statement. What a header from Harry Maguire. And while finding themselves top of the table for results against top-half sides can be slightly misleading at this early stage of the season, it’s definitely a significant development for United.",
      "The wins against Chelsea and now Liverpool have shifted things significantly, because before that pair of wins there was a deeper misery to United’s miserable record under Amorim in that the few wins they were able to muster involved feeding on the Premier League’s very smallest beasts.",
      "Their miserable 24/25 return of 42 points actually masked just how bad they really were, with 16 of those points coming from six games against the three relegated teams who were, collectively, the worst group of relegated clubs in Premier League history.",
      "The fact United have won four games already this season is encouraging enough, given that low, low floor. But the fact two have come against Big Six opposition, along with a home win over Sunderland that seems far more compelling than those previous successes against promoted teams, and even the encouraging opening-day performance against Arsenal does hint that something might actually be changing for United.",
      "There are going to be more bumps in the road, they are far from perfect and, while they were impressive yesterday, it still felt very much like a game that owed more to Liverpool’s total and widespread headloss than particular excellence on United’s part, there are still suddenly so many more reasons to be cheerful. And for now, that will absolutely do.",
      "",
      "Brighton, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham. Game on.",
      "",
      "Arguably the biggest winners from the Anfield shenanigans, because the scale of the contrast between their controlled, repeatable, sustainable and, yes, wonderfully p*ss-boiling methods and Liverpool’s chaos means that this really does look like a stunning opportunity now for a team that has spent three years being very good indeed yet still ultimately the butt of all the jokes.",
      "This last laugh is going to be very loud indeed, and we will all just have to accept they and we deserve it.",
      "There is already a clear reduction in the kind of sloppiness that has held Arsenal back in the last couple of seasons, a greater resilience to getting themselves bogged down in nonsense. That feels like a particularly useful knack in a season where everyone else appears to be absolutely riddled with nonsense.",
      "For the clearest illustration of the difference between Arsenal this season and last, the results comparison is compelling. They have won their last three games – at Newcastle, at home to West Ham, and now at Fulham. They took one point from the same three fixtures last season.",
      "",
      "A bit like Manchester United in some ways, their win at Spurs felt like it owed at least as much to the weirdness of their opponents as their own endeavour, but it was still a hugely significant 2-1 away win that hints at brighter things to come.",
      "Spurs’ sh*tness was kind of the yin to Liverpool’s yang. Or the other way round, we don’t know. Essentially, Liverpool were guilty of being just far too wild and chaotic and Spurs were guilty of barely even engaging in the game at all after taking an early lead.",
      "Villa, like United, won’t give a shiny sh*te about how bad their opponents were and will instead delight in the upturn in their own fortunes.",
      "Their two goals at Spurs were both beautiful pieces of work and only a curmudgeon like, well, us would insist on pointing out they were enormously assisted by Spurs simply not really bothering to engage with any part of the process in either of those attacks by a Villa team that created little else but also didn’t need to.",
      "After failing to win any of their first six games in all competitions as the hangover from the disappointment at how last season ended lingered on, they have now won five in a row with an extremely presentable chance to make that six when they travel to Go Ahead Eagles in the Europa League on Thursday.",
      "It’s Manchester City and Liverpool after that, but for every reason those are now fixtures Villa can once again relish rather than dread.",

      "Liverpool head coach Arne Slot proved that he’s a salty Jurgen Klopp regen with two stupid comments about Manchester United on Sunday…",
      "Slot has been a media darling for most of his tenure at Liverpool and has been widely praised for his forthright assessments of games in front of cameras immediately after the final whistle.",
      "However, cracks in his image are starting to appear as pressure mounts on the Liverpool boss amid a dire run of four straight losses in all competitions.",
      "Liverpool’s mini-crisis before the international break turned into a full-blown crisis on Sunday afternoon as they were deservedly beaten 2-1 by arch-rivals Manchester United at Anfield.",
      "Subsequently, Wayne Rooney has raised a worrying change he’s seen in Slot, who has been showing similar character traits to his predecessor, Klopp, when on the end of a disappointing result.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "Klopp was the sorest of losers when things didn’t go his way and Slot stopped short of praising Man Utd by making daft comments about their playing style and Ruben Amorim’s decision regarding Benjamin Sesko.",
      "“If you play United – who come here with a low block and playing a lot of long balls and you know that is going to be difficult as it’s not easy to play through them and you don’t get the chance to win the ball high up – and you concede after one or two minutes, it makes it harder,” Slot said.",
      "“It’s always difficult to defend against a team that defends in a low block, that mainly plays long balls.",
      "“But it makes it even more difficult when you go 1-0 down after one minute when a player of ours is on the floor.",
      "“If you would have told me before the game that against the low block, against the team that plays so many long balls, we would have created as many chances as we did, I would not have expected us to lose this game of football.”",
      "READ: Slot ‘ain’t the guy’ – he’s a ‘d***head’ who can’t ‘manage his way out of this hole’ at Liverpool",
      "Before the game, Slot commented on Amorim’s decision not to start Sesko. He said: “We’ve seen Sesko play the last three, four, five or six times, but they go to Liverpool they change the line-up.",
      "“That’s not the first where we’ve faced a team and they’ve done that.”",
      "Starting with the long balls, Man Utd did play more than Liverpool (75-47) and their long pass proportion was 25.5% compared to 9.8% for their opponents.",
      "But this is only an issue in Slot’s mind because his team came up short, having been outsmarted by Amorim and his team.",
      "Put simply, Slot needs to focus on being better to quell the threat of Man Utd and other teams that have had success against Liverpool, with the Reds and their head coach made to look pretty inept by Amorim.",
      "According to Opta, Man Utd’s ratio of long passes against Liverpool was their highest since the 3-1 win over Arsenal in December 2017, so this was a tactic deployed to increase their chances of success at Anfield, which is also the case with the rotation of Sesko.",
      "Sesko being on the bench amid his strong form before the international break raised eyebrows, but this, like the focus on long passes, was an inspired decision from Amorim as Man Utd’s fluid and mobile front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount caused Liverpool’s fragile defence no end of problems.",
      "And Amorim is obviously within his rights to tinker with his XI from game-to-game to get the better of an opponent, which is exactly what happened against Liverpool and Slot.",

      "The report adds: ‘Manchester United let Mason Greenwood leave for Olympique Marseille in 2024 for around €26 million and retains a 50% release clause on his future sale.

      "Despite a sale elsewhere meaning Man Utd ‘would still receive a significant percentage thanks to his resale clause, they prefer to assume the cost now and gain full control of the player’.",
      "When asked whether Greenwood can become one of the world’s elite if he keeps up his current form, Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi replied: “It’s true that Mason can do more, not just in terms of goals scored because in that area he doesn’t need to do better. He’s already a top player in front of goal, but he can become one of the best players in the world, because he has the ability.",
      "“He can improve in helping the team when it needs it, when it’s necessary. But I want to protect Mason from criticism, he’s always scored a lot of goals and never missed a training session. But he still has room for improvement.”",
      "Previously speaking of Greenwood’s potential, De Zerbi said: “All the credit goes to his mother and father. And I’m here to help him become more complete. When he needs a hug, a word of support, I gladly give it. And when I need to push him to give more, I have to do that too because that’s my job.",
      "“I would especially like to help him be remembered, in this stadium and by these supporters, as one of the greatest players to have played here at the Velodrome. There have been so many great players here, but I think Greenwood has the qualities to be remembered that way. And I’m trying to help him progress.”",
      "De Zerbi continued: “If he wants to become a great player, he must run off the ball. I saw Mbappe, I saw Dembele pressing without the ball, and Greenwood has to do it too. He has worked on pressing, but not always. When he wants to, he does it, and he must understand that this effort is what separates the greats.”",

      "It’s a pretty high place on the list for someone currently only third in the league scoring lists among his own team-mates. Also feels quite weird that eight games into the season a mere two goals gets you in the top 20 for the entire division.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim edge away from crisis after a red-letter day at Anfield, while Liverpool plunge themselves deep into the mire",
      "A damaging defeat for Liverpool in more ways than one has left Arsenal looking more compelling Premier League favourites than ever, and leaves Man City as for now their likeliest and potentially quite soon only rivals.",
      "For Amorim, the gift of time. This was a win that dispels all sack talk, for at least a week.",
      "Let’s get into it.",
      "",
      "1. And there, almost a year into the job, it is. Ruben Amorim wins back-to-back Premier League games for the first time.",
      "Whimsy out of the way, let us now seriously consider what this means. At the start of this weekend Amorim was locked in a two-horse Sack Race with Ange Postecoglou. Postecoglou didn’t make it beyond Saturday afternoon, but Amorim has just bought himself considerable time.",
      "This was a wild and ridiculous game, to the point that one could argue it doesn’t necessarily mean anything in the grand scheme. Not everything means anything. Sometimes it’s just a bunch of stuff that happened. And at Anfield, a great big bunch of stuff happened.",
      "But in a frenzied and chaotic football match, United produced the majority of the composed and sane football and were good value for the win that looked to have escaped their grasp before Harry Maguire rose highest to head home the winner and leave Gary Neville and everyone else thoroughly spent.",
      "United are now two points behind Liverpool and a whisker away from fully handing over the crisis club mantle after winning a game some (okay, we) had dubbed El Crisico. United still require a greater number of less emotional and outlandish victories to prove there is something sustainable here, but while this isn’t a result that buys Amorim three years it is one that buys him a significant amount of time in which to work. At least until next week’s inevitable back-to-earth-with-a-bump home defeat to Brighton, anyway.",
      "",
      "2. For Liverpool, the crisis is no longer mini. If that sounds dramatic, it is nobody’s fault but theirs. They crisised themselves here with their frankly absurd approach to a second half of a game that remained very much there to be won – or at least not lost – by more conventional methods.",
      "Liverpool gave the game away – in every sense – with their breakneck, chaos-strewn approach to the second half. Every single one of the last 30 minutes was played like it was the last, and while we suppose Liverpool’s record in injury-time means there is some logic to playing more of the game as if it was in fact injury-time, it did all just look a little bit mad.",
      "Even if it had worked here – and had Cody Gakpo’s astonishingly interesting game in front of goal not ended with a header sent impossibly wide when a second equaliser appeared certain then it may well have done – it would still have ceded the title advantage further toward Arsenal.",
      "While the Gunners go about their business for now in a composed and thoroughly sustainable manner, Liverpool have become a team for whom the Hail Mary has become too regular and too early a choice from the playbook.",
      "",
      "3. There can be no doubt that Arne Slot is under pressure like never before at Liverpool after a third straight league defeat and fourth in all, and one in which his part can be significantly questioned. There was barely an hour on the clock when he went to a sh*t-or-bust 4-2-4 formation in which Florian Wirtz was, at least theoretically, one of the two central midfielders.",
      "That is not a play a title-winning team is making when one goal down with 30 minutes remaining at home against a mid-table team that had conceded 11 goals in its first seven league games of the season.",
      "If there was one word to describe Liverpool and their manager and their star players here it was this: rattled. From quite literally the very first minute.",
      "It is not a word generally linked to serious title contenders.",
      "",
      "4. And the worst thing for Liverpool is who the most rattled players were. It is not even particularly mischievous to suggest the two worst players on the pitch today were Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah.",
      "The two players more responsible than perhaps any others for the success the club has enjoyed over recent years both had absolute stinkers in the worst possible fixture.",
      "",
      "5. Van Dijk’s day to forget began in the very first minute. He made not one, not two, but three individual errors in the immediate build-up to United’s opening goal. Four if you count colliding with team-mate Alexis Mac Allister.",
      "A poor headed clearance and clattering of Bryan Mbeumo (and Mac Allister) was followed by a tackle attempt that registered as weak-to-non-existent on the tackle-ferocity-o-meter, and then a gentle jog back towards the escalating trouble in front of Liverpool’s goal as he let Mbeumo run beyond him while airily suggesting to Ibrahima Konate that he might like to deal with this unpleasantness, please.",
      "It was a string of uncharacteristic errors from a man who has been the most reliable of all Liverpool players for so long now, but on whose 34-year-old shoulders Liverpool have placed a frankly irresponsible level of faith and expectation across this long and in theory multi-competition season.",
      "",
      "6. And he never really did regain his composure. Having had to nurse Konate through much of the first chunk of this season, today the roles were reversed to an alarming degree, with Konate clearly Liverpool’s most – and at times apparently only – accomplished defender on display.",
      "Despite a role in the build-up to the equaliser, Van Dijk’s story was one of further errors and increasing rattle. Every close-up from the TV director appeared to be of Van Dijk walking away from some new unexpected unpleasantness shaking his head.",
      "With United playing most of the game with no real number-nine, Van Dijk didn’t really seem to know what to do with himself or where to go. He was dragged out wide by Mbeumo and into midfield by Matheus Cunha, with Milos Kerkez outside him similar uncertain about who precisely should be his primary concern out of Mbeumo and an impish Amad Diallo.",
      "The visible headloss reached its peak when Van Dijk shanked a clearance into Kerkez and set about berating his team-mate for the apparent crime of not being hologrammatic.",
      "",
      "7. And then there was Salah. That was… very not good. Liverpool are missing Trent Alexander-Arnold desperately, but nobody more so than Salah, who has lost all confidence and appears to have forgotten who he is.",
      "As can often happen to great players in a rut, his decision-making has gone out of the window. Passing when he should shoot, shooting when he should pass. Running at defenders in general is just something he probably shouldn’t be doing right now; he has still yet to complete a dribble this season and lost possession 16 times today.",
      "The nadir came shortly after the hour, though, when his big chance came to bring Liverpool level as a cross arrived to him barely six yards from goal and with time to take a touch before finishing.",
      "It was just bizarre. We are talking about one of the great players of the Premier League here, but he took that chance like someone who had only had football badly explained to him by someone who’d watched half a game several years earlier while not really paying attention.",
      "We want to say he mishit his shot well wide of the target, but it wasn’t even that. It was like he couldn’t even work out which part of his boot he wanted or needed to use. He kicked it really bloody hard, in entirely the wrong direction. A slice would be bad, but it would be easier to explain than this apparent total failure to even realise what was required.",
      "",
      "8. Salah was probably fortunate to stay on as long as he did given the performance, but such is his status here and across the league that it was nevertheless striking to note he was withdrawn when Liverpool went in forlorn pursuit of their second equaliser.",
      "That new Salah contract is not looking the best piece of clear-eyed decision-making right now. Nor the starry-eyed decision to chase ever greater attacking coups in the transfer market while the more mundane but necessary business of sorting out the centre of that defence were left unfinished.",
      "",
      "9. It also feels a bit of a worry that with the player of the year in their ranks and having spent hundreds of millions of pounds on new attacking talent, Liverpool’s most effective attacking player for most of the game was Cody Gakpo, and for the last few minutes of it was Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Gakpo had an extraordinary game really, hitting the woodwork three times, very nearly slicing an attempted clearance into his own net, scoring from a yard out while getting far too close to comfort to hitting the post with that effort as well, given the whole goal was available to him, and then heading badly wide when seeming certain to equalise again.",
      "The first and third shots that hit the post were wonderful efforts, the second an attempted cross, but it is that missed header that will haunt his dreams tonight.",
      "",
      "10. Liverpool’s best moments down the right-hand side came in the few minutes Frimpong spent out there rather than the 90-odd of Salah. It was his cross from which Gakpo really should have done so much better, with another dangerous delivery arriving soon after.",
      "By this point Liverpool’s formation was barely even worth giving hypothetical consideration, but with this being not the first time we’ve seen Frimpong playing a more advanced role and Dominik Szoboszlai deployed at right-back, it all adds to the bizarroworld sensation that this is a Liverpool team where nothing is quite operating as it should, or very often where it should.",
      "",
      "11. And we’ve not even got to Isak yet. Or Wirtz. Sometimes even 16 Conclusions isn’t enough and we really do want to make at least a couple of these about what United did right rather than what Liverpool did wrong.",
      "But it was another painful afternoon for both big-money summer arrivals, with Isak’s sole contribution being to tamely fail to score a one-on-one after being brilliantly found by Konate’s throughball, and doing so in precisely the kind of way that forces the entire punditocracy by strict co-commentary law to stroke their beards and ponder thoughtfully that a confident Newcastle Isak definitely scores there.",
      "",
      "12. United, though. Let’s talk about them for a bit. Because this is a huge day for Manchester United. The performance was good, and in places excellent. But it still feels a lot like this was a day more about what Liverpool did wrong than what United did right.",
      "It’s not to downplay United’s role in it all, just that Liverpool brought such uncontrolled chaos and wildness to proceedings that in a curious way their own total lack of control and composure meant United never really had any chance to introduce their own to the game.",
      "What they did was produce a full-blooded effort all over the pitch for all 98 minutes or whatever it was in the end, and take the fullest advantage of Liverpool’s confusion.",
      "",
      "13. And that was right from the off. There was one team switched on and aware of what was happening as that first moment of significance unravelled itself before them. Mbeumo was so smartly up off the canvas and back into play after being initially clattered by van Dijk, and expertly found by Amad who was excellent throughout.",
      "His finish was more power than precision, but that was very much enough. It rattled Liverpool, and they never truly recovered.",
      "There were further chances – most involving Bruno Fernandes and/or Amad in some capacity and, even when Liverpool were making some headway of their own, never any sense of a game spiralling out of United’s control. They surely can’t have predicted or expected Liverpool’s gameplan to become quite so wild quite so quickly, but they kept their heads admirably in the face of it all, especially given what was at stake.",
      "",
      "14. But most impressive was their response to the equaliser when it finally came. It would have been so easy then for heads to drop, for the apparently inevitable to be accepted. Especially for a team that has had so many more bad days than good ones over the last year or so.",
      "Gary Neville said just before Harry Maguire’s winner that he felt there was still a goal for United here, and while the speed with which that proved true was spectacular, it was also just a straightforwardly true observation.",
      "Liverpool had chosen chaos so early and thoroughly that after the equaliser there was no way to get that toothpaste back in the tube. No way to revert to any semblance of a more measured approach.",
      "And it was a delightful winning goal, with Bruno’s cushioned volleyed cross from a cleared corner a thing of beauty that arced inexorably onto the head of Maguire with an outcome that felt a certainty from long before it played out in apparent slow-motion.",

      "15. No, there was nothing particularly surprising about United’s second goal in a game long since handed over to chaos and where reason had left the building. What was surprising was that Maguire’s 84th-minute goal, despite having far more the feeling of a goal arriving in the 94th minute, would prove to be the last.",
      "It just felt certain that this game, especially given this Liverpool team and its penchant for injury-time shenanigans, had one more nonsense in store. A Van Dijk equaliser, perhaps, for the narrative.",
      "But no. Liverpool had already treated the last 30 minutes of this game like it was injury-time, to such extent that by the time eight minutes of actual injury time rolled around they had little of their usual energy for such moments to call upon.",
      "Liverpool were beaten, United victorious, and with it a seismic shifting of the Premier League crisis plates.",
      "",
      "16. This is not yet the end of Liverpool as title contenders this season. Having seen their own five-point lead swallowed up so quickly, they should know better than ever what could happen to the four-point deficit they now have to make up on an Arsenal side who in recent history have not made good pacesetters.",
      "But it does feel now like Liverpool are back to their bit-part role in the title race, watching Manchester City duke it out with the Gunners.",
      "They are not out of it, but absolutely could be by the time the November international break comes around if upcoming games against a rejuvenated Aston Villa and Manchester City go anything like this one, with Eintracht Frankfurt and Real Madrid providing the sort of opposition that could even see the Champions League, with its safety nets designed to protect big teams at all costs, now at risk of becoming dicey.",

      "Former FIFA referee and ex-PGMOL chief Keith Hackett has given his verdict on Bryan Mbeumo’s controversial opener for Manchester United in their 2-1 victory over Liverpool, which “surprised” Jamie Carragher.",
      "Harry Maguire scored the late winner for United after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Mbeumo’s first-minute goal, which led several Liverpool players to confront referee Michael Oliver as Alexis Mac Allister lay on the ground clutching his head.",
      "Reds captain Virgil van Dijk had elbowed his teammate in the build-up to the goal, and the contention was that Oliver should have blown his whistle, as is the custom for head injuries.",
      "But Hackett believes the correct decision was made, with VAR unable to intervene if – as Oliver suggests was the case – the referee did not see the head injury.",
      "“Three players challenged in a fair manner for the ball which bounced and put Man United on the attack. They went in to score a good goal,” Hackett told Football Insider.",
      "“It appeared that Referee Oliver had not seen the head injury and play was allowed to continue. Goal scored and correctly allowed.",
      "“VAR cannot intervene on this it is not a clear and obvious error.”",
      "Offering up his thoughts on the incident, Carragher said on commentary: “I have been frustrated that players have taken advantage of that rule. There was an incident in the Arsenal game yesterday near the dugout, and the referee pulled it back.",
      "“I am very surprised Michael Oliver hasn’t brought it back.”",
      "Gary Neville was left stunned by Van Dijk’s role in the goal, saying on commentary: “Mac Allister goes down, but what stuns me is Van Dijk. Mbeumo runs off him; he can’t see him. That is the big surprise.",
      "“Mbeumo reacts like a boxer off the ground, and he is away. Mamardashvili can’t keep it out, a stunning start for Manchester United. I can’t work out if Van Dijk is trying to play him offside. He points towards Konate as if to say, ‘That is your man.’ It is a strange handover from him.”",
      "Redknapp added: “It is brilliant from United but Van Dijk makes a big mistake. He has to sprint back. Yes there is a collision but you have to get back into shape. He can’t just pass it on to [Ibrahima] Konate.”",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been working on a ‘secret’ Manchester United mission for ages but it’s public knowledge now, while Liverpool are always transfer geniuses.",
      "Man Utd forward Bryan Mbeumo is attempting to convince Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to move to Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Former Man Utd midfielder Owen Hargreaves would like to see Benjamin Sesko dropped for Bryan Mbeumo in a tactical reshuffle.",
      "There is glee about a Proper Title Race, debate over whether Viktor Gyokeres will fly or flop, a tip for Nuno to be sacked and excitement over…Everton?!",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed what was said to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in transfer talks to help Manchester United beat Newcastle to signing them.",

      "Virgil van Dijk was labelled a “baby” by Jamie Carragher, Mohamed Salah looked more like a toddler and Alexander Isak doesn’t look worth £25m let alone £125m. The Liverpool trio were awful in defeat to Manchester United.",
      "The narrative this season surrounding Liverpool’s defensive woes has been that Ibrahima Konate’s downturn – amid a contract standoff and interest from Real Madrid which is now cooling as a result of his slump – has been too dramatic for the brilliance of Van Dijk to nullify.",
      "But after an extraordinary passage of play in the first minute at Anfield which saw Manchester United take the lead, we were forced to consider the possibility that Konate’s decline and Liverpool’s collective malaise is in part down to their captain not quite being ‘at it’ this season.",
      "Either that or Van Dijk’s mind and body hadn’t yet woken up – and never really did – to a game against Liverpool’s fiercest rivals in which nothing short of victory would put paid to doubts over their ability to stay the course with Arsenal in the title race. Neither reflects well on him.",
      "He goes games, weeks, months, often seemingly full seasons without making mistakes, but made three – four if you count the head injury he inflicted on Alexis Mac Allister – in less than ten seconds at the start of this game, and spent the rest of the it, as Gary Neville said on commentary, “not knowing whether to stick or twist”.",
      "After clattering into the back of Bryan Mbeumo while failing to deal with a long ball, nailing Mac Allister with an elbow in the process, Van Dijk then dangled a leg in an almost comically weak effort to block Bruno Fernandes’ pass to Amad Diallo, before Mbeumo ran off the back of him to score.",
      "We’ve seen him jog back into position thousands of times, but typically in an ‘I’m far better than you so don’t need to break a sweat’ sort of way, rather than with the air of negligence we saw here, exacerbated by him vaguely pointing Mbeumo out to Konate rather than marking him himself.",
      "Milos Kerkez was having another nightmare alongside him and we must also ask questions as to what Arne Slot has done since their 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace to coach Liverpool to play against the 3-4-3 formation given their evident problems with dealing with it again here.",
      "Without a true No.9 to play against, Van Dijk was continually dragged out of position and looked genuinely uncomfortable no matter if he was out wide being faced up by Mbeumo or pulled into midfield, with those moments scrambling his brain to such an extent that by half time he was losing a physical battle to Matheus Cunha.",
      "Slicing a cross into the face of Kerkez before shouting at the full-back for failing to talk to him combined his new-found defensive inadequacy and the all too familiar Van Dijk quirk of blaming anyone else for his own mistakes. And while the Van Dijk aura returned briefly to create Liverpool’s equaliser through a fine tackle to prevent a United counter-attack, he was then seen marking no-one as Harry Maguire scored the Red Devils’ winner, with Matthijs de Ligt also free at the back post.",
      "“For most of the season Van Dijk’s been looking after a baby in Konate; it’s now the other way around,” Carragher said on commentary. But short of his much-maligned centre-back as a scapegoat, Liverpool did have two other very willing, highly respected patsies to draw focus from the entirely rattled captain.",
      "Alexander Isak missed a golden opportunity having been sent through beautifully by Konate, but hit his shot straight at Senne Lammens. He dragged another one wide, and could have played Mohamed Salah in when well place on another occasion. Slot said this week that Isak has now completed his delayed pre-season, so this is now just bad football from the £125m man.",
      "Not quite as bad as Salah though, who was as poor as we’ve ever seen him for Liverpool against the team he loves playing against most, with the nadir evidenced by him kicking the ball with the wrong part of his boot, like he was a toddler lining up the effort at the back post, when granted a golden chance to make it 17 goals in 18 games against United.",
      "The surprise wasn’t that Salah was replaced by Jeremie Frimpong in the 85th minute when chasing the game but that it took Slot that long to realise that the Egyptian was proving a hindrance to Liverpool, now in attack as well as defence.",
      "And on the back of a first United win at Anfield for a decade, after which Ruben Amorim and his players obviously deserve huge credit (which you will find in 16 Conclusions later), although the visitors played their part in the mini-crisis becoming a full-blown one, the upgrade is mainly Liverpool’s doing.",
      "Thanks to Slot for treating the last 30+ minutes as though it was the last, to two Liverpool legends in Salah and Van Dijk for shrinking when they really needed them and to the summer signing who was supposed to take this brilliant team to the next level rather than ushering in this dramatic fall from grace.",

      "Jamie Redknapp thinks “any manager in any league in England” could win back-to-back matches with Ruben Amorim’s current Man Utd side.",
      "Amorim is yet to win back-to-back Premier League matches since becoming Man Utd manager around a year ago with the Red Devils boss picking up just 37 points from 34 matches.",
      "That has led to rumours that Amorim could be sacked if those poor results persist but Sir Jim Ratcliffe hinted that the Portuguese coach could remain at Man Utd for three years as he gives him a chance to proove himself.",
      "After Ratcliffe’s comments were put to him, Keane said: “Listen, I think it’s probably good getting the backing off the club and the board, but results obviously have to improve. You hope, of course, any manager is given time. Whether he’s going to get three years to play with, it will depend on how they do over next few months.",
      "READ: Why Ruben Amorim is ‘really annoyed’ with Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes",
      "“They have picked up a little bit, we said at the start of the season, with a couple of attacking players they look like more of a goal threat, and particularly at home, they’ve improved their home record, and on the back of a nice result to home to Sunderland, which I fully expect them to win.",
      "“But the big tests are still games like today [against Liverpool]. What kind of group they have? Are going to turn up here today and show their quality going forward? Are they trying to grind the result out? Are they going to be physical? Are they going to put tackles in? So there’s still huge question marks away from home. Yeah, they’ve picked up, but coming to Liverpool a huge test for me.",
      "“There’s still huge question marks over this United group. I just don’t see it at this moment in time, but the signs are a little bit better going forward, but you still worry about in midfield, in terms of the physicality, and you worry about them defensively. And again, question marks still over the goalkeeper situation.”",
      "Carragher chipped in: “I actually want to come in on those comments, because I understand what the owner is trying to do. He’s trying to quell the talk of the manager losing his job.",
      "“So he comes out to defend his man. He talks about, you know, he’s got three years. But he almost doesn’t help him by saying it, because nobody believes it. Nobody believes for one minute that Ruben Amorim will be the manager of Manchester United in three years.",
      "“If he just said, ‘we’ve got no plans to change our coach over the next 12 months.’ I think we’d go ‘okay, maybe they could get to the end of the season. Maybe things can improve. They can get someone in January.’ That would almost feel like a vote of confidence in that, you know, quell the talk of the manager losing his job.",
      "“But to come out and say three years, we all know that, as Roy’s just said, if the results keep going as they’re going he’s going to lose his job, unfortunately. So even though he’s come out trying to help him, I don’t think he has actually helped him with those comments in the end.”",
      "Before Redknapp went in hard on Amorim for failing to win back-to-back matches at Man Utd, he said: “When you’ve not won back-to-back games in the Premier League as Man United manager, you are coming under intense pressure. I think you could get any manager in any league in England and I fancy him to pick a team with this Man United squad, and win back to back games, that would be the challenge.",
      "“And it can’t be that difficult, but he’s making it look difficult every single week, like Roy says, some weeks you watch him and say: ‘yeah, there’s glimpses here, they’ve got a chance. They’ve got some good players, good performances.’ Then it will just go back to the madness and the same substitutions. Forget the system, he’s  not going to change it whatever we say.",
      "“But you can’t not win back-to-back games as Manchester United manager and then say that he’s going to still be there three years. It just doesn’t make any sense.",
      "“It’s not the real world. And also, if he’s still there after a year, and this is not changing, the fans will dictate that. They won’t suffer it because they want to see change. They don’t like the situation the club are in.”",

      "Ruben Amorim has set an optimistic target for Manchester United this season, but it would be a year too late for Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Mainoo was denied his request to leave the club on loan in the summer and has featured for just 237 minutes to far this season; Zirkzee was also linked with the exit – a return to Serie A was mooted – and is now understandably ‘deeply frustrated’ with his 116 minutes of game time this term.",
      "It would be a bitter pill to swallow at the best of times with the World Cup coming at the end of the campaign, but in a United team struggling for creativity which either could theoretically provide, it would be fair for both Mainoo and Zirkzee to question just how bad the teammates currently preferred by Amorim would have to be for them to be given an opportunity.",
      "READ: Liverpool vs Man Utd: Five pre-match predictions from Rooney, Keane, Redknapp et al.",
      "Victory over Sunderland before the international break kept the wolves from Amorim’s door and the vote of confidence from Sir Jim Ratcliffe suggests his sacking isn’t in the offing anytime soon. But with champions Liverpool to come on Sunday as Amorim still searches for consecutive Premier League wins for the first time in close to a year at Old Trafford, the United manager’s target for the season feels optimistic as Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and others threaten the Big Six hegemony.",
      "“We want to go to Europe,” he said ahead of the clash with Liverpool. “We need to return to Europe.",
      "“This club’s success is to win the Premier League. We have to be honest with our fans that we are not in that moment.",
      "“We need to be really clear on that, so I am not going to call success going to Europe, or finishing in the [top] eight or six, or whatever. That is not success.",
      "“We need to give steps to success. Success for this club is to win the Premier League, nothing less.”",
      "He also responded to continued speculation over the futures of Mainoo and Zirkzee.",
      "“I understand that but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season,” he added.",
      "“I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. Players are not playing. They want to play, and there’s a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players, talking all the time.”",
      "The cost of failing to qualify for Europe last season, beyond the financial implications, is the lack of opportunities afforded to those not in the first XI this term; being dumped out of the League Cup by Grimsby Town exacerbates the problem.",
      "Manchester United will have played 20 games this season before the January transfer window opens. Clubs competing in Europe will have played 27 if they reach the Carabao Cup quarter-finals.",
      "Aside perhaps from a congested Premier League fixture list around Christmas, Amorim doesn’t and won’t have the same need to rotate as other big-club managers. If he’s not going to field bit-part players on the back of international breaks that they haven’t been a part of ahead of those that have, as we strongly suspect will be the case at Anfield on Sunday, what hope do Mainoo or Zirkzee have of getting enough game time to stake their World Cup claims?",
      "Amorim might claim he “needs” them, but amid what will be growing pressure from agents and a perfectly possible negative dressing room atmosphere created by frustration and perceived injustice, the United chiefs may feel as though they have little option but to grant the exit wishes of Mainoo and Zirkzee.",

      "A UAE-based consortium, who are hoping to buy Man Utd, have approached David Beckham over a potential role in the deal, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils fanbase were sent into a frenzy last week with wealthy Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh insisting that an interested party are at ‘an advanced stage’ of buying Man Utd.",
      "Al-Sheikh wrote on X: ‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",
      "But, after realising that some Man Utd fans were speculating that he or another Saudi Arabian was looking at buying the club, Al-Sheikh clarified his comments.",
      "Posting again the day after, Al-Sheikh wrote: ‘My yesterday’s post about Manchester United’s potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",

      "Beckham has been ‘approached to back a takeover bid’ with the group reportedly ‘preparing to make an offer to buy the Glazers’ majority shareholding in the club’.",
      "When asked in July 2023 if the Glazers should go, Beckham said in an interview with The Athletic: “I think so. I think it’s purely because the fans want it.",
      "“Once you lose the fans, especially at a club like Manchester United, it’s hard to get them back.",
      "“Obviously, they (the Glazers) have achieved a lot, and financially, the fact we’re even talking about the numbers of what Manchester United will sell for shows the success they’ve had. But there needs to be change. We’ve all seen that, we all know that.”",
      "On whether he could see himself having a role at Man Utd in the future, Beckham added: “I have a lot going on here at the moment and my focus has purely been on Miami and everything that goes on in my business.",
      "“But I haven’t been approached and I suppose any involvement with Manchester United would mean the world to me, going forward. But who knows?",
      "“We’ll see what happens in the next few weeks or months. Hopefully, a decision gets made and if I’m involved in any way… if not, I’ll be a United fan and just do what all the other fans are doing – turn up and watch our team.”",
      "Football finance expert Dan Plumley has described the potential implications of Man Utd’s share price increasing by eight per cent amid recent takeover rumours.",
      "Plumley told Football Insider: “It’s a reaction to the media stuff we saw around the Saudi Arabia potential, the quote from the fairly well renowned Saudi Arabia individual who put this out there and speculated around a takeover that’s what’s driven the share price up ultimately.",
      "“It’s absolutely fuelled by speculation around a takeover. For what it means for the club, it’s more for the shareholders, the investors, any share price going up reflects positively on them ultimately and that means that the share price is higher.",
      "“It won’t make too big a difference to the day-to-day finances and the operations of the club. In terms of the share price going up you treat those things as good news stories for a company that the share price is increasing.",
      "“That share price ultimately is going to benefit the shareholders and the investors at a certain point in time, which is again the other side of the coin with this one because the current owners don’t look like they want to sell right now and Jim Ratcliffe came in for the minority stakes so its them who would benefit from a share increase but obviously they are not looking to sell the club.”",

      "Manchester United pulled off a shock victory to beat the Premier League's reigning champions Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield but how did they do it? We pick out the key reasons why Ruben Amorim was able to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time...",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 11:27, UK",
      "",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot seemed surprised by United's team selection from the outset as Amorim omitted Benjamin Sesko despite the striker scoring in his previous two Premier League appearances for the club and starting in each of the last four.",
      "In fact, it wasn't. Matheus Cunha took on the centre-forward duties, but did not give Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate such a reference point for them to mark. \"If we [play] Ben I think it is easier for these type of centre-backs to control our striker,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim was also rewarded for his positive decision to keep Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo together on the right rather than opting for a more defensively-minded wing-back. It paid off in little over a minute when the pair combined for the opening goal.",
      "Milos Kerkez, Liverpool's summer signing from Bournemouth, has been targeted by numerous teams this season and that appeared to have been identified as a weakness United could exploit. \"Kerkez does not look comfortable,\" said Jamie Carragher early on.",
      "Kerkez's uncertainty seems to have had a knock-on effect on the once imperious Van Dijk. \"Normally the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence gets punished,\" pointed out Gary Neville. \"But today it's the left hand side. Kerkez and Van Dijk have struggled.\"",
      "The goal immediately increased the tension inside Anfield. Van Dijk was urging Ryan Gravenberch to be calmer as early as the sixth minute when the midfielder attempted an ambitious pass in behind. \"We were far too rushed,\" said the captain after the game.",
      "Slot repeatedly referenced United's use of long balls afterwards but that was a smart play at Anfield, denying Liverpool the opportunity to win the ball high up the pitch through their pressing. Senne Lammens booted the ball away time and time again.",
      "In fact, the Belgian goalkeeper has the lowest pass completion rate of any Premier League goalkeeper to play 180 minutes this season. The top two goalkeepers? Giorgi Mamardashvili and Alisson Becker, both of Liverpool. A clash of styles. United's won out.",
      "Inevitably, Liverpool pushed in the second half, Slot's bold substitutions just after the hour mark meaning wave after wave of attacks towards the Kop followed. The home side got their equaliser but Amorim noted afterwards that the response was crucial.",
      "\"We managed well when we suffered the goal, we managed that moment well and that is the key point for our team.\" The momentum was with Liverpool but United managed to retain enough composure to stay in it and find a winning goal of their own.",
      "It came from the second phase after a corner. Amorim had included Harry Maguire because of his aerial ability in his own box, but it proved decisive at the other end of the pitch. Liverpool have now conceded five goals from set-pieces already this season.",
      "\"Defending in a set-piece at 1-1, it happened to us at Palace and again today,\" said Slot. The Liverpool boss pointed out that his team created far more from open play but acknowledged that set-pieces are part of the game. \"That is something we have to do [better].\"",
      "There was still time for Liverpool to equalise but Cunha came into his own in those closing stages. \"Cunha has one characteristic that can help the team move forward,\" Amorim said beforehand and he showed in late on, often getting United up the field.",
      "\"More or less all the transitions was Cunha. He was so far from the centre-backs and that helped us to take the ball,\" said Amorim afterwards. The Brazilian could be seen celebrating after winning a free-kick in stoppage time. His role was vital for United.",
      "Of course, Liverpool had their chances and Cody Gakpo, who had hit the frame of the goal three times before scoring, could and should have had a second. But Neville summed it up well. \"When you come to Anfield, you need a little bit of luck.\" United earned theirs.",

      "Mbeumo beat Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo's pass to leave Anfield shellshocked but Liverpool were furious play wasn't stopped for a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister, who went down in the build-up after colliding with Virgil van Dijk.",

      "Mac Allister needed treatment and had to play on wearing protective headgear but VAR could not intervene as there was no foul. Guidance from the Premier League Match Centre suggested referee Michael Oliver did not stop play as he did not see the injury.",
      "The dramatic opening set the tone for a pulsating game with Manchester United initially resisting Liverpool's efforts to equalise with the help of some luck. Gakpo struck the post three times before finally hauling the hosts level when he tucked home substitute Federico Chiesa's low cross.",
      "The out-of-form Mohamed Salah had also missed two gilt-edged chances but it felt like Liverpool were primed to find a winner before Maguire struck to spark more jubilant celebrations from Manchester United, who might have had a second goal in the first half had Fernandes not fired wide from a big chance.",
      "Liverpool tried to rally again in the closing stages but Gakpo missed a glorious opportunity, heading wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross when it looked easier to score, leaving them to face up to a fourth consecutive loss for the first time since 2014, having also been beaten by Chelsea, Galatasaray and Crystal Palace.",
      "A momentous victory for Manchester United means they have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Ruben Amorim. It puts them only two points behind Liverpool in the table, with the champions four points off leaders Arsenal in third.",

      "Sunday 19 October 2025 20:52, UK",
      "",
      "Curtis Jones and Florian Wirtz in a midfield two? It was surely not the plan at half past four in the afternoon, let alone in the summer. But this was Liverpool with a little over an hour gone against Manchester United at Anfield. Let the chaos ensue.",
      "It has been their season in microcosm, a wildness highlighted on the opening night of the campaign in a prickly conversation between Arne Slot and Jamie Carragher. Liverpool beat Bournemouth that evening. But the control they had is clearly gone.",
      "They created enough chances to beat Manchester United. Slot was at pains to point that out. Cody Gakpo struck the frame of the goal on three separate occasions. Mohamed Salah missed a chance so inviting that Curtis Jones was already celebrating.",
      "\"I do not think it is usual that we are missing so many chances. This weekend again, set-pieces are such a crucial part. We are the team that creates the most in open play, I don't think that has changed. But that is not the only way to win a game.\"",
      "He is right. Liverpool have created 85 chances from open play, the most of any team in the Premier League. But he is also right to mention the defending from set-pieces. There is a vulnerability to Liverpool now and the two may be related. It is about balance.",
      "Milos Kerkez shone for Bournemouth last season but is struggling at left-back, targeted each week by opponents who sense weakness. Virgil van Dijk looks less sure of himself too, leaving that flank exposed. The captain himself was culpable for the opener.",
      "There was an irony to Van Dijk preaching calm afterwards because more urgency from him might have helped instead of allowing Bryan Mbeumo to drag himself from the deck and sprint in behind the Liverpool defence to fire United ahead after 62 seconds.",
      "Composed can soon come to be seen as lackadaisical once the goals start going in against you. It is 11 conceded after eight Premier League games this season compared to the miserly three that gave Liverpool the platform for success last time out.",
      "Too often, Liverpool find themselves playing catch-up. \"When you are 1-0 down, you need to take more risks,\" said Slot. Hence, the sight of his Galacticos arrowing forward towards the Kop late on, all talent and no cohesion as they chased goals - and lost.",
      "\"I think we had six or seven offensive players on the pitch and that may be the reason why the structure of a set-piece against Palace and now was not as perfect as usual because normally you play four or five defensive-minded players,\" Slot explained.",
      "There is an element of living and dying by that same sword. It was not so long ago that Liverpool were snatching games late on having gone chasing for the winner. Now, they are losing to late goals. Three points for a win might well justify the approach in the end.",
      "In terms of expected goals, this was the highest total that Liverpool have racked up in any Premier League game since beating Southampton in March. But when Jamie Redknapp talked of \"an air of desperation\", you understand what he meant by it.",
      "On paper, Liverpool have some splendid players. On the pitch, the blend is still not right. Slot appears willing to trust that things will click very soon. But his team will need to make sure their rivals don't snatch the crown while they are figuring it out.Adam Bate",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro against Liverpool surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Rubem Amorim had cited his set-piece threat before the game and he delivered just when he was needed.",
      "His goal, guided home from Bruno Fernandes's delicate cross, means he joins Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, John O'Shea, Ryan Giggs and Diego Forlan on the list of Manchester United players to have scored winners at Anfield.",

      "\"I suppose I might have been a surprise package last year, but now people know about me and know my game.\"",
      "And his start to the season, without a goal in seven games, reinforced how he has become a marked man.",
      "Head coach Unai Emery wasn't prepared to give up on him, though. Rogers has started all of their Premier League and Europa League matches.",
      "\"He is always doing his task. He is a hard worker,\" explained Emery. \"And through it, the performance is coming.",
      "\"He's playing and he's scoring because he's helping the team for 90 minutes.\"",
      "Rogers' stunning strike against Tottenham was the only shot he had during the match. It was a bolt from the blue, but one that can help reinstall his confidence after a tricky period in his career.David Richardson",
      "The sound of boos at the full-time whistle has become a regular occurrence at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs' home form is alarming. Their supporters have seen just three wins at home in the last 18 Premier League games.",
      "In fact, the 2-1 loss to Aston Villa means it is Tottenham's poorest home start to a league campaign since 2008/09.",
      "Since November 10 last year, Spurs have lost more home games than any other ever-present Premier League side.Frank has been unable to solve an issue which developed under his predecessor Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Asked to explain their home struggles, the Dane said at his post-match press conference: \"I don't think it's that simple. It's about looking into the performances.",
      "\"I think we performed well against Burnley, I think we performed well today. I think we had one very good first half against Wolves, and we were bad against Bournemouth.",
      "\"We could easily have won it instead of Villa, and then it would have been a different narrative, so I look at the performance on the pitch at what we did well and look at what we need to improve.\"",
      "Frank, then, will be relieved their next three games are all away."

      "Gary Neville says the next few weeks are \"crucial\" for Ruben Amorim's Manchester United era - and believes they should be able to get into the top six after a dramatic win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "United have risen to ninth in the table following Harry Maguire's 84th-minute winner against arch-rivals Liverpool, after Cody Gakpo cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's 61-second opener.",
      "\"This is a complete turnaround game,\" said Neville about the win over Liverpool on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I thought if United lose here, which they were more than likely to do when I saw the team sheet, I'm thinking Ruben Amorim is going into that Brighton game under real pressure with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham to come.",
      "\"They've got a kickstart springboard from what they've done, because to win at Anfield is special in any season, to win here is the hardest ground. They should be really proud because it's a big achievement, but they've got to kick on from here.",
      "\"So it's a great day for Manchester United, but let's see it again next Saturday night against Brighton.\"",
      "Neville cited the recent defeat at Brentford in September as a prime example for United to avoid. Amorim's side had just beaten Chelsea at home in a big game to kickstart their season - but a defeat to the Bees a week later put United back where they started.",
      "\"So what can't happen is now we've got to this height of performance, and then all of a sudden Brighton ends up being a dip,\" said Neville. \"So the next couple of weeks are huge, I think, for Ruben Amorim to start to build.",
      "\"Amorim has got to start trusting those players. I know we talk about trusting Ruben Amorim and him being under pressure, and that's always going to be the case with the manager, but Ruben Amorim wants to be able to trust his players.",
      "\"I know he likes them, and I know the players like him, you can see that. There's no sort of players losing the dressing room type stuff, which we have seen with United many times.",
      "\"There's no doubt those players admire their coach, they like him as a person, but they've got to start trusting each other, trust the system if you're the players, but also Ruben Amorim, trust his players that they can deliver consistently.",
      "\"I'm just looking towards next week now. Enjoy tonight because it's one of the greatest moments you can have as a United player, winning at Anfield, and it happens rarely, so enjoy tonight.",
      "\"But honestly, lads, you've got to get back at it tomorrow morning, you've got to switch on and focus, because next Saturday will kick you right where you don't want it to kick you, if you're not at your best.",
      "\"Brighton are a good side, so really start to focus so hard on that in terms of everything that you do this week.\"",
      "Neville believes the United squad are capable of finishing in the top six - not just because of the quality of their squad, but also the lack of European football giving them free weeks of training all season.",
      "\"They've just gone into the top half of the table, to ninth, and I think if they win next week, they've got to start thinking of pushing up the league,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Because they've got to get to a point whereby there's stability at the club, the only way there's going to be stability is through winning football matches.",
      "\"I think Manchester United have got a top six squad, particularly when you know that they haven't got European football, and they haven't got the Carabao Cup now.",
      "\"If you look at the four or five players they've got up front in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, and Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount, and Bruno Fernandes behind them. And then the centre-backs they've got - Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, they should be able to get a top six finish with the free weeks out of that squad.\"",
      "Amorim admitted he will not dwell on or celebrate this victory too much, with the Portuguese fully aware of the importance the Brighton game will bring next weekend.",
      "\"It [victory over Liverpool] doesn't mean a lot. It means [a lot] today. But tomorrow it is not going to mean a lot. It's three points but it's a good victory.",
      "\"It will give us more confidence in the week. It will give us a lot of pleasure to our fans who deserve it after Grimsby and Brentford. To have a win like this is really important. That is on our hands. This game is in the past, let's focus on the future.\""

      "By Peter Smith and Zinny Boswell",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 07:18, UK",
      "Giorgi Mamardashvili - 5",
      "Mamardashvili talked up his readiness to replace Alisson while he was away on loan last season but looked nervous on this big stage - perhaps flustered after failing to save Bryan Mbeumo's early drive through him.",
      "Could do little about Harry Maguire's header but also spilt a Matheus Cunha cross and was fortunate Mason Mount couldn't tuck away the loose ball. There were a couple of good stops midway through the first half but unconvincing.",
      "Conor Bradley - 6",
      "Misplaced just one of his 26 passes but will be frustrated not to have troubled the United defence. Miscontrolled in the box at start of the second half when he looked primed to deliver a dangerous cross. Off after an hour and saw Szoboszlai go into his right-back spot. That position is still up for grabs.",
      "Ibrahima Konate - 6",
      "Out-jumped by Harry Maguire for the winner to spoil what had been an otherwise impressive performance. Konate has copped plenty of flak this season but it was he who was regularly covering for centre-back pal Virgil van Dijk on Sunday. He couldn't get across to stop Mbeumo's goal but made plenty of other interventions amid the chaos of that first half and played a fantastic pass for Isak's big one-on-one chance.",
      "Virgil van Dijk - 5",
      "Usually imperious but Van Dijk was at fault for Mbeumo's goal, clattering his team-mate Mac Allister and ending up out of position before strangely trying to hand over the goalscorer to Konate. Turned by Cunha and needed Konate to cover in one of several examples of the Dutchman being caught out. His passing and aerial threat were there - his authority was not.",
      "Milos Kerkez - 5",
      "The left-back looked overawed in the first half and had to be told to calm down by Van Dijk on a couple of occasions. Their miscommunication continued in the second half when his centre-back kicked the ball in his face. Didn't look comfortable up against Amad.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch - 6",
      "Set the tempo at the base of Liverpool's midfield, playing a deeper role than he has ventured into at times this season but rolled his ankle worryingly early in the second half and had to come off soon after.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister - 6",
      "Jamie Carragher says if Mac Allister can get back to his best then Liverpool will too - but he was off the pace again here. Clattered by Van Dijk in the build-up to United's goal and needed treatment. Then had little impact in the first half before sparking a counter and shooting over in the second. Subbed off on the hour.",
      "Dominik Szoboszlai - 7",
      "Hit some fine long-range passes but it was his incisive forward balls through the middle of the pitch which got Liverpool moving forwards. His 100 per cent passing accuracy at the break dipped in the second half but continued to contribute defensively and offensively when shifted to right-back.",
      "Mohamed Salah - 5",
      "The most goal involvements of any player in Premier League history in this fixture - but he's miles away from his stratospheric levels of the past right now. Shot horribly wide when he looked set to score in the second half after fluffing a volley from a corner. There was a brilliant pass into Gakpo earlier but a combination of positioning and form has blunted his threat. Hooked with Liverpool needing a goal at 2-1 and that said it all.",
      "Alexander Isak - 5",
      "Arne Slot said his British-record £125m striker is ready to start firing now - not on this evidence. The big chance came in the first half when Isak fired his one-on-one chance at Senne Lammens. He snatched another shot wide from distance and saw an ambitious effort blocked away by Luke Shaw later. Not what Liverpool paid the big bucks for.",
      "Cody Gakpo - 7",
      "Scored one equaliser. Should have scored another, heading wastefully wide after tapping in for 1-1. Earlier was involved as Liverpool hit the woodwork not once, not twice but THREE times, with a deflected cross sandwiching two blasts against posts. Liverpool's most dangerous attacker but will leave Anfield kicking himself for that miss.",
      "Subs",
      "Hugo Ekitike - 6",
      "Lost his place to Isak and came on looking like a man with a point to prove, firing just wide not long after his introduction before missing the target with another dig.",
      "Florian Wirtz - 6",
      "A little pass to Federico Chiesa allowed the Italian to tee up Gakpo for the equaliser. That was some encouragement for the £116m man who had been benched again and has seen his run of no goals or assists in the Premier League go on. But he remains a big dilemma for Slot.",
      "Curtis Jones - 6",
      "Tried to add energy to Liverpool's forward play and fired a shot on target but couldn't come up with a moment of magic in a fixture he'd love to win more than most.",
      "Federico Chiesa - 6",
      "Another big Anfield moment for Chiesa this season to cross for Gakpo to thump in the leveller - but this time his late intervention didn't earn Liverpool points.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong - 6",
      "Another high-profile summer signing who started on the bench but should have had an assist when he nipped to the byline and crossed for Gakpo. His long-term role in this team still uncertain.",
      "Senne Lammens - 7",
      "Held his own in a hostile environment in his second Premier League start. Big save with his leg to deny Isak in the first half. One of five saves he made. Little he could do for the equaliser. Continued to look confident claiming crosses and brought calm to the defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 6",
      "Lost Gakpo for Liverpool's equaliser and headed over from close range with his side 2-1 up. It didn't matter in the end.",
      "Harry Maguire - 8",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and scored the winner at Anfield. He missed a chance to win the game in the same fixture last season but made no mistake this time with his head. The hero for his team once again.",
      "Luke Shaw - 6",
      "Timid defending showed Gakpo inside when he struck the post soon after the restart. Isak stuck to him in the hope of finding joy but only really got free once when Lammens denied him.",
      "Amad Diallo - 8",
      "Perfectly weighted through ball for the opener. Ran Kerkez ragged down the right as he finally clicked with Bryan Mbeumo. Undoubtedly their best game playing together. His team lost something when he was taken off.",
      "Casemiro - 6",
      "Lasted nearly an hour and put in a decent shift as the deepest midfielder after a quick turnaround from international duty playing in South Korea and Japan. The 33-year-old was unremarkable but did a job which is good going after playing two full games for Brazil.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 8",
      "Covered every blade of grass and looked exhausted late in the second half but had enough in the tank to produce a stunning volleyed assist for the winner. Should probably score to make it 2-0 in the first half, but more than made up for it in the end.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 5",
      "Nervous performance at left wing-back. His poor pass high up led to Liverpool's counter when Gakpo struck the post.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 8",
      "Good finish for the opener to set his team up perfectly in a hostile environment. His influence waned in the second half but he set his team on their path to victory. Always a threat cutting in.",
      "Mason Mount - 6",
      "Did a defensive job for his head coach as the false nine. Struggled to influence the game much in an attacking sense. Forced one save and could have scored to make it 2-0 if he had anticipated the ball bouncing for him in the box.",
      "Matheus Cunha - 7",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and caused Liverpool problems in the first half starting on the left of a front three that was fluid in possession. Was less effective offensively after the break when his team dropped deeper but never shied away from taking the ball.",
      "Subs",
      "Manuel Ugarte - 6",
      "Replaced Casemiro after nearly an hour but had little impact on the game. Made an important block deep in stoppage time to stop a Liverpool cross into the six-yard box. His best moment.",
      "Patrick Dorgu - 5",
      "Nervous when he came on to replace Amad. Beaten by Ekitike twice in the lead-up to the equaliser and then could not block Chiesa's cross. Too easily beaten.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 6",
      "Replaced Mount after an hour and had a limited role. Best chance was a through ball over the top that he took down nicely only to be ruled offside. Played a nice ball in to Cunha that came to nothing.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo - N/A",
      "Replaced Fernandes with five minutes to go and touched the ball just twice.",
      "Leny Yoro - N/A",
      "Replaced Shaw with five minutes to go and did not have enough time to impact the game.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Bruno Fernandes says Manchester United need stability and the players believe Ruben Amorim is the right man to bring the club back to where it belongs.",
      "United have lurched from one extreme to another this season, suffering chastening defeats at Manchester City and Brentford, but the captain was glad to see Amorim get the public backing of minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the international break.",
      "\"Sometimes you need to look at the bigger picture and as a group of players we believe that the manager can help this club to get back where it belongs.\"",
      "He added: \"If Sir Jim sees it the same way as the players, that the manager is the right one for the job, it makes it better that we have two groups of people looking in the same way.\"",
      "Victory over Sunderland before the international break brought a renewed sense of optimism to Old Trafford, but another no-show performance would likely put Amorim back in the spotlight, even after Ratcliffe vowed to give him three years.",
      "Fernandes expects nothing less and says his team-mates must rise above the external noise if they are to succeed at the club.",
      "\"Any manager that comes here will be one game away from a crisis,\" said the United captain.",
      "\"This club is always like that. If you win a game, it looks like you're going to win the league. If you lose a game, it looks like there is a cloud over the club that will never go.",
      "\"We have players that are aware of the dimension of the club and how it works. We don't need this around us. We need to know what we're doing, what we want to achieve in the long term and what we want to achieve for the next game.",
      "\"That's needs to be the aim for every player because at this club any manager will be under pressure when they get a bad result and our manager's no different.",
      "\"But he is very prepared for that and he knows how big of a challenge this is.\"",
      "Amorim admits he does not know how long it will take for United to reach the level of Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "United endured their worst campaign of the Premier League era under Amorim last season, finishing 15th as their fiercest rivals equalled their record of 20 league titles.",
      "For all their dominance, England's two most successful clubs' best periods have rarely coincided and, if anything, tend to come when the other is in decline.",
      "Asked what a realistic aim is to close the gap to Liverpool, Amorim said: \"I don't know. Sometimes things change really fast.",
      "\"We can win any game, so if we think just about the next game, that is the most important thing and we can win the next game.",
      "\"We are going to fight to be at the same level as Liverpool in the future, that is the idea. I don't know how long that is going to take.\"",
