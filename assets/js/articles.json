      "Manchester United fans are planning to stage a protest against Sir Jim Ratcliffe's running of the club for the first time ahead of their Premier League season opener against Arsenal this month.",
      "Ratcliffe has come under fire from a huge section of supporters over his decision-making and handling of the club since his £1.25bn investment in the club last year - quickly taking control of United's football operations.",
      "But United have had a disastrous couple of years since he joined the club, which have seen United finish seventh in the Premier League in 2023-24 before a 15th-placed finish last season. The club have also been hit by financial difficulties, which has impacted their spending in this window.",
      "Ratcliffe has embarked on a brutal cost-cutting regime at Old Trafford, with ticket prices hiked and free lunches for staff in the canteen scrapped too.",
      "Meanwhile, Joel and Avram Glazer continue to own the club in the background despite mounting calls for the Americans to leave.",
      "The 1958 supporters' group have previously staged a number of demonstrations against the club's ownership, including before the final game of the season against Aston Villa - as they accused United of stealing their \"history, dignity and integrity\".",
      "They have now announced their next move in a bid to make their voices heard. The group will lead a protest outside Old Trafford before the team faces the Gunners on August 17.",
      "Protesters will hold up banners in opposition to both Ratcliffe and the Glazers presence at the club, with the signs reading: \"Jim can't fix this\".",
      "A spokesman for The 1958 said: “It’s a new season but the same old ownership issues. Twenty years of the Glazers and their debt mountain is 20 years too long. Enough is enough.",
      "\"We won’t allow some natural optimism and a couple of shiny new signings to deflect from the bigger off-field picture. Jim Ratcliffe chose to get into bed with the Glazers and in our opinion is helping keep them in charge.",
      "\"So on 17th August, we protest not just against the Glazers, but now also against Jim Ratcliffe – a man once seen by many, including ourselves, as a possible saviour, a beacon of hope but now revealed as complicit in the ongoing erosion of everything that makes our club what it is.",
      "\"Jim Ratcliffe, you have chosen your side and it is not ours. You now stand shoulder to shoulder with the Glazers. The mask has slipped. You are no saviour. You’re like a (red) devil in disguise.\"",
      "Ratcliffe previously admitted he could leave the club if he became as unpopular as the Americans, saying: \"Eventually, if it reached the extent that the Glazer family have been abused, then I’d have to say, 'look, that’s enough guys, let somebody else do this'.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have rejected the opportunity to sign Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, as they push to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. But the Red Devils could yet be forced into an embarrassing U-turn should a deal for Bundesliga ace collapse.",
      "A No.9 has emerged as Ruben Amorim's top target after the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Sesko is now the top priority at Old Trafford over other strikers such as Ollie Watkins, who is admired by Amorim in particular.",
      "On Tuesday, a bid worth a potential £74million was tabled by United. However, a deal for the 22-year-old Slovenian won't be easy, with Premier League rivals Newcastle also still in the mix and having offered more to Leipzig.",
      "Although Sesko expressed a preference for the Manchester club in the past, Amorim's side could still return to Vlahovic if he ends up on Tyneside.",
      "The Old Lady are keen to offload Vlahovic, who has just one year left on his current deal in Turin, and the player would like to depart himself. According to Tuttosport, the 25-year-old has seen a request to terminate his current deal with a £9m severance package rejected. Juve instead are asking for £21million to any potential suitors. Both AC Milan and United have been offered the striker, it's claimed.",
      "But the Premier League side turned their noses up at signing Vlahovic as they push to land 22-year-old Sesko.",
      "Yet Eddie Howe's side have submitted an improved offer worth over £70m for Sesko to rival United's latest approach, with Sesko seemingly set to pick his ideal suitor.",
      "United are continuing to search around for alternatives if they lose out on Sesko to the Toon. Alongside mooted marksmen such as Watkins and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson, according to The Athletic, Vlahovic remains a possibility. It would be quite the 180-turn if United missed out on Sesko and went for the Serb.",
      "It seems an inevitability that Amorim adds to what was a lacklustre forward line last season before the window closes, with £72m man Rasmus Hojlund simply not producing and understood to be available for £30m.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes, who himself was linked with a move away from the club earlier this year, has called for change during their pre-season tour of the US, wishing for added competition and more signings.",
      "\"I don't want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about,\" began Fernandes, speaking after United's 2-2 draw against Everton on Sunday. \"I don't know about it, I'm not involved in that. But obviously, it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "\"We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that's what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",

      "Rio Ferdinand believes Luke Shaw's claim about Manchester United shedding the \"stragglers\" in the squad highlights Ruben Amorim's positive effect. Amorim, 40, has taken a no-nonsense approach to United's squad this summer.",
      "One of his first acts was to banish the so-called 'Bomb Squad' featuring Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. The latter has been loaned to Barcelona, but the other trio were left out of United's pre-season tour in the USA and told they will be training separately from the rest of the squad.",
      "Last season, Sancho, Antony and Rashford were loaned to Chelsea, Real Betis and Aston Villa, respectively, while Garnacho was told to find a new club after he publicly criticised Amorim shortly after United's loss to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "New recruits Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have now been brought in, and Shaw recently praised Amorim's tough love approach that has managed to rid the club of \"stragglers\" holding the group back.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents show, the ex-United captain reacted to Shaw's comments. He said: \"It was quite a damning statement, wasn't it?",
      "\"When I heard that, I was like, 'I wonder what the next meet-up is going to be like if he sees any of those guys.' I think I'd have had something to say about that if I thought it was about me.",
      "\"Then you go, 'Maybe they don't say anything, because they might think and know it is true.' But there's a confidence in there with him that goes, 'You know what? They know that I know what went wrong. So I can say this with my chest.'",
      "\"That's what it feels like. Also, the environment he is feeling now would have to be a positive one for him to come out and speak like that.\"",
      "When asked specifically about Shaw's place at Old Trafford and whether he was referencing the aforementioned quartet, Ferdinand added: \"His stature within the squad, I noticed it while I was on tour. He has a very strong stature within the squad. He's been there, I think, over 10 years now.",
      "\"He has seen it all there. All the bad times, he's seen it. He is one of the most experienced and most Manchester United players within that squad. So, I don't think he has any qualms coming out like that.",
      "\"I think you have to have seen enough to be able to go and talk like that. So I think it's a strong statement. I don't think there's any two that he's directed at those four players, because they are the ones sitting on the outside.\"",
      "Last season was a chastening one for the Red Devils. They finished 15th and only mustered 42 points and 44 goals. Their last chance of redemption in the Europa League final also ended with them losing to Tottenham in a lacklustre fashion.",
      "But the signs are looking positive for the Red Devils, as they won the Premier League Summer Series in the USA. They beat West Ham United 2-1 and Bournemouth 4-1, before drawing 2-2 with Everton.",
      "Of course, the real measure will be how they start the Premier League campaign. Their opening fixtures are ominous, as they host Arsenal, Burnley and Chelsea, while also travelling to Fulham, Manchester City and Brentford in their first six matches.",

      "A spectacular pair of diamond-encrusted football boots once owned by former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand are expected to fetch £40,000 when they are put up for auction this month.",
      "The specially-commissioned Nike T90 size-11s, each set with a ruby and both white and black diamonds, are back on the market six years after they were sold to raise money for Ferdinand’s ‘Live The Dream Foundation’, a charity that helps underprivileged children.",
      "Online bidding with auctioneers Ewbank’s starts on August 19 - and it is estimated that the boots will go under the hammer for between £20,000 and £40,000.",
      "The boots were first commissioned by Embee Jewels of London after former fashion model and dancer Luisa Di Marco came up with the inspirational idea of designing the world ’s most expensive boots as part of the charity appeal.",
      "Ferdinand, who won six Premier League titles with United as well as the Champions League, Club World Cup and the Club World Cup, played 81 times for England during a glittering career that also included spells with West Ham, Bournemouth, Leeds and QPR. The 46-year-old launched a media career after hanging up his boots and is a respected television pundit.",
      "The boots were commissioned by Di Marco and fashion designer Scott Henshall after consultation with Ferdinand’s management company. They were customised further with spray paint and graffiti-style artwork by rapper and film producer Goldie.",
      "Both boots have Ferdinand’s name machine-stitched to the side in capital letters and have been applied with an 18 ct rose gold shield, hallmarked London 2009, along with the sponsor’s mark EJ.",
      "Each 7.3 x 5cm shield has a round cut ruby set border with an estimated total ruby weight of 1.80 carats. At the centre sits the number 5, set with white round brilliant cut diamonds and round cut black diamonds set as a detail.",
      "The tongue to each boot is set with a 2.4cm diameter gold circular black diamond-set panel, and a No. 90 set with white diamonds, with an estimated total white diamond weight of 0.25 ct. A large black diamond-set Nike Swoosh to one side and a smaller white diamond-set Nike Swoosh decorate the sides, with an estimated total white diamond weight of 0.82 ct.",
      "The back of each heel is even more flamboyant. Adorned with an attached 7.6 x 6.8cm gold panel depicting a winged heart, sword and crown motif, with black enamel lettering spelling the word 'Core', each heart is set with round-cut rubies, with an estimated total ruby weight of 1.12 ct.",
      "The white round brilliant cut diamonds set in the design have an estimated total white diamond weight of 4.54 ct.",
      "Completing the vision in bling is a pair of gold-tipped laces, each set with round brilliant cut white diamonds at the terminals, and with an estimated weight of 0.22 ct each.",
      "The boots were first sold at a Private VIP Auction event in 2009, hosted by James Corden. Also up for auction at the time were England team-mates’ John Terry and Wayne Rooney's match-worn and signed boots covered in jewels.",
      "Ewbank’s specialist Tom Duggan said: “Rio Ferdinand’s gold and diamond encrusted boots must rank as one of the most extraordinary pieces of sporting memorabilia we have ever offered.",
      "“One of the best things about them is that they brought together rare talents in sport, design, film and music to create them, and of course it was all for a good cause. The buyer at that original charity auction is the seller here.”",
      "Live online bidding for Sporting Memorabilia auction is available via www.ewbankauctions.co.uk",

      "Manchester United have made a £73.8million bid for Benjamin Sesko, as they move to beat Newcastle in the race for the RB Leipzig striker. Sesko, 22, is both clubs' top target, as they each push to sign a striker in the final month of the summer transfer window.",
      "Newcastle were first to lodge a formal bid that was rejected. Following talks with the Bundesliga club, Eddie Howe's side submitted an improved offer of £69.5m plus £8.6m in add-ons on Monday.",
      "United have now made their own move, with a proposal worth £65.2m plus £8.6m in further payments. It's understood that Sesko is training away from Leipzig's first-team squad amid the race to sign him.",
      "Newcastle's decision to pursue the Slovenia international comes after Alexander Isak told club chiefs that he wants to leave amid concrete interest from Liverpool. The Magpies rejected Liverpool's opening bid last week but they're braced for a second offer.",
      "United, on the other hand, want to upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, who's available for just £30m after two difficult seasons at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have already signed two forwards this summer, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for a combined £133.5m.",
      "United's interest in Sesko dates back to when he was 16 and playing for Slovenian club Domzale. The Red Devils' new director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, also knows plenty about the in-demand 22-year-old.",
      "Vivell signed Sesko for both Salzburg and Leipzig during his spells with the two Red Bull-run clubs, and he's hoping to do it for a third time in his role at United.",
      "Howe has been tight-lipped on Newcastle's interest in Sesko. When asked about the ex-Red Bull Salzburg wonderkid, the Magpies boss told Chronicle Live: \"I am sorry to sound like a broken record, I am aware of what is happening, but I am not dealing with it.",
      "\"I woke up today and had two training sessions then came straight here. I am finding out what is happening after it has happened, so we will try to bring the best to the football club - I will make that clear - but I can't talk about individual targets.\"",
      "Who should Benjamin Sesko chose - Newcastle or Manchester United? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "After Sesko was absent for Leipzig's pre-season friendly with Atalanta last week, managing director Marcel Schafer confirmed that approaches had been made, without giving specifics.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that, but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches,\" Schafer said. \"It's obvious what has happened.\"",
      "Now, RBL have both Premier League clubs pushing to land their prized asset, with the Slovenian tasked with deciding on which United he really wants.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand believes Arsenal's teenage sensation Max Dowman is the most exciting English talent since Wayne Rooney. Dowman, despite not even being old enough to sit his GCSEs, has left Gunners talent drooling with his talent during pre-season.",
      "In a summer featuring the arrivals of stars like Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke and others, the player Arsenal fans haven't been able to stop watching is the 15-year-old, a product of the club's fabled academy system. Dowman, who has been playing above his age group for a number of years and spent much of last term training with the first team, was included on the north Londoners' pre-season tour of Asia.",
      "And while he may have presumed he was only there for the experience, boss Mikel Arteta had other ideas, desploying him in their friendlies against AC Milan, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, where he immediately made an impression. Dowman, who was born in 2009, has already impressed Declan Rice and the Gunners boss with his mature displays.",
      "Ferdinand, who won his fourth Premier League title the year Dowman was born, has been so captivated by the teen, he thinks he is just as exciting as a young Rooney was. Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, the ex-England captain said: \"Dowman excites me on another level. This kid is different.\"",
      "When co-host Joel Beya told Ferdinand, who already sang Dowman's praises last month, that some people are calling the teenager the best talent England has produced since Rooney, he instantly replied: \"Yes. I am saying the same thing.”",
      "After Beya suggested Ferdinand should take it easy with such a comparison, he hit back: \"What? Have you seen him? They’re different. This kid is not Rooney.",
      "\"Just let me put it out there, he is not Rooney. He is not built. He hasn’t got a hairy chest. He hasn’t got a beard at the age of 16. Rooney was a man. A man-child.”",
      "Rooney was responsible for perhaps the most spectacular breakthrough in Premier League history when he made his Everton debut at the age of 16. He came off the bench against Arsenal and crashed home a strike from 30 yards, which smashed off the underside of the crossbar on its way into the net in 2003.",
      "He went on to become United and England's highest-ever goalscorer, until Harry Kane broke the latter record in an away clash against Italy in 2023. While Ferdinand has compared the breakouts of Rooney and Dowman, he did insist they are different types of players.",
      "He added: \"The thing with Wayne Rooney is that he had guile, but he came on with brute force. He was like, 'You’re going to know about me because I’m going to force it down your throat.’",
      "\"This kid is more subtle, more technical. All he is going to do is have people on ice skates, slipping and sliding everywhere. Very rarely do you see a player actually get near him and touch him.",
      "\"He is that elusive. He’s a player who will excite you, get you off your seat. You’ll be going, 'Have you seen that?’ He’s making defenders into memes.”",
      "Dowman is yet to make his full, competitive senior debut for the Gunners, but he appears to have a great chance this season. Arteta has a record of promoting youngsters, having made Ethan Nwaneri the youngest player in Premier League history when he brought him on during a 3-0 victory at Brentford in 2022, aged just 15 years and 181 days old.",

      "Harry Maguire admits that Manchester United's lack of European football this season gives them 'no excuses' in the Premier League. Maguire, 32, has said that the extra time to prepare for league matches should be an advantage for his team-mates and boss Ruben Amorim, who'll have more hours to work with them on the training ground.",
      "United manager Amorim often bemoaned the Red Devils' busy schedule after he was appointed in November. Due to having a fixture either in Europe or domestically every three to four days for the vast majority of the campaign, the Portuguese found it even more difficult to implement his system.",
      "But that's been flipped on its head this term. After finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final last time out, Amorim's side won't be in Europe whatsoever.",
      "It's only the second time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 that the Red Devils will go into a season without European football. For Maguire, he sees it as an opportunity to make sure that they're in tip-top condition to enjoy a much better Premier League campaign.",
      "\"I just want to be part of a successful team this season,\" the defender told MUTV. \"I think last season was a tough season for everyone individually, but also as a team, as a squad, as a club.",
      "\"This season, there are no excuses. We're going to have a lot of time to prepare for the Premier League games, and we've got to make sure we're ready. So, for myself, it's making sure I'm available, I'm fit, I'm ready to go, and give everything I can to this team and this club.\"",
      "Maguire added that he and his team-mates know Amorim's system 'a lot better' following their pre-season tour of the USA, where they largely worked on tactics in training. \"It's something that he reiterated, that we didn't have enough time on the training pitch,\" the England international continued.",
      "Where will Manchester United finish this season? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"This pre-season, it's been tough on the legs, but the majority of it has been tactical. So, it's nice to do the drills that are tactical rather than running around poles and running around the pitch.",
      "\"It's been an enjoyable pre-season, but a pre-season that we've all learnt from. We know the system a lot better, and we've just got to take that into the games now.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United look to be lining up a new midfield signing after Ruben Amorim signalled his intention to loan out youngster Toby Collyer, with senior colleague Casemiro identified as a squad player this season.",
      "Amorim has been overseeing a huge rebuild of his squad this summer as he bids to erase the heartache of last season, when the Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League after 18 losses. Marcus Rashford has already departed while four other players have been told to find new clubs.",
      "United have been working on refining their tactics and fitness under Amorim during their pre-season tour in the United States, where they won the Premier League Summer Series, with new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo bedding into the squad.",
      "But while the team have been unbeaten in pre-season so far and look a much improved side, Amorim still isn't satisfied having previously complained that his midfield has \"a lack of pace\".",
      "Collyer was a squad player under Amorim last season as he was given a chance off the bench in ten games and also earned three starts in cup competitions, but the United boss wants more top-level experience to help the team control games.",
      "There have also been concerns over Manuel Ugarte after he struggled in the 2-2 friendly draw with Everton, failing to deal with their physicality and aggressive press.",
      "Casemiro is also not a player Amorim appears to look at with optimism after he showed signs that he was struggling to keep up with the pace of elite football last season.",
      "This season he will be a squad player after he was not mentioned in Amorim's six-man leadership group for the season, despite being included in it under the reign of Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim will be looking to starlet Kobbie Mainoo for the future but for now he will need a suitable option who could play alongside him - or Ugarte.",
      "The club have been linked with moves for Atalanta midfielder Ederson, while Valencia star Javi Guerra is also understood to be a target. Further forward in midfield, United have also been credited with a big-money move for Barcelona's Fermin Lopez.",
      "The biggest priority for Amorim in the transfer market, however, is a new centre forward. The club are in talks to sign Red Bull Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, but face stiff competition from Newcastle, who can offer Champions League football.",

      "The Magpies have identified the Slovenian as their top target in attack with Sesko likely being the replacement for Alexander Isak, who is pushing for a move to Liverpool. Newcastle know that Manchester United too are keen on the Leipzig frontman, but are yet to bid.",
      "It puts Eddie Howe's side in pole position currently to land the striker, who has reportedly told his team-mates in Germany that he will be moving on this summer. Whilst United are interested it is thought that currently they would not pay as much as Newcastle - it comes as United have been slammed for missing out on an Arsenal star after Bruno Fernandes let rip at his team-mates.",
      "Positive talks have been held between Newcastle co-owner Jamie Reuben, Leipzig and the 22-year-old striker, as first reported by the Athletic. Sesko is understood to be open to both projects but Leipzig are adamant that they will not sell until their valuation is met.",
      "The Slovenian is among the brightest young forwards in Europe and the Bundesliga outfit want to ensure they get a fee that reflects that. Leipzig are without Champions League football this term but will not sell their top players on the cheap with some of their other leading lights attracting attention.",
      "Newcastle recently turned down an opening offer of £110m from Liverpool for Isak, who did not feature on the club's recent pre-season tour, citing an injury issue. He was later seen training at former club Real Sociedad.",
      "Isak has now been at St James' Park for three years and has continued to blossom since making a club-record move. He is now among Europe's top strikers but is haggling for a move elsewhere. It is the first time in the Saudi-era at Newcastle that a major name has expressed a desire to push for the exit door, leaving the club with a decision to make.",
      "They value Isak at £150m and are likely to hold out for close to that figure. The Swede has years to run on his contract, meaning Newcastle are not under pressure to sell. They also want to know that they've got a top quality replacement through the door before they consider selling.",
      "Sesko's contract with Leipzig runs through to 2029, but his deal is thought to include a gentleman’s agreement allowing him to leave. He has recorded 39 goals and eight assists in 87 appearances for the German club since moving from RB Salzburg in 2023.",

      "United have already spent in the region of £130million to land Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while Diego Leon arrived this summer after a deal was agreed for the full-back earlier in the year. Former Celtic and Arsenal forward Charlie Nicolas has been left aghast that the team have not tried to work smarter in the transfer window and reckons they should have been in the race for Arsenal signing Christian Norgaard.",

First-choice striker Alexander Isak has been the subject of a rejected bid worth up to £120million from Liverpool, while the expiry of Callum Wilson’s contract leaves prospect William Osula as the club’s only other recognised centre-forward.",

      "talkSPORT have reported that Newcastle have informed Leipzig of their desire for clarity in terms of Sesko's next steps by Wednesday. It is said that the club are confident of reaching an agreement with the German side.",

      "However, the report also claimed that Newcastle feel they must have a clear idea of Sesko’s intentions before the latter half of the week. It is said that Leipzig have yet to receive any formal offers for Sesko, despite recent reports.",
      "Newcastle’s unwillingness to find themselves in a transfer saga is contrary to Man United’s approach to signing Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Despite the club’s public interest in Mbeumo, Man United had several offers turned down before the striker finally arrived at Old Trafford in a deal worth up to £71m. Newcastle wish to avoid replicating a similar scenario with Sesko.",
      "The Isak situation provides Newcastle with extra motivation to accelerate negotiations for Sesko and any other transfer targets. Aside from potentially losing a star player, Howe will want to ensure any new recruits have time to settle before the start of an important season for the club.",
      "When asked if he thought Isak would report back to the club as the squad prepared to return from their pre-season tour of Asia, Newcastle boss Howe said: \"Of course I'd like him to be (there), but whether he will I don’t know at this moment in time. We have been here with the time difference, preparing for training and for games. Other people have been dealing with that situation back at home.\"",
      "Isak scored 27 goals across all competitions as Newcastle finally ended their long wait for silverware by winning the Carabao Cup and secured a Champions League spot by finishing fifth in the Premier League. He was brought by Newcastle in for around £63m in August 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko scored 21 goals in 45 games for Leipzig, including four goals in the Champions League. The centre-forward is one of the most sought-after strikers in European football, having thrived during his spells in Austria and Germany.",

      "The 27-year-old came off the bench at half-time and featured for 30 minutes before he was substituted himself. When asked about his decision to take Rashford off, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick explained: \"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury.\"",
      "Rashford also featured off the bench in a 6-3 win over FC Seoul on Thursday before netting his first goal for Barcelona against Daegu on Monday. Rashford once again came off the bench, replacing Robert Lewandowski at half-time, and he found the back of the net after latching on to a cross from Eric Garcia.",
      "Speaking ahead of the game, Rashford shared his ambitions for the new season, stating: \"It's been a good preseason and we're ready for the start of the season. I've integrated quite well and I'm adapting to the team and the coach.",
      "\"There are a lot of great players here, but I knew that before I came. The quality is very high and the intensity too, and that’s what we need to maintain throughout the season.\"",
      "When asked if he has a goal-scoring target, Rashford replied: \"As many as I can. I know it will be different for me to play in another country and in a different style of football, but I accept the challenge and will try to score as many goals as possible.\"",
      "Rashford is yet to be registered to play in La Liga this season due to Barcelona's financial woes, but the England international has insisted he is not concerned about the situation. \"I'm not worried about my registration,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it's something the club needs to resolve, and I'm confident it will happen. I'm focused on training and being ready for the start of the season.\"",
      "Rashford was part of a five-man 'bomb squad' at Old Trafford before his move to Barcelona and he is the only one of those five players who has left so far. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have also been frozen out and are expected to leave this summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are hoping for a clean slate this season after their disastrous 2024-25 campaign and it's been a case of so far, so good as far as this pre-season is concerned.",
      "Ruben Amorim has taken his players for a tour of the United States and they are yet to lose a game in pre-season, though the coach will primarily be focusing on the squad's fitness levels and how they are adapting to his tactics.",
      "United have wrapped up the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for big money fees and both players started against Everton on Sunday, though after a 2-2 draw it showed Amorim still has work to do on the best way to accommodate his new stars.",
      "The performance was probably United's worst of pre-season so far but Amorim's side certainly have shown signs of improvement since last season and they still have another friendly to come against Fiorentina before their huge Premier League opener against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "What United need from their captain is to be blunt and tell it like it is and that's exactly what they've got from Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The Portugal star was at risk of leaving after an approach from Saudi club Al-Hilal and fans will be grateful he decided to stay put - because he is exactly the kind of figure this team needs to get back to the level they desire.",
      "Even after a friendly game, Fernandes showed he wasn't happy with the performance and accused his team-mates of being \"lazy\" during the game - even though United ended up winning the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United twice relinquished the lead after Fernandes himself scored from the penalty spot before Mason Mount put the team back ahead in the second half - with Iliman Ndiaye and an Ayden Heaven goal pegging them back.",
      "\"It’s improving, but it’s not where we want it to be,” Fernandes said. “It’s a game of football, there’s always passion there. Whatever happens, happens. There was nothing spicy there, it’s normal, it is part of the game.",
      "\"It’s been positive [the US tour] and it’s good to create a bond with the players. We looked a bit lazy today and we need to change that.\"",
      "Fernandes' bold and brutal comments will stand United in good stead for the season to come as it shows he won't stand for any more sloppiness for the team - something they cannot afford if they want to push on as a club.",
      "United only have two new signings so far and most supporters will tell you they needed arrivals from across the board given their woeful season. Despite being unbeaten in pre-season, it's been obvious this summer that United are crying out for more depth.",
      "Starting from the back of the team, it's clear United are lacking a new goalkeeper given Andre Onana's injury and question marks over his back-up Altay Bayindir, who is thought to want more regular game time.",
      "Onana has also come under fire for some high profile errors and United could really do with more competition in between the sticks, while the team could also do with more depth in defence and midfield - not to mention up front after the clear struggles in attack last season.",
      "Fernandes spoke about the need for more signings in his rant after the Everton game and said the team were crying out for more competition to help the players up their game.",
      "\"I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about,\" he said. \"I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko is just one of the players United are interested in and they have already opened talks with Red Bull Leipzig over his signature - but face stiff competition from Newcastle, who can offer him Champions League football.",
      "United lined up with Mbeumo and Cunha in attack against Everton as Amorim took a tactical gamble by playing a 3-4-1-2 formation, but neither player is an out-and-out centre-forward and prefer being out wide.",
      "The team will be deadly if they can get Mbeumo and Cunha either side of a clinical finisher like Sesko, who fired in 21 goals in all competitions last season and 18 in the season before. He is currently rated at £70m.",
      "United still have Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee at their disposal, but the later is currently injured and the former still has a long way to go in showing he is dependable.",
      "Hojlund did score in the 4-1 friendly win over Bournemouth and the fact he has been included in United's travelling group in the United States - and not left behind with \"the bomb squad\" of unwanted players - shows Amorim still has faith in him.",
      "Recent reports have claimed that Amorim believes the arrival of a top class striker like Sesko will bring out the best in Hojlund and force him to take his game to the next level.",
      "Having the two players in the team - alongside Mbeumo and Cunha and existing talent like Amad - can give United a new layer of firepower this season and that might be the difference to push the team up the table.",
      "Amorim has shown that once he falls out with a player, it is difficult to find a way back and it appears the ship has sailed with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho wasn't happy with his manager after he dropped him for the Europa League final and immediately suggested he wanted out of United - with the player subsequently left out of the club's pre-season tour.",
      "He has been strongly linked with a move to Aston Villa or Chelsea in this window and with a move yet to come to fruition, Amorim suggested that any United player who was currently frozen out had a chance of being reintegrated if they didn't find a new club.",
      "But his recent comments on Garnacho suggests there is no going back in their relationship after he claimed their relationship simply didn't work - and he could not put his finger on why.",
      "\"I think Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" Amorim said. \"And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Just like Fernandes, you want your manager to be a no-nonsense coach that pulls no punches and takes no prisoners.",
      "Amorim has raised eyebrows at Old Trafford with his candid statements on the team and brutal assessments about where they are at this moment in time. That's all fine, but those words have to be followed up with action on the pitch.",
      "He's already admitted this is the 'worst Manchester United team in history\" and recently said he knew his team would struggle in games last season, but luckily he is making moves to overhaul the squad to combat their woes.",
      "Amorim has isolated the players who he feels don't gel in his squad and aren't part of his plans - Rashford, Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia - while Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans have left on free transfers.",
      "He's brought in two new signings and is plotting more - and revealed he was happy with the improvement he's seen from the team this summer so far.",
      "But his lengthy recent interview also set out his ambition and long-term plans for United after claiming he wanted to stay at Old Trafford for 20 years and follow in Sir Alex Ferguson's footsteps. It remains to be seen whether he can bring success to the club in the long term, but his attitude and bold steps he's taken certainly gives the team of chance of reaching that.",
      "\"I want to stay, I want to stay 20 [years],\" Amorim said. \"That is my goal and I truly believe in that. Something will happen. It always does. In some moments I will be lucky.",
      "\"I had a lot of luck during my career as a manager and my idea is to stay for many years. But again we know that the results will dictate that. I know that last season I used all the credits but I'm ready to start fresh.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas has slammed Manchester United over their transfer business this summer. The Scotsman believes the likes of new Gunners star Christian Norgaard and Newcastle shot-stopper Aaron Ramsdale should've been pursued.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have added two offensive weapons this window so far in the form of £62.5million Matheus Cunha and £71m Bryan Mbeumo. Teenage left-back Diego Leon has been their only other acquisition.",
      "A move for a striker seems on the cards with Benjamin Sesko, also a target for the Magpies, being priority No. 1 for the Red Devils. Yet Nicholas, who played over 175 times for Arsenal, has lambasted the club for what he believes to be a sub-par recruitment round, questioning why the likes of Ramsdale were not looked at.",
      "\"There are a lot of players out there, a whole list who I think would be better than what Manchester United currently have,\" Nicholas exclaimed to Sky Bet. \"I just don't know where they see themselves going.\"",
      "Nicholas went on to raise questions about two players who have made moves this summer for fees that wouldn't break the bank: Norgaard, who arrived at the Emirates in July for £12m, and Ramsdale, who joined Newcastle on loan from Southampton last week.",
      "\"If I was Manchester United, why didn't they go in for Christian Norgaard? It looks as if they've waited for two high-profile players,\" continued Nicholas.",
      "\"But I look at them and I think, why are not adding more players like Norgaard, or players who have played well at Bournemouth and Newcastle, you could disrupt things and see who's interested.",
      "\"There are so many pillars I just can't understand, the whole lack of authority defensively and what is the current situation with the goalkeeper?",
      "\"Why don't they go and get Aaron Ramsdale? He's qualified, he knows the circuit, he's English, experienced, and competitive. I know Ramsdale hasn't won too much, but it's not far off what United have won.",
      "\"I just don't see how they see what an upgrade means. I don't see Manchester United fans showing one bit of excitement as it stands right now, and it's getting close for them to get aggressive towards the club again.\"",
      "Securing the services of a new star between the sticks is supposedly on the Old Trafford agenda this summer after Andre Onana suffered a substandard campaign last time out.",
      "Aston Villa No. 1 Emi Martinez looks destined to wave goodbye to Villa Park, but a United loan proposal for the Argentine was reportedly rejected last month. Head coach Amorim was asked about the prospect of signing a new goalkeeper before the window closes, and didn't rule the proposition out.",
      "\"To hope is a strong word,\" Amorim responded when asked if he hoped to bring in a new keeper or striker. \"We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.\"",

      "Alan Shearer has pinpointed two key areas Manchester United must address in the transfer market – and it seems the club agree with his verdict. Ruben Amorim's side have completed two high-profile moves but the iconic striker believes the club still need several more new recruits at Old Trafford.",
      "United wasted no time in snapping up Matheus Cunha from Wolves after meeting his £62.5million price tag. Manager Ruben Amorim has since bolstered his forward line further by clinching a deal for ex-Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo, which could reach £71m, with the forward making his first appearance in their draw with Everton on Sunday.",
      "United will be determined to bounce back from their woeful 15th-place finish last term and are eager to secure more signings before the transfer window shuts. However, Shearer has insisted that the club needs to bring in new players in two specific areas.",
      "\"Two good signings...they need at least another three, I would say,\" Shearer said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"They need a top-class centre-forward and goalkeeper.\"",
      "While Shearer commended United's recent acquisitions, Gary Lineker delivered a succinct five-word message to the recruitment team: \"They need a lot more. A lot more.\"",
      "It appears United may agree with Lineker and Shearer's assessments. The club are eyeing a move for RB Leipzig's sought-after striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old is also on Newcastle United's radar, with Leipzig reportedly demanding around £70m for the talented young forward.",
      "United are on the hunt for a new number nine to bolster their attacking options, despite Rasmus Hojlund's determination to keep his spot at Old Trafford. Sesko impressed last season with 21 goals and six assists in 45 appearances across all competitions, though Shearer has admitted that a move for striker would be a gamble.",
      "Shearer also suggested that United need to strengthen their goalkeeping options and it is an area of the team that has been the subject of speculation. The Sun have reported that United are searching for a new deputy to Andre Onana, with Antwerp's Senne Lammens emerging as a potential candidate.",
      "The implications of signing Lammens or another backup would likely impact Altay Bayindir's future at United. The 27-year-old joined the club from Fenerbahce, where he was captain, in 2023, but has since made only 11 appearances.",
      "On the field, United had reason to celebrate after clinching the Premier League Summer Series title following a 2-2 draw with Everton, adding to their victories over West Ham and Bournemouth. Post-match, captain Bruno Fernandes criticised the team for being \"a little bit lazy\", but Amorim had no qualms in supporting his captain's call for higher standards.",
      "\"It's saying that they understand the situation. So it's a good feeling. So tomorrow we are going to travel, one day off and we return to Carrington to work,\" Amorim said when asked about Fernandes' comments.",
      "\"Understanding that in this club everything is ups and downs. We understand that, but I prefer that feeling than the other side.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford is better than Nico Williams according to former Barcelona president, Joan Gaspart. The England international arrived at the Camp Nou on a season-long loan from Manchester United with a £26million option to buy earlier this summer, with his long-term future at Old Trafford far from certain.",
      "At 27 and in the prime of his playing career, Rashford will go down as one of the most impressive Manchester United academy graduates of all time, but that hasn't prevented him from falling out of favour with new boss, Ruben Amorim. Rashford was dropped by the Portuguese head coach midway through last season and subsequently went on loan to Aston Villa in February.",
      "With his future in the north west still up in the air, he has since joined Barcelona for the upcoming season. Rashford's journey to Catalonia was far from smooth sailing, however, with Barcelona seemingly favouring other top talents this summer before opting for the England international.",
      "Not only did Barcelona register an interest in Liverpool's Luis Diaz, only to be told that the Colombian wasn't for sale, but they also neared the completion of a deal for Athletic Club's Williams, which reportedly fell through at the eleventh hour due to a dispute with regards to a release clause and La Liga registration.",
      "Williams instead returned to Bilbao, before signing a 10-year extension which will see him at the Estadio de Sans Mames until 2035, while Barcelona landed Rashford on a temporary basis. And while many fans of the La Liga giants will be disappointed that they didn't sign Spain international Williams, Gaspart believes that Rashford is more talented than the 23-year-old left winger.",
      "Speaking to El 10 de Barca, Gaspart said: \"First of all, for me, Marcus Rashford is better than Nico. From here on, I don’t care what Inaki [Williams, Nico's brother] might say. The player has used us in a good way – he’s gotten a good contract, and I’m happy for him.",
      "\"I don’t understand Athletic’s anger. I’ve signed many players from Bilbao, and always got along with their president. This is in the past. We have to focus on the season and trust the squad and the exceptional coach we have.\"",
      "It comes as Inaki lambasted Barcelona for their handling of Williams' potential transfer, claiming that they orchestrated a \"media campaign\" to lure his younger brother away from Bilbao. He alleged: \"They launched a media campaign they thought would work. Many of the things said were lies. People weren’t fair to my brother this summer.\"",
      "He added: \"The external noise ruined a lot. At Athletic, we go about things quietly. We don’t leak false stories to pressure players,\" as well as: \"My brother had options everywhere. But he stayed. He’ll play with his family, friends, and girlfriend close by. That means more than money or trophies.\"",
      "Rashford made his unofficial debut for Barcelona in a pre-season friendly against Vissel Kobe last month. The Englishman entered the fray as a half-time substitute for Raphinha, but only graced the pitch for 30 minutes before he was substituted off.",
      "While the incident may have looked a little disrespectful from the outside looking in, manager Hansi Flick was quick to clear the air, explaining that it was a tactical decision to monitor the forward's fitness. He said after the 3-1 win: \"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball.",
      "\"He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",

      "The squad will now fly back to England and return to Carrington. There is now less than two weeks until the new Premier League season gets underway against Arsenal.",
      "The summer transfer window is still open, with United continuing to be linked with several potential new signings. A new striker is the priority for Amorim, with Benjamin Sesko at the top of their list.",
      "Newcastle are battling hard for the RB Leipzig striker's signature, but it has been suggested that United are the current favourites. There are also reports linking United with moves for Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins and Paris Saint-Germain star Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "United have until September 1 to complete their transfer business, and there is likely to be plenty more twists and turns before the window closes next month.",
      "Take a look at all the United news, views and rumours in our dedicated blog below.",
      "Last month, reports emerged suggesting that Amorim was keen to reunite with Hjulmand this summer to bolster the central midfield.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, United could have an opening there as Juventus, who have been keen on the Dane, are now exploring other options.",
      "Among those being considered are believed to be former United loanee Sofyan Amrabat, Brighton’s Matt O’Riley and Spurs star Yves Bissouma.",
      "If a bid for Sesko has been made, this is great news for United.",
      "It is believed that United were only going to bid for the forward if they felt that Sesko favoured them.",
      "Now news that an offer has been launched is circulating, it suggests that the Slovenian may have made his mind up.",
      "United's bid is believed to be valued at just under £74m.",
      "Currently, it is not known which way Sesko will choose this summer.",
      "According to journalist Florian Plettenberg, Sesko has reached full verbal agreements with United and Newcastle over contracts.",
      "Final details with both clubs were agreed last night according to the Sky Sport Deutschland journalist.",
      "Plettenberg believes it is now down to which club can reach an agreement with Sesko first.",
      "This afternoon, RB Leipzig have provided an update on their squad.",
      "In that, they confirmed that striker Sesko has been training with the club but individually away from the rest of his teammates.",
      "The update comes amid reports that United have launched a bid for Sesko.",
      "Bookmakers Betfair have confirmed they have suspended betting on Sesko's move to United this summer with the Reds now seen as overwhelming favourites to sign him.",
      "Betfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom explained:",
      "Having been odds-on 8/15 favourites to sign Benjamin Sesko on Monday, betting is now suspended for Man United to seal a deal for the 22-year-old Slovenian. United have already secured deals for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to boost their attacking ranks this summer. With his future looking unlikely, Rasmus Hojlund is 3/10 to join RB Leipzig, heading in the opposite direction to Sesko.",
      "According to BILD, United are making their move for Sesko.",
      "It is understood that the Reds have launched their first formal bid for the Slovenian.",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein understands the bid is valued at £65m plus £8.7m in add-ons.",
      "United are far from done this summer. We know they want a new centre-forward, with Benjamin Sesko of interest, but what other deals could they complete before the window closes?",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is a prime candidate for an exit and bookmakers Bet365 rate him as a 9/4 chance to stay at the Reds this summer with Chelsea the 4/11 favourites to sign the Argentina international.",
      "Meanwhile, Newcastle are the 1/2 odds-on favourites to sign Sesko with United still a short 6/4 to complete his signature.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's situation is an interesting one. He could be allowed to leave Chelsea this summer and United are 9/4 to sign him. If United do not sign either Sesko or Jackson this summer, Ollie Watkins is an option and he's 4/1 to sign from Aston Villa.",

      "Ratcliffe secured a minority stake in United last year and the club has since been forced to navigate choppy waters since.",
      "The workforce has been slashed and numerous other unpopular decisions have been made across the board.",

      "\"We won't allow some natural optimism and a couple of shiny new signings to deflect from the bigger off-field picture. Jim Ratcliffe chose to get into bed with the Glazers and in our opinion is helping keep them in charge.",

      "Old Trafford or St James' Park? That is the question facing Benjamin Sesko right now.",
      "With just under four weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, the RB Leipzig striker finds himself at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between Manchester United and Newcastle United.",
      "Both clubs are determined to strengthen their respective forward lines ahead of the September 1 deadline and Sesko has emerged as a leading target for the pair of them.",
      "After finishing last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10, United have prioritised attacking signings this summer.",
      "They have brought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively, but they are still missing the most importance piece of the jigsaw in the form of a recognised centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who United are open to selling for £30million, regressed last season, scoring just ten goals in all competitions. Fellow attacker Joshua Zirkzee, who arrived from Bologna last summer, scored seven goals and is not a centre-forward.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap in early-June, United have since been chasing shadows in their striker search. However, it was never unrealistic to suggest sourcing their most important signing could take the most amount of time.",
      "Right now, Sesko occupies top spot on United's wish list. However, unlike Newcastle, they are yet to table a formal offer for the Slovenian international, who scored 21 goals for Leipzig last season.",
      "United do not want to get drawn into a bidding war for the striker, and understandably so, and it is believed they want assurances from Sesko that he wants to move to Old Trafford before potentially making an opening offer.",
      "Despite already spending more than £130m this summer, United are confident of financing a deal for Sesko before overseeing sales. United expect to save £14m this season on Marcus Rashford's wages, they have banked £5m from Chelsea's decision not to sign Jadon Sancho permanently and have raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses inserted in previous sales.",
      "In a better financial position than what was originally anticipated at the start of the window, United have resources available to them to sign Sesko. But is he worth the fee Leipzig are demanding?",
      "As with any transfer pursuit, United's interest in Sesko has split opinion. Many recognise his high ceiling and potential, and also acknowledge his respectable goalscoring record in Germany and Austria, but can United afford to take such a big risk at this moment in time?",
      "On one hand, supporters are within their rights to say yes, acknowledging the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, of which 35 were scored in the Premier League. On the flip side, others believe United should go for somebody who is more established and proven, no doubt mindful of the gamble United took on Hojlund two years ago.",
      "Last week, it was confirmed Ollie Watkins had also made his way onto United's list of options, but Aston Villa are currently refusing to sell him. He has three years left on his contract and scored 16 Premier League goals last season.",
      "However, if United are capable of throwing big-money at Leipzig in an attempt to sign Sesko, they will almost certainly have the funds available to try and change Villa's stance.",
      "Watkins is seven years Sesko's senior, meaning his ceiling is not as high, but what he does boast is a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Despite never scoring 20 goals or more in a Premier League campaign, the England international has reached double figures in each of the last five seasons since joining Villa in 2020, scoring 75 league goals. He has plundered 87 goals in all competitions for Villa.",
      "At 29, Watkins is not necessarily as attractive a signing as what Sesko would be, but there is a stronger likelihood of him coming in and hitting the ground running. He has scored 35 Premier League goals in the last two seasons, assisting 21.",
      "Having already swooped for two of the Premier League's best players in Mbeumo and Cunha this summer, Watkins would be a fitting addition to come in and spearhead United's attack.",
      "Sesko currently sits at the top of the wish list, but it would be foolish to turn a blind eye to Watkins and his record.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

    "body": [
      "Three games, two wins, one draw, eight goals and one trophy marked a positive pre-season tour for Manchester United as they won the Premier League Summer Series in the United States.",
      "Beyond the results and performances, United have looked fitter than at this stage in recent years, the manager is secure and no clouds are hovering over the squad.",
      "United's schedule was more streamlined and Chicago was a perfect base. The Endeavor Health Performance Center they trained at only opened this year and the players could socialise in a superb city with next-to-no hassle.",
      "The past fortnight has provided a promising platform for a successful season. With the transfer window open for four more weeks, United are certain to be active with incomings and outgoings and there are unaddressed issues that were apparent before they took off for Chicago.",
      "Here are five talking points from their tour:",
      "Bruno Fernandes, typically, was one of three players to start all three tour games and scored three goals. Fernandes ended the match against Everton in midfield, where he started against Bournemouth in Chicago.",
      "Fernandes will flitter between the No.10 and the No.8 over the course of the season as United have a surfeit of options to play behind the striker. Even when Matheus Cunha operated as the false nine against Everton, Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Mason Mount had stints as one of the 10s.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is another option as Amorim ponders how to enhance a midfield arguably as in urgent need of an upgrade as up front. Whenever Fernandes eventually departs United, they are not going to require a playmaker for a while.",
      "United's intention to loan out Toby Collyer all but confirms a midfield recruit is lined up. Amorim criticised the \"lack of pace\" in the area after the goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm and he hooked Mainoo before the hour mark against Everton.",
      "The bigger issue in the 2-2 draw was Manuel Ugarte, who was stuck against the Toffees. Everton preyed on Ugarte's limitations and he wilted against an aggressive press. Ugarte sought protection from the referee and when he attempted to match Everton's physicality he committed an obvious foul.",
      "Casemiro is undeniably a squad player and not even in the new six-man leadership group, having been a part of it under Erik ten Hag. Collyer's three career starts have come against teams from Romania, Scotland and League One. Amorim has belief in Mainoo but seems caught between two stools as to his role.",
      "Amorim suggested he was \"happy\" that United underperformed against Everton, easily the least accomplished of their performances, as the players would not be lulled into a false sense of security back at Carrington. This has been a buoyant United tour but the midfield has to be improved.",
      "United's second-best player last season was another playmaker and Amad started behind Rasmus Hojlund in Chicago. In the other two games, he was on the right wing and that appears to be the role Amorim has settled on for him.",
      "Amorim had Geovany Quenda to service Viktor Gyokeres in his final months at Sporting and Amad is a similar profile: a young left-footed winger expected to assume defensive responsibilities whilst offering attacking intent down the right-hand side.",
      "With £133.5million worth of new forwards and the totemic Fernandes in the attacking trident against Everton, United had dexterous playmakers to drop deep and spring through Amad, playing on the shoulder of the last defender. It led to a chance for Cunha and the penalty that Fernandes converted.",
      "Amad played on the wing in Amorim's first United match in charge at Ipswich. Four other wingers are in the bomb squad, either unwilling or incapable of meeting Amorim's demands.",
      "Another 'hidden' attacking asset is Leny Yoro, who is literally stepping up and playing more on the front foot.",
      "One of the last kicks from Rasmus Hojlund in the States was his boot against the post. He was appalled that Patrick Dorgu had shot at goal rather than gone across goal.",
      "Dorgu was well within his rights to shoot. Hojlund may have strayed offside, too. We have become accustomed to that reaction from Hojlund and he vented at Diogo Dalot in Stockholm a little over two weeks ago.",
      "It cannot be easy for Hojlund to continue as United's No.9 when they are enquiring about almost any attainable striker. He is in an identical position to Erik ten Hag last year when United asked every Tom, Dick and Harry if they would take over as manager. Ten Hag remained in situ after the head-hunting but was eventually summoned to the guillotine.",
      "Hojlund is digging his heels in amid United's efforts to flog him but it is unsustainable and could jeopardise the squad harmony. Hojlund was socialising with Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as recently as United's penultimate night in Chicago. United need to be transparent with the Dane.",
      "This has been the most upbeat United pre-season since 2017. The quirk of that is United entered that summer having just won the Europa League final.",
      "Denying the 'bomb squad' members a seat on the plane to Chicago has indubitably helped. The players have publicly backed Amorim's handling of players who have caused him and the club problems. United are not treading on eggshells with Marcus Rashford any more after he was whisked away to Barcelona.",
      "Ten Hag had Jadon Sancho foisted onto him for pre-season last year and his working relationship with Rashford was practically irreparable. Senior figures at United want to provide unequivocal backing for Amorim and his authority is yet to be challenged over his handling of a player.",
      "The days when Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba rode roughshod over the manager are thankfully over.",
      "Andre Onana is expected to be match-fit for the Arsenal fixture but if he isn't then a 39-year-old deserves to be between the sticks for United.",
      "This tour was additional evidence that Altay Bayindir is the third-best of United's senior 'keepers. In a summer where United are exploring the possibility of recruiting a new goalie, it is peculiar that they are not actively looking to shift Bayindir, whose reputation hinges on a couple of penalty saves in a cup tie.",
      "Bayindir was utterly unconvincing again in the draw with Everton whereas Tom Heaton kept competently against Bournemouth. Onana has to demonstrate clear evidence that he has honed his technique when he does return and the first-choice goalkeeper position can be parked for a year.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "Manchester United defender Leny Yoro has been one of the biggest 'winners' of pre-season this summer.",
      "Yoro has impressed in each of his appearances in Stockholm, New Jersey, Chicago and Atlanta, and supporters are excited about what he could achieve with a clean bill of health this season.",
      "The Frenchman's first 12 months in Manchester were disrupted by injuries - and he still made a strong impression. There were clear signs of Yoro's potential in the midst of a hugely challenging season for United and this summer's evidence suggests he is ready to take further steps forward in 2025/2026.",
      "Yoro, 19, is learning on the job and already has the qualities of a top player, which helps to explain why Real Madrid were interested in signing him before his transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Attracting interest from Real Madrid speaks volumes and they were in the race to sign Yoro. However, United submitted a financial package - €62million (£51.8m), with an additional €8m (£6.6m) in add-ons - that Madrid were not prepared to match, as Yoro was in the final year of his Lille contract.",
      "Some suggested United were foolish for paying a significant fee when Yoro's deal was approaching its expiry, but sitting on their hands would have opened the door for Real Madrid to sign him on a free transfer this summer.",
      "United considered Yoro worth the investment and he could make the £51.8m outlay look like value in the coming years. Yoro has the skillset to become world-class and world-class players command much higher fees.",
      "One of the most promising aspects of Yoro's pre-season performances has been his willingness to play out from the back because his passing range is hugely beneficial to build-up play.",
      "It's something Ruben Amorim wants from Yoro, too. \"The coach asked me to do, so I need to do it. I enjoy doing it, being in front, and If I can bring the ball forward then I will do it,\" he said after the Everton draw.",
      "When Yoro made his United debut against Rangers at Murrayfield in Scotland in pre-season last summer, he executed a few sublime passes, leading to jokes that he was a future Ballon d'Or winner.",
      "Those types of passes aren't easy to execute and they were briefly missing from Yoro's locker when he returned from a metatarsal injury in December, but he gradually grew in confidence.",
      "Yoro now looks completely relaxed as a United player and it's exciting to see him pick out long passes again - defenders who can play such passes are a manager's dream to deal with.",
      "Before picking up an ankle injury against West Ham in May, which almost ended Yoro's hopes of playing in the Europa League final, he was outstanding in the left-sided centre-back role.",
      "Most suspected Yoro would be nailed to start in that position in the back-three at the start of the new season, but Amorim has deployed him on the opposite side this summer.",
      "Yoro played on the right side of the defence against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton in the States, and his performances on that side were just as good as those previously produced on the left.",
      "With that in mind, Yoro deserves praise for delivering strong displays on both sides of the back-three. Possessing the skill to be versatile is another string to his bow as he develops.",
      "Real Madrid would have loved to sign Yoro, but they weren't willing to cough up a decent transfer fee for a player in the final year of his contract. And that caution forced them to miss out on a supremely talented young defender.",

      "RB Leipzig have confirmed Benjamin Sesko trained individually on Tuesday as speculation continues to increase about a potential move to Manchester United.",
      "Last month, it was reported that United were prioritising a move for the Slovenia international if they were to sign another striker this summer and informal contact was made with the Bundesliga club.",
      "Now, according to The Athletic, United have submitted a £65.2million plus £8.7m add-ons bid to Leipzig for Sesko. The Reds think that the former Red Bull Salzburg man wants to move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "United's first official proposal, however, comes less than 24 hours after Leipzig received an improved offer from Newcastle United to sign Sesko this summer. The Magpies lodged a first bid - believed to be worth up to £69.8m - for Sesko on Saturday but Leipzig felt that was insufficient and turned it down.",
      "Newcastle have since come in with a second proposal in the region of £78.4m including add-ons. It's unknown whether that is going to be enough for the German side to accept and allow him to leave.",
      "With Sesko's future uncertain, Leipzig have since issued an update on the forward. In a squad update on Tuesday afternoon, Die Rotten Bullen confirmed that Sesko had trained on his own.",
      "After announcing that Andrija Maksimovic and Yan Diomande were absent from training due to visa-related matters, Leipzig then added that Sesko worked individually during their latest session.",
      "In a statement on the club's official website, RB Leipzig said: \"Andrija Maksimovic and Yan Diomande were absent from training on Tuesday to deal with visa-related matters. Benjamin Šeško trained individually.\"",
      "That could be the latest hint that Sesko is going to be on the move this summer, with Amorim's United attempting to beat Newcastle in the race for his signature.",
      "Sesko was left out of the Leipzig squad for their pre-season fixture against Atalanta on Saturday. When asked for the reason behind his omission, head coach Marcel Schafer said it was \"obvious\" why.",
      "Schafer said: \"We won't go into detail on that, but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened.\"",
      "Sesko scored 21 goals in 45 appearances across all competitions for Leipzig last season. He had attracted interest from Arsenal earlier this summer, but the Gunners instead went for Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "He has since emerged as a top target for United as the Reds look to strengthen their forward line. There has been talk that Rasmus Hojlund could be used in a player-plus-cash swap deal in the opposite direction.",

      "Manchester United recruitment director Christopher Vivell has previously outlined the star qualities Benjamin Sesko could bring to Old Trafford.",
      "United, according to The Athletic, have tabled an opening bid for the RB Leipzig striker worth more than £70million. United are said to have offered £65m up front and around £8.7m in performance related add-ons.",
      "United's first official bid for the Slovenia international comes following a second offer from Premier League rivals Newcastle United. The Magpies' second offer was reportedly worth £67.9m up front plus add-ons.",
      "United are desperate to strengthen their attacking options ahead of the transfer window closing on September 1 and Sesko has emerged as a top target. He is considered to be one of Europe's most promising strikers and he scored 21 goals for Leipzig last term.",
      "If Sesko chooses a switch to Old Trafford, he will be reunited with United recruitment guru Vivell, who was working at Leipzig at the time of him joining the club from RB Salzburg in 2023.",
      "Having worked on the deal that saw Sesko join Leipzig from their sister club, Vivell knows all there is to know about the 22-year-old, and he has previously detailed his key strengths, admitting he has \"enormous potential\".",
      "\"Benjamin Sesko is among the game's top young talents and has enormous potential to become a top player,\" Vivell told the Bundesliga website. \"He has all the qualities to do that.",
      "\"He's extremely quick, has a great jump on him and is strong in the air. Benjamin is a real goalscorer, who despite his 1.95m (6'4\") is mobile and technically strong.",

      "Sesko, 22, who scored 21 goals in 45 matches for Leipzig last season, has emerged as one of the most sought-after attackers in European football. Arsenal were interested in a move earlier this summer, but the Gunners instead went for Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP. Meanwhile, Newcastle United are pushing to bring Sesko to St James' Park and have so far made two offers to Leipzig, with the second coming in at around £78.4 million.",

      "It is no secret RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has claimed residency at the top of United's wish list, but they face staunch competition from Newcastle United for his signature.",
      "After reaching an agreement to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves on the opening day of the transfer window at the beginning of June, United were expected to get signings through the door at pace, particularly when it emerged they were interested in signing Bryan Mbeumo the following day.",
      "However, negotiations with Brentford took weeks, so much so he did not finalise his switch to Old Trafford until July 21. With that in mind, United are unlikely to rush into making an offer for Sesko just because Newcastle have made their move.",

      "The 'celebrations' were obviously muted, but the vibes around United at the end of the pre-season tour are undeniably better compared to the mood in the days building up to the trip across the Atlantic.",
      "The signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for an initial £65million, announced a day before the flight to the USA, was the catalyst for a more optimistic outlook. It was important to sign Mbeumo in time to travel to the States, and there have been green shoots elsewhere in the friendlies.",
      "United have looked fitter, well-organised and capable of hurting their opponent in the final third. The players were handed individual fitness regimes during their holiday this summer and it seems to have paid off.",
      "Ruben Amorim's decision to exile players who had fallen below expectations has also seemed to pay off, with the players on the USA tour discussing the improved culture and morale in the dressing room.",
      "Amorim has banished the bad eggs. There is a feeling of harmony within the group and the players have seemed notably upbeat during sessions at the Endeavor Health Performance Centre.",
      "The performances themselves have been better. United cruised to victories against West Ham and Bournemouth, although the draw against Everton in the final game was a reminder that there is further work to do.",
      "For all the positivity on tour, some of the old problems remain, particularly in midfield, which is an area that Amorim needs to strengthen before the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "United struggled with Everton's physicality in midfield and will struggle throughout the campaign if a fresh face is not added. Amorim also needs to sign a striker, potentially Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Speaking during half-time against Everton, Berrada spoke about transfers and promised that club officials are working long hours to ensure Amorim's squad receives additional reinforcements.",
      "“We have to do a lot of multitasking,\" he said. \"We have a team back home led by Jason, the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad. There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it.”",
      "Berrada continued: “The mood has been very good. The culture, the standards, the values, we are trying to ensure that we create a team spirit that allows the players to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We have very high standards, Ruben is very clear about that and so is Jason [Wilcox]. It is something we want to see with the players, with the staff, with everyone, because what we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.",
      "“Of course, adding players helps. We have seen the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon. They have adapted really well.",
      "\"We are going to see Bryan play for the first time, Matheus has already shown his quality and Diego has shown that he is adapting very quickly, having just come from Paraguay, so all of the signs are positive and we are cautiously optimistic. We hope we are going to have a great season.”",
      "Berrada also said the right things during another brief interview to MUTV on the money-spinning post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong in May.",
      "Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha should prove to be tremendous signings, but more high-quality additions are required to get United into a position to challenge for European football.",
      "Amorim said United \"need to return to Europe\" during his captivating chat with journalists on tour. United need to sign a midfielder and a striker to have a chance of achieving that goal this season.",
      "The mood has improved at Old Trafford, but there is still work to do before deadline day.",

      "Manchester United have made Benjamin Sesko their transfer priority this summer and it appears it is just themselves and Newcastle left in the race for his signature.",
      "At the moment, it appears that Sesko is torn, with the Magpies holding the luxury of Champions League football while United can offer him the chance to play a crucial role in Ruben Amorim's rebuild. Indications at present suggest that Sesko may well favour the Reds.",
      "However, there is still the matter of negotiating a fee with RB Leipzig which could throw up a hurdle for United considering that finances remain tight for Amorim and co. It is looking likely that United will need to spend around £70m for Sesko which shall only be affordable if player sales are agreed.",
      "Therefore, there is a chance that United may not be able to sign Sesko even if the Slovenian decides that he wants to move to Old Trafford. If that scenario plays out, the Reds will need to look at alternatives.",
      "It was suggested earlier in the summer that Jamie Vardy could be considered as a last resort option on a free transfer which would largely split opinions in the fanbase considering his age. Fortunately, there is another option who would likely be cheaper than Sesko but still provide a longer term solution than Vardy.",
      "Former Brentford forward Ivan Toney is currently plying his trade in Saudi Arabia with Al Ahli and has impressed, bagging 30 goals in all competitions last season. This form earned him a call-up to the England national team at the end of the campaign under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Toney has previously been linked with a move to Old Trafford. Erik ten Hag was credited by ESPN with interest only to decide that Joshua Zirkzee was a better fit for his system.",
      "The 29-year-old returned to the United conversation this week as he commented: \"Let's go my son,\" underneath Bryan Mbeumo's social media post marking his debut for the club. At Brentford, Toney formed a lethal partnership with Mbeumo and clearly the pair remain close.",
      "If United have to pivot away from Sesko, Toney could be a safe option. He has played as a lone striker before, has excelled in the Premier League and already has an existing relationship with a key new addition to this squad.",
      "United may not be able to pay him what Al Ahli are, considering their new wage structure. But, perhaps Toney could be open to a wage cut considering he could move back to the Premier League, be a key player and increase his chances of being on the plane to the World Cup next summer.",
      "This is the sort of scenario Amorim will genuinely need to consider if a deal for Sesko cannot be completed.",

      "Borussia Dortmund are considering re-signing Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho.",
      "Sancho's relationship with Erik ten Hag broke down in September 2023 and he returned on loan to Signal Iduna Park for a second stint with Dortmund during the second half of that season.",
      "The winger signed for Chelsea on a season-long loan in 2024/2025, but the London club made an unprecedented decision to break their obligation to sign Sancho permanently after falling to agree on wages.",

      "Sancho has been linked with Juventus and Fenerbahce, but has still not found a new club in August.",
      "However, Dortmund's sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, was more forthcoming: “[Jadon] is constantly being linked with us. I understand the desire. We’re thinking about it within our possibilities. The conditions have to be right. We will definitely do something, but we’re limited.”",

      "Clubs and fans seem terrified of the ‘selling club’ branding that everyone bar Real Madrid should embrace. Spurs and Newcastle must be more Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Modern football fandom is beset with two-word comebacks that should really go directly in the bin.",
      "Lazy, tribal, point-scoring shitpost retorts to shitpost statements. ‘Warra trophy’. ‘Cry more’. ‘Rent free’.",
      "But there’s one two-word sobriquet that most clubs themselves appear to fear above all others, when in reality it belongs in the same social-media bonfire as the rest.",
      "‘Selling club’.",
      "It is a desperate moniker to become saddled with, a slur almost impossible to shake once it has taken hold. It’s one that speaks to so many of football’s wider talking points: of profit above glory; of placing more emphasis on the balance sheet than the league table; of, at the most basic level, a lack of ambition.",
      "But there is something else very important about it, and that is the fact it is complete and utter and total bollocks. There is an utter bereft hollow meaninglessness at the core of the jet-black soul of ‘Selling Club’.",
      "Because do you know which clubs are selling clubs? Almost all of them. And with the possible exception of Real Madrid, for any club that is not a ‘selling club’ at this time it is down to either rank incompetence or not for the want of trying.",
      "Manchester United have spent much of the summer desperately trying to be a selling club. Tottenham and Arsenal both historically suck at the art of selling players.",
      "With Spurs they either sell players long after the need has become obvious, or grudgingly unwillingly let star names go at the peak of their value but in such a way that no useful reinvestment of that windfall can ever follow.",
      "Arsenal are simply incapable of selling players at all. At least, not for any meaningful value. The £22m they received from Real Madrid for Nicolas Anelka 25 years ago remains one of their biggest ever player sales, and that’s just plain nutty.",
      "Against these you have Liverpool and Manchester City, who are just much better at it. Liverpool will not have entered this summer thinking “WE SIMPLY MUST SELL LUIS DIAZ” but at the same time knew there was a price that was worth selling him at, and when someone offered it they accepted.",
      "And it’s not an isolated case. Unlike Arsenal or Spurs, they are happy enough to cash in on even talented homegrown players when the right offer comes along. Our gut feel is that if Jarell Quansah was at Spurs or Arsenal, they would not have sold him for £30m.",
      "But that readiness and willingness to trade in the market is a big factor in why Liverpool have been able to spend as they have this summer.",
      "The way in which they reaped the benefits of selling Philippe Coutinho for the very daftest of money has entered football legend, and those benefits continue to be felt to this day.",
      "Man City operate similarly. They spend plenty, but they are better than most at recouping it as well. There are inevitably mistakes along the way with this approach. Cole Palmer, for instance. But who can really argue with City’s decision to move on Raheem Sterling or Ferran Torres or Gabriel Jesus or Leroy Sane at prices around the £50m mark.",
      "Even though selling Julian Alvarez for around £70m left them short at times last season, it’s hard to argue that wasn’t reasonable business for an understudy.",
      "But again, it’s simply not a deal one can imagine Spurs or Arsenal or Man United pulling off at this time.",
      "A shrewder club than Spurs might, for instance, have considered cashing in on Brennan Johnson this summer. His stock is high after scoring the winning goal in Bilbao, and he is a player who catches the eye because he is very, very good at one particular thing: arriving late and finding space in the penalty area to score from close-range when his opposite number or full-back puts a cross into the box.",
      "It’s certainly a very useful skill to have, and in the right team is absolutely deadly. He is also really quite average at almost everything else. There were many potential ways to upgrade there for minimal or even no financial outlay.",
      "But it’s simply not the way Spurs operate. Always the most painfully self-aware of the fragility of their ‘Big Six’ status, Spurs are perhaps more afeared than anyone of selling any player who might still have some value. Instead they end up with a stockpile that leaves them quite unable to name an even halfway coherent Champions League squad and a logjam for incomings as well thanks to a squad that pulls off the trick of being both bloated yet desperately lacking in so many key areas.",
      "While there are some teams who are good at selling and some that are bad, there needs to be a separate category altogether for Chelsea. We are grudgingly and confusedly coming round to the view that their objectively insane transfer strategy might just be the most correct one for an insane world.",
      "Theirs is not necessarily a route open to other clubs in the way the City and Liverpool blueprints are. And Chelsea have always been pretty handy at this even in the Abramovich days. But under Clearlake they have leaned into it so successfully that even their stupidest signings end up stupid like a fox.",
      "Spent over £30m on Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for some reason? Don’t worry, Everton will make sure you wipe your feet.",
      "Overspent on Joao Felix even after watching him go through a deeply unimpressive loan spell with absolutely no obvious reason to expect anything different on a permanent basis? Here comes the Saudi gravy train.",
      "Burnley are going to give them £20m for Armando Broja as well as a similar amount for Lesley Ugochukwu and £14m for Bashir Humphreys.",
      "And it’s not just teams lower down the foodchain who very much enjoy handing Chelsea vast sums of money. Arsenal simply cannot get enough of handing Chelsea vast sums of money.",
      "We’re not saying there’s anything particularly admirable about Chelsea’s vast football player megamart where players are bought and sold for absurd fees and daft contracts, but there’s something extraordinary about their ability to make their successes vast and even their failures, at worst, not that costly.",
      "Someone, somewhere will, over the weeks ahead, cough up £80m for Nicolas Jackson. And you have to say that’s magnificent.",
      "As Spurs make announcements about Radu Dragusin that declare their fifth-choice centre-back will be wearing the number three shirt next season, other clubs are actually selling these players and getting something for them. Like Vinted but for billionaires.",
      "Newcastle are told time and again they must not sell Alexander Isak because it would make them a ‘selling club’. But that’s only true if they don’t actually spend that money on improving the team and the squad.",
      "Because the boring reality behind the ‘selling club’ slur is that what you’re actually describing is a trading club.",
      "And that is what almost all football clubs are, or should strive to be. It was always true, but never more so than now with PSR and squad limits ready to hurt those who can’t get this right."

      "Man Utd will ‘end up’ signing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko this summer despite Newcastle’s latest bid, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils are desperate to sign a new striker this summer after Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee managed just seven Premier League goals between them last campaign.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term and now INEOS have made Sesko their priority centre-forward target.",
      "However, Man Utd face top competition from Newcastle, in fact the Geordies are the only side currently negotiating a fee with RB Leipzig.",
      "It was revealed on Monday evening that Newcastle had made a new offer worth €90m in order to try and satisfy the Bundesliga club’s demands for Sesko.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano wrote on X: ‘Newcastle have sent official bid to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Šeško worth €90m package. €80m plus €10m add-ons on the table from #NUFC. No decision yet from the player.",
      "READ: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "‘Manchester United confirmed again to RB Leipzig that they will bid if Šeško picks them.’",

      "But football finance expert Stefan Borson has predicted that Man Utd will end up signing Sesko and hoping they can offload Hojlund before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “Newcastle now are going to be in a position where because they’ve missed out on so many players, are they going to be pressured into overpaying or overpromising for a player like Sesko?",
      "“It’s going to be interesting to see. It’s almost impossible to know whether it’s a good price or not. If he works, you’ve got a striker for 10 years, and if he fails, then it’s just another £65million down the tube.",
      "“What could United get for Hojlund? Maybe half the money back, and that’s the nature of these transfers. I don’t think the fee itself is going to put anybody off.",
      "“I think it’s more United will just be looking at it and going can we sell before we buy ideally and, if not, then are we prepared to invest another £65million, with maybe £30million down, and the wages are obviously going to be significant for this player.",
      "“So, it becomes a financial decision.",
      "“I would think United probably end up with him and kind of just cave in timing-wise, just taking the decision to buy him and hoping that they can sell towards the end of the window.”",
      "Man Utd are looking to recoup around £30m for Hojlund this summer with Caught Offside revealing on Monday that former Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag is ‘pushing hard’ to take the Dane to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Speaking on his future after a recent pre-season win over Bournemouth, Hojlund told reporters: “I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused, and then obviously we’ll see what happens.",
      "“I think my plan is very clear, and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I’m more than ready. I’m feeling sharp so I welcome everything that comes.”",
      "Hojlund added: “I’m still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I’m only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",

      "Fjortoft wrote on X: ‘Re: Sesko I fully respect Manchester United’s stance in saying, “We only want players who genuinely want to play for us.” That principle is admirable and important for building the right culture.",
      "‘However, the current situation with RB Leipzig highlights the challenge of that strategy in the real market. Newcastle have made a strong bid, reportedly €80m plus €10m in add-ons, putting pressure on any competing club.",
      "‘As the selling club, RB Leipzig’s objective is straightforward: to secure the best possible deal. For Manchester United, this means two things must happen: a) Convince the player that United is the right move, not just emotionally, but also in terms of sporting project and ambition. b) Convince RB Leipzig that United can at least match Newcastle’s offer, whether through direct financial terms (a bid) or other guarantees. Without both, this becomes very difficult.’",
      "Fjortoft later added: ‘Subject: Re: Sesko Fresh updates from Leipzig this morning: the club still expects Manchester United to submit a bid. The key questions now are: Is this just a tactic to buy more time? Or are they trying to pressure Newcastle into raising their offer even further? Don’t forget- Newcastle’s deadline expires today.’",

      "After taking well over a month to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United are continuing their one-iron-in-the-transfer-fire approach by putting all of their efforts into signing a new No.9 this summer.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the man they want and we can safely assume a first formal bid – if and when it arrives – will fall short of the mark, like the second formal bid, and maybe even a third, before Sir Jim Ratcliffe holds his hands up and pays the piper.",
      "Either that or Sesko chooses Newcastle, which will be absolutely fine by Ruben Amorim, who has become perhaps the greatest-ever purveyor of the This Is Manchester United call to arms, despite being – or perhaps because he is – the worst Manchester United manager in the Premier League era.",
      "After a harrowing first season and with so-called ‘bad eggs’ either moving to Barcelona or currently training away from the rest of the squad while seeking an exit, Amorim has set his sights on footballers with a genuine love for Manchester United.",
      "By all accounts he’s found that deep-seated adoration in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, to whom he offered telling, on-brand advice before they decided to make their dream moves.",
      "“In the meetings with Bryan, with Cunha, we said that. Don’t go to a club because of the manager. Go because of the idea of the club. And they are here because of the idea of the club.”",
      "It’s a non-negotiable he’s stayed true to throughout the transfer window having made the vow before the end of last season when asked about a possible approach for Viktor Gyokeres: “We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.”",
      "It’s a requirement of any aspiring United player which nearly cost Amorim the signing of Mbeumo, and may well have resulted in the club paying over the odds for the 25-year-old, with Brentford not at all happy that they approached him before them.",
      "But with innumerable post-Sir Alex Ferguson signings seeing a move to Old Trafford as a means to a hefty pay cheque and as their final destination in the worst possible ‘f*** it, I’ve made it’ sort of way, bringing about a whole club malaise that’s seen them plumb extraordinarily low depths, Amorim has quite rightly identified hunger as the key trait in new signings beyond them being excellent at football. If only it didn’t then take so bleeding long to sign them.",
      "We’re aware that a football club that “would have been bust by Christmas” had it not been for the lunch-denying, ticket price-increasing, redundancy king isn’t flush enough to be making offers for multiple players in multiple positions at the same time, but this linear approach to a transfer window has already cost Amorim the chance of a pre-season with a new striker, and threatens to leave him without another much-needed addition when the season starts in less than two weeks.",
      "They clearly have and have had the funds to sign all of Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Sesko, so why not look to sign them at the same time rather than waiting for one to be confirmed before moving onto the next? It’s like a toddler eating a meal from highest-value item to lowest. Don’t forget the central midfield broccoli, guys.",
      "Omar Berrada promised in June to “do our best to do more signings quickly”, adding that “when you’re not quick it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money”.",
      "So far they’ve met Cunha’s £62.5m release clause, took 44 days between first contact with Mbeumo and paying Brentford £17m over his market value to sign him, and are currently waiting to either pay the €80m Leipzig want on the terms they set for Sesko or walking away from a deal for a player who’s certainly now the club’s top target if not necessarily Amorim’s – he’s keen on Ollie Watkins – before presumably making a late-window dash to sign a central midfielder.",
      "Because let’s be absolutely clear – Amorim really needs a new central midfielder. He’s walking into a season knowing that none of his current possible pairings will work. Fabrizio Romano has revealed they dropped their not-so-secret interest in Joao Palhinha as Amorim decided he wanted a “less holding defensive midfielder – still defensive but with more intensity in their vision”.",
      "They don’t have that guy, and although they’ve been linked with Sporting’s Morten Hjulmand and Valencia’s Javi Guerra while ignoring the midfielder Romano is essentially describing there in Douglas Luiz, judging by the strategy of the transfer window thus far, United won’t even have made contact with a preferred option, let alone asked for the requisite pictures of them in a Cristiano Ronaldo shirt as a ten-year-old before initiating club-to-club talks.",
      "Amorim is to blame for the Sesko hold-up in so much as United are waiting for the striker to ‘commit’ to them over Newcastle before making a bid. But that in no way stops his bosses from multi-tasking. A lack of funds may do, but amid claims throughout the window that United must sell before they buy, they’ve sold precisely no-one and yet are prepared to take their spending to well over £200m if they get the green light from Sesko.",
      "The transfer window will be a success if United sign a striker and midfielder thanks to Amorim’s hard-and-fast rule on those new signings, but the start to his second season has been hamstrung by the club’s apparent inability to negotiate two signings at the same time.",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed what was said to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in transfer talks to help Manchester United beat Newcastle to signing them.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is reportedly excited at the prospect of Benjamin Sesko joining with the Red Devils ‘very optimistic’ a deal will get done.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s ‘spending is to continue’ after landing Benjamin Sesko as they will turn their attention to a new top target.",
      "Man Utd fans may have to settle for another year of Rasmus Hojlund up top after Ruben Amorim suggested he was happy with the Dane leading the line.",
      "The Manchester United push to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle is not being ‘driven’ by Ruben Amorim, who ‘prefers’ an alternative.",
      "Man Utd’s ‘next three signings’ have been ‘revealed’ as Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive” the remaining four members of the bomb squad."

      "“I expected them to do more to sign Emiliano Martinez, but I am told that interest hasn’t gone away. Whether it’s him or somebody else, they want a new goalkeeper before the window closes.",
      "“Aston Villa might have to sell somebody so United want to take advantage of that. I think Martinez is a very, very good goalkeeper who would be a major improvement on what they’ve got, and it seems the club agree with my view of things.",
      "“Obviously, they haven’t been able to sell Onana, but I’m not sure how much of an issue that will be. They wanted to do that before signing Martinez, but the interest just hasn’t been there and it looks like he’s going to be staying.",

      "Jackson is said to be ‘high’ among the options for clubs in the Premier League and Europe due to his ‘suitability and availability’, while he is ‘at risk of not being the primary forward and will want to be the main man somewhere’.",

      "Every summer, the likes of Fabrizio Romano, Florian Plettenberg and Gianluca Di Marzio declare that one transfer could trigger a ‘domino effect’. It never does. And yet, we delude ourselves into thinking it might.",
      "But…this summer, it just might.",
      "The potential domino effect doesn’t simply surround signing replacements, but also raising the funds to go out and sign a top target. That’s a strong factor this summer, anyway.",
      "With everything taken into account, we’ve predicted what will happen in the striker market before the 2025 summer transfer window closes. Here are ten different dominos set to fall this month.",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko to Newcastle United\nThere’s only one deal that can truly get the ball rolling, and that’s Sesko to Newcastle United.",
      "The RB Leipzig and Slovenia striker was under consideration at Arsenal before they swerved toward the Viktor Gyokeres lane, going all in on signing him after deeming Leipzig’s demands for Sesko too steep.",
      "It’s reported that the Bundesliga club want a guaranteed £65million, some add-ons, and a percentage of a future sale.",
      "Newcastle thought they’d have an opening bid worth £65m + £4m in add-ons accepted, but David Ornstein says it has been deemed ‘insufficient’ over in Germany. The add-ons weren’t enough, or maybe it was the lack of a future fee guarantee – we’re not entirely sure.",
      "Either way, the Magpies need to return with another offer, or Manchester United could swoop in. They have no intention of selling Alexander Isak before having a replacement sorted, so unless Liverpool cough up £150m over the next few days, we can’t see that transfer being the one that triggers the domino.",
      "The Red Devils are still in the picture but haven’t made a bid for Sesko…yet. If they get an indication that the 22-year-old prefers them to Newcastle, they’ll probably sign him. They need to sell but could get Sesko and work that out later, with Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho all available for transfer.",
      "In an ideal world for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, they’ll bring in around £100m and significantly reduce the wage bill in the process.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak to Liverpool\nAssuming Sesko to Newcastle is the first domino to fall, the door will be firmly open for Isak to complete a dream move to Anfield.",
      "The Premier League champions remain in a strong financial position despite already spending £263m. They’ve been sensible enough in the transfer market over the years to enable such an expensive outlay, and recently sold Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich for £65m and Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.",
      "Newcastle signing Sesko doesn’t completely force their hand when it comes to selling Isak either; they’ve always wanted to sign another striker this summer and are still working on a deal to sign Brentford’s Yoane Wissa.",
      "Isak didn’t travel to Asia for the Magpies’ pre-season tour and has burned some bridges with the club’s fanbase through his attempts to force a move to Liverpool. Many don’t want to see him don the black and white stripes again, while others accept the situation and would do anything for their elite centre-forward to stay ahead of a Champions League campaign.",
      "That’s extremely unlikely, and Isak’s move to Liverpool feels like a case of when, not if.",
      "MORE ON ISAK TO LIVERPOOL\n👉 Liverpool ‘have played a blinder’ over Isak to ‘gazump’ Newcastle ‘no matter what’\n👉 £150m Alexander Isak would *actually* be the ninth most expensive Premier League player ever\n👉 Liverpool swap for Isak worth a ‘bash’ thanks to Eddie Howe and Newcastle failsafe",
      "",
      "8) Darwin Nunez to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool want to sell Nunez no matter what. Clubs in Italy have been strongly linked throughout the summer, but it looks like Captain Chaos is off to the Middle East.",
      "You can put this transfer second or third on this ranking. If he’s sold before Isak is signed, then the Reds are even more equipped to pay a British record fee. If Isak is signed first, the Reds’ stance on Nunez doesn’t change: he’s still set for the exit door.",
      "We’ll miss Nunez and his unpredictable nature, but a summer transfer is the right thing for everyone. It remains to be seen if he’s fully on board with a switch to Saudi, but he knows there’s no place for him in Arne Slot’s squad anymore – especially if Isak joins.",
      "",
      "7) Ollie Watkins to Manchester United\nUnited have narrowed down their striker shortlist to two completely different players: Watkins and Sesko. The former loves getting in behind and does most of his business in and around the 18-yard box, while Sesko drops deep and takes long-range shots.",
      "Is that what United need? Not really. Is that what United have prioritised over the experienced Watkins? Of course it is.",
      "If Sesko joins Newcastle, United – assuming Ruben Amorim has any say in striker recruitment – will surely turn their attention to Watkins. And at 29, there are reservations over Watkins’ resale value. United really shouldn’t care about that. When was the last time they sold someone for a profit? Not counting academy players, it was Alvaro Carreras, and they still managed to mess that up spectacularly.",
      "Just forget about that and get an outstanding centre-forward through the bloody door.",
      "Missing out on Sesko will surely reignite United’s interest in the Aston Villa star, and despite being reluctant to lose him, Unai Emery’s side should sanction a sale for £40-50m. And if he joins the Red Devils, they’ll be even more desperate to offload their unwanted players.",
      "",
      "6) Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea\nOne of those unwanted players is Garnacho, who Chelsea want to sign because Chelsea want to sign all of the players.",
      "Does paying £50m for the 21-year-old make sense when Tyrique George is Right There? And £50m has already been spent on Jamie Gittens this summer? Oh, and Mykhaylo Mudryk exists even without a shirt number. He’s suspended but is still there and could return tomorrow, in two months, or four years. Nobody knows.",
      "Simply put, Chelsea don’t need Garnacho.",
      "The overriding point is that Chelsea will always be Chelsea, and their unrelenting desire to sign players means they’re convinced Garnacho can become one of the best wingers in the world. Just as they were with Mudryk, Noni Madueke, Estevao and Angelo. They are deluded, but integral to the transfer domino, with interest in Garnacho completely separate from their Xavi Simons pursuit.",
      "",
      "5) Christopher Nkunku to Manchester United\nThe Blues’ transfer addiction means players who don’t do very, very well are on the chopping block. It’s a revolving door at Stamford Bridge. Their next signing will be their 50th over the last four years. Manchester United, who are chronically addicted to trying to make things right in the transfer window, bought Ander Herrera 49 signings ago.",
      "Nkunku has been expected to leave Chelsea for a while, but he’s still at the club and still played in this summer’s Club World Cup, scoring once. Efforts to offload the Frenchman will ramp up when Simons or Garnacho are signed, and we can see him following Watkins to Old Trafford.",
      "Swap deals almost never happen, and PSR means they’re a bad idea, so the Garnacho and Nkunku deals will be separate. And the latter’s move to United will open the door for another Old Trafford exit…",
      "",
      "4) Rasmus Hojlund to Juventus\n“I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay at Manchester United. I want to fight for my spot whatever happens,” said Hojlund last week. But the transfer domino effect has spoken.",
      "Leipzig are interested in making Hojlund part of the Sesko deal, and the Dane is also an option for AC Milan, while Juventus have been linked and want a striker as well.",
      "Having done well for Atalanta in Serie A, Hojlund could open the door for a return, and it doesn’t come much bigger than Juve in Italy.",
      "",
      "3) Dusan Vlahovic to AC Milan\nAnd if Juventus sign Hojlund, there’s no doubt that Vlahovic will move on. The Old Lady are reportedly keen to offload the former Arsenal target and are also working on a deal for Randal Kolo Muani, who is tangentially involved in the domino.",
      "But Hojlund’s move, coupled with Nunez going to Al-Hilal, means Milan’s striker shortlist will be down to Stade Rennais’ Arnaud Kalimuendo and Vlahovic. For pure convenience, we’re saying the Juve man makes the move to San Siro.",
      "",
      "2) Arnaud Kalimuendo to Brentford\nIt’s awfully convenient, as it opens the door for Brentford to sign Kalimuendo from Rennes.",
      "The Bees have been linked with the Frenchman and Arsenal’s Leandro Trossard, but the former is a natural centre-forward and exactly what they need as Wissa does everything in his power to leave.",
      "Wissa is refusing to train and will leave Brentford under acrimonious circumstances, having been promised a £26m transfer this summer after pledging his future to the club last year. After losing Man United signing Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford’s stance changed, and Wissa is very, very upset.",
      "Clearly having some level of understanding and sympathy for a player who scored 19 Premier League goals last season, Brentford aren’t sitting still and have identified Kalimuendo as a potential signing. He won’t come cheap, but Keith Andrews needs some real quality in his team after selling Mbeumo and Christian Nørgaard.",
      "",
      "1) Yoane Wissa to Newcastle\nThe transfer domino starts and finishes at St James’ Park, as Wissa finally finds his way to the northeast after Brentford sign Milan target Kalimuendo from Rennes.",
      "Poor Aston Villa are left in the dust without a Watkins replacement because ten is the magic number. An honourable mention for Kolo Muani here will suffice.",
      "As mentioned before, the plan has always been for Eddie Howe to receive a new striker to play with Isak, and that could happen with Wissa or Sesko joining and their star player staying, or with Wissa playing alongside Sesko in 2025/26.",
      "Despite all the aggro surrounding Wissa’s situation, we think he’ll get his Magpies move. Whether it comes after these nine deals remains to be seen, but the timeline is absolutely spot on. Bring it on, we say.",
      "READ NEXT: Yoane Wissa deserves our sympathy…but not as much as poor Brentford fans",
      "Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak is tipped to be the “missing link up front” for Liverpool by ex-Reds defender John Arne Riise.",
      "Newcastle United and RB Leipzig have been left stunned by ‘unexpected move’ from Man Utd to make a huge bid for Benjamin Sesko, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have put their ‘first offer’ on the table for Benjamin Sesko as they battle Newcastle for the RB Leipzig striker, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have already come up with a three-part ‘plan’ to get more out of Alexander Isak than rivals Newcastle United.",
      "Man Utd will ‘end up’ signing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko this summer despite Newcastle’s latest bid, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool will regret messing Newcastle around this summer now the Magpies have launched yet another bid for Marc Guehi under Crystal Palace’s valuation."

      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has utilised an interesting play for his next transfer as he has reportedly told two interested sides, Manchester United and Newcastle, that he ‘only wants to join them’.",
      "Sesko has been on the radar of a number of Premier League clubs this summer. It looked like he could have landed at last season’s second-placed side Arsenal, before they instead opted for Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Sesko has since been pursued by Newcastle and Man Utd. The former club might need a new striker amid uncertainty over the future of Alexander Isak, while United’s starting striker options severely underwhelmed last season.",
      "It seems neither side truly knows where Sesko’s head is at, though, as he has made an interesting play, according to Bild.",
      "The report states Sesko has ‘told both clubs he only wants to join them’. All sides are now said to be putting pressure on him, though.",
      "Newcastle are said to want clarity ‘quickly’ and have set a ‘short deadline’ for the potential transfer. Though he is said to have told them he wants to join, Sesko is apparently ‘slightly favouring’ United.",
      "After a total package worth £69.6million was rejected by Leipzig from Newcastle – the right total but wanted in one go, without add-ons – it’s been reported United are willing match it.",
      "That is supported by the Bild report, but it states they are ‘expected’ to make the offer only when Sesko rejects Newcastle and ‘commits’ to the Red Devils.",
      "But Sesko needs United to guarantee that they can financially support the deal, which is not guaranteed, because they still need to sell players in order to do so.",
      "Leipzig, meanwhile, want things settled soon so they can sign a replacement if they need to do so, with Romulo Cardoso and Fabio Silva named as potential successors.",
      "Reports have shrouded United’s move for Sesko in further doubt, with the finances surely not available if they can confirm the deal they want.",
      "It’s been reported that United want to make a ‘monumental offer’ for Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr, which would see them allocate ‘their entire summer budget’ to the signing of the superstar winger.",
      "However, that seems fanciful, as it’s suggested they’re preparing a €200million (£174m) offer. United almost certainly do not have that to spend, given it’s know they’ll have to sell to buy any more players, so that move seems very unlikely.",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to RB Leipzig\nThere have been murmurs of a swap deal involving Hojlund and Sesko, but the former really doesn’t want to leave United. The Premier League club signing Sesko seems contingent on player sales, whether it’s before they bid or after, so sending Hojlund to Germany works well for them. It’s all too good to be true, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Jeremy Jacquet – Rennes to Arsenal\nAnother defender, Mikel? That’s insane. Arsenal’s interest in Jacquet will only be accelarated should Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior leave. The latter is attracting interest from all over Europe, but Arteta wants to keep him. Arsenal even rejected an offer from Portugal earlier this summer for the Pole, who’s destined for a place on this rumour ranking very, very soon.",

      "",
      "18) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in the agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to AC Milan\nGianluca Di Marzio says Nunez is Milan’s ‘first choice’, with Rasmus Hojlund, Dusan Vlahovic and Kalimuendo the back-up options. It’s down to Italy or the Middle East for Captain Chaos…",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 John Victor – Botafogo to West Ham\nThe Hammers have made an opening bid for the Manchester United-linked goalkeeper, who starred for Botafogo at this summer’s Club World Cup. If you were given the choice to be second-choice at Old Trafford or *potentially* first-choice at the London Stadium, what would you choose?",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Let’s see who blinks first…",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are back in for the England defender after a failed pursuit last summer. Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £50m and expected to move due to his lack of desire to sign an extension. Guehi has also been linked with Liverpool, who could continue their assault on the Magpies by hijacking the deal…",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThere are no negotiations between United and Chelsea but Romano says the winger is giving his ‘full priority’ to the Club World Cup winners. The Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Poor Tyrique George knows he doesn’t stand a chance and has asked to leave. This club, man…",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow. Until it isn’t. United are now behind their league rivals in the race for Sesko.",
      "F365 SAYS: Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin recently in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "7) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. The deal is dropping down our power ranking, but we’re refusing to rule it out completely…",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "6) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nNewcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters but a Magpies bid is in. Let’s see whether or not Leipzig reject it and if the Red Devils react…",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool rejected an offer of around £70m from Al-Hilal for Nunez in January and will not delude themselves into thinking a summer sale could generate nearly as much. But another piece in their Isak puzzle could fall into place thanks to the Magpies’ owners. PIF want to give the Saudi Pro League runners-up a shiny new centre-forward and Nunez has been earmarked as that man, with the Uruguayan described as ‘receptive’ to that interest ahead of bidding.",
      "",
      "3) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "2) 🆕 Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – Chelsea to Everton\nWell, that was an underwhelming year for Dewsbury-Hall…on a personal level, anyway. He barely played for Chelsea in the Premier League and is now set for a switch to the Hill Dickinson. This is a top move for the player and both clubs.",
      "",
      "1) 🆕 Armando Broja – Chelsea to Burnley\nA ‘Here we go’ out of nowhere was delivered on Friday night. It will be a permanent move for Broja."

      "Newcastle and Manchester United have both made bids for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 13:56, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest is over after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Newcastle and Manchester United have both lodged bids in the region of £70m.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt forms a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, and to Manchester United as they look to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Newcastle and Manchester United.",

      "Monday 4 August 2025 14:44, UK",
      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",

      "Bruno Fernandes on Man Utd's need for further additions: \"We needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up more and I think that is what the club are trying to do. Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Monday 4 August 2025 08:03, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes was critical of Man Utd's \"lazy\" display in their 2-2 Premier League Summer Series draw with Everton before calling for further reinforcements in the transfer window.",
      "Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "When asked about the success of Man Utd's tour to America and the display against Everton, Fernandes said: \"It's been positive. It's been positive to be together to create a bond between the players.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way,\" The United skipper added. \"Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "The positives for United against Everton was a first appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford.",
      "He combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha on a number of occasions during the first half, showing the benefit of new additions to the squad.",
      "However, the United skipper called for more reinforcements when asked if the club was where it needed to be heading into the new season.",
      "\"It's improving,\" he said. \"But it's not the place it needs to be.",
      "\"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
      "\"You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.",
      "\"The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.",
      "\"It's not only the winning mentality that we need but it is other things too that the club are trying to improve like the facilities, the team, the staff and a lot of other things.",
      "\"A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.",
      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
      "\"I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.",
      "\"We are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].\"",
      "Reflecting on Mbeumo's debut, Amorim added: \"He played well. He needs to understand the position, the movement but the first touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in the perfect condition physically but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team so everything I was expecting, he delivered.\"",
