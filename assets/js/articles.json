      "We've entered the final week of the Premier League season before attention turns firmly to the summer transfer window - with a number of clubs poised to act.",
      "Liverpool won't waste any time in bolstering their champion squad with Jeremie Frimpong set to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold, who has ran down his contract and is poised to join Real Madrid imminently. They are also among those linked with Florian Wirtz.",
      "They face competition from Manchester City, who will wave goodbye to Kevin De Bruyne this week with the Belgian leaving when his deal expires. Across town Manchester United's focus is on Wednesday's Europa League final - which will have a huge influence on their transfer business.",
      "Arsenal have wrapped up second place and know they face a massive summer if they want to take that next step. A move for either Viktor Gyokeres or Benjamin Sesko has been tipped.",
      "The two men are thought to be at the top of the club's shortlist as they eye a striker.",
      "Sesko has endured a gradual rise with RB Leipzig proving themselves to be a selling club for the right fee.",
      "Gyokeres though may be seen as the preferred candidate with his output dwarfing that of Sesko. The Sporting Lisbon frontman has played in England previously, potentially making the adapting process that bit easier, and he would by no means break the bank. Sporting thought to be willing to do business at between £60m-70m.",
      "An FA Cup win on Saturday may have slightly salvaged their season, but the shock loss really does scream rebuild.",
      "They have the crux of a team that can still be among the best in Europe, but some of the talismans are clearly past their best. Dias, Gvardiol, Rodri, Marmoush and Haaland are all stellar operators.",
      "But the likes of De Bruyne and Silva are ageing with father time potentially beginning to tell.",
      "It leaves Guardiola with a huge summer. Recruitment will be massive and the club need to move swiftly if they want to hit the ground running next season.",
      "Man United's hopes of signing Dan Ndoye have suffered a significant blow after Bologna moved to hand him a new long-term deal. The winger has impressed for the Serie A side, scoring the winner as they beat AC Milan in the Coppa Italia final.",
      "According to TuttoSport, United had been on Ndoye's 'trail', even sending scouts to watch him lift the Italian Cup. But it is said that Bologna are now attempting to 'shield' him from a move with a new deal.",
      "Liverpool have held positive talks with Milos Kerkez's agent as they look to land the Bournemouth star.",
      "Discussions continue over a move with the Cherries ready to cash in on their player for around £50m. The Reds have a five-year contract ready for Kerkez, reports Nicolo Schira.",
      "Already this summer Bournemouth have seen Dean Huijsen head to Real Madrid, banking them £50m.",
      "Manchester icon Wayne Rooney has urged his former club to make three key moves this summer. Rooney believes the Red Devils should bring back David De Gea, make Victor Osimhen their top striker target and make a 'difficult' move for Crystal Palace skipper Marc Guehi.",
      "\"I'd sign David de Gea back. I think Manchester United have missed him and I think he would do an amazing job. Second I'd sign Osimhen as a number nine,\" Rooney told Amazon Prime.",
      "\"He's a good striker and possibly available. The third one I'd sign, it would probably be difficult, but I'd try to sign Guehi from Crystal Palace. As a centre-back he'd have a really good impact.\"",
      "It's now five years without a trophy since Arteta led the Gunners to FA Cup glory in his first season. Even so, he doesn't expect things to change for the worse when it comes to bringing in reinforcements.",
      "\"They always have done within the limitations of the restrictions we have,\" Arteta told BBC Radio 5 Live when asked about potential backing from the higher-ups. \"They have always been really supportive.\"",
      "Emi Martinez's uncertain Aston Villa future has left Man United and Barcelona exploring a move, it has been claimed. Martinez has been the subject of interest from the Saudi Pro League, but could yet end up staying in Europe.",
      "The Argentina number one was visibly emotional at the end of Villa's final home game of the season, a victory over Tottenham, as was Saudi-linked team-mate Leon Bailey. Manager Unai Emery wasn't able to confirm the keeper would be staying, sparking plenty of speculation.",
      "“Of course, it is the last match (of the season) here, and I don’t know,” Emery said.",
      "Attention has quickly turned to Viktor Gyokeres' future now that Sporting Lisbon have wrapped up the title, but he was non-committal. \"It's football, I'm still here,\" he told Portuguese broadcaster Sport TV via Record. \"I don't know what's going to happen. Nobody can predict the future.\"",
      "Despite this, Arsenal remain very much in the mix for the former Coventry man. A bid in the region of £60million is likely to be enough, but a reunion with Amorim at Manchester United isn't out of the question.",
      "Napoli remain keen on Darwin Nunez, according to reports in Italy. Sporting director Giovanni Manna is said to have held talks over a move for the Uruguayan, though the Serie A side also have other options.",
      "If Nunez goes down a different route, Jonathan David could find himself at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. The Canadian is out of contract at Lille this summer and available on a free transfer.",
      "Napoli are expected to cash in on Victor Osimhen this summer, with those funds going towards attacking reinforcements. Osimhen has starred for Galatasaray during a loan spell, and is the subject of Premier League interest.",
      "Arsenal co-chair Josh Kroenke has set the tone for a big summer with Andrea Berta in charge of transfers. Kroenke covered the topic in a letter to fans, which was shared in the programme ahead of the final home league game of the season.",
      "\"We plan to invest to get behind winning and doing better next season,\" the American wrote. \"We’re delighted we have our sporting director, Andrea, who will play an important role in this.",
      "\"He is part of a unified and strong team, supported by the board, who are crystal clear on exactly what we need to do and the way in which we want to do it. The right way. The Arsenal way.\"",
      "Jeremie Frimpong is expected to sign a five-year deal with Liverpool. The Leverkusen star is on his way for a medical, with the deal all but done.",
      "Frimpong's release clause - in the region of £30m - makes things a little more straightforward. He is understood to have already agreed personal terms, and could well be announced as the first new arrival this summer.",
      "Of course, one new signing has already been confirmed the best part of a year ago. Giorgi Mamardashvili is on his way from Valencia, with the Georgian becoming Arne Slot's first signing but only joining this year.",
      "Rise and shine - we're here to bring you all the latest! Stay tuned throughout the day"

      "While United could still gain qualification for the Champions League by beating Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, Arsenal will have to accept another campaign without a major trophy.",
      "With the season ending soon, attention is turning to the transfer window, where Arsenal are on the verge of signing Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi, with a move for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres also potentially on the cards. However, Wright, who has previously defended Fernandes from a Roy Keane onslaught, would be over the moon to see his former side turn their attention to the Portugal international.",
      "While speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Wright said: \"I wish we had Bruno Fernandes. I wish we had Bruno. I would love to have him at Arsenal.\"",
      "The ex-Gunners striker has repeatedly defended the United skipper when Keane has unleashed him. After Wright's latest defence on the podcast last month, the ex-United skipper said: \"Ah Wrighty, I've had enough of that rubbish!",
      "\"You watch United every week, we focus more on United. Sit and watch a game with him! People pretend to be closing people down.",
      "\"Talent is not enough! You keep going back to talent - Bruno's a talented player, but it's not enough! Who were you in the dressing room with, Tony Adams! Tony Adams was this, Tony Adams was that, because he was a fighter!",
      "\"You've got young players who have to look at somebody and go, ‘I like what he does.’ They all can't put the ball in the top of the net from 25 yards, I get that, but you want someone who's going, 'Lads, are you with me? Are you with me?'\"",
      "Wright told Keane that comparing modern captains like Fernandes to the likes of Adams is unhelpful, saying: \"Maybe he's not that kind of captain, Roy, I'm with you, but what he's doing in respect of... saving you, playing that pass, the goal. If Bruno's not there, United are in the relegation battle.”",
      "Despite Wright's admiration of Fernandes, it's unlikely the Gunners would target a move for him. Arteta already has club captain Martin Odegaard in Fernandes' position, while Declan Rice is being encouraged to maraud forward more often.",
      "Zubimendi's potential arrival would only encourage the aforementioned duo to occupy more forward positions, while Kai Havertz may also be given more opportunities to play behind a striker should the Gunners sign a centre-forward like Gyokeres. Moreover, the chances of United doing business with Arsenal for a player as important as Fernandes are also highly unlikely.",
      "The silky playmaker's deal expires in the summer of 2027, but there appears to be no sign that he is agitating for a move out of Old Trafford. However, reports from the Daily Star at the end of March claimed Real Madrid were interested in the midfielder and were considering a shock £90million move.",
      "If United lose the final in Bilbao on Wednesday, then Fernandes, who has been at the club since January 2020, will have to face up the reality of another season without Champions League football, despite his undoubted quality. While the season has been a poor one for United, he has still contributed 19 goals and 19 assists in all competitions.",
      "The ex-Sporting midfielder's numbers are far superior to Odegaard's, who has struggled to replicate his performances from the 2023/24 campaign. The Norwegian has only managed five goals and 11 assists compared to last year's record of 11 goals and 12 assists."

United have suffered their worst season of the Premier League era, with Ruben Amorim's under-performing side down in 16th place, after 18 defeats this season.",
      "But United can still salvage something from their otherwise miserable season by beating Tottenham in Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao. As well as lifting the trophy, the winners will also go straight into next season's Champions League, which is worth up to £100million in revenue.",
      "And although their domestic form has been pitiful, Mazraoui claimed that will largely be forgotten if Amorim's players are victorious against Spurs. “Winning a trophy is never easy,” said Mazraoui.",

      "In contrast to losing almost half of their Premier League games this season, United are the only team that started out in the Europa League or Champions League to remain unbeaten. It is something United defender Mazraoui cannot explain.",

Extra-time, everybody's tired and everything, and you still manage to win.",
      "“I think one of the biggest differences in the Europa League and the Premier League for us this season is how to manage to win. We maybe have that kind of fighting spirit in the Europa League that we maybe lack in the Premier League.”",
      "Who'll win the Europa League final - Tottenham or Man Utd? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "Mazraoui was signed by former United manager Erik ten Hag, who made way for current boss Amorim whose forthright and straight-talking approach has been welcomed by the defender. “I like him a lot in that respect,” said Mazraoui.",
      "“He's really honest, really straightforward, he's not hiding from anything. That's how I am as well. I'm not hiding behind anything and that's the manager as well.",
      "“He takes responsibility, he knows he's the head of the club eventually, because he's the manager. That's something I like a lot about him.”",
      "Tottenham have beaten United on all three occasions they have met this season, but Mazraoui claimed that will have no bearing on the outcome of Wednesday's make-or-break showdown.",
      "“I don't think so, because this is a whole different competition,” said Mazraoui. “It's the Europa League, it's a final, so the context around it is so different that you can't really compare any previous games with this final.",
      "“Tottenham bring a lot of intensity in their games. We've seen that already this season. That's their biggest quality - they bring so much intensity and pressing in everything they do.”"

      "Roy Keane has never been far removed from Manchester United almost 20 years after his controversial Old Trafford exit. The iconic midfielder won 13 major honours during his 12 years at the club, and is regularly seen assessing United games as a pundit.",
      "Despite his legacy at the club, Keane agreed to leave by mutual consent in November 2005, stemming from comments made on MUTV about his team-mates following a heavy defeat to Middlesbrough. Two decades later, he pulled no punches as United, who sit 16th in the Premier League, continued to fall well below his standards.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.” Here’s a closer look at how Keane’s relationship with United has altered over the years.",
      "Keane has spoken extensively about his shock exit from United. The former captain would end his career at Celtic, but the club’s decision had a long-term impact on Keane’s relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "The Irishman was known as a tough-tackling midfielder with a hardman persona on the pitch. However, when speaking on the Stick to Football podcast in February, he admitted the emotional toll that it took on him: \"When I left United, I did cry that morning. Cried in my car,” Keane said.",
      "It was not the first time Keane had reflected on the raw emotion that came with his departure from United. “I think the only time I really cried was when I left United after I had a bit of a disagreement with a few people, but other than that you're very much in that bubble,\" Keane previously told Tommy Tiernan.",
      "\"You're in the zone. I always say I was in the zone. I used to say to people, and they didn't quite understand it, I was going to war every week.\"",
      "The manner of his exit meant that Keane had a different view of the club than many of his United team-mates, despite being crucial to the glory that they achieved under Ferguson. However, almost 18 years later, Keane shocked supporters by appearing in the reveal video for United’s third kit in 2023.",
      "A joint statement from the club and kit manufacturer said: “Manchester United and Adidas are proud to work with Roy Keane, one of the club’s most iconic and popular former players. Roy won 17 trophies with Manchester United, his fearless playing style and never give up attitude has earned him a special place in the hearts of Manchester United fans around the world.”",
      "Keane has been vocal about United's relative underachievement since Ferguson stepped down as manager in 2013. The 53-year-old has been brutally honest in his assessment of various United players, but former team-mate Mikael Silvestre feels that the club can use Keane’s feedback to their advantage, and backed him to join current boss Ruben Amorim’s staff in an advisory role",
      "“I think it would be great for Roy Keane to play a role at Manchester United,” Silvestre told Yaysweepstakes.com. “Because, the thing is with Roy, he always treated everybody exactly the same way. It didn’t matter if you were a new signing, an old guy, the manager, everybody.",
      "\"That's how he got respect. That's how Sir Alex got respect. If you treat everybody the same, no problem. I think it’s a bit of a problem with this generation of players. They find criticism harder to take.",
      "\"If Roy Keane was involved at Manchester United, if he was on the inside with the group, he would have to protect and work for the group. You wouldn’t see him criticising players in public, so there wouldn't be any issue.”",
      "Ex-United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer agreed with Silvestre and saw the value in the expertise that Keane could pass on to his squad. In 2019, Solskjaer invited Keane to the club’s Carrington training ground to speak to the players, four years before he would feature in the kit reveal video.",
      "In terms of how the meeting unfolded, a source told the Mirror: “As you’d imagine, Roy has strong views on what it takes to be a proper United player, and he gave it to them straight.",
      "“He wasn’t impressed with one player who didn’t seem to be all that interested and looked as if he’d rather be somewhere else. But for the majority, it was a fascinating snapshot into the hunger and desire that drove Roy during his time at the club.”",
      "Keane may have reached some form of truce with United in recent years, but that has not prevented him from sharing his thoughts on the current hierarchy. Before Erik ten Hag was replaced by Amorim this season, Keane suggested that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and those in charge of football operations had undermined the Dutch coach by changing his backroom staff.",
      "\"I'm not saying he's not a good manager or he hasn't got good coaching staff, but in the summer they changed all the coaching staff,” Keane argued on the Stick to Fooball podcast. “So you're on about a manager having a bit of power and control of the football club – I'll bet you Ten Hag's got none of that!",
      "\"So players will look at the manager and go, 'Well, all your staff went in the summer. I didn't see you fighting for any of them. You're bringing more staff in.' I just think it looks chaotic, doesn't it?\"",
      "Keane has been frequently touted for the United job, despite last managing Ipswich Town in 2011. There was speculation that he could follow in the footsteps of United legends Solskjaer, Ryan Giggs, and Michael Carrick by taking charge on an interim basis. However, Keane quickly shut down the suggestion, having already critiqued the manager’s lack of power at the club.",
      "\"They're not gonna be asking me. They just wouldn't... they just wouldn't,” Keane told Arsenal great Ian Wright. When asked about the possibility of taking over at Old Trafford on a short-term basis, Keane said: \"I'm not leaving you, Wrighty.“"

      "Ruben Amorim is working out his best line-up to beat Spurs in Bilbao, with the United boss considering dropping Hojlund on the bench.",
      "The return of Amad from injury has given Amorim greater attacking options and the United boss is said to be considering starting him against Spurs.",

      "Keane said: \"They've got no striker. Hojlund looked like he'd just come out of the academy. His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play. Again, if you're a striker playing for United - even for the whole team - one shot on target?'",
      "\"We keep making excuses for him. We talk about confidence, but you still think, when you're a striker, you have to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"What the big clubs have - and what United have always had - is strikers who can produce something for themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they have quality, a bit of determination, a bit of experience, football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund.\""

      "Wayne Rooney has identified three key signings that could help Manchester United bounce back from their worst-ever Premier League season. And one of them is a return for former goalkeeper David de Gea.",
      "The Red Devils, who have won the Premier League a record 13 times, are currently languishing in 16th place with a record low of 39 points. Their dismal league performances have continued under Ruben Amorim, who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Despite their chronic struggles in the league, United will salvage Champions League football from the season if they can defeat Tottenham in Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao.",
      "However, the squad clearly needs a complete overhaul to compete at the highest level domestically and in Europe next season. Rooney, United's all-time leading goalscorer, believes that the addition of his former team-mate De Gea, along with striker Victor Osimhen and defender Marc Guehi, could be the catalyst for a turnaround.",
      "Speaking to Amazon Prime Video Sport, the former England forward said: \"I'd probably sign David de Gea back. I think Manchester United have missed him and I think he could still do a very good job.",
      "\"The second one, I would sign Osimhen. He's a number nine, I think he's a really good striker and possibly available. And the third one, it would be difficult but I'd sign Guehi from Crystal Palace. As a centre-back, I think he would have a really good impact on the club.\"",
      "De Gea enjoyed 12 seasons at Old Trafford, winning the Premier League title once and being crowned United's Player of the Season four times. The 34-year-old was let go in July 2023 and spent nearly a year searching for a new team before joining Fiorentina at the start of this season.",
      "The Spaniard has been a standout performer for the Serie A side, helping them to secure European football while making it to the Europa Conference League semi-finals. He is set to face United in a pre-season match this summer, which will undoubtedly be an emotional encounter for the Spaniard. His replacement, Andre Onana, who was brought in for his superior ball-playing skills, has made numerous high-profile blunders since his £47.2million arrival from Ajax in 2023.",
      "Meanwhile, another United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has made it clear what he thinks the team needs. He said: \"Forget Delap's ability, potential, whatever you want to say about him. It's not about that right now for Man United. I think they need experience in there.",
      "\"Someone who knows how to score and someone that these younger guys can learn off. Rasmus Hojlund needs help. He doesn't need a competitor.\"",
      "England and Crystal Palace defender Guehi is in demand too. The 24-year-old, who has been linked with Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham, will come with a hefty price tag, especially after helping Palace to FA Cup glory against Manchester City."

      "Ruben Amorim's men will jet out to Bilbao this week hoping to beat Premier League rivals Tottenham in a bid to end their disastrous season with silverware, while also catapulting themselves into the Champions League.",
      "However, United come into the final in poor form, having lost five of their last six games in the Premier League and manager Amorim has even questioned whether he is the right man to take the team forward.",

      "Both of the club's transfer wishlists have been curated to put together a squad that will be able to deliver on Amorim's tactical vision - which has so far failed to come to fruition following 13 defeats in 26 games under the Portuguese boss.",
      "There have been some concerns that Amorim may walk out on the team at the end of the season after his brutal comments about the clubs' fortunes.",

      "He said: \"Europa League will not change anything in our problems - it's going to help us to have Champions League next year, more money to spend, but the problems are still there.",

      "Despite going in as underdogs against Manchester City at Wembley Stadium, the Red Devils pulled off a stunning 2-1 victory, courtesy of goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo which overshadowed Jeremy Doku's goal. The win came as a shock to supporters up and down the country and marked the team's sole piece of silverware for the season.",
      "Ratcliffe, who holds a minority stake in United, didn't shy away from acknowledging his team's outsider status but heaped praise on their Wembley performance after the match. \"Manchester United were clearly not the favourites to win today,\" he previously said.",
      "He added: \"But they played with total commitment and skill and overcame one of the great teams in football. We are all very proud of the players and the staff who work tirelessly to support them.\"",
      "However, comments about not being favourites highlighted just how much of an uphill battle Project 150 – which aims to see United win the Premier League by 2028 in line with its 150th anniversary – would be. The club's recent performances, including a record-low eighth-place finish in the 2023/24 season and a dreadful 2024/25 campaign in the Premier League, have highlighted the significant challenges they face in closing the gap with their rivals.",
      "Despite the arrival of head coach Ruben Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November, the team continues to languish near the bottom of the table, on track for their worst-ever Premier League finish. And while Amorim has shown glimpses of promise, such as dragging the team to the Europa League final where they face fellow Premier League strugglers Tottenham, it is clear that he needs time to adapt and shape the squad to his playing style.",
      "\"You've got to be brave or foolish to think winning the league by 2028 is doable from where United currently are.\"",
      "It has been 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson departed Manchester United, and the club has struggled to replicate his success in the Premier League since then.",
      "The current state of the team suggests that it will be a long and challenging journey to return to the top of English football. Old Trafford has seen a parade of managers, including David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and now Amorim, all attempting to reverse the club's fortunes. But instead, they've seemingly slipped further down the league table.",
      "Another hurdle is the Premier League's PSR rules and regulations. In the January transfer window, United were only able to secure the services of Patrick Dorgu for £25million and promising Arsenal youngster Ayden Heaven, while Marcus Rashford, Antony, and Tyrell Malacia were sent out on loan.",
      "If United can arrange permanent moves for these players, and if Chelsea decide to splash out £20m for Jadon Sancho following his loan stint at Stamford Bridge, it could help ease the club's substantial debts. As of March, the club was reported to be in debt to the tune of £733m, with an additional £315m owed in outstanding transfer fees."

      "When Cristiano Ronaldo joined Al Nassr midway through the 2022-23 season, the expiry of his bumper contract was the last thing on most people's minds. Now, though, the imminent end of his deal has left plenty of questions over the Portuguese.",
      "Ronaldo has continued to score for fun in the Saudi Pro League, but hasn't delivered the trophies his current club had hoped for when bringing him in from Manchester United. It's time for the Riyadh side to stick or twist, and Ronaldo's wages may tempt them towards the latter.",
      "Of course, the player himself is far from ready to retire. He remains part of the Portugal international picture, missing just one competitive match in the last 18 months, and has a World Cup on the horizon in 2026.",
      "\"I just want to enjoy. Plan for the retirement… if it has to happen, in one or two years… I don’t know,\" Ronaldo said in 2024. \"I’m turning 40 soon… I really want to enjoy, as long as I feel motivated I keep going. The day I don’t feel motivated, I will retire”.",
      "Upon signing for Al Nassr, Ronaldo indicated he wouldn't be returning to club football in Europe. \"\"I did my mission in Europe well and achieved everything. Now it's time for a new challenge in Asia,\" he said.",
      "The offer of a return to Sporting might change that, though. He was a teenager when he left his home in Madeira to join the Lisbon club, and it's there that he made his senior debut.",
      "Despite a dramatic slump when Ruben Amorim left for Manchester United, Sporting have secured a return to the Champions League. Victory in their final league game will see them crowned champions, and a return for the prodigal son could make for a very interesting summer.",
      "If Ronaldo feels he has settled in Saudi Arabia, Al Ahli might be the solution. Matthias Jaissle's side won the AFC Champions League Elite this season, beating league rivals Al Hilal along the way, and will defend their title next season.",
      "The Jeddah club are also likely to have space in their squad for a big-name arrival over the summer. Roberto Firmino has had an up-and-down time at the club, and is expected to return to Brazil.",
      "A bigger issue, of course, is how Ronaldo might gel with Ivan Toney. The England international has top-scored for the club this term, and much may hinge on whether he feels he needs to return to Europe to earn a chance of making Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad - and wether he cares enough to do that.",
      "Speaking of Premier League stars of yesteryear who have endured goal droughts in so-called 'lesser' leagues... Olivier Giroud joined LAFC from AC Milan last summer, but went 10 league games without scoring in his first half-season.",
      "He opened his MLS account in April, after a couple of strikes in cup competitions, but the return is probably some way short of what the California club would have expected from the Frenchman's elevated Designated Player pay-packet. If they're able to get the veteran off their books, might another elder statesman take his place?",
      "Of course, the biggest selling point of a move for Ronaldo is a chance to reignite his one-time La Liga rivalry with Inter Miami's Lionel Messi, only this time across the Atlantic. It wouldn't be exactly the same as in those Clasico years, but fans who weren't able to witness those matches first-hand may well be pleased just to see the pale imitation.",
      "A Premier League return for Ronaldo remains unlikely, and a third Manchester United stint all but impossible. If he were to return to England, though, Chelsea might be bold or foolish enough to take the plunge.",
      "The Blues' transfer policy has focused predominantly on a younger profile of player, but there have been times this term when a lack of experience was telling. If a near-40-year-old Thiago Silva could do the job last term, why not a 40+ Ronaldo?",
      "We wouldn't even be entertaining the idea if Chelsea had a settled and consistent front-line, but the cupboard looks rather bare when you take out Nicolas Jackson. A summer exit for Christopher Nkunku would free up a bit of space, leaving them with someone ready to step in and share line-leading duties at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Ronaldo's return to Manchester United in 2021 came with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the helm. It might be a long shot, but a reunion with the Norwegian boss at Besiktas could end up tempting Ronaldo this summer.",
      "While Ronaldo found it harder to earn regular minutes under Erik ten Hag, he was United's top scorer in that first season under Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. Besiktas' top scorer this season, Ciro Immobile, only has one more year left on his own deal and missed periods with hamstring trouble earlier in the season, so the Super Lig club may be tempted to see if the funds are there for Ronaldo.",
      "There is, of course, the small matter of the Istanbul side missing out on a top-two finish this term. Would Ronaldo return to Europe without the promise of Champions League football?"

      "“I guess I will in a sense be a role model if it goes well but we can learn from each other and hopefully it can be normalised going forward.”",
      "For now, however, she will be an uneasy spectator as Marc Skinner’s team look to inflict a first domestic defeat of the season on Chelsea.",
      "“This is our third consecutive year (in the final), that’s a massive help,” she says. “The first year we lost, the second we won.",
      "“Most girls have felt both sides of it. You never want to lose but I think we’ve got such characters in the group there is no reason not to be confident.”"

      "Their 1-0 defeat to Chelsea - their 18th in the league this season alone - puts them 16th in the table. Things could yet get even worse for Amorim’s side though.",
      "A defeat on the final day could potentially see them finish just above the relegation zone. Fortunately, they do have a way to salvage what has been a horror season: by winning the Europa League against Tottenham later this month.",
      "And that could go a long way in helping them make some much-needed signings. With all of that being said, take a look at the latest transfer news and rumours from Old Trafford:",

      "It is reported that they are keen to sign Hojlund on loan with an option to buy. Fenerbahce are keen on giving their attack a fresh look next season with Edin Dzeko now 39.",
      "Hojlund has endured a very tricky second season at Old Trafford following his big-money move from Atalanta. He has scored just four Premier League goals throughout the campaign.",
      "Amid interest from Turkey, it appears that United icon Roy Keane has finally lost patience with Hojlund and his sub-par displays. Speaking after the defeat to Chelsea, he said: “They have got no striker.",
      "“Hojlund looked like a young kid for Chelsea, he looked like he had come straight out of the academy. His runs weren’t right, his hold-up play, his timing.",
      "“If you’re a striker playing for Man United and you are having one shot on target… we make excuses for him, saying he needs more confidence, but when you are a striker up there, you have to make things happen sometimes.",
      "\"What the big clubs have, what United always had, is strikers who can produce something by themselves because they have quality, desire, determination, a bit of experience, football intelligence. You don’t see it with Hojlund. he needs a little bit of support, but you need to do better.”",
      "One solution for the Red Devils would potentially have been a deal to sign Jonathan David from Lille. The Canadian striker has confirmed that will leave Lille at the end of the season.",
      "Unfortunately, it appears that a couple of their rivals have stolen a march. According to L’Equipe, both Aston Villa and Tottenham have opened talks regarding a free transfer.",
      "There is also apparently interest from Napoli and Juventus. United have been strongly linked in the past."

The 40-year-old has even questioned whether the job is too big for him, with the Reds set for their worst league finish for 50 years despite the prospect of still qualifying for the Champions League by beating Tottenham in Wednesday night’s Europa League Final in Bilbao.",
      "Now Dalot has lifted the lid on Amorim’s style - and has promised the fans that the good times will return once United have ridden out the storm. Dalot, who believes he is winning his fight to be fit to face Spurs, said: “Personally it hurts a lot when the manager says what he’s said.",

      "“It is really hard these days to find managers and players like him. But if it hurts you, it’s a good sign because it means you want to change things. He is speaking about my team, my team-mates, my club. I don’t want to hear my manager and anybody else around the club feeling like that.",
      "“So what can I do to change that? That is what I focus on the most. I try to evolve as many team-mates as many people as I can into having the same energy - but then you have to fight.",
      "“It is obviously something the club will address, the players have to address also. We have to look at ourselves and see what can I change to be better and try to get in the same pattern that the manager wants.”",

      "“We just have to keep building because I believe together we will do great things. The manager showed how much he wants to keep the club united by literally paying to make sure everybody will be together at the final.",

      "Speaking to Opta in March, Pereira revealed he wants to prove United made a mistake in selling him whenever he plays at Old Trafford. He said: “I don’t think I got my full chance to play and show my quality when I was there. Fulham gave me that opportunity, they did everything for me, and I want to do everything for them. So, whenever I play at Old Trafford, I want to show that United made a mistake.”",

      "Brian McClair believes the definition of what constitutes Manchester United's DNA can be captured in three simple words - class, humility, dignity.",
      "The former Scottish international striker, who spent 11 years at Old Trafford while Sir Alex Ferguson was restoring the standards first laid down by Sir Matt Busby, has warned that until the Reds rediscover their identity then the lifeblood of the club will continue to drain away.",
      "Ruben Amorim is the latest manager to be tasked with getting the Stretford End arising - and McClair believes a comparison can be made between the club he arrived in the summer of 1987 and the one that now finds itself on a precipice.",
      "United will finish in their lowest league position for half a century - yet still have a chance of qualifying for the Champions League by beating Tottenham in Wednesday night’s Europa League Final.",
      "McClair doesn’t accept that Amorim’s fate hinges on the result in Bilbao. But he does feel that the result will have huge ramifications on the time it’s going to take for the glory years to truly return.",
      "“I can’t say I’ve enjoyed watching United this season but the one oasis in the very dry desert has been the Europa League,” said McClair, who joined a club that had not been champions for 20 years when he arrived from Celtic for £800,000 and went on to win four title medals, two FA Cups, the League Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup after Ferguson was handed both time and money.",
      "“I’m even reluctant to say they have played well on the road to the final because I think that they’ve enjoyed a lot of good fortune.",
      "“I’m pretty sure that even if United lose against Spurs it will have no bearing on whether Amorim is still the manager next season.",
      "“But as far as transfer business is concerned, I would imagine they have got two different plans based on whether they win or lose.",
      "“Qualification for the Champions League is worth upwards of £100million and that will have an effect on both the budget and the quality of the players United will be able to attract.",
      "“Players will always want to come to Manchester United. But can they afford these players if they’re not in the Champions League or will they be forced into a cheaper market?”",
      "McClair became the first United player since George Best to score 20 league goals in a season during his first year at Old Trafford - and Ferguson’s team came second to Liverpool.",
      "But the next two campaigns saw the Reds finish 11th and 13th as the Scot sold fan favourites like Norman Whiteside and Paul McGrath in a ruthless cull that McClair believes has echoes of the way Amorim has made it clear that players like Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are finished.",
      "Winning the FA Cup in 1990 and the European Cup Winners Cup a year later became the springboard for an unparalleled period of United success. McClair said: “There are definitely comparisons to be made between now and what happened when Fergie arrived.",
      "“Defeats, lowly league positions - and then a welcome cup run to a final. In 1990, it was the FA Cup. Now it’s the Europa League. What also intrigues me is the way Amorim has gone about restoring discipline inside the dressing room.",
      "“He’s been very candid about what he thinks. He’s made it clear that he’s in charge and that he will set the tone. I can see comparisons to Fergie in the way that Amorim is imposing his authority on the club.”",
      "McClair added: “Manchester United’s DNA is all about class, humility and dignity. It goes all the way back to when Sir Matt Busby took over after the Second World War. Players, managers and staff have a responsibility, irrespective of whether the club is having success or not, to be an ambassador for certain values.",
      "“The fabric of United has been lost since Alex Ferguson left and I suspect that Amorim recognises that and is doing what’s needed to restore things that used to be non-negotiable.",
      "“Fergie made it clear that you had to be special to play for Manchester United. That meant being a good player, or course, but he also made it clear that you had to be someone who was capable of carrying the mantle of all that history.”",

      "Despite taking the lead in all of their opening three league phase outings, United amassed a paltry three points from a possible nine, drawing with FC Twente (1-1), FC Porto (3-3) and Fenerbahce (1-1).",
      "The stalemate with Fenerbahce in Istanbul left United 21st in the league phase table. It also left Erik ten Hag clinging on to his job.",
      "Alongside making an underwhelming start to their Europa League campaign, United experienced a difficult start to their Premier League season. They won just three of their opening nine matches, leaving them 14th in the table.",
      "United's ninth game of their league campaign saw them beaten 2-1 by West Ham United at the London Stadium, just three days after they were pegged back by Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce.",
      "That defeat to the Hammers, which was United's fourth in their opening nine league games, marked the end of the road for Ten Hag, who was dismissed the following day, just months after Ineos decided to keep him.",
      "United, almost as soon as Ten Hag had cleared his office, were on the phone to Sporting Lisbon and attempting to convince Ruben Amorim to replace him. Despite the Portuguese chief being hesitant about moving to Old Trafford mid-season, United got their man, appointing him just four days after Ten Hag had been dismissed.",
      "As part of the agreement, Amorim stayed at Sporting until the November international break, meaning Ruud van Nistelrooy was placed in temporary charge.",
      "He won three of his four games at the helm, drawing the other, and it felt as though Amorim would pick up from where the Dutchman had left off. His short spell in charge did improve the mood in and around the club. It also saw United get their Europa League campaign up and running with a 2-0 win over PAOK at Old Trafford.",
      "However, Amorim's obsession with his trademark 3-4-2-1 system meant that teething problems were to be expected at the start of his tenure. After a solid first set of results saw United draw 1-1 at Ipswich Town, beat Bodo/Glimt 3-2 and brush Everton aside 4-0, United's supporters hoped the transition to Amorim's preferred system would be seamless.",
      "Amorim's warning about a storm being on its way soon came to fruition, though, and United started stumbling. The 2-1 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium was the only highlight in a forgettable December.",
      "However, despite the disappointment and frustrations of United's Premier League form, their results and performances in Europe have seen them reach the Europa League final. Wednesday night's clash with Tottenham Hotspur offers them the opportunity to salvage something from what has been a disastrous campaign.",
      "United head into the clash with Spurs boasting an unbeaten record in Europe this season, winning nine and drawing five of their 14 Europa League matches. They won each of the four league phase matches Amorim took charge of, ensuring they finished in an automatic qualification spot for the last-16.",
      "Despite being held to a draw in the first leg of their last-16 tie with Real Sociedad in Spain, they came from behind to make light work of them at Old Trafford in the second leg, winning 4-1 to seal a 5-2 aggregate triumph.",
      "Lyon were up next in the quarter-finals and United, as we all know, made hard work of that one. After the first leg finished 2-2 in France, United were heading for the exit in the second leg at Old Trafford, trailing 4-2 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate with just minutes to go.",
      "However, goals from Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire meant the Europa League dream remained alive. Maguire's dramatic header was perhaps a sign that it is simply meant to be for United in this competition.",
      "Athletic Bilbao, despite looking as though they would pose the sternest test United had faced in Europe all season, were blown away in the semi-finals. United won 3-0 in Spain and 4-1 at Old Trafford to progress to the final with a commanding 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Now, of course, they are one step away from winning a European trophy and securing a place back in Europe's premier club competition next season.",
      "Despite how poor their domestic form has been this season, supporters of other clubs in this country would kill to be in the position United will find themselves in on Wednesday evening.",

      "Yoro has improved each month during his debut season in Manchester and would be a nailed-on starter against Tottenham if he's fit enough to play. That remains to be seen, though.",

      "Lindelof has bags of experience and should be capable of filling in on the big stage, despite his contract situation. He arrived at United in the summer of 2017 and Luke Shaw is the only player in the dressing room who has been at the club for longer.",
      "This season was supposed to be low-key for Lindelof, but he has suddenly become important again and it's pretty staggering that he could start in another Europa League final for United.",

      "Noussair Mazraoui has cut out fizzy drinks from his diet, a self-imposed measure. He misses a soft drink at dinner and will treat himself if Manchester United win the Europa League final.",
      "Mazraoui was the most frugal of United’s five summer signings for an up-front fee of £12.8m. He has also been the most effective.",
      "Beyond Bruno Fernandes and Amad, Mazraoui has been the most consistent performer in the United squad. His availability has been so remarkable he required a corrective procedure after experiencing heart palpitations and did not miss a game.",
      "“That's a long time ago, it feels like ages ago,” Mazraoui says. “Everything was just fine. It was like nothing big or huge, nothing mention-worthy.”",
      "Mazraoui knew he had to make adjustments to his conditioning for his maiden season in English football. He feels the benefit, as much as he may miss some fizz. Mazraoui played a minimum of 40 games in only one season before he joined United. He has broken the 50 barrier this season.",
      "Until his breather at Brentford, Mazraoui had started in 13 successive matches. He only managed 15 Bundesliga starts for Bayern last season. In the Premier League, it is more than double that. A trophy would provide a sweet finale for a player who has deprived Mazraoui’s system of sugar.",
      "“To be honest, I'm surprised that you're telling me that I played in seven positions,” Mazraoui says. “I didn't know that.”",
      "You can’t blame Mazraoui for not counting. For those who have been: right centre back, left centre back, right back, left back, right wing, left wing and, most curiously, as the No.10.",
      "Rangers at home marked his sole enforced absence, through illness. Ruben Amorim has fretted about Mazraoui’s fitness in recent weeks and his importance could be gauged by his absence from the squad at Brentford.",
      "“Being in a season where you win everything, you come into a kind of flow where you can kick me, I will not feel it,” Mazraoui shrugs. “But when you lose a lot of games, you just give me a little step on my toes and you're in a lot of pain. It's a big difference.",
      "“It's a long season, like I said. It's the end of the season, so of course, physically, after playing so many games, I didn't do that quite often in my career, so of course you're going to feel it a little bit in the body.",
      "“I think the biggest example is Lyon, where we were almost dead in the last ten minutes of the game. Extra time, everybody's tired and everything, and you still manage to win.”",
      "Mazraoui has ping-ponged from right to left this season and his activity during United’s Europa League media day is similar. Mazraoui has to walk the breadth of the Stretford End to fulfil media engagements on Wednesday, inside and outside.",
      "By the time he stops to speak for an interview scheduled for 1pm, it is nearly 3.45pm. That is the sheer demand for one of United’s ever-presents.",
      "As one of the interviewees for the final, Mazraoui is a certainty to start. It is still unclear where yet the spate of centre back injuries suggest he would be a logical inclusion at right centre back.",
      "His relocation there could be permanent next season. “I have some qualities which fit perfectly with the position,” he explains. “Like in the right centre-back, I really like to go forward with the ball. So in the build-up and break the lines, that's something I can do good. So I'm comfortable on the ball.",
      "“But it's not like attacking as wing back. And wing back, a lot of times you come in a right wing position. For that, you really need like Amad one-v-one skill. That's maybe not my biggest strength.",
      "“So on both positions, you know some good points and some points which you feel like, ‘okay, maybe it's better to play in another position’.”",
      "Like everyone, Mazraoui suffered teething issues in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system. Mazraoui was recruited as a specialist right back capable of filling in on the left and, as an Ajax-schooled talent, his instinct is to attack.",
      "Under Amorim, it is markedly different for the defender. “In the beginning, some things were not like going automatically. So instead of going forward, you had to go on the break and stay in your position.",
      "“So some things were different. But eventually, now after a couple of months, this system, everybody knows what to do and how to do it.”",
      "Ten Hag reunited with Mazraoui two years after they both left Ajax in the same summer. Ten Hag gave Mazraoui his debut and the Moroccan played 150 times under the former United manager before he was sacked in October. The pair are still in touch.",
      "In Ten Hag’s penultimate match, he picked Mazraoui as the No.10 in the 1-1 Europa League draw with Fenerbahce. That was a surprise to almost everyone, including Mazraoui. “Yeah, it was a surprise. Not something I didn't do. I did it a really long time ago, before that moment.",
      "“I've always been quite good with Erik. It's not that I talk to him every week. I just texted him maybe one or two times more personally, like, how are you as a person, because it's not only about football.",
      "“You’re never happy with [a manager’s sacking], of course. Getting a manager sacked is always a feeling of disappointment. You feel it as a player as well.",
      "“So yeah, really, I was not happy with that. I was disappointed with that in myself and everybody else was as well, I think. So yeah, that was not the most happy part.”",
      "United have revelled in their Europa League commitments yet a Premier League side await in the final. Mazraoui started in all three defeats to Tottenham, trophyless since 2008.",
      "It is a dicey dynamic for the Premier League’s worst teams bar the sinking ships in the relegation zone. United have the trophy-winning nous and the pedigree yet Spurs are unbeaten in six matches against them.",
      "“Tottenham brings a lot of intensity in their games,” Mazraoui says. “We've seen this already this season. We've played, I think, already three times against them. So yeah, that's, I think, their biggest quality, that they bring so much intensity and pressing in everything, what they do.",
      "“Winning a trophy is never easy. I think in any case you don't downgrade that, because you have to fight hard to get into the position to win a trophy. You have to beat opponents who are strong and who are also really hungry to be in that final.",
      "“Eventually, I think if you look at the end of your career and you look back at your career, you will look back at this season you're going to be proud of winning if we win on Wednesday, of winning the Europa League, more than you're going to look at eventually at the failure in the Premier League. You can be, for sure, proud.”",
      "Are Tottenham’s wins against United relevant? “No, I don't think so. Because this is like a whole different competition. It's Europa League, it's a final, so the context around it is so different that you cannot really compare any games, any previous games with this final.”",
      "Amorim was at a loss to explain United’s Jekyll-and-Hyde form in the Premier League and Europa League. Manuel Ugarte, the last of the summer recruits, opined that the main difference was the physicality.",
      "Mazraoui pinpoints a more glaring issue. “Out of two chances in every Europa League, we score a minimum one. Out of the 20 chances we get in the Premier League, we don't manage to score one. That's the biggest difference.",
      "“So I don't think that has something to do with the league. I don't think that the goalkeepers in the Europa League are that much worse than in the Premier League, so yeah, that's the biggest difference.”",
      "That Dutch bluntness (Mazraoui was born in the Netherlands and retains a Dutch accent) thickens Mazraoui’s skin to withstand Amorim’s candour. He has no issue with some of the Portuguese’s diatribes.",
      "“I like him a lot in that [respect]. He's really honest, really straightforward, he's not hiding from anything,” Mazraoui enthuses. “No (it’s not hard to hear the criticism), for me personally not, because that's how I am as well.",
      "“I'm not hiding behind anything, and that's the manager as well. He takes responsibility, he knows he's the head of the club, eventually, because he's the manager. That's something I like a lot about him because I’m like that as well.”",
      "Mazraoui was involved in three Ajax title-winning sides and lifted the Meisterschale shield that is awarded to the German champions. His winners’ medals are on display at his home, offering daily motivation.",
      "If he gains another one next week, it may be soaked in fizz."

Amorim has been keen to stress that securing Champions League qualification will not paper over the cracks of United's worst season of the Premier League era, but the financial and morale boosts that would come with Champions League qualification cannot be understated.",
      "United and Tottenham both have injury concerns heading into the contest, with the latter set to be without Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Lucas Bergvall and Radu Dragusin.

It's unclear if he has picked up another knock or whether he just wasn't selected. Either way, it's difficult to envisage him being named in the squad if Yoro and De Ligt do return, even if he is fit.",

The Bradford-born forward would become Ligue 1's joint top goalscorer alongside Ousmane Dembele on the final day after bagging a brace in the 4-2 victory over Rennes.",
      "With the season now at a close for Greenwood, the forward took the time to reflect on what he has achieved in his life after Old Trafford. \"From day one, this club welcomed me like family,\" he explained.",
      "\"Ending the season in second and qualifying for the Champions League is something we can all be proud of. Being joint-top scorer in Ligue 1 is a proud moment for me personally, but the real highlight was playing in front of our incredible fans week in, week out.",
      "\"Your support means the world.\" At the time of writing, Diogo Dalot was among the current United squad to like Greenwood's post.",
      "In recent weeks, Greenwood has been linked with a move back to the Premier League. Reports have suggested that two Premier League teams are interested in signing the winger, but in his post-match interviews on Saturday, Greenwood insisted that he was happy to remain at Marseille next season."

      "This summer's transfer window promises to be eventful for Manchester United.",
      "With just two games left to play, United's direction of travel in this summer's window could be dictated by the outcome of Wednesday night's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",
      "Coming out on top at the San Mames Stadium will secure Champions League qualification for the Reds, meaning they will be much more attractive to prospective signings.",
      "Champions League qualification will also boost their transfer budget, offering Ruben Amorim more leverage to get his desired targets through the door.",
      "United plan to strengthen their squad this summer, meaning exits and arrivals are likely across various areas, and the midfield department is no exception. With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at what deals United should be striving to complete to freshen up their midfield options.",
      "Following United's transition to a 3-4-2-1 system under Amorim last November, full-backs who previously played in a back-four have had to adjust.",
      "Two wing-backs flank two central midfielders in Amorim's preferred shape, meaning they are expected to attack just as much they are expected to get back and assist the three centre-backs.",
      "Of United's current pool of wing-backs, Tyrell Malacia, who is currently out on loan at PSV Eindhoven, is the only one the Reds should be actively striving to offload this summer. His eight appearances under Amorim after returning from a lengthy spell on the sidelines quickly proved that he is not effective enough as a wing-back.",
      "Malacia's career has been built on playing as a traditional full-back, operating on the left of a four-man defence. He does not have the attack-minded profile and athleticism to operate as a wing-back.",
      "He has not set the world alight out on loan at PSV, playing just 12 times since arriving in February, meaning offers might not be forthcoming. However, one way or another, United need to move him on.",
      "Elsewhere, United need to lower the average age of their central midfielders by offloading Christian Eriksen and Casemiro. Eriksen will be released when his contract expires and will leave the club after three seasons.",
      "He has often done a solid job when called upon, proving key to United's success in 2022/23, but the time has come for the two parties to go their separate ways.",
      "Despite his eye-catching performances in the Europa League, United should also be looking to try and cash-in on Casemiro. The Brazilian is now 33 and he has struggled to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League.",
      "United must sell him for £15million this summer to avoid a financial loss under profit and sustainability rules [PSR].",
      "Elsewhere, United should look to try and send Dan Gore out on loan for the season. He has left Old Trafford in the last two January windows, joining Port Vale and Rotherham United respectively, but both loan stints were derailed by injury issues.",
      "Highly-rated by United staff, Gore would benefit from a full season out on loan, earning regular game time.",
      "Following Harry Amass' promotion to the first-team squad this season, there is confidence he will be able to compete with and challenge Patrick Dorgu at left wing-back next season.",
      "On the opposite flank, however, United may need fresh legs. As good as Noussair Mazraoui has been this season, he is restricted in an attacking sense, meaning his long-term position under Amorim could be as a centre-back.",
      "If that proves to be the case, and Amad is utilised as one of the two No.10s, Diogo Dalot may need a competitor at right-sided wing-back. United do have players within their academy that are emerging who could play in that position, such as Jaydan Kamason, but they may feel they need someone more experienced to challenge Dalot.",
      "Dorgu can play at right wing-back, likewise Amad, meaning they do, at least, have options.",
      "In the centre, Manuel Ugarte has grown into his first season at Old Trafford, but he is yet to prove himself as the elite-level destroyer United thought they were buying. If Casemiro departs, he will need replacing with a younger operator and multiple midfielders have been linked with the club.",
      "Crystal Palace ace Adam Wharton, who was linked with United before moving to London in January 2024, has excelled since making the switch to Selhurst Park. He is able to dictate games, progress the ball and win back possession.",
      "He would be perfect to help United continue evolving their midfield, but he will command a hefty price tag, with £60m having been reported as a possible fee. A player of his profile is exactly what United should be looking for.",
      "United may also make a case for trying to replace Eriksen with a younger operator. That, however, would likely be dependent on United finding a player who is happy to bide his time and develop before becoming a regular starter.",
      "Sunderland's Chris Rigg has been linked with Old Trafford and he is a player with enormous potential.",
      "However, Bruno Fernandes has demonstrated this season that he is very effective when playing in midfield, while Kobbie Mainoo is also capable of playing as a No.8, although his long-term position is yet to be determined.",
      "Wing-back options: Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu, Harry Amass, Jaydan Kamason, one new right wing-back.",
      "Central-midfield options: Manuel Ugarte, Adam Wharton, Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Chris Rigg."

      "Ruben Amorim's brutal honesty about Manchester United's dismal season is turning the Old Trafford dressing room into a more emotional and vulnerable environment, according to defensive stalwart Diogo Dalot.",
      "The Portuguese head coach hasn't sugar-coated United's woes since he arrived. A record of just six wins in 26 Premier League games highlights the depth of the club's domestic struggles.",
      "In January, he branded this the worst United side in history, and after the club's defeat to West Ham a week ago, he didn't hold back in revealing his own concerns and the fear that he could be sacked if he can't turn the club's fortunes around quickly.",
      "That isn't in danger of happening, with Amorim maintaining the support of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has someone who also shoots from the hip and admires Amorim's honest appraisals. But Dalot said seeing the 40-year-old so clearly suffering was hurting the players, while also encouraging them to show how much it is hurting them as individuals.",
      "\"Personally, it hurts a lot, especially not being able to be on the pitch, it hurts even more,\" said Dalot. \"But it is just something he is really honest about.",
      "\"He doesn’t hide his emotions. He doesn’t hide the type of communication he wants to express. And that makes him an honest guy, an honest person.",
      "\"That is really hard nowadays to find, managers and players that don’t go through what you are supposed to say or are supposed to feel. It just becomes natural. And I think being and seeing him like that, it makes you want to be exactly like that. If it hurts you, it is a good sign because you want to change things.\"",
      "Amorim has taken the blame for United's woes this season on his own shoulders, constantly placing his own job in the spotlight and taking responsibility for the run of results.",
      "\"Even if I don’t feel like that, it still hurts to say because he is speaking about my team, my teammates, my club,\" said Dalot. \"I don’t want to hear my manager and anybody around the club feeling like that.",
      "\"So what can I do to change that? That is what I focus on the most. I try to evolve as many team-mates as many people as I can into the same energy and then you have to fight. It is obviously something the club will address, the players have to address also. We have to look at ourselves and see what can I change to be better and try to get in the same pattern everyone should be.\"",
      "Dalot talks warmly about his fellow Portuguese and the attitude and approach he has brought to the job, but he insists he does have the edge and the anger required to succeed in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "\"Don’t get me wrong, he is a nice guy, but when he has to give a stick to everybody, he gives a stick. He isn’t afraid to say what he thinks,\" he said.",
      "\"I think you saw that since he came that he has his own ideas, he will not change for anybody. Because he thinks he is best for the clu,b and I can guarantee you it’s the best for the club. It will take a little bit of time.",
      "\"We see him as he is. When he is happy, he is happy; when he is angry he makes sure everybody knows he is angry. We just have to keep building because I believe together we will do great things.",
      "\"Everybody made a headline when he came about the big storm we needed to go through but that is what we are facing now and we will get through it and people will look back to this time as something was big for the club.\"",
      "Amorim put his hand into his own pocket to fund tickets and travel to Bilbao for family members of his backroom staff, a gesture Dalot said showed how much he cares.",
      "\"It shows how much he wants to keep the club united and keep everybody on the same page and how much he is willing to, in this case literally, pay to be able to everybody be together,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it is an amazing gesture, in my opinion. It could have been easily all the players doing it but just him by himself trying to have that relationship is something incredible.\"",
      "For all of United's domestic struggles, they have impressed in Europe and travel to Bilbao this week, targeting the Europa League trophy and qualification for the Champions League.",
      "They are unbeaten in 14 European matches and have scored 19 goals in six knockout games against Real Sociedad, Lyon, and Athletic Bilbao, but they face domestic opponents in Tottenham in the final.",
      "Dalot is second most-used United player this season but hasn't featured for a month after picking up a hamstring injury and is in a race against time to be fit for the final.",
      "\"At this stage I have to go day by day to see how I am feeling every day but so far so good,\" he said.",
      "\"It is part of the job. I wouldn’t think in these last two years [when he has played nearly every game] a time like this would arrive. After playing so many game it was a sign probably that the body needed a little bit of a rest but I am working really hard to come back as soon as possible.\""

Victory has also secured European football at Selhurst Park for the first time ever, with Oliver Glasner's side qualifying for next season's Europa League.",

      "Eze has scored 13 goals and provided 11 assists for Palace across all competitions this season, but the Eagles' participation in Europe next term may improve their chances of keeping hold of their star attacker. Speaking in September last year on what the future holds for him, he said: \"I'm so focused on just being the best player I can be, whatever interest comes, or whatever happens.",

United boss Amorim is eager to sign a goalkeeper to compete with Onana next season, however, with Bayindir likely to be sold and third-choice shot-stopper Tom Heaton's contract currently set to expire in the summer, although he may yet stay.",
      "Several names have been linked with a move in recent weeks, but despite United not prioritising a new goalkeeper, Rooney has called on the Old Trafford outfit to bring De Gea back to the club. The 34-year-old spent over a decade at United after joining from Atletico Madrid in 2011.",
      "He made more than 500 appearances for United across all competitions and established himself as one of the Premier League’s top goalkeepers. He left as a free agent in the summer of 2023 and spent a year without a club before joining Serie A side Fiorentina last summer.",

      "United booked their place in the last-16 with a 2-0 win over FCSB in Bucharest on January 30 and Casemiro stepped off the bench to replace Christian Eriksen with 18 minutes left on the clock.",
      "United were already two goals up following strikes from Diogo Dalot and Kobbie Mainoo, meaning it felt as though Casemiro's introduction was nothing more than an opportunity for him to stretch his legs, having not played since the end of December.",
      "In between the 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United on December 30 and the 2-0 win over FCSB at the end of January, United had played six times in three different competitions. Casemiro was an unused substitute on every occasion.",
      "It sparked theories that his United career could be over before the end of the January transfer window. He was linked with clubs in Saudi Arabia and an exit seemed possible, with his performance against Newcastle ranking as one of his worst in United colours.",
      "An extensive injury crisis meant he was recalled to the starting line-up for the first time since the Newcastle defeat when United lost 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur in February. Unsurprisingly, he was off the pace and struggled to deal with the likes of Rodrigo Bentancur and James Maddison.",
      "United were without Manuel Ugarte, Eriksen, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount against Spurs. Had they been available, Casemiro probably wouldn't have featured for the sixth league game running.",
      "Bruno Fernandes operated next to Casemiro in north London and it wasn't long before the Portugal international went on a terrific run of form.",
      "Operating from a deeper position, the United skipper was allowed to dictate the game and scan the play with much of it in front of him. He also started to increase his attacking output.",
      "Between late-January and the March international break, Fernandes started seven league games in midfield and contributed three goals and four assists. He also operated from midfield in both legs of United's Europa League last-16 triumph against Real Sociedad and netted a hat-trick in the second leg to fire United to a 4-1 win and the quarter-finals.",
      "Casemiro started next to Fernandes in both legs of the tie with Sociedad, with Ugarte unavailable for the first and being named on the bench for the second at Old Trafford. Casemiro's fourth and fifth Europa League starts of the season produced his best performances for some time, with the Brazilian able to cope with the slower pace.",
      "Unlike in the previous round, however, he was partnered by Ugarte, giving United a more defensive mindset in the centre of the pitch. Fernandes was reinstated as a No.10, despite his best form all season coming from a deeper role.",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's appointment as head coach back in November, it was widely anticipated that his preferred midfield partnership would be Ugarte and Mainoo. Instead, the latter is not currently a guaranteed starter.",
      "Casemiro and Ugarte have started each of United's last four games in the Europa League alongside each other and it is hard to imagine that partnership being broken up for Wednesday night's final against Tottenham in Bilbao. Of course, the key difference about the final in comparison to United's journey to it is that they have not come up against a Premier League counterpart in Europe.",
      "The pace of the game is likely to be much faster than United have been used to throughout their journey to Bilbao. Tottenham will no doubt be saying the same.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro, who has only featured in two of United's last six league games, is highly likely to start against the Londoners, and his performances in the Europa League this season are worthy of a starting berth.",
      "Few would have anticipated him playing himself back into the reckoning after being ignored by Amorim for six games running in January. Fernandes' form as a No.8 could also have prevented him being drafted back into the team.",
      "But as United gear up for a first European final in four years, Casemiro is likely to be central to Amorim's preparations."

      "Former Man Utd and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo has received a ‘tempting’ offer to leave Al-Nassr in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Ronaldo, who currently plays for Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, won numerous trophies with Man Utd, Real Madrid and Juventus before choosing to leave Europe in 2022.",
      "The Portugal legend has scored 798 goals in 1,060 club career appearances and will go down as one of the best players to have ever lived.",
      "Ronaldo left Manchester United in controversial circumstances at the end of 2022 during his second spell at the Premier League club with Erik ten Hag allowing him to leave and join Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr.",
      "The Al-Nassr star recently declared himself the “most complete player to have existed” in an interview with friend Edu Aguirre.",
      "Ronaldo said: “I’m talking about numbers. I think I’m the most complete player to have existed. In my opinion, I think it’s me. I do everything well in football: with my head, free kicks, left foot. I’m fast, I’m strong.",
      "READ: Twelve Man City players Guardiola should upgrade after FA Cup final defeat",
      "“One thing is taste — if you like Messi, Pelé, Maradona, I understand that and I respect that — but saying Ronaldo isn’t complete … I’m the most complete. I haven’t seen anybody better than me, and I say it from the heart.”",
      "And now Spanish newspaper Marca claims that the ‘absence of achievements’ at Al-Nassr since Ronaldo joined ‘has unleashed an earthquake at the club and when that happens in a Saudi entity, changes come throughout the structure and affects the field, bench and the upper echelons.’",
      "Ronaldo ‘has received a proposal from Brazilian soccer, considered out of the market for its importance’ with his ‘discomfort’ at Al-Nassr showing in recent weeks.",
      "The report adds that ‘while the storm is raging at Al Nassr’, Ronaldo has ‘received a major offer from a Brazilian team’ and the bid ‘could turn into an out-of-market offer with significant contributions from outside investors’.",

      "And for the Man Utd and Real Madrid legend ‘the offer is tempting and would open up the possibility of participating in the Club World Cup’ over the summer.",
      "With Erling Haaland picking up a number of injuries over the course of the season for Man City, there are some who would want to see the Norway international rested for the Club World Cup.",
      "When asked recently if Ronaldo could be a good stand-in for Haaland, former Man Utd striker Louis Saha said: “I don’t think it makes sense. It’s a tough question. It’s painful to think of Ronaldo at City. But also, I don’t think Ronaldo needs it, it wouldn’t be worth the message it would send.",
      "“Going to Man City for what? What is this new competition? For me, I don’t respect it. This competition for me is absolutely unnecessary. Almost like something strange based on the fight that they had with the Super League. I just don’t understand it.",
      "“Going there for Cristiano doesn’t make sense for me because the competition is not worth it.”",
      "Man City striker Erling Haaland has been told by Wayne Rooney why he and Kylian Mbappe will never reach the heights of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.",
      "Former Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly made three remarkable demands to Al Nassr during talks over a new contract.",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Football finance expert Dr Rob Wilson has suggested Cristiano Ronaldo could “sniff around” Manchester United, but he suggested Cheltenham would be a “great” option.",
      "Former Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has been backed to join arch-rivals Manchester City in a potential shock transfer.",
      "Only eight players in history have scored more Champions League knockout stage goals than Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, which really is daft."

He is a busy boy. Though he should absolutely have been sent off v Liverpool.",

      "The first declared the need for open heart surgery, whose advice was roundly ignored. The second identified a number of problem players and was busy moving them out and replacing parts in flight, while also dealing with the clusterf*** above him that continued to overpay for players and fail to get rid of others.",
      "We’ve then seen the team above the manager change, change again and change again, meanwhile signing off the recruitment of players who simply don’t fit, who then sacked the manager for not getting a perfect tune out of this mixed selection of walking wounded and unsuited.",
      "We did sign some excellent young players, which is good, and a shame we didn’t get to see a coach famed for developing youth have a chance with them.",

      "2. Arsenal’s CL run. Regardless of your opinions of Arteta, it seems strange to criticise him for getting a team to compete and be utter hard nutters when previously they were castigated for being too soft. You can dislike him and give him credit for being a decent manager too…! Those Declan Rice free kicks against Real will live long in the memory.",
      "3. Mo Salah being utterly brilliant. I remember watching the 3-6 against Spurs at Xmas and saying ‘Salah’s not done a lot here; Spence has dealt with him quite well.’ I still think the second part of the statement could be true, but he ended up with two goals and two assists, so what do I know?",
      "4. Manchester United being a bit pants. As someone born in the eighties and grew up in the nineties, I had to watch quite a few red Premier League lifts. To see them languishing towards the bottom of the league is a bit mad yet they could still put a trophy in the cabinet…it’s a bit bonkers.",
      "5. Bournemouth being boss for a period. Iraola has got that side playing some wonderful football and although they’ve dropped off slightly towards the end, no one expected them to be competing for European spots deep into the season. A big summer ahead could lead to real excitement next year.",
      "6. Nottingham Forest going mental. Although you can hang your hat on Nuno’s formation changes and when he’ll do them, I’m not sure anyone expected them to be this good, nor Chris Wood turn into prime original Ronaldo. I really hope they take one of the remaining European spots this Sunday. Ideally at the expense of….",
      "7. Club 130 charges. Winning nothing. As the yoot say, ‘you love to see it’.",
      "8. PSG looking like an actual team. The speed of the passing and transitions through midfield against the three English sides in the knockout phase was an absolute joy to watch at times. Luis Enrique has done a fantastic job; plus with all his charity work with child loss awareness really seems like one of the good guys (shout out to Lee here; hope you’re holding up, mate).",

      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.5\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace.

He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",

      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.7\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his last five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final.",

But he under-conceded v Liverpool and made five saves in the 1-0 win over Newcastle to draw him level with Sels for the Golden Gloves.",

      "Manchester Untied have reportedly put a shock ‘offer’ on the table to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa this summer, along with Barcelona.",
      "Martinez became the first goalkeeper to win the Yashin Trophy twice in October and has been a standout player for both club and country since his £15m move from Arsenal in the summer of 2020, helping Villa into the Champions League and winning both the World Cup and Copa America as Argentina’s No.1.",
      "But he’s been heavily linked with a move away of late and the 32-year-old was seen with tears in his eyes and waving to the fans at Villa Park after their key win over Tottenham on Friday night, suggesting it could be his last ever appearance at home for the Premier League side ahead of their crucial final day game against Manchester United at Old Trafford, which could be his new home.",
      "Responding to the footage of Martinez with tears in his eyes waving to the fans, Jamie Redknapp said it looked as though he was saying goodbye.",
      "Roy Keane added: “He’s been a good character. Obviously some people like him, he can be annoying sometimes – some of his antics – but he’s been a great signing and would be a big loss because it does look like he’s saying his goodbyes.”",
      "After the game, Villa boss Emery provided an update on the goalkeeper’s future: “We will see. Of course, it is the last match here [this season], and I don’t know. We will see about the team, the players, but of course, they are responding on the field.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano confirmed previous reports after the game that “it could be his last appearance at Aston Villa”.",
      "He said: ‘Dibu Martinez, emotional at full time as this could be his last appearance at Aston Villa – not sure yet but a possibility ahead of summer window.",
      "‘Understand Saudi Pro League clubs have approached Martinez in the recent weeks.",
      "‘Emi Martinez will assess all the options also from Europe after Saudi Pro League clubs approaches, as he’s expected to leave Aston Villa.’",
      "But now a report from Argentinian outlet claims Martinez could yet stay in Europe, with Manchester United supposedly battling Barcelona for his signing.",
      "Hansi Flick is on the lookout for a long-term replacement for Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who’s missed most of this season through injury and hasn’t convinced besides, while Ruben Amorim has reportedly asked United chiefs to source an upgrade for Andre Onana, who’s made a number of high-profile errors this term.",
      "DSports claim ‘Emiliano Martínez has offers from Manchester United and Barcelona to leave Aston Villa’ this summer.",
      "Aston Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez should be ashamed. He ‘did not dive at all’ for the first PSG goal and committed an actual crime for the second.",
      "Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez expects that the Paris Saint-Germain crowd will “insult me” but feels that the reception towards him will help his team-mates.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain icon Bernard Lama has started the war of words ahead of their match against Aston Villa, labelling Emiliano Martinez “annoying” and stating he is “not a great goalkeeper”.",
      "Former Aston Villa striker Darren Bent has told Chelsea that they “could get” Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, a player who would surely help their title credentials grow."

      "Pep doesn’t confront an equal like an opposition manager in his frustration because he is ultimately a coward. He wants an unequal playing field in his anger just as he does for his teams. For Pep has never been the underdog, the one who has to scrap and fight against the odds. The one who has lost a hundred times and gets the redemption of one moment when all his efforts are rewarded.",
      "He is a spoilt man child who can’t take losing and so stacks the odds in his favour anyway he can and is this fails he cannot cope. Like his state owned club he will behave anyway he likes and knows he will be bailed out by his name and reputation which is he has so carefully curated his whole career. Just as his club can break every rule known to the league they play in and bully that same league in court for years on end rather than pay their dues.",

League so raging against it being diluted further is like adding a gallon of water to a lake and objecting it’ll raise the level.

      "Here’s every current Premier League manager ranked by how much they moan – from the zen monks to the ticking time bombs.",
      "",
      "20) Simon Rusk (Southampton)\nTriggered Ruben Dias and for that, not a single bad word will be said about Southampton’s interim manager.",
      "",
      "19) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nHe seems nice, doesn’t he? Glasner gives off the vibe that he doesn’t have a care in the world as long as the powers above just leave him to coach in peace.",
      "",
      "18) Eddie Howe (Newcastle United)\nIt’s rare to see Howe lose his cool. He’s just a chill guy. And for that, we can’t praise him enough. Managing in the Premier League is a chastening experience, yet Howe makes it look like a walk in the park.",
      "That said, he’s not above the odd moan – but more often than not, he takes his medicine and moves on. A true modern-day stoic.",
      "",
      "17) Kieran McKenna (Ipswich Town)\nWe’re not ashamed to admit we’re not entirely sure if McKenna is a moaner or not, which probably means he’s not. Calm, composed and too well-raised to throw shade at referees. We suspect he apologises to fourth officials for blocking their view.",
      "",
      "16) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nThree-time Europa League winner Unai Emery is an animated manager, but not overly moany. He’s actually polite and respectful in interviews — and used to be mocked for it.",
      "",
      "15) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nUnited boss Amorim is more prone to self-loathing than anything else. If he moans, it’s about himself or his players being rubbish. It’s a refreshing change from his predecessor, Erik ten Hag, who would rather die than admit fault and still believes Alejandro Garnacho was onside because VAR used the “wrong angle”.",
      "Amorim may yet explode – it’s United, after all – but for now, his grievances are existential.",
      "",
      "14) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nPotter is a man slowly being lured to the dark side by the soul-sapping grind of managing West Ham United. And we can’t blame him. Reporters beware: he might still be polite, but he can swear if you want him to.",
      "",
      "13) Ruud van Nistelrooy (Leicester City)\nThere have been whispers of discontent – complaints about Caleb Okori’s boots, frustrations with players’ living arrangements and public criticism – but overall, Van Nistelrooy has kept a lid on things. He’s moaned, yes, but with humility. Leicester’s chaos hasn’t exactly helped.",
      "",
      "12) Pep Guardiola (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola is in a camp of his own as a very knowing, quite weird and extremely funny manager. He is unintentionally hilarious and we wouldn’t have it any other way.",
      "",
      "11) Thomas Frank (Brentford)\nWhen things don’t go his way, Thomas Frank is well accustomed to throwing his toys out of the pram. Generally, though, he’s pretty reserved and honest, and tends to give compelling answers in both pre- and post-match press conferences.",
      "",
      "10) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nIt’s been plain sailing for Slot in year one, but when the mask did slip – against Everton – it was spectacular. Even in defeat to PSG, he was almost serene. But four yellow cards suggest something’s simmering under the surface. Next season, we’ll see the real him.",
      "",
      "9) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nThere’s no hard evidence – but Pereira feels like a moaner. This season has gone well for him, which helps. But if Wolves had VAR go against them in a key game, you just know he’d throw the fourth official’s board into the stands.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nMaresca recently complained about the St James’ Park atmosphere influencing the referee, as if Nicolas Jackson hadn’t just elbowed Sven Botman in the head. Pick your battles, Enzo.",
      "His comments may have been more about the decisions that followed, and Maresca comes across more as a disciplinarian and standard-setter than a simple moaner.",
      "",
      "7) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nGet this man going, and it’s hard to stop him. Forest’s incredible season means Nuno hasn’t had much to complain about, but we all know he has it in him.",
      "",
      "6) David Moyes (Everton)\nMoyes might be more reserved and calm now he’s back at Everton, but there’s no doubt he still loves a good moan. It’s not always reporters who get the brunt of his frustration — sometimes it’s poor German ball boys. Nobody is safe when he’s in the mood.",
      "",
      "5) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nThe youngest boss in the league found himself in Arsenal’s crosshairs after claiming Declan Rice’s red card early in the season was fair and saying Joao Pedro booting the ball away was irrelevant. Arsenal fans noticed – and pounced.",
      "Hurzeler’s comments ensured the Gunners sleuths were ready to swarm at the first hint of hypocrisy. And they did just that. Their obsessive nature has kept the German’s moaning firmly in the social media spotlight — helping to propel him up this ranking.",
      "",
      "4) Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham Hotspur)\nBig Ange is ranked high, mainly because he despises Spurs fans and hates having to be Spurs manager. That results in a lot of moans, groans and passive-aggressive monologues in press conferences. His inconsistencies are part of the charm, though – ‘everyone’s human, mate’ becomes ‘the whole system is broken’ within a week.",
      "He’ll be gone soon. We’ll miss him.",
      "",
      "3) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nNo Premier League manager has received more yellow cards this season than Andoni Iraola, with his most recent caution coming on February 1 against Liverpool. He’s learning. Slowly.",
      "The Basque boss wears his heart on his sleeve and isn’t shy about speaking his mind — even when Bournemouth win.",
      "",
      "2) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nWe are now into the category of top-tier moaners. In second place is Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta — who many would have top, and we wouldn’t blame them.",

      "Man Utd lose to ‘Kavanagh FC’\nIn the money laundering cycle, I believe Chris Kavanagh tonight was what you’d call the washing part of the cycle. United 14 “fouls” and 6 yellows. Chelsea only 10 fouls (should have been plenty more) and 1 yellow for time wasting. Nothing for simulation, he did give Amad one despite a contact (never a penalty I’ll agree). But it’s not like the home fans are intimidating they only know how to sing their own name. He was given his orders. There were some positives for United to take in the first half but didn’t deserve to lose to Kavanagh FC.\nAnthony",
      "READ: Chelsea, Aston Villa made to sweat in Champions League race as Blues star proves Maresca wrong",
      "",
      "Well done Chris Kavanagh. You got Chelsea there in the end. Even brought a friend on to the field dressed in full Chelsea kit (JT?) to disturb things.",
      "State of officiating in this league. Embarrassing.\nGarey Vance, MUFC",
      "",
      "United/Chelsea combined XI…\nI always enjoy the combined XI’s, so thought I would have a stab at United vs. Chelsea, as I don’t agree with the WhoScored selected team (as the article mentions, some of the ratings don’t pass the eye test). I’m also going to a 4 2 3 1 formation because it works for me on Football Manager and therefore is right.",
      "GK: I’m going to give Onana the nod, mainly due to bias, but if I was being a prick and not admitting to my bias, I’d probably make some vague claims about his form for Ajax and Inter and a loose point about United’s defence being an absolute shower of clowns",
      "RB: Mazraoui gets in because he has been an excellent addition, the sort of which we don’t make nearly enough of these days. A fully fit and in form James would obviously start, but as with Shaw at LB, this simply hasn’t been the case often enough",
      "CB: I haven’t watched much of Chalobeh so will just assume that F365 are right in saying he has been strong since coming in to the side",
      "CB: If I could stick VAR here I would as it seems to be the best hope of not conceding (certainly for United), but since we haven’t fully moved to AI yet, I’ll stick with Tosin",
      "LC: Would love to say Shaw but Cucarella has clearly been better this season, so he starts",
      "DM: I’m honestly quite pleased for Caicedo, purchased for crazy money and hounded for that, but has been strong for most of this season",
      "CM: Bruno, can do everything. Also very likely the captain",
      "AM: Palmer has had a difficult second half of the season, but is a certain starter in my team (also a Manc which gives him bonus points)",
      "RW: Amad has really come on this season when given a chance, and I am firmly of the opinion that in a half decent side he would be even better",
      "LW: Probably my bias again but I’m going with Garnacho (cannot understand why some United fans want him gone – frustrating sure, but capable of magic)",
      "FW: Has to be Jackson, even if he was a d*ck the other week",
      "This team could probably finish about mid-table…\nJack (Probably should have just stuck Bruno in Chelsea’s XI) Manchester",

      "I know Gyokeres has scored a few crackers, but the goal Sesko scored against Bayern a couple of weeks ago is the sort of ‘holy shit’ goal that should make prioritising him a no brainer.",
      "There is no-one on our team currently who can do that; sign him up!\nTom, (looking forward to another Wembley playoff final, up the O’s!) Leyton",

      "Should Man Utd have a parade? ‘Of course they f***ing should’… \nI’ll just start by saying that I didn’t take offence to someone else being called Lee. Amusing as that would be, I wish I’d thought of that first to be honest. I read your mail and it did come across to me as someone trying to minimise how ineffectual Ratcliffe is. If I misread that then apologies.",
      "Should Man U celebrate the Europa League with a parade? Of course they f***ing should. It’s a trophy! The whole point of the sport is to win trophies. Parades are also excellent for the city and businesses within it, the fact earthworm Jim doesn’t want to have one further exemplifies what a sh*t businessman he is that he doesn’t recognise it’s good for PR. Good for brand. Good for his business and local business and also brings some Levity to what has been a rough season for the Manchester tarts.",
      "That shouldnt be even the slightest bit controversial. You can both celebrate a trophy while also addressing the failings in the league.",
      "Second hot topic since United are in the final is whether it’s fair or not for a team finishing outside European qualifications to then get it for winning a trophy. Would Wenger et al also argue Palace shouldn’t get in Europe if they win the FA Cup? Or how about Seville when they won it and finished 12th that year? Or do these silly rules only apply to clubs we don’t like?",
      "I actually think cup wins should be given better access to Europe. It’s silly that 4th place gets a place in the Champions League but the team who wins the FA Cup doesn’t. All trophy wins should be rewarded with European football.",
      "FA Cup = CL\nLeague cup = Europa\nEuropa = champs league\nConference league = Europa",
      "Winning trophies should always be more valuable than finishing 2nd or below. It’s crazy we currently don’t think it is.",
      "I genuinely think this change would be great as it would motivate absolutely everyone to take them seriously and stop moaning about fixture congestion. It also makes those trophies more prestigious again and provides the winners with a financial bonanza because the £2m that the FA cup currently rewards isn’t even a months gate receipts for a top 10 club. It would also mean that more actual champions are in the champions league.",
      "If you think finishing 4th should be better rewarded than winning a trophy I think you miss the point of football. This season 5th place will get in..5TH! some of the other leagues in Europe don’t even get in if they win their league and we have 5th place getting in?",
      "Wenger has a lot of ideas I agree with, but that isn’t one of them. I’ll take his keepers concede a corner when they time waste though, that’s an excellent rule.\nLee",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n👉 Forget Newcastle and even possibly Spurs; the best ‘overdue silverware’ story would be Crystal Palace\n👉 ‘Arrogant’ Arsenal star, five Man Utd flops, only one Spurs man in ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of 2024/25\n👉 Six Leverkusen standouts reassigned post-Alonso to Real Madrid with Liverpool given two signings",

      "C, it’s not self imposed misery. If you’ve ever read the mailbox, you’ll know that I, and every United fan I’ve ever met, care more about and enjoy a cup final win over something accountants care about like the top 4 trophy. Something you can actually remember and celebrate.",
      "Few reminisce 5 years down the line over that run to 4th if you don’t win the Champions League next year (only Liverpool have ever done that, maybe Chelsea too, no time to look) or if it is something you have done before and are reasonably expected to do. Winning a trophy is an amazing memory no matter how small – the day out, the one-off emotions of it all, the party afterwards, that’s what football is all about. That doesn’t always warrant an open bus top parade that shuts down a city though, and really it shouldn’t. Funnily enough, the hardest places to get permission are Manchester and London, go figure.",
      "Also all teams and councils aren’t the same, it comes down to relativity. United basically won trophies every single year, you have to apply to the council to have a parade and that comes with implications. So in their pomp, United only have parades for major trophies (Prem and Champs), since then, they’ve maintained that. It doesn’t mean there aren’t major fan celebrations in other forms, just not a parade that shuts down a city, requires policing, logistics with local authorities, road closures, permissions from businesses that require access, safety concerns, ambulances assigned, etc. Hopefully you get the point.",
      "Newcastle never win sh*t, Leeds and other teams likewise, so shutting down the city once every 25-100 years for a parade makes sense. In Manchester, there would be parades every single year with varying levels of interest/disinterest – look at City’s ‘turn-out’ for a treble lol.",
      "West Ham had a parade for the Intertoto cup, Portsmouth had a parade and were roundly mocked for reaching the FA cup final, Cardiff for finishing 2nd…. mocked, mocked, mocked. I’m sure United headlines would be full of capitalised EMBARRASSMENT and SHAME if they had a parade.",
      "I must repeat and emphasize without sounding rude, I’m guessing your fandom is online only – Many celebrations happen in the city for trophy wins, just not an open-top parade that shuts the city down…. no one is miserable after a win. Hope that clears things up.",
      "Now, name the lamest reason for a parade that anyone can remember – it’s West Ham btw.",
      "Moses\nP.S. The top 4 trophy should be renamed the Accountants Cup, you generally never go further than the round of 16 at best and doesn’t often translate to long-term success without a Big Billy Billionaire to build on it.",

      "Late offsides…\nA few thoughts on the ‘late offsides’ debate. I find this gets an unwarranted amount of airtime so I’ll give it some more",
      "It seems like the numerous proponents of this argument have been desperate for an injury in the few seconds of ‘meaningless play’ preceding a late flag that occur in most games to prove their point. It has now finally happened after a mere 5 years and nearly 2000 games of Premier League football demonstrating the likelihood of injury in this phase of play is extremely low.",
      "During this time there have been multiple other serious injuries some of which could have no doubt been avoided through more consistent refereeing of dangerous tackles and violent conduct or a reduction in the fixture burden. These seem like much more pressing issues.",
      "It would be very difficult to introduce a rule whereby the flag is raised for obvious offsides. In the Villa PSG game, Shearer was moaning about the flag going up late when Dembele went through, but went silent when the replays showed he was actually on. Even in the game in question, the offside looked more obviously than it was because elanga was almost at full pace and the defender was stepping up. If the ball was released a couple of milli-seconds earlier it would have been on.",
      "It would also create an imbalance whereby VAR is able to correct situations when the flag should have gone up but not when the flag went up but shouldn’t have for the most obvious errors, leading to less goals.",
      "Finally, the whole concept of a ‘meaningless period’ of play is a bit philosophical and hindsight driven. Most of the play in football is meaningless when you know what happens next. Towards the end of the season some entire games are meaningless and indeed some clubs have been meaningless throughout their entire history (Spurs). Why do people get so worked up by the max 5-10 seconds per game from late offside flags?\nWill AFC",
      "",
      "Time for a change…\nHere’s a wild idea for a Thursday afternoon that will grow the English game to new heights – Champions League playoffs. Hear me out.",
      "As someone who has never been comfortable with the idea of the Champions League containing teams who finished second, let alone fifth – these are not “Champions” people – I’ve always thought at least one of the additional spaced should be given to our domestic cup winners. That really would bring back the magic of the FA Cup and/or give the League Cup some relevance it’s never really had. Everyone always objects to this for perfectly good reasons, though often this boils down to “my team always finished in the top four so why should I vote for that?”. Arsenal fans basically.",
      "However, with every additional spot, the Premier League gets for the Champions League, the whole thing is becoming more and more that European Super League that we all said we definitely didn’t want (big fan of the new format though). Even with United and Spurs threatening not to compete in any sort of European football next season, they’ve both blundered their way to a final chance to win Big Cup next year. We need to do something about this nonsense.",
      "And then we have the everlasting spectre of playing meaningful games abroad. We don’t want it but the money men certainly do. Give them the Community Shield I used to say.",
      "Until now.",
      "What i propose, is that in the seasons where England gets a fifth Champions League spot, an end of season tournament is held to decide who gets it. Four teams vying for the same thing Arsenal win nearly every year without any actual hardware to show for it. In fact let’s lay a trophy on the line as well. (To be designed by the mailbox, naturally).",
      "To qualify, you must win the FA Cup, the League Cup or finish 5th or 6th. If the FA Cup or League Cup winners are in the top four then it’s extended to 7th. If both are in the top four then 8th gets a go too.",
      "As an example, if City win the FA Cup, this year’s playoffs would currently include Chelsea, Aston Villa, Forest and Brentford, Brentford beating Forest 4-0 in the final. Tell me that doesn’t sound like fun? This would give us 5 champions – Liverpool, Newcastle (league cup), City (FA Cup), Brentford (5th Place trophy) and Spurs (Europa League – United becoming #1 banter club in the process) – and Arsenal (trophyless but definitely “THE BEST TEAM” qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "This also gives Palace more incentive to beat City in the Cup Final (cos they need more apparently) and replace Brentford in the Fifth place trophy playoffs. Imagine the live feed to Brian Mbeumo’s living room (he’s got the whole team round to watch obviously) as Palace score two last minute goals to get a come from behind win against City. Gutted. You’ve also got Fulham in 11th with a chance of grabbing that final spot off Brentford in the next two weeks. It’s magic.",
      "And finally, we can do all this abroad to shut everyone up about the 39th game. It’s basically meaningless but also potentially transformative for a side that wins it so might just hit the sweet spot and be acceptable to English Fans.",
      "It’s amazing. I’m surprised no one’s thought of it already!",
      "I mean it’s definitely more interesting than what happens now though I suppose it provides another backdoor into the Champions League for underperforming clubs. It also adds games to an overcrowded football schedule. And it’s bad for the planet.",
      "I guess what I really want is for UEFA to limit Champions League entry to League winners, reinstate the Cup Winners Cup and let everyone else fight it out in the Europa League. But somehow my other idea seems more likely. It’s probably not an original idea but if it is I want 10% of the revenue generated by it.\nAshmundo (UPTFR)",
      "",
      "Goodbye Goodison…\nSad to see another of the great grounds depart. Between Highbury, WHL, Upton Park, The Dell and Maine Road…and Roker Park, the Baseball Ground…these stadia all had something so unique, and despite Spurs seemingly having done what many of the others failed, in retaining a sense of the old ground – just on steroids – the fans of all those teams I have spoken to, all miss the old ground, and would happily return to their old homes.",
      "The reasons for moving are all sound, but there will always be something hollow in the new stadium.",
      "Misty eyed nostalgia? Sure. I mean, I don’t miss being crammed into a toilet splashing around in piss, or the jostling queue for a warm plastic bottle of Carslberg, but the echoes of glory (and failure) can’t be recaptured.",
      "So, to Evertonians, good luck in the new gaff but I promise you, you’ll never feel about it the way you do Goodison Park.\nDan",
      "",
      "People do watch women’s football… \nI saw ATG’s mail this morning asking whether any men watch the women’s game, and I wanted to chime in—because I absolutely do. I follow the Chelsea Women just as closely as the men’s team, and what a season it has been under Sonia Bompastor. An unbeaten WSL campaign, multiple records shattered, and now a shot at completing a domestic treble in this weekend’s FA Cup Final.",
      "From what I’ve seen when attending matches, there’s a strong presence of male fans in the stands—but what really stands out is the number of families. The atmosphere is less hostile than the men’s games, making it a more welcoming and enjoyable experience for people of all ages. The ticket prices are also far more accessible, which certainly helps when bringing the whole family along.",
      "Personally, I’ve seen the women’s game grow dramatically in both audience and quality in recent years. If you haven’t yet, I really encourage all football fans to watch their women’s team, support them, and if possible, attend a match in person.\nThe Admin @ At The Bridge Pod"

      "Two games both featuring one side desperate to win in order to qualify for the Champions League and another that couldn’t give a damn in a bid to achieve the very same feat is an historically bizarre state of affairs. The 7.30 and 8.15 kick-offs on a Friday night only added to the unsettling feeling.",
      "Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou took very different approaches with their starting lineups in preparation for the Europa League final next week. Amorim came good on his promise of picking a strong Manchester United XI against Chelsea in a bid to avoid them being caught cold in Bilbao, while injury fears prompted Postecoglou to play the Tottenham backups vs Aston Villa.",
      "This perceived injustice led to great gnashing of teeth from Blues fans, who had seen their side romp to a 3-1 win over a hungover Liverpool less than two weeks ago, up against a midfield trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott. Swings and roundabouts.",
      "It wasn’t a walk at Villa Park anyway. Son Heung-min looked like something closer to his old self on a happy hunting ground that’s seen him score more Premier League goals as a visitor than any other player (6), swinging a curled effort just over the bar, while Wilson Odobert’s flick after an excellent counter-attacking move was well saved by Emiliano Martinez in a first half which saw the home fans grow increasingly nervy and quiet.",
      "Villa were the dominant team. Antonin Kinsky was forced into a wonderful save to deny Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins was found in excellent positions on two or three occasions, while the outstanding Marco Asensio was frequently seen drifting past challenges in the No.10 position and saw one whipped effort drift agonisingly wide of the post.",
      "It was pretty clear after 13 minutes at Stamford Bridge that things weren’t going to plan. This Manchester United team had been in the ascendency to such a degree that Chelsea had lost all sense of themselves, leading Robert Sanchez to wave the players forward from a free-kick deep in the Blues half before booting it in the general direction of the helpless Tyrique George. There’s nothing Enzo Maresca hates more.",
      "When Harry Maguire volleyed in Bruno Fernandes’ cross, before they were handed a VAR reprieve for the most marginal of offsides, the Chelsea players resembled England vs Iceland at Euro 2016: anxious; confused; shellshocked. And they were playing the football to match.",
      "We lost count of the number of missed passes, while simply controlling the ball appeared to require extraordinary levels of concentration. Aside from an early fluff from Noni Madueke, which would probably have been ruled out for offside had he scored in any case, and a stunning effort from Reece James from outside the box which clipped the post, Chelsea offered very little against a side proven to wilt under the slightest pressure.",

      "An unchallenged Watkins headed John McGinn’s deep corner towards goal for the unchallenged Ezri Konsa to sweep the ball home, and there was no hope (not that they cared) from that point on for Spurs, who were fortunate to concede just once more, with Boubacar Kamara cutting inside to fire into the bottom corner and ramp the pressure up on Chelsea, where the unease swept from the silent stands onto the pitch.",
      "They were again fortunate not to go behind at the start of the second half, as turncoat Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes both missed decent chances after linking up with Amad Diallo.",
      "There was no urgency from Chelsea and, Moises Caicedo aside, a stunning lack of forward thrust from a side in desperate need of a goal but with no apparent method of scoring one. The impact of George playing out of position as the No.9 paled in comparison to the suspended Nicolas Jackson, who’s a long way from perfect and an absolute fool for getting sent off against Newcastle, but is a handful for defenders even at his worst.",
      "Chelsea relied upon the only player to provide a moment of quality in the first half to come up trumps in the second. It was brilliant from James, who unsurprisingly impressed throughout at right-back because he’s a brilliant right-back and not a central midfielder, no matter how much Enzo Maresca tries to convince us he is.",
      "Space opened up for the captain on the edge of the box for a shot, but instead of taking it on with his left, he pirouetted onto his right and as everyone expected him to let fly he clipped the ball delightfully to the back post for Marc Cucurella, who extended his lead as Chelsea’s top scorer in 2025 with his fifth goal this year.",
      "Helped by an understandably meek Manchester United, whose focus had well and truly turned to Wednesday as Amorim rang the changes after going behind, Chelsea saw the game out comfortably, with some very welcome passion displayed by the players, manager and fans that was absent for 70 minutes here and all too often in a run that had seen them slip from the Champions League places.",

      "The Red Devils allowed the Brazil international to leave Old Trafford and move to Real Betis on loan until the end of the season in the winter transfer window.",
      "Man Utd spent around £87m on Antony in the summer of 2022 but he made very little impact in his two-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony contributed just five Premier League goals and three assists in 62 appearances with the 25-year-old making no league starts this season before the Red Devils offloaded him to Betis.",
      "But the Brazilian has been impressing in La Liga with the winger contributing eight goals and two assists in 23 matches in all competitions for the Spanish outfit.",
      "Real Betis have been keen to make the move permanent in summer with Man Utd hoping to permanently remove him from their books.",
      "READ: ‘Arrogant’ Arsenal star, five Man Utd flops, only one Spurs man in ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of 2024/25",
      "But now reports in Spain claim that his continuation at Real Betis beyond this season has been ‘seriously complicated’ and the ‘main obstacle is qualifying for the Champions League’.",
      "It now looks almost certain that Real Betis will finish outside the top five in La Liga and that ‘directly affects the club’s financial aspirations, which would be unable to afford either a loan with advantageous terms or a permanent signing of the player.’",
      "Man Utd have told Antony that he is ‘not in their plans for next season’ with the Red Devils ‘looking for a way out for him, preferably through another loan, in the hope that he will maintain his form and increase his market value’.",
      "And now Villarreal, who look likely to pip Betis to fifth place and a Champions League spot, ‘enters the scene’ and the prospect of moving to El Submarino Amarillo ‘has enticed Antony’s entourage, who are keen to remain in Spain, but with a team with greater international exposure’.",
      "The Brazilian would ‘would fit perfectly into the manager’s plans’ at Villarreal with the Spanish club having the ‘upper hand’ over rivals Real Betis.",
      "It is understood that ‘what is clear’ is that Antony ‘will leave Manchester United again, and his destiny will be determined by the most ambitious project he faces.’",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen recently advised Antony to stay at Real Betis as he “has no future” at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "According to reports, one ‘beleaguered’ Manchester United star ‘faces’ being offloaded this summer, while three potential replacements have been mooted.",
      "Former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs has named four current Red Devils stars with no “way back” under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "These six could all move this summer – three are basically confirmed, and Kevin De Bruyne is certain to leave City. We reckon Arsenal should take a look.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could scupper Tottenham Hotspur’s hopes of signing England international Angel Gomes on a free transfer.",
      "Spurs in Norway on an artificial pitch? Nothing to worry about, lads. Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta must inspire an Arsenal comeback against PSG.",
      "Man Utd are closing in on their first summer departure with Atletico Madrid ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony, according to reports."

      "Manchester City and Chelsea somehow escape unscathed, while Liverpool – predictably – have no representatives in the ‘Big Eight’ Premier League Worst XI of the season; Manchester United have five.",
      "To keep things fair, this team only includes players who’ve made at least 20 appearances and 10 starts in the Premier League this season. Match ratings come via WhoScored, so don’t blame us — blame the algorithm.",
      "",
      "GK: Andre Onana (Manchester United) – 6.52\nEvery goalkeeper has a clanger in them – it comes with the territory when you’re playing in the most high-risk position on the pitch. But this is a particularly erratic bunch. Robert Sanchez, Guglielmo Vicario and Onana have all been walking VAR checks at times, while Emiliano Martinez, Ederson and Nick Pope aren’t exactly bastions of reliability either. Even David Raya and Alisson have had wobbles, though they’re clearly less error-prone than the rest.",
      "The algorithm has Onana rock bottom of the lot, and it’s hard to argue. Four errors leading to a shot and three leading directly to goals in the Premier League – plus a bizarre knack for making himself look smaller in his goal – make him a prime candidate to be replaced. If United had a bigger budget, Ruben Amorim would surely axe him.",
      "",
      "RB: Archie Gray (Spurs) – 6.17\nWe do feel for young Archie Gray. He’s filled in at right-back, centre-back and left-back in an injury-ravaged Spurs side, with the occasional reward of a cameo in midfield – his actual position.",
      "It’s been a turbulent season for Ange Postecoglou and his squad, and the algorithm has picked out Gray as the scapegoat, somehow making him the only Spurs player in the ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of the season.",
      "Clocking up 1,563 Premier League minutes is no small feat, but playing here, there and everywhere, rarely in his natural role, probably isn’t doing wonders for his development.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.33\nAnother teenager enduring a bruising introduction to Premier League life. Leny Yoro’s debut season has been littered with injury setbacks, and limping off against West Ham on Sunday now puts his Europa League final place in doubt.",
      "That would be a fitting end to a stop-start campaign. United were warned about his fitness record before splashing £52million on him from Lille last summer. A metatarsal injury in just his second appearance ruled him out for months, and he didn’t make his Premier League debut until December 4.",
      "There’s clearly loads of potential – no-one’s disputing that – and it’s been a brutal year for just about everyone at Old Trafford. But this has been far from the ideal start for the 19-year-old in particular.",
      "",
      "CB: Pau Torres (Aston Villa) – 6.41\nA bit of experience at the back, but not quite the calming influence Aston Villa hoped for. Pau Torres looked a smart signing after arriving from Villarreal in July 2023, settling quickly into Unai Emery’s system. But things have unravelled somewhat in 2024/25.",
      "Villa’s January-February wobble – one win in seven with Torres injured – seemed to underline his importance. But since returning to fitness, he’s played in just four of their last eight games, all wins, and isn’t looking quite as undroppable as he once did.",
      "With calls for Tyrone Mings to get the nod over him, Torres suddenly feels more like a rotation option than a defensive cornerstone.",
      "",
      "LB: Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal) – 6.41\nJamie Carragher compared him to Wayne Rooney and Jude Bellingham, praising his “football arrogance” – and it’s been a pretty spectacular breakthrough season for Myles Lewis-Skelly. But two red cards have dragged down his average rating enough to sneak him into this back four.",
      "Still, the talent is obvious, and he looks every inch a long-term fixture in Arsenal’s defence for the next decade. Not a Young Player of the Year candidate, though, clearly.",

      "With Joelinton ruled out for the season, Willock looked like the natural alternative. But after starts against Ipswich and Brighton, he didn’t feature at all in the win over Chelsea, with Anthony Gordon preferred in a reshuffled XI.",
      "The lack of consistent starts has dragged down his average rating, and Willock ends up with the second-lowest score in this XI – only Gray has fared statistically worse.",
      "",
      "CM: Christian Eriksen (Manchester United) – 6.41\nSet to leave Manchester United when his contract expires this summer, Christian Eriksen just scrapes into this XI with 11 starts and 22 Premier League appearances in 2024/25.",
      "It’s been a miserable season all round, but United could still salvage something by beating Eriksen’s former club, Spurs, in next Wednesday’s Europa League final. He’s unlikely to start that one, which means he’ll probably get run-outs against Chelsea and Aston Villa in the final two league games – in a last-gasp attempt to bump his average rating and escape this team. Because obviously, that’s what he really cares about.",
      "",
      "RW: Leon Bailey (Aston Villa) – 6.42\nIn 23 Premier League appearances this season, Leon Bailey has managed a meagre one goal and two assists – and picked up more yellow cards (three) than either.",
      "Injuries continue to hamper the Jamaican, who took a step forward last term but hasn’t kicked on this time around. Villa have coped well without him, and with Marcus Rashford likely to leave, Donyell Malen looks set to leapfrog Bailey in Unai Emery’s pecking order – alongside Jacob Ramsey and Morgan Rogers.",

      "AM: Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United) – 6.32\nSigned from Bologna last summer to ease the burden on Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee looked an instant hit when he scored the winner on his debut against Fulham – but that was the high point for the Dutchman.",
      "The big question remains: where is his best position? It could be attacking midfield, up front, or maybe he’s destined for a Joelinton-style reinvention as a box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Rather than seeing this as a problem, Amorim might do well to view Zirkzee’s versatility as a genuine opportunity.",
      "",
      "LW: Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa) – 6.43\nVilla might feel hard done by having three players in this worst XI, but hey, life isn’t fair, and the algorithm doesn’t lie.",
      "Ramsey’s red card against Bournemouth last weekend didn’t do his average rating any favours, helping land him a spot in this unfortunate XI after making the worst team of the weekend.",
      "With one goal and five assists from 28 Premier League games in 2024/25, it’s a disappointing return for a player with top talent. Still, at 23, he’s one of the brightest young talents in Emery’s squad.",
      "",
      "ST: Rasmus Hojlund (Manchester United) – 6.27\nIt’s hard to say anything about Hojlund that hasn’t already been said – the young Dane frustrates United fans every week, doing everything possible to make his £70m price tag feel like yet another colossal transfer disaster at Old Trafford.",
      "In 30 Premier League appearances this season, he’s managed a miserable four goals. Whatever excuses you want to make for United’s struggles or his age, that return is nowhere near good enough for a striker who cost so much.",

      "Saturday 17 May 2025 14:13, UK",
      "Roy Keane believes the days of everyone wanting to join Manchester United have ended after the club suffered an 18th defeat of the season at Chelsea, which he felt proved they \"aren't really good at anything\".",
      "United lost 1-0 thanks to Marc Cucurella's second-half winner to leave them on 39 points with one game - at home to Champions League-chasing Aston Villa - remaining.",
      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",
      "\"If they don't win [the Europa League final] next week, I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone. I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Manchester United. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",

      "Chelsea held their nerve in the race for Champions League qualification as Marc Cucurella’s second-half header secured a 1-0 win over Manchester United to send them fourth.",
      "The pressure was on for Chelsea after Aston Villa beat Tottenham, a result which would have moved them above Enzo Maresca's side had they dropped points but, after a tense wait for the breakthrough, captain Reece James set up Cucurella with a fine turn and cross.",
      "Although Ruben Amorim went with a strong line-up ahead of the Europa League final, if Chelsea had slipped up against this United side, 16th and now winless for a record eight Premier League games, questions would have been asked.",
      "Chelsea will at least be in the top five when they go to Nottingham Forest in their final game of the league season on May 25. Victory at the City Ground would guarantee a return to the Champions League after two years away.",
      "United have now lost 18 games in the league this season and are yet to hit 40 points, usually the target for teams to avoid relegation, with just one game left against Villa. Everything is riding on Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "Chelsea: Sanchez (7), James (8), Tosin (7), Colwill (8), Cucurella (8), Caicedo (8), Enzo (7), Palmer (7), Madueke (6), George (6), Neto (6).\n\n\nUsed subs:  Gusto (6), Lavia (6).\n\n\nMan Utd Onana (6), Lindelof (6), Maguire (6), Shaw (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (5), Fernandes (7), Dorgu (5), Amad (6), Mount (6), Hojlund (5).\n\n\nUsed subs: Garnacho (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (6), Heaven (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Moises Caicedo.",
      "There was a party atmosphere after the full-time whistle blew for the final time at Stamford Bridge this season. Chelsea's owners are just one win away from their first Champions League qualification after more than £1bn spent and three coaches sacked.",
      "Behdad Eghbali, co-founder of Clearlake Capital, and co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley were on the pitch enjoying the moment with players and staff after the win was sealed. How different it might have been if there was another slip.",
      "Chelsea did not find it as easy as others had against United and, without suspended striker Nicolas Jackson, it was not clear where the breakthrough would come from as Tyrique George, 19, struggled up front in his first league start.",
      "Tension had built around the stadium - and only grew when Villa's victory over Spurs was confirmed - until the skipper came up with the moment of brilliance required to break the deadlock, having struck a post with an exquisite strike in the first half.",
      "Seventy minutes had passed when James pirouetted on the edge of the box and picked out Cucurella free in the box. His seventh goal of the season, a fine header back across goal, has a case for being his most important. Win at Forest and it is mission complete.",
      "Maresca will be as relieved as anyone. Chelsea were the better team for much of the game, but the wait made life uncomfortable. The consequences of falling short may have seen attentions turn to him. Instead, Eghabli's presence on the pitch was just a footnote.",
      "Keane said United had been a disgrace in the Premier League this season before kick-off at Chelsea. This was no disgrace. Not for the first time this season, Amorim's side upped it against a better side.",
      "This wasn't a performance akin to the win at Manchester City in December. But, with Amorim warning his players their starting spot in Bilbao was potentially at risk, there was a marked improvement from the defeat to West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire nearly got them off to the perfect start with a clever finish after 17 minutes but was denied by a marginal offside. The technology showed his shoulder was a whisker ahead of Tosin.",
      "There was little other to speak of aside from Amad forcing a save from Robert Sanchez shortly after Chelsea scored. Mason Mount fired wide in the first half, too, as his every touch was booed on his return to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United have set a low bar this season. Eighteen is the most defeats the club have suffered in the league since losing 20 games on their way to relegation in 1973/74.",
      "If not for the low quality of the promoted teams, Amorim would not have had the luxury of using this game as a means to play his side into form ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "United have not waited this long for a league win since the season Sir Alex Ferguson won the FA Cup in 1990. That trophy is often looked back on as the one that saved him. There are parallels - with the form at least.",
      "Amorim doesn't appear to be in any danger just yet - even if he loses to Spurs in Bilbao. But success in the final, aside from the financial reward it brings, feels crucial for him to take something positive into next season.",
      "There is nothing which does so in the league. Since the start of April, United are the worst team in the top flight, drawing two and losing six of their eight games.",
      "Being in the latter stages of the Europa League has undoubtedly seen their league form suffer in that time. But that excuse only really carries if the gamble pays off. All eyes on Wednesday.",
      "\"I was quite confident. I know how difficult it is to play against Man Utd. We expected a tough game, congratulations to them because they played very well. It was a game where I had the good feeling to find a goal.",
      "\"Cucurella's got the same goal this season - against Wolves and Brentford. He's a good player, a very good player. It's about timing and being in the right position. It doesn't matter if you're tall, he's in the right position and right moment.\"",
      "Asked how big Champions League qualification would be, he added: \"For me, the problem is in general people, you the press, think Chelsea is the same Chelsea from years ago. It's not the same. I can understand people struggle to understand it.",
      "\"Once again, tonight Jackson was suspended, we played with Tyrique, six players from the academy. Years ago, if Didier Drogba was injured, Diego Costa would play or Fernando Torres. This is a completely different Chelsea. We are in the right direction, but we can bring the club to where it deserves to be.",
      "\"I don't think - since I'm here - that we are spending more money than others clubs. We are spending the same money. But we are building something important, people have to trust us. We are in the right direction, we are working well and we can fight, in the future, for important titles.\"",
      "\"It was the good things we talked about before the game: we had some moments, improving the way we played football, we pressed quite well and had some chances.",
      "\"We were quite aggressive, we need to be more aggressive. We have good build-up to the last third but then we miss something. But we faced the competition in the right way today, we were competitive.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer. The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",

      "\"We've been working the whole season, the message has been clear from the start. Executing it has been hard. Today, what we're trying to do pays off.",
      "\"I feel confident, it's the most I've played in a few seasons. I want to help the team and hope we can finish it in the right way.",
      "\"The Champions League is where the club belongs, competing in the best competitions. People like to write us off and call us young ,but it's an experienced Manchester United team and we did what we needed to do to get the three points.\""

      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",

      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",

      "Rashford is set to decide on his next steps after the season is over, with little certainty around where he will be playing once the summer transfer window has closed, aside from the expectation that it will be away from United, who have set their asking price at £40m.",

      "Competition for places at Barcelona is high in the wide forward positions, with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, two of the favourites for the Ballon d'Or, unlikely to be displaced.",
      "As far as Man Utd are concerned, they are seemingly already pursuing replacements for Rashford, with Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap among their top targets.",
      "Rashford's wages, of which Villa agreed to cover at least 75 per cent of during his loan, were considered a potential stumbling block in January and could well cause issues again.",
      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",
      "Emery's side sit in sixth place, one spot outside securing a spot among Europe's elite, after winning six of their last seven games in the Premier League.",
      "Villa face Tottenham and Man Utd in their final two fixtures and sit level on points with Chelsea, ahead of them in the table only on goal difference.",
      "Opta's supercomputer has given them a 38 per cent chance of breaking into the Champions League spots.",
      "\"If Man Utd win the cup [Europa League], they will be celebrating and won't be fussed. If they lose, you'd have to push them out the dressing room to play that game!",
      "\"I see Chelsea winning on Friday Night Football. Then they have to beat Nottingham Forest.",
      "\"The problem is Man City, they could be sixth in the league by the time they play Bournemouth! I expect Chelsea and Villa both to win. City don't play because of the FA Cup final.",
      "\"I don't see Newcastle beating Arsenal away and then they have to beat Everton, a difficult team to play against.",
      "\"Forest need to get a result and win at West Ham or they will finish seventh. It is massively exciting. You wouldn't want to be in it!\""
