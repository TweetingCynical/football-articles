      "Claims of a potential takeover at Manchester United have reportedly been met with surprise by insiders close to Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Earlier this week, Turki Al-Sheikh set tongues wagging when he suggested that the Reds were in 'advanced negotiations with a new investor'.",
      "claims United officials were taken aback by the Saudi Arabian billionaire's activity on X, stating his reports were 'news to them'. They reported that Ratcliffe and his INEOS team didn't believe Al-Sheikh's claims.",
      "On Wednesday night, the Saudi government official stirred the pot by claiming that United were on the brink of sealing a deal. Given Ratcliffe's somewhat recent acquisition of a minority stake, many speculated that Al-Sheikh's cryptic post was aimed at the Glazers.",
      "On social media, he wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "The Saudi tycoon, who owned Spanish club Almeria from 2019 until earlier this year after they failed to secure promotion to La Liga, shared the post with his seven million followers. It quickly went viral, racking up a staggering number of views, likes and shares.",
      "Al-Sheikh provided an update on the alleged negotiations on Thursday evening. He said: \"My yesterday's post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "\"Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "The Times also explained why Ratcliffe could be left out of the loop if the Glazers decided to suddenly sell. Noting that just because the British billionaire has a 30 per cent stake, that doesn't mean the Glazers won't consider cashing in without consultation.",
      "The report added that the family would 'definitely sell United for the right price'. It also unearthed a clause inserted into Ratcliffe's deal, which was triggered in August this year, allowing the Glazers to sell their stake if they received the 'right offer'.",
      "They report claims that a bid of $33 a share could be enough to tempt the family to sell the whole club. While Al-Sheikh's post reignited speculation of a takeover, Ratcliffe has shown no indication of walking away from Old Trafford.",
      "In a recent appearance on The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, the British billionaire insisted he retains control of football operations at the club.",
      "When questioned about what would occur if the Glazers instructed him to dismiss Ruben Amorim, Ratcliffe responded: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS chief, who has held just under 30 percent of United since February 2024, continued: \"That probably sums it up. We're local, and they're on the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rep... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Highlighting his long-term vision, the 72-year-old stated: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "When asked if the United manager is granted three years to turn things around, Ratcliffe confirmed: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years.",
      "\"You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week...\"",

      "Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna is still keeping tabs on Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo as the January transfer window approaches. The 20-year-old ace tried to secure a loan switch in the dying embers of the summer window, but United blocked his exit.",
      "Mainoo had no desire to quit his boyhood club on a permanent basis and simply wanted a temporary spell elsewhere to guarantee game time this season. Italian giants Napoli showed interest, but it's understood the youngster has been grafting away at Carrington to win over United boss Ruben Amorim, who has thrown down the gauntlet for him to up his standards.",
      "The midfielder has even switched his personal chef at home and enlisted a private coach during September's international break in a bid to elevate his performances.",
      "\"He needs to fight for his place,\" Amorim warned previously. \"We need Kobbie. I understand that the players who aren't playing in this moment are disappointed. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "With the January window looming, Napoli are still reportedly interested in the England international.",
      "According to Gazzetta dello Sport, sporting director Manna is still tracking the midfielder's situation and holds his abilities in high regard.",
      "Despite failing to sign him last summer, Napoli reportedly see themselves as the perfect platform for Mainoo to flaunt his skills ahead of the World Cup next year.",
      "However, it's reported that any potential January deal would not include a buy option.",
      "Should Mainoo make the move to the Serie A club, he'd be joining ex-Reds teammate Scott McTominay in Naples, where McTominay has rapidly become a crowd favourite.",

      "Arsenal have been slapped with a suspended fine of £500,000 for breaking FA Cup rules ahead of their clash with Manchester United in January. The dispute centered around United's away ticket allocation.",
      "The Red Devils were provided with 8,000 seats at the Emirates, less than they should've been given. FA rules state that away clubs must be allocated up to 15 per cent of the ground capacity, more than the percentage required for Premier League matches.",
      "United complained to the FA after not being given the maximum 9,000 tickets but the Gunners cited safety concerns. The Safety Advisory Group insisted the upper tier at the Emirates can't be used for the away fans due to concerns over persistent standing.",
      "Now the FA have reached a verdict, nine months after the fixture was played and United won 5-3 on penalties. A statement read: \"It was alleged that Arsenal FC had breached the 2024-25 FA Cup Rule 192, and the matter was referred to the PGB (Professional Game Board) for consideration.",
      "\"The PGB concluded that Arsenal FC had failed to comply with the 2024-25 FA Cup Rule 192 and imposed a suspended £500,000 fine. The fine is suspended pending Arsenal FC's confirmation that it is able to comply with this requirement for the 2025-26 FA Cup third round and continued compliance for any further rounds of this season's competition.\"",
      "It marks the end of a lengthy ordeal involving the clubs. United, crucially, claimed victory on the pitch, with the scores having been 1-1 after extra-time.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side therefore advanced to the fourth round, beating Leicester 2-1 at home. But the Red Devils' run soon came to an end, as Fulham won on penalties at Old Trafford in round five.",

      "British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe had a quizzical response when confronted about a rival bid to take over Manchester United. And the Ineos chief wasn't entirely convinced his competitor was even a real person.",
      "It was back in December 2023 that Ratcliffe agreed to buy a 27.7% stake in United for around £1.3billion, though he's since increased that stake to 28.9%. At the time, the Briton beat out a rival bid from Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was only interested in purchasing the club from the Glazer family outright but failed in his £5.5bn proposal.",
      "Ratcliffe's future as a United shareholder is suddenly believed to be under threat following word a new investor is in talks to buy the club. That's after Saudi sports chief Turki Al-Sheikh claimed to have an inside scoop when he wrote on X this week: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor.\"",
      "Al-Sheikh later walked back those comments somewhat and conceded the proposed purchase \"might not necessarily happen.\" And it wouldn't be the first time Ratcliffe has cause to feel sceptical on a rival offer after previously commenting on Sheikh Jassim's attempts.",
      "\"Still nobody’s ever seen him, actually. The Glazers never met him,\" he said last year after being asked about the \"odd\" nature of Sheikh Jassim's low-visibility during the bidding process. He then delivered a brutal five-word summary of his former rival: \"I’m not sure he exists! [Laughs].\"",
      "There was an air of mystique regarding Sheikh Jassim's candidacy while the bidding process reached its peak in 2023. While Ratcliffe has long been a prominent business magnate and already owned European clubs like Nice and Lausanne, Sheikh Jassim was largely in the background of his own proposal.",
      "The son of former Qatari emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani saw his proposal crumble in opposition to Ratcliffe's. While the Briton was content purchasing a minority stake in the club that could increase over time, Sheikh Jassim wanted to purchase the whole pie with his £5.5bn attempt.",
      "In the end, the offer was overlooked due to concerns over whether the Sheikh and his team could provide proof of funds. But not even two years later, there is fresh talk of a new takeover taking place.",
      "While that may seem strange so soon after Ratcliffe's investment, it's emerged exactly how another change of hands can take place. That's due to 'drag-along' clauses included in his agreement, which give the Glazer family rights to force a sale if certain conditions are met.",
      "Ratcliffe had first-refusal rights to try and match any offer that comes in, although this expired in August. However, the Glazers now hold the authority to enforce a deal.",
      "Although details of any new bid remains scarce, it isn't believed Sheikh Jassim has made another attempt to take over United. However, potential buyer Thomas Zilliacus would be prepared to welcome fellow investors like the Qatari should their intentions be in the right place.",

Zirkzee, who has sat on the bench unused in four fixtures, finds himself behind Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the attacking hierarchy.",
      "His lack of action has also cost him his place in Ronald Koeman's Dutch squad for this month's international fixtures. With next summer's World Cup looming large, Zirkzee is thought to be desperate to impress and nail down a spot in the national side.",

      "United shelled out £43 million to Bologna for his signature last summer. Earlier this year, the Portuguese boss made his feelings crystal clear about the Dutch attacker.",

      "Manchester United could be on the brink of changing ownership after reports emerged that minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe might be forced to relinquish his stake. The development follows the revelation that mechanisms exist that could compel the Ineos billionaire to sell his United shares.",
      "Ratcliffe, 72, emerged victorious from a bidding battle against Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani to invest in the Red Devils towards the end of 2023. While Sheikh Jassim sought to acquire all of the Glazer family's shares in the club for £5.5billion, Ratcliffe prevailed with his proposal of approximately £1.3bn for a 27.7% stake.",
      "The British chemical magnate subsequently boosted his portion to 28.9% after a £79.2million cash injection in December 2024. Nevertheless, the club's fortunes have remained unchanged despite Ineos assuming control of daily operations at Old Trafford.",
      "However, a 'drag-along clause' that came into effect during the summer means Ratcliffe and his associates could face removal. A drag-along clause represents a provision within a company's shareholder agreement enabling majority stakeholders to \"drag along\" minority shareholders into selling their shares should the majority choose to sell up.",
      "This condition guarantees the Glazer family possess the authority to force all shareholders to dispose of their holdings. Under his takeover arrangement, Ratcliffe held first refusal should the Glazers have chosen to sell during the initial 18 months after his minority acquisition was finalised, though this provision lapsed in August 2025.",
      "This means that, should the Florida-based Glazers decide to sell up, they can force through a full sale of the club. And given the value of Ratcliffe's 2023 investment, its likely they would require a proposal exceeding £5bn to be enticed into selling up.",
      "Saudi sports supremo Turki Al-Sheikh sent shockwaves through the footballing world when he posted on X this week: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor.\"",
      "Responding to his own message, he continued: \"I hope he's better than the previous owners.\" Yet many have been left scratching their heads following the surprise announcement, with precise details remaining shrouded in mystery.",
      "His prior endeavour was dismissed after he couldn't demonstrate sufficient financial backing during negotiations. Al-Sheikh has emerged as a pivotal player in positioning Saudi Arabia at the heart of a recent sporting revolution.",
      "The nation has deployed its enormous wealth to revitalise various sporting disciplines, including boxing, snooker and most lately darts. The chairman of the Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation (ISSF) later clarified that he is \"not the investor,\" nor is the person in question from Saudi Arabia., adding the deal \"might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "talkSPORT and the Daily Mail reported on Thursday that the bid might come from investors in the United Arab Emirates. The Glazer family, who took over United more than 20 years ago with a total investment of £790m, have been widely criticised by the club's fanbase in recent years",
      "Ratcliffe spent a significantly larger sum to acquire just over a quarter of the club, and he may already be facing the axe after less than two years. Sir Jim has invested more than £200m of his own money into the club and has indicated his intention to restore United to their former glories in the coming years.",
      "Former bidder Thomas Zilliacus, who rivalled Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim's bids to purchase United in 2023, confirmed on Friday he is still interested in investing in the club should the opportunity arrise and that he is currently drawing up plans of his own to do so. The Finnish entrepreneur also offered to partner with Ineos, or any parties interested in acquiring the club.",
      "\"I actually have nothing against working with people like Jim Ratcliffe or any investor, whoever that may be,\" he said. \"Because I'm not in this to have a trophy that I can show off to other people.",
      "\"I'm in this to make a club that I've been a fan of since I was 12 years old the best club in the world. My heart cries when I see how things are going today. Manchester United are so far below where the club should be and could be if things were managed the right way.",
      "\"When I had made my bid I realised that the Glazers were playing a game where Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim and myself were just trying to outbid each other. So the price was just going higher and higher and higher.",
      "\"I publicly said that this is madness, that this is money that should be used for the club and not to further enrich the Glazers. So I said, 'Why don't we join forces and take over the club together?'",
      "\"I'm still completely open to that, and I would be more than happy to speak to Sheikh Jassim or to Jim Ratcliffe or any other investor about how we could work together.\"",

      "However, they entered the October international break on a high note, securing a 2-0 victory over Sunderland at Old Trafford. This win eased some pressure on Amorim, with United now sitting tenth in the league, just three points behind the top five and arch-rivals Manchester City.",

      "Zilliacus maintains that should he gain any control over the club, he would incorporate a fan-led initiative and his bid wouldn't be a takeover per se. He alleges this is something the Glazer family currently dismisses.",
      "\"I think the Glazers, unfortunately, are a good example of somebody who is not really looking out for the club, but rather using it as a cash cow,\" he added. \"But in any case, they are not doing what should be done.",
      "\"I have a programme that involves the fans who are overseas, who cannot come to watch a game. And my programme can evolve in a way that can bring significant new revenues to the club.",
      "\"So with that money the club could do all the things it needs to do to be truly the best football club in the world, where all the best players, the best managers, everybody wants to be there.\"",
      "Zilliacus also stated that he would be more than willing to collaborate with any investor, including another former bidder, Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim. He said: \"I actually have nothing against working with people like Jim Ratcliffe or any investor, whoever that may be. Because I'm not in this to have a trophy that I can show off to other people.",
      "\"I'm in this to make a club that I've been a fan of since I was 12 years old the best club in the world. My heart cries when I see how things are going today. Manchester United are so far below where the club should be and could be if things were managed the right way.",
      "\"When I had made my bid I realised that the Glazers were playing a game where Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim and myself were just trying to outbid each other. So the price was just going higher and higher and higher.",
      "\"I publicly said that this is madness, that this is money that should be used for the club and not to further enrich the Glazers. So I said, 'Why don't we join forces and take over the club together?'",
      "\"I'm still completely open to that, and I would be more than happy to speak to Sheikh Jassim or to Jim Ratcliffe or any other investor about how we could work together.\"",

      "Henrikh Mkhitaryan endured a toxic relationship with Jose Mourinho during his spell at Manchester United, with their bitter feud ultimately forcing the midfielder's exit to Arsenal.",
      "The Armenian had arrived at Old Trafford from Borussia Dortmund in 2016 and even though Mourinho initially wanted him at the club, Mkhitaryan's disappointing performances sparked a explosive row between the pair. During his debut campaign, he managed 11 goals across 41 appearances.",
      "Their bond rapidly crumbled, with Mourinho making it abundantly clear he wanted the midfielder out of his squad. The 'Special One' even admitted his eagerness to bring in Alexis Sanchez as Mkhitaryan's replacement.",
      "In his new autobiography 'My Life Always at the Centre', Mkhitaryan revealed: \"I told him, you've been criticising me for a year-and-a-half now, ever since I arrived at Manchester United. Mourinho told me I was 's***' and I just lost my temper.",
      "\"'You are the s***. An enormous one.' Mou replied: 'Get out of here, I never want to see you again.'",
      "\"During the training sessions, the coach said nothing to me, he remained at a religious level of silence, but every evening he'd send me a message via WhatsApp. 'Miki, leave, please.'",
      "\"The situation had become grotesque. I'd reply every time with the same copy and paste response. 'I will leave if I find the right team, otherwise I'll wait for the summer.'",
      "\"Towards the middle of January, the text changed slightly. 'Miki, please leave, that way I can get Alexis Sanchez.'",
      "\"Mino Raiola was working on this exchange with Arsenal. So my response mutated too. 'I am not leaving just to do you a favour, and please stop writing to me. If you want, talk to Mino.' And everyone lived happily ever after.\"",
      "In January 2018, Mkhitaryan transferred to Arsenal in a swap deal involving Sanchez and enjoyed a more fruitful period in north London.",
      "He went on to net nine goals in 58 appearances for the Gunners, playing a crucial role in their journey to the 2019 Europa League final.",
      "However, he was subsequently reunited with Mourinho at AS Roma, where the duo enjoyed some success together.",
      "During the 2021/22 campaign, Mkhitaryan featured in 44 matches across all competitions at Roma under Mourinho's guidance, and claimed the Europa Conference League trophy.",

      "Senne Lammens was put in an awkward position on his first day at the Carrington Training Complex. The 23-year-old goalkeeper has already made quite the impression at Manchester United following his £18m move from Royal Antwerp in the transfer window, but he had a bit of a rocky start.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, sections of the dressing room 'strongly pushed' higher-ups at Old Trafford to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. The 33-year-old shot-stopper was heavily linked with a move for much of the summer following what looked like an emotional farewell on the final day of last season.",
      "Despite approval from people in Ruben Amorim's circle, United turned their attention to Lammens. The Red Devils managed to wrap up a deal for the Belgian on deadline day before sending Andre Onana out on loan to Trabzonspor.",
      "Lammens arrived at Carrington knowing that many of his new colleagues would rather have somebody else between the sticks. The youngster, who made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Europe's top 10 leagues last season, was made to wait for his debut.",
      "Altay Bayindir had started each of United's first six games of the Premier League season before he was dropped for the Sunderland clash. In the final game before the October international break, Amorim handed Lammens his first start – and he certainly caught the eye.",
      "He quickly took leadership of the Red Devils' backline, commanding his penalty area with great confidence. Lammens was also often seen – and heard by those in the ground – barking orders at his defenders.",
      "The Stretford End faithful even serenaded him with chants of, 'Are you Schmeichel in disguise?' paying their new goalkeeper the ultimate compliment. According to the i Paper, Lammens has made just as much of an impression off the pitch since his awkward introduction at Carrington.",
      "The report claims he's always the first to arrive and the last to leave, going above and beyond to improve his game. It's that the United staff have also been taken aback by his maturity, having already sorted out his own private long-term accommodation.",
      "Speaking to reporters following United's 2-0 win over Sunderland, Amorim heaped Lammens with praise. The Portuguese boss said: \"Yeah, I think he looks confident in the first game.",
      "\"But, [the] important thing is that the teammates help Senne to have a good game, because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes, against a team that was really comfortable playing football. So, we did well, [it] was a good day for us.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"When Senne arrived here, first of all, Altay was playing, and then he arrives, and you can feel it, that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive.",
      "\"So, it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game. But now, it's just one game, and he needs to work because he needs to be prepared that in our club, things are really hard.",
      "\"But he did well, and again, he was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",

      "Despite his initial desire to remain at Old Trafford and compete for a starting berth, even with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, his choice to depart appears justified.",
      "Hojlund found the back of the net just four times in the Premier League for United during the previous campaign - playing a part in the club's dismal 15th-placed finish in England's top division.",
      "Yet in merely six appearances between Serie A and the Champions League, Hojlund has already matched that goal return whilst working under Napoli chief Antonio Conte.",
      "Denmark chief Riemer has now weighed in on Hojlund, with the United striker preparing to represent his nation in Thursday's World Cup qualifying clash against Belarus on the road.",
      "When questioned about whether Hojlund can still thrive in England, Riemer told TipsBladet: \"I think Rasmus has the quality for both leagues, without discussion.",
      "\"Does he fit in Italian football? Yes.",
      "\"There was no doubt about that, because he had already proven that.",
      "\"But that doesn't mean he doesn't fit in English football. On the contrary, I would almost say.\"",
      "He added: \"The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced. It is more important than which league you play in.\"",

      "Conor McGregor once hinted he wanted to buy Manchester United and rumours of potential investors at Old Trafford are swirling again. The Irish former UFC two-weight world champion made his ambition clear in 2021.",
      "Takeover talk have been squashed since Sir Jim Ratcliffe bought a minority stake from the Glazers. But earlier this week, Turki Al-Sheikh, chairman of the Saudi Arabian General Entertainment Authority, took to social media and suggested that the Manchester club have reached an \"advanced stage\" of negotiations with new investors.",
      "Many assumed he would be involved with this party or they would be from his own country, but hours later the official made it clear that they were not. This came the same day that United co-owner Ratcliffe gave an honest review reflecting on his two years at the club, which he and his company Ineos purchased a nearly 30 per cent stake in in 2023.",
      "While it is currently unknown who these investors mentioned by Al-Sheikh are, one sporting star who made it clear he wanted to be involved with United is affluent MMA ace McGregor. Though his proposition was somewhat tongue-in-cheek.",
      "Four years ago, United's former executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward stepped down from his position amid drama surrounding the proposed Super League. This sent fans into a frenzy and pleas for the Glazer family to sell began.",
      "McGregor took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to stir the pot and simply posted to his then 8.6 million followers: \"Hey guys. I'm thinking about buying Manchester United! What do you think?\"",
      "He followed this up by stating: \"I am certainly interested in acquiring a sports team at some stage! Both Celtic and Man United are teams I like for sure. But I am open. I feel I could do big things for a club.\"",
      "At the time it was abundantly clear that the Irishman did not have the financial capabilities to purchase the club on his own. He had gained a fortune from his £61million fight with Floyd Mayweather and held brand deals with the likes of Monster Energy, EA, Burger King and Reebok.",
      "But his estimated net worth stood at just £181m in 2021 and Celebrity Net Worth suggests that his fortune is £150m as of 2025. This financial power would be enough for him to join forces with other investors to form a consortium, however.",
      "McGregor is one of many potential investors who have expressed an interest in purchasing shares in United over the years, but Ratcliffe and Ineos put their money where their mouth is in 2023. It has been 24 months since they seized control of football operations and the British billionaire has addressed his rather lacklustre reign in depth this week.",
      "\"There are two halves to a football team,\" Ratcliffe told The Business podcast. \"There's the business side and the sports side. The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor, is profitability.",
      "\"The more cash you've got, the better squad you can build. It's like a Formula One car - the better car you can build, the quicker you go. The better your squad, the better your football should be.",
      "\"So a lot of what we've done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing. If you look at our results for last year, we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of results, and we weren't in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "\"The press, sometimes I don't understand,\" added Ratcliffe. \"They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "Speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, Tyler recalled an incident involving ex-England striker Rickie Lambert as he opened up about accusations of favouritism.",
      "\"Ricky Lambert, first game of the 2012/13 season, Southampton at home against Man City,\" began Tyler. \"Ricky comes on as a substitute and he's come from the fourth tier and non-league and everything.",

      "\"He said, 'I'm only sub.' So that was the backstory. He was the sub and he comes on and he scores. There was an accusation of a bit of personal bias, but it was for somebody who'd made a long journey to that moment!",
      "\"[Being accused of bias] happens to all commentators, especially with social media. People have their opinions. I did the League Cup final when Manchester United played Southampton.",
      "\"And the Daily Telegraph, I think it was, published two tweets the next day, one saying I was the most biased commentator in favour of Man Utd, and the other one saying I was most biased in favour of Southampton.",
      "\"So I did the whole profession a favour really because, yeah, you accept that, but I'm a Woking fan. I've never been anything else but a Woking fan. And so I know in my own skin that there's not a bias.\"",
      "Tyler, who admits he is a supporter of National League side Woking FC, also opened up about being accused of bias by Manchester City fans, notably when Jamie Mackie scored against them during their infamous 3-2 title-winning victory against QPR in 2012.",
      "\"Jamie Mackie's goal in 2012. I'm accused by Manchester City fans of being too excited,\" he added. \"QPR go two and up, they're trying to stay in the league and I gave it 'too much.' It was only one person to be fair.",
      "\"It was quite a surprise. I was at a reunion for the match where they were playing it and it hadn't come up yet, so the game was going through and Jamie Mackie scores on the video. They said, 'There you go, you're shouting!'",
      "\"But everybody's entitled to their opinion. We're all football fans and we've all got one vote in that respect and I don't have any problem with people thinking what they think.",
      "\"As long as you know in yourself that you're not doing something. Yeah, that is a bit of a confession about Ricky, but it was very personal and they even lost the game.\"",

The head coach has come under intense pressure this season following a torrid start to the campaign, which has seen a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby and poor league form.",
      "There was speculation that Amorim could be sacked if he failed to beat the Black Cats, but a 2-0 win eased the pressure a little. The Portuguese then received more good news when he received a vote of confidence from minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has insisted he will give the head coach more time to prove himself, possibly as many as three years.",
      "As United fans await the trip to bitter rivals Liverpool following the international break, here’s a round-up of the major news surrounding the Red Devils...",
      "Saudi Arabian sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh has raised the prospect of a fresh takeover bid. The club's majority owners, the Glazer family, rejected a takeover by Sheikh Jassim Al-Thani’s Qatari consortium when they sold 27.7 per cent of the club to Ratcliffe for £1.25billion, but would consider offers of more than £5billion for their stake.",
      "The Glazers, whose controversial ownership of the club dates back to 2005, granted Ratcliffe’s Ineos group control of football operations. The American billionaires are deeply unpopular with the United fanbase, who would presumably welcome a full sale of the club.",
      "Al-Sheikh, who as the chairman of Saudi’s General Entertainment Authority is the key mover in the country’s growing influence in sport, has caused intrigue with a cryptic message on social media about a potential takeover of the club. He posted: “The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he’s better than the previous owners.”",
      "United have not publicly reacted to Al-Sheikh’s claim but there is believed to be surprise and bemusement behind the scenes at Old Trafford, given there has been no recent talk of any takeover.",
      "Despite Ratcliffe’s vote of confidence, it would be hard to see United sticking with Amorim if they become mired in the bottom half of the table, as they were last season, especially having spent more than £200million on new signings in the summer.",
      "If United do pull the trigger, United legends Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane have made it clear who they would like at the helm. Both Neville and Keane would go for long-serving Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane lavished praise on the fiery Argentine, who has led Atletico to the La Liga title and Champions League finals.",
      "The Irishman said: “I’ve said it for years, I’d like Atletico Madrid’s Simeone to go in there. I’d like to see him go there. I know his mate has gone to Arsenal [Andrea Berta, the Gunners’ sporting director who recently left Atletico].",
      "“I think he would just create havoc, but good havoc. He'd rock up to that place. No guarantees, but I'd just like to see his personality, his track record.",
      "“People might think styles of football, [but] they scored five against Real Madrid [winning 5-2] last weekend. He doesn't like his teams giving up too many goals or chances, but they can play a bit and fight.",
      "“At Liverpool [where Atletico lost 3-2 in the Champions League] a few weeks ago… the team aren’t as great as few years ago, but they still had fighting spirit. He’s on the sideline, he got sent off that night, I’d like a big personality.”",
      "However, Keane isn’t pushing for Amorim to be sacked just yet. He joked: “I’d still say give the man a chance, absolutely. Another week.” Neville agreed with Keane, adding: “I think I’d go with that. I’d go with Simeone.”",
      "However, Scholes went for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, although he had reservations about his long-time assistant, Jason Tindall, joining him. He said: “I’m not sure about his mate [Tindall], but definitely him.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has been on a goal-scoring spree since leaving Manchester United in the summer transfer window. The 22-year-old returned to Italy for the 2025/26 season, signing for Napoli on a season-long loan with a £38.3million buy-obligation clause included in the deal.",
      "After netting for Denmark during the September international break in his first competitive outing, Hojlund marked his Napoli debut with a goal against Fiorentina. Despite failing to score in his next three appearances, he bounced back in style with a stunning brace against Sporting CP in the Champions League.",
      "Just days later, Hojlund bagged the winning goal in a 2-1 triumph over Genoa and with his confidence soaring, it's no shock that he's been finding the back of the net while on international duty.",
      "His first goal in the World Cup qualifier against Belarus on Thursday evening came just 19 minutes into the match when he slotted home from close-range. Right on the stroke of half-time, Hojlund doubled his tally, instinctively tapping the ball into an empty net from just a few yards out.",
      "The initial shot that was saved into his path came from Patrick Dorgu, with the United wing-back finding the target just minutes later.",
      "Hojlund turned provider when he unselfishly squared the ball to Dorgu after a pass in behind, showcasing what could have been for Ruben Amorim.",
      "The latter played the entirety of the second half while Hojlund was subbed off in the 77th minute with Denmark going on to thrash their opponents 6-0.",
      "Despite Amorim bringing him to United, Dorgu has found it tough to secure a regular starting berth and often finds himself on the bench against supposedly inferior opposition, particularly when Amad gets the nod on the opposite wing with Diogo Dalot slotting into his preferred role.",
      "Three goal contributions from Hojlund will certainly catch United's attention given his battles at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, it's worth highlighting that his replacement Benjamin Sesko is enjoying a purple patch in front of goal.",
      "Following a difficult beginning, the Slovenia striker netted his maiden goal for the club during the 3-1 loss to Brentford before finding the back of the net again in last weekend's triumph over Sunderland, an achievement he branded a \"dream come true\".",
      "\"This [scoring at Old Trafford] has been the moment I've dreamed about as a kid, because the atmosphere here is unbelievable,\" he said.",
      "\"Not just after the goal, but after every tackle as well. It's a dream come true, I'm happy we won.\"",

      "Turki Al-Sheikh has sparked Manchester United takeover talk back into life. The Saudi Arabian billionaire set tongues wagging earlier this week with a mysterious social media post.",
      "On Wednesday night, Al-Sheikh claimed that the Reds were in the 'advanced stages' of agreeing a deal with a new investor. Given that Sir Jim Ratcliffe only recently acquired a minority stake, many speculated that the Glazer family could be discussing terms for their shares.",
      "On X, previously known as Twitter, the Saudi government official wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "Al-Sheikh, who was the owner of Almeria from 2019 until earlier this year when they failed to secure promotion to the Spanish top-flight, shared the post with his seven million followers. His cryptic message spread like wildfire, racking up five million views, 12,000 likes, 3,500 shares, and nearly 2,000 replies.",
      "The Saudi sports chief insisted he had shared the post as 'a fan who wishes the deal to happen'. He wrote: \"My yesterday's post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "\"Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "Predictably, Al-Sheikh's follow-up post also generated a staggering amount of engagement, racking up a million views at the time of writing. Within mere hours, the tweet had chalked up 900,000 views, 7,000 likes, 1,000 shares and nearly 500 replies.",
      "While the Saudi Arabian businessman may not be holding discussions with the United hierarchy over a possible takeover at Old Trafford, the influence he wields on social media is undeniable and will have certainly reached Ratcliffe's radar. Speaking on The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, Ratcliffe insisted that he retains authority over football operations at the club.",
      "When questioned about what would happen if the Glazers instructed him to dismiss Ruben Amorim, Ratcliffe replied: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss, who has owned just under 30 per cent of United since February 2024, continued: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rep... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe also hinted that he'll be at the helm of football operations for a while longer. The 72-year-old outlined his long-term vision, adding: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "When questioned if the United manager will be given three years, Ratcliffe said: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years.",
      "\"You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "Denmark boss Brian Riemer has expressed his delight that Rasmus Hojlund is now 'on a well-functioning team' after joining Napoli on loan from Manchester United. The forward endured a difficult two years at Old Trafford and is unlikely to return.",
      "Hojlund completed a deal that included a £5million loan fee, with the Italian giants said to be obligated to make the move permanent for £38m, should they secure Champions League qualification for next season.",
      "Last term, the 22-year-old scored just four goals in 32 Premier League outings and is already halfway to that mark with Napoli in just four Serie A outings. Hojlund has previously found success in Italy, while at Atalanta, where his form earned a £72m move to the Red Devils in 2023.",
      "The forward's international manager believes that Hojlund is capable of success in any division, including in England, however. Instead, he pointed towards the forward having a more accomplished side to benefit from as the reason behind his change in fortune.",
      "Riemer said, via TipsBladet: \"I think Rasmus has the quality for both leagues, without discussion. Does he fit in Italian football? Yes. There was no doubt about that, because he had already proven that. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t fit in English football. On the contrary, I would almost say.\"",
      "He added: \"The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced. It is more important than which league you play in.\"",
      "And Hojlund continued his promising form in international colours. The Dane scored twice in the opening period of a 6-0 victory over Belarus. The forward even found time to assist Manchester United team-mate Patrick Dorgu in the sixth minute of stoppage time of the first half.",
      "Hojlund appears to be enjoying his new environment too. After netting for Napoli against Sporting CP, the sharpshooter gestured towards the Champions League badge on his sleeve — a tournament he is only playing in due to leaving United.",
      "The loanee is not alone in finding more success away from his parent club. Marcus Rashford is performing well for Barcelona, while the likes of Antony hit the ground running on his loan to Real Betis last term.",

      "Manchester United are exploring the controversial idea of selling seat licences for the club’s proposed brand-new stadium. Plans for a state of the art arena were unveiled by the Red Devils in March.",
      "If those plans come to fruition, the new ground would take United’s capacity to around 100,000, with the project estimated to cost around £2billion. And in an effort to recoup some of that, Ratcliffe and fellow Man United chiefs have explored a radical plan.",
      "According to The Athletic, the club are exploring the option of selling seat licences. The club have sent a survey to match-going fans that would see supporters pay for the right to buy a specific seat. It is suggested that the licenses will be optional and will be targeted towards those in premium areas of the stadium. The plan is already in place in a number of stadiums in the United States but has yet to be adopted by clubs in Europe.",
      "Ratcliffe has been desperately attempting to rectify the club’s poor financial outlook since he arrived at Old Trafford. Despite record revenues, United lost around £33m in the past financial year.",
      "Ratcliffe has attempted to change the tide by enforcing two rounds of redundancies at the club - decisions that have not gone down well at all. But he believes that they were necessary for the future of the club.",
      "\"The costs were just too high,” Ratcliffe explained after featuring on The Business Podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times. “There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one has ever given me a free lunch. The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor, is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",

      "Meanwhile, Ratcliffe has predicted the situation to improve dramatically once the new stadium is completed in the future. He added: \"Those numbers will get better.",

Since Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos acquired a minority stake in the club in early 2024, there have not been too many further updates about a potential takeover or outside investment from elsewhere.",
      "Protests against the Glazer family, who are the majority owners of United, have taken place over the last two decades but it certainly looks as though they have no plans to complete an outright sale unless an offer exceeding a sensational £5 billion arrives.",
      "Talk around Ruben Amorim's future has been the dominant topic on United with Ratcliffe addressing exactly that on on The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, where he stated the club sacking Amorim if the Glazer's asked him to \"would not happen\". He also spoke more directly about the Glazers in that interview.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Given the way Rasmus Hojlund has flourished since leaving Manchester United this summer, Denmark boss Brian Riemer would appear to have a point.",
      "Hojlund, who has joined Napoli on a season-long loan, scored twice for his country as they thumped Belarus 6-0 in a World Cup qualifier on Thursday.",
      "The double took Hojlund's tally for club and country to seven goals already this season, including late winners in the Champions League against Sporting Lisbon and Genoa in Serie A.",
      "Considering Hojlund only managed 10 goals in all competitions for United last season – just four in the Premier League - to say the 22-year-old is reborn as a player is something of an understatement.",
      "Hojlund has revived his stagnant career within a matter of weeks at Napoli, just like fellow United outcasts Marcus Rashford and Antony have done at Barcelona and Real Betis respectively, and is thriving on the supply line provided by fellow summer arrival, former Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Hojlund's explosive start to life in Italy makes it legitimate to question whether United jettisoned him too soon and would have been better served holding on to him, despite the £74million acquisition of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Denmark boss Riemer certainly thinks so. “I think Rasmus has the quality for both leagues, without discussion,” he said. “Does he fit in Italian football? Yes. There was no doubt about that, because he had already proven that. But that doesn't mean he doesn't fit in English football. On the contrary, I would almost say.",
      "“The fact that he's now in a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced. It's more important than which league you play in.”",
      "Reimer has a point. Watching Hojlund's two goals against Sporting, both provided by De Bruyne, it is hard to recall the young striker being afforded the same service at United, certainly in his second season, when he was starved of it.",
      "Hojlund was not helped by never being able to step out of the firing line during his two seasons at Old Trafford, where he lead the attack week-in, week-out, without any respite, because there was no-one else to share the burden.",
      "He said as much on United's pre-season tour of the US, before he was offloaded to make way for the arrival of Benjamin Sesko. Had United qualified for Europe this season, perhaps Hojlund could have stayed to share attacking duties with Sesko, but too few fixtures meant something had to give and it was the Dane who was moved on, rather than Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Whether that will prove a mistake or not, with Napoli able to buy Hojlund for £38m at the end of their loan agreement – roughly half of what United paid for him – only time will tell. But the early signs are not looking good for United, give the electric start Hojlund has made to life it Italy.",

      "Altay Bayindir has lifted the lid on his relationship with Manchester United goalkeeping rival Senne Lammens and their battle for the No.1 spot.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim said Bayindir and Lammens will fight for the right to be first-choice keeper, following Andre Onana's season-long move to Turkish side Trabzonspor.",
      "Deadline day signing Lammens has moved above Bayindir to claim the No.1 spot after an impressive debut in United's 2-0 win over Sunderland before the international break.",
      "That assured display between the posts means Lammens will keep his place for United's trip to reigning Premier League champions and arch rivals Liverpool a week on Sunday.",
      "Despite their rivalry for the keeper's jersey Bayindir was among the United players to congratulate Lammens on his debut and revealed the pair are close, despite their personal competition.",
      "“That is the way, everyone has to be together, always,” said Bayindir. “We have a good group, a good goalkeeper group, and we are always pushing each of ourselves on the pitch.",
      "“Of course, we are fighting for the shirt, but in the outside, we have a good relationship, like how we did with Andre. He's at Trabzonspor and he's doing well.”",
      "United have struggled at the start of Amorim's first full season in charge, losing three of their opening seven league games to stand 10th in the table, with Bayindir calling on every player to give more to improve their plight.",
      "“I can say football is a team thing,” said Bayindir. “Everyone needs to work good, you know? Everyone needs to be focused. From my side, every day, after every game, we are improving ourselves and we're thinking what we need to do more.",
      "“After the game, we are doing the analysis. We're seeing everything in the analysis, which parts we have to improve – everything. When you can catch the routine, you can be better every game, because it's about experience. Also you're learning something from every game and that's the important thing.”",
      "United's failure to qualify for Europe and humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby means Amorim's side are currently restricted to one game a week, something Bayindir said must change next season.",
      "“After the game, you have more time to recover and you have more time to be ready for the next game,” said Bayindir.",
      "“But we want to play more games in the week. We can play three games. We want to play more games. It's why this year is more and more important than other years before, because we have to be good.",
      "“Then next year, we want to play more games as, if you're playing for this great club, you have to do more and give everything yourself. I hope we can win more games and everything can be more positive for us. I hope we can make everyone happy.",
      "“Sometimes I'm quiet but I was captain of Fenerbahce and I have this streak, I have this soul. I'm not quiet and calm. I'm always thinking what we have to do. It's never 'I don't care', never if we lose 'it's not my fault' – you can't be successful if you have this idea.”",

      "Manchester United academy graduate James Chester is gaining experience in coaching in the club's academy.",
      "Chester played in the 2007 FA Youth Cup final, he was named United's academy Player of the Year by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and he made his first-team debut under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2009.",
      "The Warrington-born lad was sold to Hull City in 2011 for a transfer fee that Ferguson called \"an absolute steal\". He subsequently represented West Brom, Aston Villa, Stoke City, Derby County and Barrow before calling time on his playing career earlier this year following a stint with Salford City.",
      "After retirement, Chester was invited by his close friend, Paul McShane, to watch the academy train.",
      "Although McShane left United this summer after five years in the academy, Chester was invited to take his first steps in coaching by working with the Under-15s and Under-16 age groups.",
      "Chester has been welcomed back to Carrington on a voluntary basis, and the former defender is working three times per week with the U15s and U16s - passing on his experience from his career.",
      "The 36-year-old announced his retirement in January and is understood to be in the early stages of weighing up what his future holds, but he is enjoying the chance to coach while studying for his UEFA B Licence.",
      "United have reaped the benefits of welcoming academy graduates back to Carrington in academy coaching roles over the last few years. Such arrangements give youngsters the opportunity to learn from former players with Premier League experience, and it's mutually beneficial for all parties involved.",
      "Chester was part of a talented United team that reached the 2007 Youth Cup final, starring alongside the likes of Danny Welbeck, Danny Drinkwater, Sam Hewson and Febian Brandy.",
      "Ferguson handed Chester his first-team debut in the League Cup semi-final second leg against Derby in January 2009. He came on as a substitute for Gary Neville with 20 minutes to go.",
      "Chester was part of the Hull City side that reached the 2014 FA Cup final against Arsenal and he scored the opening goal inside four minutes. He made over 500 competitive appearances and recorded 35 caps for Wales.",
      "The United academy graduate played every minute for Wales as they reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016.",

      "Turki Al-Sheikh has revealed he is not in talks with Manchester United regarding a potential takeover. On Wednesday night, the Saudi Arabian billionaire claimed that the Reds were in the 'advanced stages' of agreeing a deal with a new investor.",
      "On X, formerly known as Twitter, he wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he’s better than the previous owners.\"",
      "The post, which he shared with his seven million followers, went viral. It quickly eclipsed five million views, 12,000 likes, 3,500 shares and nearly 2,000 replies.",
      "Then, on Thursday evening, Al-Sheikh clarified his statement. He said: \"My yesterday’s post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "\"Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "Speaking to The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, the British billionaire claimed that he remains in control of football operations at the club. When asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Ruben Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss, who has owned just under 30 per cent of United since February 2024, added: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "So, naturally, Al-Sheikh's social media caused confusion among staff at the club. Ratcliffe also suggested that he'll remain in charge of football operations for some time, pointing to his long-term plan.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" said the 72-year-old. Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\""

      "Welcome to the Manchester United takeover blog on Friday, October 10.",
      "We will be continuing to bring you all the latest United takeover news today following Turki Al-Sheikh's admission that a businessman is in an 'advanced stage' to purchase the club. Following that statement on Wednesday, he clarified his stance further on Thursday.",
      "With the potential buyer not from Saudi Arabia, it has led to speculation whether Sheikh Jassim could be back in the fold. The Qatari lost out to Sir Jim Ratcliffe in the initial bidding process for the club.",
      "The Qatari banker missed out as he wanted to purchase the entirety of United while Ratcliffe was happy to settle for the Glazers' proposal of a minority stake in the club.",
      "Take a look at all the latest United takeover news below...",
      "According to Caught Offside, United have identified Kenan Yildiz as a key target ahead of the summer transfer window. The Juventus winger was heavily linked with a move to the Premier League earlier this year following his impressive performances at the Club World Cup.",
      "The report claims that Chelsea and Arsenal are also interested in signing Yildiz, whose contract in Turin runs until June 2029. It's said that the Italian giants want to keep the 20-year-old.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United are in talks with Harry Maguire over a new contract. The 32-year-old defender has recently entered the final year of his current deal at Old Trafford, making him available for a free transfer in the summer.",
      "The report claims that the Reds recently had a face-to-face meeting with Maguire's camp. It's said that United have been satisfied with the England international's performances and leadership.",
      "According to TBR Football, Joshua Zirkzee will push to leave United in the January transfer window. The 24-year-old striker, whom the Reds signed from Bologna for £36.5m in the summer of 2024, has struggled to force himself into Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "The report claims Zirkzee has already held talks with United officials about a potential move. It's said that the club are aware of the Dutchman's situation, as he hopes to secure himself a place in the Netheralnds squad for the World Cup.",
      "Zirkzee signed a five-year contract last year.",
      "Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna 'continues to follow' Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder sought a loan move during the final week of the summer transfer window, but United did not entertain his request.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus claims he is planning to approach investors in a bid to purchase Manchester United. He also states he would be interested in working with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and other backers.",
      "Speaking exclusively to MEN Sport, Zilliacus has revealed that he plans to approach potential investors, including Ratcliffe, in a bid to purchase a share in United or the club in its entirety.",
      "\"Last week, I was sitting and thinking through all the possibilities of investing in Manchester United and drafting a basic plan on how I could approach certain parties to see if something could be done,\" Zilliacus said.",
      "\"This is about joining forces with the right parties with the sole aim of bringing Manchester United back to where it should be as the number one club in the world. I mean, my love for the club has gone nowhere and I think the opportunity is still there. So I would really welcome an opportunity to talk to the key players and see what can be done.",
      "\"The key players, of course, today, Ratcliffe, then if other parties would be keen to join as well, then that would be great. Some of the investors, I think it's almost everything or nothing, meaning either they own the club alone or they are not interested. So you would have to find the investors who are willing to look at what is best for the club and not what is best for the investor.\"",
      "Fernandes is privately of the belief that Manchester United can finish in a Champions League qualification place, it has been claimed.",
      "Fortunes for United and Amorim have improved too much in the new season with four defeats suffered from their opening few fixtures. However, the Reds entered the October international break on a high with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland at Old Trafford.",
      "Pressure on Amorim was somewhat relieved following that result, with United now tenth and only three points off the top five and bitter rivals Manchester City. Though there are 31 games still to play, Fernandes believes it is possible for United to finish fifth or even higher, according to BBC Sport sources.",
      "It has also been stated in that report that Fernandes is committed to the project and is determined to put everything he has into sealing a better future for United. No European football could benefit Amorim and Co. with more time to prepare for Premier League games on the weekend.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is reportedly prepared to leave Manchester United in January as he continues to struggle for game time under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The 24-year-old is yet to start a game for United this season, having played just 74 minutes across three Premier League matches so far. Zirkzee, who has been named as an unused substitute in four games, is behind Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the pecking order.",
      "The lack of game time has also seen the forward dropped from Ronald Koeman's Dutch squad for this month's international break. With next summer's World Cup fast approaching, Zirkzee is believed to be desperate to impress and secure a spot in the team.",
      "As a result, he may look to depart Old Trafford in the New Year and is said to already have a potential suitor. Journalist Ben Jacobs has claimed that PSV would be open to a loan deal. However, Amorim is keen for him to stay and the club are also reluctant to sanction an exit unless they could sell him for more than a book loss. United paid £43 million to Bologna for his services last summer.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, there is no truth in the information that Fernandes has signed pre-contract agreements with any club in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The journalist insists that Fernandes is fully focused on United.",
      "However, should he open the door to a Saudi move, the captain would receive what is believed to be 'crazy' offers from the Middle East to join.",
      "Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus claims he is planning to approach investors in a bid to purchase Manchester United. He also states he would be interested in working with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and other backers.",
      "Zilliacus led one of many parties that submitted bids for the club in 2023 when the Glazer family announced they would open to either a full or partial sale of United. But his fan-led approach came too late in the day and Ratcliffe's Ineos purchased a nearly 30 per cent stake while seizing control of footballing operations.",
      "This week, rumours have spread that the club could be sold with suggestions of a bid from the UAE. Saudi Arabia's Turki Al-Sheikh claimed that a businessman is in \"advanced talks\" with United's hierarchy.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Speaking to 247Bet, Michael Owen has insisted that United and Ratcliffe are right to give Amorim further time at the club.",
      "I’ve liked him since he’s come in. Obviously, the results don’t suggest that, but I like what he says. I like his demeanour, and I like him, really. Bigger names have come in and failed, and it’s been one of the hardest jobs in the world for the last decade. So, it’s going to take someone who’s given time. I do think he’s the right man. I think Manchester United will be patient. They’ve chopped and changed for a long, long time, and I do think he is the right man, but it’s obviously going to take time.",
      "Should a takeover of United become a reality, there is a chance that the Reds' new owner will look to hire a new manager for the club.",
      "If that is the case, Roy Keane knows exactly who he would like taking on the position.",
      "He told Stick to Football:",
      "I’ve said it for years … I’d like to see Diego Simeone going there. I think he’d create havoc, but good havoc. I’d like to see his personality and his track record. They beat Real Madrid, they scored five… yes he likes his teams a bit defensive, but they have that fighting spirit. I like a big personality.",
      "Despite Turki Al-Sheikh's comments to the contrary, the UAE interest in United is at an early not advanced stage, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "We reported on Thursday that the Glazers would be looking for £5bn if they are to sell the club outright.",
      "MEN Sport also understands that news of UAE interest caught United by surprise, with those inside the club unsure where Turki Al-Sheikh had received his information.",
      "United full-back Dorgu was hailed on Thursday night thanks to his performance and goal in a 6-0 victory over Belarus in World Cup qualifying.",
      "Danish outlet DR rated him a 10 out of 10 stating:",
      "The dynamic and physically strong Manchester United player was initially entrusted with the position of left back, but with much more focus on putting pressure on the offense. And it must be said that he succeeded. Dorgu had to find his position, but then he combined and dribbled forward and was the main man behind the Danish 3-0 score, plus further chances. Excellent effort.",
      "Hojlund bagged a brace and an assist in the victory which leaves Denmark top of their group.",
      "Those are the thoughts of cycling legend Geraint Thomas when he appeared in a recent episode of The Sport Agents podcast.",
      "Thomas told Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan, when speaking about the Ineos Cycling Team:",
      "I can't really speak for Ineos, but I feel like they're involved for the next few years for sure. I think it was just unfortunate that when they came into the cycling team, it was, you know, towards the end of our reign, so to speak. Because, in sport it's hard to stay at the top for forever. You know, it always comes in cycles, and they came in just as [Tadej] Pogacar came on the scene. And, you know, we won our first tour with Ineos. But then after that, well, we didn't.",
      "According to talkSPORT, the bid for United which Turki Al-Sheikh is referring to could be coming from the UAE.",
      "They claim that club legends have also been approached regarding the possibility of joining the bid.",
      "It is also noted that potential investors can speak to the Glazer family directly about a potential takeover.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "The only party known to have had any major interest in purchasing the Reds was Sheikh Jassim.",
      "However, if he is now interested then he has taken a U-turn from his stance as recently as May.",
      "Back then, the Daily Mail reported that Sheikh Jassim had no current intention of reviving his interest in purchasing United.",
      "After suggesting the United sale was at an 'advanced stage', Turki took the opportunity to send an update and clarify a few points on Thursday afternoon.",
      "He wrote on X:",
      "My yesterday’s post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor. Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United takeover and transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be keeping you posted on the latest on both topics over the course of the morning.",
      "To get things started, let's take a look at what this man's revised statement on the Reds' takeover had to say...",
      "According to GiveMeSport, sections of the United dressing room were strongly pushing for Emiliano Martinez over Senne Lammens. The report claims the Reds held talks with Aston Villa and, despite recommendations from people in Ruben Amorim's circle, they went for the 23-year-old from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Frenkie de Jong has revealed that he's 'very close' to signing a new contract with Barcelona, finally putting to bed years of speculation over a move to United. The 28-year-old midfielder has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford on numerous occasions in the past, but a deal never materialised.",
      "\"We are very close,\" De Jong told reporters ahead of the Netherlands' trip to Malta on Thursday. \"If there's real news, you'll hear about it, but I can't say anything for now.",
      "\"I hope to stay at Barcelona for the rest of my career,\" De Jong added. \"This is the place I wanted to be as a child. Now we have a team with a great future, I want to win the big trophies here.\"",
      "According to Italian outlet Gazzetta dello Sport, Napoli has been following Kobbie Mainoo for 'some time', and the club's sporting director 'appreciates his qualities'. The report claims that talks with the United playmaker in the summer were positive, and that he'd have gladly accepted a loan.",
      "Even though a deal failed to materialise, it's said that Napoli are still in the market for a midfielder. Gazzetta dello Sport suggests that United could let Mainoo leave on loan in January if there's no obligation to buy clause inserted into the deal.",
      "Brian Riemer believes Rasmus Hojlund has what it takes to still be successful in the Premier League. Speaking to reporters, as quoted by TipsBladet, the Denmark boss said: \"I think Rasmus has the quality for both leagues, without discussion.",
      "\"Does he fit in Italian football? Yes. There was no doubt about that, because he had already proven that. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t fit in English football. On the contrary, I would almost say.\"",
      "Riemer added: \"The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced.",
      "\"It is more important than which league you play in...\"",
      "Turki Al-Sheikh has clarified that he is not in talks with Manchester United regarding a potential takeover. In a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, he said: \"My yesterday’s post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "\"Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "Read the full story here",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United are in talks with Harry Maguire over a new contract. The 32-year-old defender has recently entered the final year of his current deal at Old Trafford, making him available for a free transfer in the summer.",
      "The report claims that the Reds recently had a face-to-face meeting with Maguire's camp. It's said that United have been satisfied with the England international's performances and leadership.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Gary Neville, Roy Keane and Paul Scholes revealed who they would appoint to replace Ruben Amorim as United boss.",
      "Neville and Keane backed Diego Simeone to take the reins at Old Trafford following his brilliant work over the years at Atletico Madrid. The duo, however, agreed that Amorim should be given more time.",
      "Scholes opted for Eddie Howe, but he expressed doubts about the Newcastle boss' long-standing assistant, Jason Tindall.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, United are hoping to sign Kenan Yildiz next year. The Juventus winger, who's enjoyed an electric start to the season, was linked with a move to the Premier League in the summer.",
      "The report claims that the Reds face tough competition from Chelsea and Arsenal for his signature. It's said that United could be willing to pay as much as £78million for Yildiz.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Gary Neville claimed that he's changed his mind after recently meeting Bruno Fernandes. The former United defender said: \"I say Bruno [changed my mind after meeting him personally].",
      "\"I met him for half an hour, and I thought it was fair to say that when people talk about him at the club, they say he’s a good type and he’s hardworking.",
      "\"He really looks after the staff, and that was the thing that impressed me most when the staff said he looked after the staff; he looks after people.\"",
      "According to the Mirror, the Glazers would consider offers of more than £5billion for their stake in United, which is more than double what the English giants are currently worth on the stock market.",
      "The report acknowledges speculation that Turki Al-Sheikh could launch a bid – despite what the club have said. The Mirror reckons that the Saudi billionaire would have to start the bidding at around £5.2billion, just to stand a realistic chance of persuading the Glazers to sell up.",
      "Manchester United have received a Bryan Mbeumo boost during the October international break.",
      "The Cameroonian arrived at Old Trafford from Brentford this summer for £65million, plus £6m in add-ons. The forward, who scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season, has made a positive start to life under Ruben Amorim with two goals and an assist so far across all competitions.",
      "Mbeumo has been a regular in the league, having played 90 minutes in all but one fixture so far in 2024/25. The 26-year-old is currently away on international duty with Cameroon, where he has continued his fine form.",

      "A further update has now emerged with talkSPORT sharing new details. The report claims that the group being referred to by Al-Sheikh are based in the United Arab Emirates and that several club legends have also been 'approached'.",
      "It is also noted that potential investors can speak to the Glazer family directly about a potential takeover. A clause in the deal between Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers stipulates that he will be required to sell his shares or match any offer if an interested party makes an offer that is accepted.",

Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.”",

      "After launching the bold plans in Match, United have now invited fans to share their views on a range of potential stadium features, including facilities, seating and pricing options.",
      "The survey, run by commercial research company CSL, is part of United's stated commitment to place fans at the heart of the planning for the future of Old Trafford.",
      "United's request for supporter feedback on the proposed new stadium comes on the back of an initial phase of fan research conducted a year ago, when the opinions of more than 50,000 fans were canvassed.",
      "It also follows a series of focus groups held in July, the aim of which is to use the insight and feedback to help shape the next stage of design development.",
      "All match-going supporters – including season ticket holders, official members and hospitality purchasers – were contacted via email on Thursday, with a link to take part in the survey.",
      "United are mindful of retaining and ultimately enhancing the match-day atmosphere with any move to a new stadium, harnessing the passion of their fans and protecting the club's rich fan culture.",

      "United are adamant the Stretford End should not allow its vibrant, vocal support from loyal fans, who set the tone on match-days, to be diluted as a result of a move to a new stadium.",
      "As well as that, United have made a commitment to ensuring ticket prices for games at the new stadium will remain affordable to young fans and plan to do so by introducing premium options to subsidise lower-cost tickets.",
      "As part of the latest consultation, fans will be asked about their preferences, priorities and expectations including facilities, seating and pricing options for the proposed new stadium.",
      "United will do so by presenting a series of hypothetical product and pricing scenarios across a range of seating categories, to gauge interest and demand from supporters",
      "The survey will also look at a potential seat licence option, whereby fans have the opportunity to secure the right to buy a ticket for matches and other events at Old Trafford for a longer period of time, through a one-off payment or series of instalments.",
      "This would not affect traditional season ticket holders who would still receive the normal benefits, including the same seat for every game and the ability to apply for away game and cup final tickets.",

      "Arsenal have been punished by the FA for breaching regulations during their third round FA Cup loss to Manchester United last season. The Gunners have received a suspended £500,000 fine for violating ticket allocation rules after United were allocated just 8,000 seats for their cup tie when they should have received 15 per cent of the stadium capacity.",
      "To satisfy that requirement, 9,000 tickets ought to have been provided to United, though Arsenal contended that safety regulations prevented them from fulfilling this demand.",
      "These capacity rules differ in the Premier League where smaller allocations can be provided. This explains why away sections appear considerably larger during cup fixtures.",
      "United tried to negotiate a compromise on the issue but received no response from Arsenal, prompting their grievance to be submitted to the FA. Approximately ten months after the fixture, the findings of their inquiry have now been disclosed.",
      "A statement declared: \"The Professional Game Board (PGB) has sanctioned Arsenal FC for breaching the 2024-25 FA Cup Rule 192 in relation to its third round tie against Manchester United FC on Sunday 12 January 2025.",
      "\"It was alleged that Arsenal FC had breached the 2024-25 FA Cup Rule 192, and the matter was referred to the PGB for consideration.",
      "\"The PGB concluded that Arsenal FC had failed to comply with the 2024-25 FA Cup Rule 192 and imposed a suspended £500,000 fine.",
      "\"The fine is suspended pending Arsenal FC's confirmation that it is able to comply with this requirement for the 2025-26 FA Cup third round and continued compliance for any further rounds of this season's competition.\"",
      "The complete statement published on the FA's website stated that \"the away club shall have the right to claim up to 15% of the tickets issued (up to a maximum of 9,000)\".",
      "Despite less supporters being inside Emirates Stadium, United gave the travelling faithful an evening to remember by winning the clash on penalties.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were ultimately beaten in the fifth round on spot-kicks by Fulham, who would go on to be knocked out by eventual winners Crystal Palace.",
      "Their campaign in this year's tournament will commence in early January with the draw taking place beforehand.",

      "Manchester United invited club correspondents into the Old Trafford boardroom last season.",
      "Omar Berrada and Dan Ashworth spoke on record during a wide-ranging question-and-answer session before the Liverpool game, touching on Erik ten Hag, transfers and much more.",
      "The most interesting quotes were about the controversial decision to keep Ten Hag in charge.",
      "When asked about Ten Hag's contract extension after he lifted the FA Cup, Berrada said: \"Again, so in terms of the contract, that was a decision that was taken prior to both of our arrivals.",
      "\"But as I said before, we're very happy with that decision. Erik has our full backing and we have worked very closely together, as Dan said before, in this transfer window. We're going to continue working very closely with him to help him get the best results out of the team.\"",
      "Berrada was asked whether Ten Hag would still be backed if there was a bad run of results and said: \"Do we still believe in Erik? Absolutely. We think Erik is the right coach for us and we’re fully backing him.\"",
      "Responding to a question about inheriting a coach, Ashworth said: \"Well, it happened at Newcastle with Eddie Howe [during his time there], it happened at West Brom, Tony Mowbray was in place. Very rarely do you go into a job as a sporting director and there's no manager in place.",
      "\"I didn't start until July 1, so none whatsoever [say in keeping Ten Hag]. All I can do is reiterate what I remember saying, I've really enjoyed working with Erik for the last eight weeks.\"",
      "In no uncertain terms, Berrada and Ashworth made it clear that Ten Hag retained the backing of the board - but the Dutchman was sacked 57 days later following a defeat to West Ham.",
      "Those comments are relevant because Sir Jim Ratcliffe has publicly backed Ruben Amorim, saying on The Business podcast: \"He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "Asked if the Glazers have told him to sack his head coach, Ratcliffe replied: “It’s not going to happen.”",
      "He added: \"The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Some consider Ratcliffe's comments as a cast-iron guarantee of giving three years to Amorim, but you only need to look at what Berrada and Ashworth said about Ten Hag to show that his assurances are worthless. The winds change quickly in football and Amorim needs results to survive.",
      "Amorim is thought to have a good relationship with Ratcliffe. During this summer's pre-season tour, he revealed that Ratcliffe sends him GIFs after matches, but he will be sent a P45 if results don't improve.",
      "Sunderland felt like a must-win for Amorim ahead of the October international break, following another setback against Brentford which saw the pressure increase on his shoulders again.",
      "Amorim's failure to win back-to-back Premier League games during his tenure is concerning and he must dispose of that unwanted record sooner rather than later. The performance against Sunderland was a step in the right direction, but it's fair to say Amorim is not out of the woods.",
      "It's also worth noting that Ratcliffe said the only thing he can say. Imagine the uproar if Ratcliffe came out and questioned Amorim, suggesting that he could be on borrowed time?",
      "The meaningful conversations about Amorim are held in private. Ratcliffe would not reveal he was having second thoughts about United's manager during a conversation on a podcast.",
      "United will play Liverpool and Brighton before the anniversary of Ten Hag's sacking on October 28, and it feels like a decision on Amorim's future will be made at a similar time of the season.",
      "Ineos sacked their previous manager shortly after backing him - could history repeat itself?",

      "A former Manchester United prodigy, who idolised Ryan Giggs as a youngster and was strongly linked with Wrexham during the summer transfer window, has finally secured a new club.",
      "Tom Lawrence has been without a team since May after his contract with Scottish outfit Rangers concluded. The attacking midfielder, born in Wrexham, was claimed to be considering a move to his hometown club following their promotion to the Championship at the end of last season.",
      "Burnley, Coventry City, West Brom, Middlesbrough and Blackburn Rovers were also reportedly interested in securing the services of the 31-year-old. Despite interest from teams in the Middle East and Turkey, it was suggested at the time that Lawrence found the prospect of playing for Wrexham, now owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, particularly enticing.",
      "However, no deal came to fruition and after a lengthy five-month period without a club, he has now officially signed for Australian A-League side Perth Glory. Lawrence explained how the move transpired after a chat with former United defender Scott Wootton.",
      "He said: \"I had a call with [Glory football director] Stan Lazaridis and the manager [David Zdrilic] and just listened to their passion for the club and where they want to go. That's really what settled it in the end.",
      "\"I also spoke with [Glory defender] Scott Wootton and he was very complimentary about the club and Perth as a city. He basically said, 'Just get here as soon as you can, you'll love it'.",
      "\"I've been training every day with a guy back home in the UK and I feel like I'm in good shape. My body feels good, so I don't think it'll take long at all and I'll be raring to go.\"",
      "He added: \"I've come here to score as many goals and contribute as many assists to help the team as I can. I want the team to finish as high as possible and go for whatever we can this season.\"",
      "Lawrence's stint at Rangers was plagued by fitness problems after his switch from Derby County to Ibrox in 2022. Despite those setbacks, he still racked up 65 appearances and netted 11 goals during his three-year period in Glasgow.",
      "Lawrence, who has earned 23 caps for the Wales national team, honed his skills under some of the finest in the business during his formative years at United. Signing for the club at the tender age of just seven, he had the opportunity to learn from legends such as Sir Alex Ferguson and Paul Scholes, not to mention his hero Giggs.",
      "Speaking to The Sun last year, Lawrence said: \"The number of figures that helped me out along the way, I couldn't name them all. What I will say is that you looked up to those who were in the first team at the time, the likes of Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.",
      "\"Coaching-wise Paul McGuinness and Warren Joyce helped me massively. I am really thankful to them all. There were role models everywhere. It was just all about standards, it makes you have those standards from such a young age.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson was one for big standards and you couldn't mess up. That grounding never leaves you. When you grow up hearing that you just get used to doing the same high level standard stuff every day. It's instilled in you.\"",
      "Despite his lengthy spell at United, Lawrence's first-team opportunities were restricted to just one senior outing in May 2014 against Hull. At that time, Giggs was juggling duties as United's player-manager when Lawrence featured for the majority of the match.",
      "In a poignant moment, Giggs substituted Lawrence with 20 minutes left on the clock, marking his final appearance for United. Lawrence said: \"He was a big hero growing up, there were a few of them. But he gave me my Manchester United debut so I'll be forever grateful. Nothing will ever come close to that.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus claims he is planning to approach investors in a bid to purchase Manchester United. He also states he would be interested in working with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and other backers.",
      "Zilliacus led one of many parties that submitted bids for the club in 2023 when the Glazer family announced they would open to either a full or partial sale of United. But his fan-led approach came too late in the day and Ratcliffe's Ineos purchased a nearly 30 per cent stake while seizing control of footballing operations.",
      "This week, rumours have spread that the club could be sold with suggestions of a bid from the UAE. Saudi Arabia's Turki Al-Sheikh claimed that a businessman is in \"advanced talks\" with United's hierarchy.",
      "Speaking exclusively to MEN Sport, Zilliacus has revealed that he plans to approach potential investors, including Ratcliffe, in a bid to purchase a share in United or the club in its entirety.",
      "Zilliacus said: \"Last week, I was sitting and thinking through all the possibilities of investing in Manchester United and drafting a basic plan on how I could approach certain parties to see if something could be done.",
      "\"This is about joining forces with the right parties with the sole aim of bringing Manchester United back to where it should be as the number one club in the world.",
      "\"I mean, my love for the club has gone nowhere and I think the opportunity is still there. So I would really welcome an opportunity to talk to the key players and see what can be done.",
      "\"The key players, of course, today, Ratcliffe, then if other parties would be keen to join as well, then that would be great. Some of the investors, I think it's almost everything or nothing, meaning either they own the club alone or they are not interested. So you would have to find the investors who are willing to look at what is best for the club and not what is best for the investor.\"",
      "Zilliacus insists that if he were to have any control of the club he would integrate a fan-led initiative and his bid would not be a takeover as such. He claims this is something the Glazer family currently rejects.",
      "\"I think the Glazers, unfortunately, are a good example of somebody who is not really looking out for the club, but rather using it as a cash cow,\" he added. \"But in any case, they are not doing what should be done.",
      "\"I have a program that involves the fans who are overseas, who cannot come to watch a game. And my program can evolve in a way that can bring significant new revenues to the club.",
      "\"So with that money the club could do all the things it needs to do to be truly the best football club in the world, where all the best players, the best managers, everybody wants to be there.\"",
      "Zilliacus also says he would happily work with any investor including another former bidder, Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim. He continued: \"I actually have nothing against working with people like Jim Ratcliffe or any investor, whoever that may be. Because I'm not in this to have a trophy that I can show off to other people.",
      "\"I'm in this to make a club that I've been a fan of since I was 12 years old the best club in the world. My heart cries when I see how things are going today. Manchester United are so far below where the club should be and could be if things were managed the right way.",
      "\"When I had made my bid I realised that the Glazers were playing a game where Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim and myself were just trying to outbid each other. So the price was just going higher and higher and higher.",
      "\"I publicly said that this is madness, that this is money that should be used for the club and not to further enrich the Glazers. So I said, 'Why don't we join forces and take over the club together?'",
      "\"I'm still completely open to that, and I would be more than happy to speak to Sheikh Jassim or to Jim Ratcliffe or any other investor about how we could work together.\"",

      "British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe responded with scepticism when questioned about a competing bid to take over Manchester United. The Ineos boss wasn't entirely convinced his competitor was even a real person.",
      "Ratcliffe, 72, agreed to purchase a 27.7% stake in United for approximately £1.3billion in December 2023, which he has since increased to 28.9%. At the time, the Brit outbid Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was solely interested in buying the club from the Glazer family outright but failed in his £5.5bn proposal.",
      "Ratcliffe's future as a United shareholder is now thought to be at risk following rumours a new investor is in discussions to buy the club. This comes after Saudi sports chief Turki Al-Sheikh claimed to have insider information when he posted on X this week: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor.\"",
      "Al-Sheikh later somewhat retracted those comments and admitted the proposed purchase \"might not necessarily happen.\" And it wouldn't be the first time Ratcliffe has reason to feel doubtful about a rival offer after previously commenting on Sheikh Jassim's attempts.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"Still nobody's ever seen him, actually. The Glazers never met him,\" he said last year after being asked about the \"odd\" nature of Sheikh Jassim's low visibility during the bidding process. He then delivered a brutal five-word summary of his former rival: \"I'm not sure he exists! [Laughs].\"",
      "An atmosphere of mystery surrounded Sheikh Jassim's candidacy when the bidding process reached its climax in 2023. While Ratcliffe has long been a well-known business tycoon and already possessed European clubs such as Nice and Lausanne, Sheikh Jassim remained largely behind the scenes of his own bid.",
      "The son of former Qatari emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani witnessed his proposal collapse in the face of Ratcliffe's challenge. While the Briton was satisfied acquiring a minority share in the club that could grow over time, Sheikh Jassim sought to purchase the entire entity with his £5.5bn bid.",
      "Ultimately, the offer was rejected due to worries over whether the Sheikh and his representatives could demonstrate proof of funds. Yet not even two years on, there is renewed speculation of a fresh takeover occurring.",
      "That may appear peculiar so shortly after Ratcliffe's investment, but it's become apparent precisely how another change of ownership can happen. That's because of 'drag-along' provisions incorporated in his deal, which grant the Glazer family powers to compel a sale if particular conditions are satisfied.",
      "Ratcliffe initially had first-refusal rights to match any incoming offer, but this expired in August. Now, the Glazers hold the power to enforce a deal.",
      "While details of any new bid remain scant, it's not believed that Sheikh Jassim has made another attempt to take over United. However, potential buyer Thomas Zilliacus would be open to welcoming fellow investors like the Qatari, provided their intentions align.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe could be “forced” to sack Ruben Amorim over results despite his claim that he’s ready to give him three years at the helm.",
      "There were rumours before their match against Sunderland that Amorim could lose his job if Man Utd had been beaten well at Old Trafford before the international break.",
      "However, Amorim made it two wins from three Premier League matches with a 2-0 victory over the Black Cats and held onto his job until at least the Liverpool match at Anfield on October 19.",
      "In an interview this week, Ratcliffe insisted that he intends to give Amorim three years to prove himself at Old Trafford with the Man Utd co-owner looking for consistency over chaos.",
      "Man Utd have collected just 37 points from Amorim’s 34 Premier League matches in charge and Football Insider journalist Pete O’Rourke reckons Ratcliffe will be “forced” into a change if he continues down a similar path.",
      "O’Rourke explained: “Look, it’s a results driven business. And if you’re not getting results, it obviously piles of pressure on Amorim.",
      "READ: Premier League player stats: Erling Haaland, Elliot Anderson, Jack Grealish all thriving in 2025/26",
      "“If results don’t improve, performances don’t improve and Man United find themselves well down in the table, it’s going to increase pressure on them and they might be forced into making a change.",
      "“It’s a very huge public backing and support that Ratcliffe has given to Amorim saying he wants to give him three years to prove himself at Man United.",
      "“We know Ratcliffe has said that he wants to give him three years to get things right, prove himself.",
      "“If the results don’t improve in the meantime, the pressure will just grow and grow, and once that happens, you normally do have a change of managers.",
      "“Results will dictate what Ruben Amorim’s future is at Old Trafford.”",
      "Man Utd legend Roy Keane has put forward Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone as the perfect fit for the Red Devils if they do sack Amorim.",
      "Keane said on The Overlap: “I’ve said it for years, I’d like Atletico Madrid’s Simeone to go in there. I’d like to see him go there. I know his mate has gone to Arsenal [Andrea Berta, the Gunners’ sporting director who recently left Atletico].",
      "“I think he would just create havoc, but good havoc. He’d rock up to that place. No guarantees, but I’d just like to see his personality, his track record.",
      "“People might think styles of football, [but] they scored five against Real Madrid [winning 5-2] last weekend. He doesn’t like his teams giving up too many goals or chances, but they can play a bit and fight.",
      "“At Liverpool [where Atletico lost 3-2 in the Champions League] a few weeks ago… the team aren’t as great as few years ago, but they still had fighting spirit. He’s on the sideline, he got sent off that night, I’d like a big personality.”",
      "When asked about about how long he’d give Amorim, Keane quipped: “I’d still say give the man a chance, absolutely. Another week.”",
      "READ NEXT: Mourinho text ‘s***’ Man Utd star every day telling him ‘leave’ in ‘grotesque’ bust-up",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim will not be sacked yet but there are reportedly still dissenting voices who want the Red Devils to talk to other managers.",
      "The man in charge of United’s football operations wants to give Amorim three years but there has been little to show he deserves that.",
      "It has been suggested that a Manchester United takeover is ‘advanced’ as a new report has revealed the real bidder and a ‘whopping’ demand.",
      "According to reports, the Glazer family have already set a Manchester United ‘sale’ price amid interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Man Utd are ‘an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor’ according to a Saudi government official.",
      "It is certainly crisis (CRISIS) season in the Premier League. That’s not our fault. Nothing we can do about that except rank them."

      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo will only be allowed to leave Old Trafford on loan in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have been inconsistent once again this season, winning three, losing three and drawing one of their seven Premier League matches so far.",
      "It comes after Ruben Amorim could only guide Man Utd to a 15th-placed Premier League finish last term with the Red Devils failing to qualify for any European competitions.",
      "One player who has dropped down the pecking order under Amorim is Mainoo with the Man Utd boss angering club officials by revealing that the England international would be competing with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot this season.",
      "Those comments saw Mainoo – who has not started in the Premier League this season – pursue a move away from Old Trafford before the summer transfer deadline but Jason Wilcox managed to talk him into staying.",

      "And now Football Insider insist that Mainoo’s ‘only’ option in the January transfer window will be to leave on a loan deal.",
      "Football Insider transfer correspondent Pete O’Rourke said: “It’s a difficult one.",
      "“There’s no doubt that Mainoo is frustrated with his current role at United. He wants to be playing regularly in that side.",
      "“But Ruben Amorim has got his preferred centre-midfield choice of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and probably even Manuel Ugarte is ahead of Mainoo as well, which does leave a lot of Manchester United fans perplexed that Mainoo can’t find a role in that side.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is already doing well at Napoli, after leaving Man Utd on loan with the Serie A side having an option to buy, and there are rumours Mainoo could also end up in Naples.",
      "Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport insists that Napoli are ‘still targeting’ Mainoo a ‘loan in January being a possibility’ and the Man Utd midfielder ‘would like to show off his skills to earn a place in the next World Cup’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Mainoo is unhappy with this start to the season and is pushing for a January transfer, even on loan. The Englishman’s short-term goal, in fact, is to show off his skills and secure a place in Tuchel’s squad for the next World Cup. Manchester isn’t the right platform, but Napoli could be.’",
      "Earlier this season, former Man Utd team-mate Phil Jones insists that if his lack of game time continues then Mainoo will look to force a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Jones said on Stadium Astro: “Kobbie is a player that I really admire. I loved watching him come into the team, and I remember his performance at Everton away, his first start.",
      "“He absolutely bossed the game. He was terrific that night. It was a mature performance, and he carried on that season.",
      "“It just looks like at the minute he’s out of favour. The manager’s already come out and stated that he’s not going to be playing with Bruno. You’re not going to dislodge Bruno in the form that he’s in.",
      "“He’s going to find it difficult for games. I think by Christmas and January time, if he’s not had the game time that he’ll like, then I’m sure he’ll be trying to force a loan move.”",

      "“It has been proven the opposite, we were very mature, very honest with each other.”",
      "Mourinho went on to add: “I’m so happy with him and I’m happy with people understanding with me everything is not black and white.”",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has hit back at former Liverpool star Steven Gerrard after his comments on England’s golden generation.",
      "Despite the Three Lions oozing with talented players in the 2000s, England failed to get to the final of a major tournament with Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson failing to get the best out of the players.",
      "David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Paul Scholes, Frank Lampard, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Rooney, John Terry and Jamie Carragher are just some of the players who were at the disposal of the managers.",
      "Their failure to win anything in the first decade or so of the 2000s was put down to players failing to put club rivalries aside with Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal fighting for the same trophies.",
      "Gerrard recently admitted that was one issue with the former Liverpool midfielder insisting that the England squad back then was full of “egotistical losers”.",

      "“I watch the telly now and I see Jamie Carragher sitting next to Paul Scholes and they look like they’ve been best mates for 20 years.",
      "“And I see Carragher’s relationship with Gary Neville and they look like they’ve been mates for 20 years. I’m probably more close and friendly with you [Ferdinand] now than I ever was when I played with you for 15 years [for England].",
      "“So why didn’t we connect when we were 20, 21, 22, 23? Was it ego? Was it rivalry?",
      "“It was down to the culture within England. We weren’t friendly or connected. We weren’t a team. We never at any stage became a real good, strong team.",
      "“I hated it. I didn’t enjoy it. Hated the [hotel] rooms.",
      "“In my early days, I’d have days where I was down, like low down. Like I’m in this room for seven hours, what am I going to do?",
      "“There was no social media, we didn’t have a DVD player or anything. Channel 1 to 5 or whatever it was on TV. I used to get low and down.",
      "“I used to love the games. I used to love playing for England. I was really proud. I used to enjoy the training sessions but it was 90 minutes a day. And then I was just on my own.",
      "“I didn’t feel part of a team. I didn’t feel connected with my team-mates, with England.",
      "“I didn’t feel that with Liverpool. They were the best days of my life. I felt like the staff looked over me, like I felt special. I felt like I couldn’t wait to get there. With England, I just wanted the games and the training sessions and then to be away.”",

      "Ratcliffe described Arteta’s opening years at Arsenal as “miserable”, no doubt ‘informed’ by their back-to-back eighth-placed finishes, but crucially, there were signs of progress even in the early days.",
      "Emery’s stint at Arsenal was characterised by throwing away leads and gifting opposition goals; Arteta’s 18 clean sheets in his first 50 games demonstrate where he improved Arsenal the most.",
      "When Jurgen Klopp arrived at Liverpool, they too had a leaking defence. When Brendan Rodgers was sacked following a 1-1 draw at Goodison, Liverpool had a -2 goal difference, conceding 1.25 goals every game. In Klopp’s first 50 games, he brought that down to 1.02 and kept it there for his whole Liverpool tenure.",
      "For both Arsenal and Liverpool, there were clear signs of progress from a playing style aspect, and soon the results began to follow. Arteta may have finished eighth in both of his opening seasons, but he achieved five more points in his second campaign and Ratcliffe’s “miserable” assessment ignores their FA Cup win in 2020.",
      "In 2021/22, the Gunners rose to fifth and their big leap came in 2022/23 when they reached second in Arteta’s third full season in charge. Liverpool also came in eighth in Klopp’s first season and in the following year, they were up to fourth.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United have shown very little signs of any progress, either from a points or playing style perspective.",
      "Amorim’s predecessor Erik ten Hag averaged 1.84 points per game with 1.83 goals scored per game and 1.41 conceded. Amorim meanwhile may have a better scoring record at 1.94 per game, but they also concede a lot more at 1.9 per game. His points per game is also 1.38, 0.46 less than Ten Hag. And that was ‘miserable’.",
      "The former Sporting boss may not have had the full season with the squad but Amorim took a side that was 14th and pushed them one spot lower to 15th.",
      "Then there is the tactical reluctance. His devotion to 3-4-2-1 is unbreakable, so much so that not even the Pope could convince him otherwise, and in his 50 games for United, on only five occasions have the team not lined up like that. And even then it was a 3-4-3.",
      "A devotion to a philosophy is nothing new and not inherently bad for a football manager, but you need only look at the way Pep Guardiola has changed his system over the years to keep up with changing trends.",
      "When he arrived at City in 2016, only three players were taller than 1.9m, two of them goalkeepers. Now, that number is at six. Over the years we have seen changes like inverting full-backs, a move away from 4-3-3 towards a 4-2-2-2 when in possession and more from Guardiola. His first season had many saying he could not cope with English football after a couple of hammerings, but mid-season tweaks meant they went unbeaten in the last eight games of the year.",
      "Guardiola was of course helped by City’s spending, but it is not as if United have not splashed the cash either. The key difference is that City’s signings fixed obvious holes in the team, while United have still been left with gaping chasms, mainly in midfield.",
      "Amorim has dug his own grave and Ratcliffe has pinned his colours to the mast of what may well be a sinking ship.",
      "The man in charge of United’s football operations often likes to portray himself as a fan, one that used to stand on the terraces, more than your typical Premier League owner, and this desire for patience may be him harking back to days of yore, but if you’re backing a dead horse for 11 months or three years, it is still not going to be winning any races.",
      "Amorim may well come good and United may well start winning titles again, but there has been very little evidence to suggest that, and Ratcliffe’s dedication for now seems more based on hope than it is on the reality playing out in front of him.",

      "A representative of Viktor Gyokeres has revealed how close Manchester United came to signing the Arsenal star in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "Arsenal‘s top priority in the summer was to sign an elite striker as they have been short in this department in recent seasons and Gyokeres was eventually preferred to Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, Arsenal’s pursuit of Gyokeres was far from simple as Sporting Lisbon went back on a gentleman’s agreement, while they faced competition from Man Utd and the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Man Utd also identified Gyokeres as a leading target, though they missed out on the 27-year-old, who was intent on a move to Arsenal.",
      "Arsenal’s patience eventually paid off as they paid around £64m to sign Gyokeres, who has three goals in his seven Premier League appearances this season.",
      "Now, Jonathan Chalkias, who is assistant to agent Hasan Cetinkaya, has provided details on Gyokeres’ move to the Premier League, claiming Man Utd and Sporting Lisbon “finalised a deal behind their back”.",
      "“It was such a lot of money [from the Saudi Pro League], it was well over 400 million net per year,” Chalkias said on the Studio Allsvenskan podcast.",
      "READ: Premier League CRISIS Rankings: Forest 2nd, West Ham 3rd, but what of Liverpool and Man Utd?",
      "“It’s a ridiculous amount of money. It’s better Viktor answers that question some day, we didn’t once push him in that way.",
      "“I think at the end of the day, money comes and money goes. Making this move to Arsenal gives us good marketing, too. He was actually never even that way, he didn’t think about it.",
      "“But there was also the problem with Sporting that they had finalised the deal with United behind our backs.",
      "“They [Sporting] had agreed because United paid a much higher transfer fee, but they didn’t get any attention. Every time they called it was, ‘no, no, no’, because he wanted to go to Arsenal.”",
      "Chalkias has also revealed why Gyokeres was in favour of a move to Arsenal.",
      "“It’s just that they haven’t had a new one [striker] in the last two years, Arteta spoke with him, to go to a club that hasn’t won in a few years,” Chalkias added.",
      "“Getting to do it on the biggest stage, living in London, playing for Arsenal, it doesn’t get much bigger.",
      "“And this is a club that can not only win the Premier League, they can win the Champions League, they are an incredible team. And there’s a lot of talk about their defensive and midfield play and that they need a striker to score those goals.”",
      "On the Arsenal newbie’s start at the Emirates, he added: “Really good, I think not above expectations but good.",
      "“I think everything will be better when he settles down but he has started every game and they are leading the Premier League and they have faced City, United away, Newcastle away and Liverpool away, not that bad.",
      "“I think if he just does what he’s good at he’ll score many goals there.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand has reacted to claims that Liverpool are “on their knees” after a couple of losses, as he describe one summer signing as doing “alright.”",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Unlikely. Kylian Mbappe is 15 ahead of the Arsenal man.",
      "Arsenal still aren’t ‘100% the best in Europe’ but Arteta’s 2025 nonsense could come true in 2026 if one Gunners star pulls their finger out.",

      "Wayne Rooney has been slammed for propagating a Manchester United conspiracy theory – Djibril Cisse is “not going to take this accusation any longer”.",
      "Cisse was part of the QPR team which faced Manchester City on the final day of the 2011/2012 season, when Roberto Martinez’s side staged a dramatic comeback to win the Premier League title ahead of Manchester United.",
      "United had beaten Sunderland at the Stadium of Light and were ready celebrate with City trailing to QPR in the final stages, but Edin Dzeko’s late equaliser laid the platform for Sergio Aguero to score the most famous goal in Premier League history.",
      "QPR could have been relegated that day but knew they were safe when the late goals were scored, and Rooney has been the spokesperson for the suggestion that the QPR players, including Cisse, were purposefully phoning it in to ensure City would win the title instead of United.",
      "The Red Devils hero has picked out Cisse in particular for criticism as he was seen “celebrating” with city players after the final whistle.",
      "Cisse has had enough and has set the record straight in an interview with FourFourTwo.",
      "He said: “I’m not going to take this accusation any longer. I was celebrating with Samir Nasri.",
      "“I didn’t celebrate with Mario Balotelli, Sergio Aguero or anybody else. I celebrated with my brother, Samir, who had been a friend of mine for 15 years.",
      "“I was happy for my friend and also that we managed to stay up. I don’t care about Man City. My friend finally won the Premier League after many years in England and I was happy for him and also for me. That’s all.”",

      "Cisse had opened the scoring for QPR and  questioned why his side would have fought so hard to take the lead if the plan had been to lose to Manchester City.",
      "Probably to avoid being relegated, but anyway…",
      "He added: “What Rooney said isn’t cool. He took out his frustrations on me. It’s not my fault.",
      "“If we had wanted Man City to win the league, would it not have been a little risky to have waited until the very last minute to let them score?",
      "“We could have let them win 4–0 or 5–0 and gone home. But we played a strong team, the manager wanted to win that game. It wasn’t our reserve team.”",

      "“Not much has happened other than me getting into a good football team,” he said. Ouch.",
      "Hojlund elaborated: “I’ve played a lot and it’s been going really well. I’ve felt fit and sharp. I’ve made sure I was ready, and I did a lot of things off the pitch during my summer break to be ready for the upcoming season.",
      "“I don’t know if there is a difference. In the subconscious, there may be. But I always try to tell myself that I am a good footballer who can always score goals, regardless of whether I haven’t scored in 20 games or I am in the group I am in now.”",
      "Denmark boss Brian Reimer also aimed a sly dig at United in agreeing with the striker.",
      "He said: “The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced. It is more important than which league you play in.”",

      "“There seems to be a trend with Manchester United that as soon as a striker leaves the club, they start scoring goals,” he said. “Rasmus Højlund had a tough time at United but now he has joined Napoli and scored twice in Serie A, including a winner against Genoa recently.",
      "“The same can be said for Marcus Rashford – he joined Aston Villa on loan in January last season and got four goals and six assists in in 11 starts. Now he has joined Barcelona on loan and he’s flying. He already has three goals and five assists in his first 10 games and he scored an amazing goal in the Champions League against Newcastle.",

      "Despite Jim Ratcliffe giving him a three-year stay of execution, Ruben Amorim’s future at United seems shaky at best and there will be no shortage of managers who think they can be the one to change the cursed Old Trafford club.",
      "There’s also no shortage of pundits giving their opinion on who should be next and kicking us off is Paul Scholes, who recently picked incumbent Newcastle boss Eddie Howe for the United gig.",
      "Scholes did not elaborate on his choice but it is not the worst shout in the world – more of that later – with Howe having done well at Bournemouth and now Newcastle.",
      "He also won silverware with their League Cup victory last season but the question is whether he would be able to replicate that success at Old Trafford.",

      "And if Howe can be criticised for no experience at a top European club, that is not an accusation that can be made of Roy Keane’s suggestion.",
      "“I’ve said it for years,” Keane said on The Overlap’s Stick to Football podcast.",
      "“I’d like to see Atletico Madrid, [Diego] Simeone. I’d like to see him go in there.",
      "“I think he would just create havoc, but good havoc. I think he’d rock up to that place and say, ‘This is how you do things.’",
      "“No guarantee, but I’d just like to see his personality, even his track record.”",
      "That track record includes a now 14-year stint at Atleti and it is not an exaggeration to say he has revolutionised the club in that time. While they were once one of Real Madrid’s biggest sources of joy, Simeone turned them into a thorn in both Madrid and Barcelona’s sides.",
      "And while plenty of managers like Mikel Arteta and Gareth Southgate can be praised for reforming a team, Simeone crucially delivered trophies including two league titles.",
      "The question would be whether Simeone can deliver that success elsewhere as he enjoyed enormous freedom at the Wanda Metropolitano, not to mention the biggest paycheque of any manager in the world.",
      "Speaking of Roy Keane, former Spurs midfielder turned talkSPORT host Jamie O’Hara reckons the Irishman should be part of the coaching setup.",
      "“I’m amazed that no one has phoned Roy Keane and said, ‘Can you come in at Man Utd and be part of what we’re doing here?’ because he is arguably Man Utd’s greatest captain,” O’Hara said.",
      "“He is a leader. He’s unbelievable. When you watch him, he’s ferocious, you listen to him, when he walks into a dressing room, you’re going to listen.",
      "“He’s going to lead by example. He’s not going to allow poor standards. I can’t believe Manchester United have not phoned Roy Keane.",
      "“Maybe it’s because he can’t be the manager.",
      "“Maybe it’s because he’s too hot-headed, I don’t know. They want someone in with more tactical nous or whatever.",
      "“How Roy Keane isn’t in there at that football club, in the dressing room, in there every day at the training ground telling them this is the standard, this is what’s Man Utd, this is what we’ve built, this is how we do it… I cannot believe they’ve not done something like that.”",
      "Keane’s managerial record is not quite as glittering as his playing days. While he did guide Sunderland to the Premier League, he did not do the same at his next club Ipswich and went 14 games without a win in his first full year in charge.",
      "By the time he was sacked, Ipswich were 21st in the league in what was Keane’s last managerial role. He has since been an assistant boss to Martin O’Neill at Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and the Irish national team.",
      "Another pundit to put his two cents in is Charlie Austin who put forward two candidates – Zinedine Zidane and, um, Sean Dyche?",
      "Other than being follically challenged, it is hard to see too many similarities between Dyche and the three-time Champions League-winning manager Zidane but Austin believes his former coach could do a job.",
      "“Ultimately, there are a different set of managers that you’ve got to be looking at, because the situation Manchester United are in, I would take Zidane but is he the right man for the job and how we see them, probably not.”",
      "“In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton. For me, he stabilised the club, at least he’s going to put structure in there.",
      "“Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have. I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, ‘he said Sean Dyche’, no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.”",
      "If Dyche is on the more extreme end of the scale, the suggestion put forward by former assistant boss Rene Meulensteen may be more realistic.",
      "“Michael Carrick might be the obvious option if Ruben Amorim is to go,” he told BetVictor.",
      "“Obviously Michael Carrick still knows quite a few players that were there when he was there. So he’s still got some good inside information. He obviously knows the club. He knows what’s expected from the club.",
      "“But the key is that you need to have a guy that obviously has got a clear idea but puts some kind of a structure in place that the players buy into and that you get a spark from the players. Because they’re not bad players, there’s plenty of good players there.",
      "“I’m sure that if they would play in a system that suits them, they really play at their best. I think you could see a fantastic Manchester United. Maybe Michael could well be the guy.",
      "“It’s not magic. It’s common sense more than anything, that’s it and Carrick has got plenty of that.”",

      "“He’s good at talking to the media. He’s got a brilliant playing style, he wants to play good football and dominant football.",
      "“He will calm it down, he will be clear, in that aspect, he would be a brilliant appointment.",
      "“He is very assured of his way, where he wants to go, and his communication skills in communicating with the people around him and the players. He’s very clear in that, and yeah, he gives young players opportunities.",
      "“He’s not afraid to give young players opportunities, and that’s what Man United stands for.”",
      "Hasselbaink is not the only one to suggest Southgate with Peter Crouch backing the man who took England to two European finals.",
      "“He’s gone from a statue to people thinking he’s not good enough for the Man United job. It’s such a fine line in football,” Crouch said.",

      "We’ve done mood rankings. We’ve done manager rankings. But we see now that was only ever building up to this moment. Everything has been leading to this. The Crisis Rankings. Or CRISIS Rankings, because it does feel like this important and serious work merits a tiny bit of panicked ALL CAPS headloss.",
      "It is certainly crisis (CRISIS) season in the Premier League, anyway. That’s not our fault. Nothing we can do about that.",
      "Sure we could do our usual thing of affecting a lofty superiority and pretending it’s all silly tish and daft fipsy. But really we love it. We love clicks just as much as Reach.",
      "And we therefore will proceed to both have our cake by chuckling at the transparency of the collective media attempt to plunge absolutely every team up to and including Arsenal into crisis (and if you don’t believe us, just a reminder that this was the response to them winning a Champions League game 2-0) as the barren wasteland of a dreary international break stretches out endlessly before us all, and also eat said cake by leaning directly into the assorted deliciously stupid and stupidly delicious cracked-badge crisis narratives currently knocking about.",
      "Here, then, are the inaugural F365 Crisis Rankings, ranked from least to most crisis-ridden (which we’re pretty sure you could have worked out for yourselves).",
      "",
      "There absolutely are clubs for whom crisis talk can and does begin when a 19-match, trophy-winning unbeaten run comes to an end via a scrappy late goal at Everton. Crystal Palace are not one of those clubs.",
      "They probably aren’t going to do a Leicester after all. We’ll tell the children etc. but while a bit of a shame it is no crisis.",
      "Still if anything just about as far from crisis as it’s possible to be, at least until they lose two defenders to injury and/or a Glasner-enraging January transfer.",
      "READ: Everton spare Liverpool blushes but not Wirtz’s as huge Crystal Palace weakness laid bare",
      "",
      "A club all too familiar with crisis in recent years but currently well above all that kind of thing, thank you very much. They’ve got themselves a perfect new hero in Jack Grealish and have thus far made the awkward jump to a new ground and new surroundings look pretty straightforward indeed.",
      "Don’t look at all like they’re liable to get themselves into any real bother at all this season. Look far more likely to actually be proper good fun. Long-suffering Everton fans will still have the automatic defence response of expecting the worst at any moment, but honestly guys it’s all absolutely fine here isn’t it? Just enjoy it, would be our advice.",
      "There’s even a decent chance you might get to laugh at Liverpool quite a bit. And that’s been a while.",
      "",
      "Seems deeply quaint now, given the sheer depth and breadth of the assorted CRISIS levels now beleaguering other clubs up and down the country, but if you cast your mind back into the deep, distant past of about a fortnight ago you’ll remember that Arsenal were themselves quite deep in crisis. Because of the handbrake.",
      "Specifically, the handbrake that silly old Mikel Arteta refused to release in games against Liverpool and Manchester City.",
      "Said handbrake has since been released in games against Newcastle and West Ham which, coupled with Liverpool’s own seven-stages-of-crisis descent, has allowed Arsenal to go top of the table.",
      "And now they have every chance of opening up a really tidy lead from some kindly fixtures between the October and November interlulls having had to wade through some distinctly unpleasant games in August and September.",
      "Obviously Arsenal are Arsenal and thus can never be entirely crisis-free. There are two main pillars in the current attempts to paint the current favourites to the win the Premier League and Champions League as still mired in some kind of crisis.",
      "One was the really quite insane response to Arsenal maintaining their 100% Champions League record this season with a 2-0 win over Olympiacos, an event that was covered by our brave press with the kind of gravity normally reserved for the passing of a minor royal.",
      "The other crisis pillar for Arsenal – and this is one that only the winning of actual trophies will quell – is the Arsenally factor. They have a great opportunity here, but what if they just Arsenal it up?",
      "Related to this – a sub-pillar, if you will – is the fact they also really don’t like being called favourites. Because it inevitably invites subsequent accusations of bottling.",
      "And there really is no way out of this maze for Arsenal until, like their near neighbours, they manage to shut the talk down with an actual trophy. Because until then, the ridiculous reality of the noise around this most noise-generating of modern clubs is that the two things that can lead them to crisis town are a) good football results and b) bad football results. And celebrating wrong, obviously. Always with the celebrating wrong.",
      "",
      "We thought there would be a crisis. By rights there should have been a crisis. When you sell four of your back five to assorted big buggers, a crisis seems inevitable.",
      "But Andoni Iraola and Antoine Semenyo have had other ideas. Accepting the inevitable for the defence but holding firm on Semenyo is already looking like inspired pragmatic real-world transfer market realism from the Cherries. There’s a real skill for clubs in their situation in knowing when and where to fold and when to hold.",
      "Iraola still feels like the real genius behind all this, though. Thanking Gary O’Neil for his sterling work in keeping Bournemouth in the Premier League after they’d been Scott Parkered and moving him on to bring in Iraola must now go down as one of the biggest and most significant upgrades made by a member of the ‘Small 14’.",
      "As long as he remains in place, Bournemouth will be fine. Which does invite us to ponder the inevitable problem somewhere down the line. As wiser football minds than ours have opined: it is what it is.",
      "",
      "We are very, very suspicious of this Tottenham start. We’re not actually at all convinced they’re really any good at all, but we also have a sneaking feeling that they may get away with it far more often than not and end up very much in and around the top-four picture despite themselves.",
      "Also wouldn’t really be shocked at all if they’re 11th by the New Year. We’re keeping our options very much open here.",
      "We do think that a summer of upheaval could have ended up much, much worse for Spurs. For all the banterous nature of the Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze pursuits and their humiliating conclusions, Spurs have ended up…okay.",
      "They’ve strengthened the areas they needed to strengthen and without yet being entirely convincing are already reaping the benefits. That Leeds game was an absolutely perfect example of precisely the sort of game they would have wilted and lost last season in the face of a physical and psychological test.",
      "The simple fact that Spurs have won every game in which they’ve led this season is immensely encouraging given how p*ss-poor they were by that metric last year, and while it’s reasonable to ask questions about how precisely they got themselves into the pickles they did against Brighton or Wolves or Bodo/Glimt it must also be acknowledged that they found a way to at least get some of the way back out of them. That is not a trait one immediately associates with Spurs.",
      "Joao Palhinha may provoke grumbling among some Spurs purists for his no-nonsense game but he is exactly the player for which they have been crying out to have in their midfield for some time now. There’s a fight and steel about Spurs now, a willingness and acceptance that sometimes in this league you are going to have to earn your right to play.",
      "That Thomas Frank is also managing to get some decent output from encouraging Palhinha into more forward positions is also good news, suggesting a flexibility and thoughtfulness to both coach and player that is welcome at a club where things can get very dogmatic. We’re still very hopeful that Xavi Simons will eventually get up to the speed of things when given a run of games in a more settled role, and Mohammed Kudus is already looking far more like the season-one West Ham version than season-two.",
      "We’re not quite sure exactly how Spurs have only lost one game this season, but they have, and they’ve got themselves into a tidy position in three competitions. They are still Spurs, they will always be Spurs and they can always go fully and entirely Spurs, but right now there is no crisis here.",
      "",
      "Sunderland will be disappointed not to have come away from Manchester United with something. The very fact this is a sentence you can write with an entirely straight face tells you things are going pretty well for the Black Cats on the back of what looked for all the world like a dangerously premature promotion back to the big league.",
      "But an expert summer of recruitment from a transfer net cast far and wide has given them every chance. At the very, very least they won’t be getting relegated without a damn good fight and that is all one can reasonably ask of unexpected play-off winners when coming into the Premier League, really.",
      "Notable too that all their points have come against the established and settled Premier League set. There is nothing artificial or obviously deceptive about a set of results including wins over West Ham, Brentford and Forest alongside points against Palace and Villa. Those are results that indicate Sunderland are precisely what they currently appear to be: a perfectly capable mid-table Premier League side.",
      "Still a genuinely incredible effort if they can keep that up for another seven months, but now no reason really to think otherwise.",
      "",
      "Not currently in crisis, but definitely still on a crisis watchlist. The summer was hard and unpleasant for Newcastle, dominated as it was in the end by the Isak Saga and the great and at one time potentially never-ending quest for a replacement.",
      "They spent an awful lot of money on Nick Woltemade and it did have about it a whiff of desperation, but Newcastle was a club desperate for a new hero and he already has the look and air and most importantly goals of a man heading for beloved cult status at a place that loves its big number nines. We think everyone loves big number nines, really, but Newcastle definitely love big number nines.",
      "Results are on a general upward trend despite the late p*sser against Arsenal, and the fixture list for the month between October and November interlulls doesn’t look too bad at all either domestically or in the Champions League.",
      "Late November and into December look like potentially choppier waters, though, where keen crisis watchers might just need a close eye on Eddie Howe and the lads.",
      "",
      "We’re old enough to remember when everything was definitely going all 2024/25 after back-to-back defeats against Tottenham and Brighton plunged a new-look Manchester City and their manager into clear crisis territory.",
      "They’ve since escaped that talk for now by not losing any more games, and winning most of them thanks to Erling Haaland scoring quite simply all the goals. We’ve even seen the team and manager that has won six of the last eight Premier League titles described as ‘dark horses’ to make that seven out of nine, which is quite funny given all the information in that sentence and the fact they are currently trailing by three whole points.",
      "Perhaps the speed with which City have proved that all the talk of crisis after a couple of bad results might have been a bit much, and maybe we should learn something from that about the whole idea of deciding who is and isn’t in crisis at such an early stage of the season.",
      "Reader, my friend, we haven’t learned a thing.",
      "",
      "Impressively not in crisis despite losing so much in the summer and taking the high-risk continuity option of entrusting their precious yet deceptively precarious Premier League status to a novice in Keith Andrews.",
      "So far, it’s okay. Better, even. The high points have been very high. Victories over Villa in both league and Carabao, with the best of the lot clearly a thoroughly deserved win over Manchester United. Even managed to get the defeat to Nottingham Forest out of the way early enough for people not to realise how embarrassing that now is.",
      "And, in general, the bad moments – defeats at Fulham and Sunderland as well as Forest have been sufficiently spread out that they don’t command attention. There’s always been another good day round the corner soon enough.",
      "When you’re Brentford, that’s enough. They’re like a Reverse Man United. There, under the spotlight, it takes multiple good results to wash away the effect of the bad, while for Brentford it takes a proper run of bad results for people to forget taking four points off Chelsea and Man United, just as a for instance.",
      "What we still fear is that such a run of bad results really could be just around the corner. It still feels very precarious; they’ve coped admirably with losing the guiding hand of Thomas Frank but it still feels like a club where a minor wobble could become worrying and before you know it, you fear for them, you really do.",
      "December feels like it’s the key month for Brentford given the spread of games they’ve got during that always crucial and busy time. They play Spurs both home and away that month in obviously narrative-heavy games as well as Arsenal away and Bournemouth at home. Throw in a couple of potential six-pointers against Leeds and Wolves and you’ve got the perfect lab conditions for a crisis.",
      "Or you take the optimistic alternative, where the perfect conditions to create a crisis must by definition offer the opportunity to thoroughly dispel the notion altogether.",
      "",
      "A reminder of how restorative a bit of Thursday night Europaball can be for a troubled club. Doesn’t always work and can definitely make things even worse (see Forest, Nottingham) but Villa aren’t the first team who’ve managed to inject a bit of life into a season turning toward the dreary thanks to some Thursday evening respite.",
      "Having failed to win any of their first five Premier League games – failing even to score in the first four of them – and gone out of the Carabao on penalties to Brentford, Villa have now got themselves into a four-match winning run thanks to home league results against Fulham and Burnley to go with a pair of Euro victories.",
      "It’s all feeling much better now than it did a few weeks ago, when it really did feel like we were approaching the end of a bold, often brilliant, but ultimately doomed attempt to re-insert Villa into the elite of English and European football.",
      "We’re still quite a long way from last season’s Icarus-like highs as they soared so close to the sun on wings fashioned from unsustainable wages, but it’s a lot better than it was after failing to hold on to a lead against 10-man Sunderland.",
      "We also very much reserve the right to reassess this reassessing of Villa’s Crisis Levels at the next international break, because they have perhaps the most troubling run of intra-interlull games of anyone. Their four league games in that time are all against teams currently in the top five: Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "Already shaping up to be their magnificent scampish big-boy-bothering selves this season. They’ve taken seven points from three games against Man City, Tottenham and Chelsea, and two points from four games against Fulham, Everton, Bournemouth and Wolves.",
      "That remains in the ‘irritating’ rather than ‘crisis’ territory for now, but isn’t a trend you want to deepen too carelessly in what looks like being a particularly competitive season for those who’ve grown accustomed to easy and comfortable survival in the last couple of straight up, straight down seasons for promoted clubs.",
      "We would very much like to see them continue their policy of winning Carabao games 6-0 away from home when they travel to Arsenal in the next round. Sure, some people might contend that winning 6-0 at Arsenal is harder than doing so at Oxford or Barnsley but as far as we’re concerned that’s loser talk. Aim high, always. Especially when you’re Brighton and as a general rule apparently prefer playing good teams.",
      "",
      "Feels like Leeds were very close to serious crisis levels after botching the last days and hours of the transfer window, leaving themselves pretty short of attacking weaponry and prompting plenty of chat that a decent shot at survival had been squandered.",
      "They’re doing perfectly well, though, and have even started scoring goals. Since being ultimately outclassed at Arsenal – which is fair enough – they’ve been competitive with everyone and while their games against Newcastle, Bournemouth and Spurs may only have yielded two points in total they all showed that Leeds are perfectly capable of mixing it with decent teams.",
      "It certainly doesn’t feel particularly crisis-y right now, even if Bournemouth’s last-gasp equaliser and the lack of reward for a very decent performance against Spurs are a bit annoying.",
      "There is, though, perhaps no club outside the Big Six that faces a more defining period between these two upcoming international breaks. Leeds already occupy an unusual space in that their size as a club doesn’t quite tally with their status as a newly-promoted team, but it’s a fascinating run of games they’ve got coming up over the next five weeks or so.",
      "Before we all take another unwanted rest for the November break, Leeds will face Burnley, West Ham, Brighton and Nottingham Forest. That is a set of fixtures to conjure with. It screams crisitunity. These are all games that should sit pretty high on target fixtures in Leeds’ survival roadmap, given what we’ve seen from all of them so far.",
      "But at the same time three of those games are away from Elland Road. A month from now we could be looking at Leeds sitting loftily and confidently clear of the squabbling and bickering down at the bottom. Or if things haven’t gone quite to plan they could be right in there getting filthy with the rest of them.",
      "",
      "Almost impressive to be a London club and attract as little attention as Fulham. It can work both way but currently means that the only real response to successive 3-1 defeats at Aston Villa and Bournemouth has been to note that Marco Silva looked magnificent standing in the south-coast rain.",
      "No crisis. Might just be the beginnings of one after they’ve played Arsenal and Newcastle, though.",
      "",
      "A keen example of how finely balanced the see-saw can be between crisis and not-crisis. There’s no doubt that, overall, Chelsea’s results have been inadequate given all that talk in the summer – mainly from us, sure – that they ought to be title contenders now.",
      "But also… they absolutely should be title contenders, shouldn’t they? Enzo Maresca can’t keep playing the “Little old us? Title challengers, aw shucks!” when they’ve spent the GDP of a small nation on wingers and Brighton players over the last few years.",
      "Chelsea’s defeats have been eye-catchingly bad. Outclassed by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, mugged off again by Brighton late on in the Premier League and – most shaming of all – managing out-stupid Manchester United at Old Trafford. A feat of such crisis-inducing magnitude it’s almost impressive.",
      "They also made uncomfortably hard work of negotiating Lincoln in the Carabao. They also did all those things in the space of four consecutive games.",
      "They are, in short, neither the first nor surely last Big Six club to find themselves grateful that whatever daft things they might be getting up to are being overshadowed to some degree by the dafter things Manchester United are getting up to.",
      "And the response to that run of a win that felt like a defeat and three defeats that felt like… even worse defeats has been undeniably impressive. Survived a meeting with the Special One in the Champions League and then of course lessened their own crisis ratings while deepening Liverpool’s on Saturday evening.",
      "They’ve nudged clear of the deepest crisis alerts but certainly aren’t out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "It is perhaps an indicator of just how low the bar has become for promoted teams now that four points from seven games, with the only win against another promoted club, isn’t drawing more attention towards Scott Parker and his team.",
      "In fairness, it’s also because Burnley did have an undeniably horrible start. Four of those seven games have been against members of the Big Six. And while all have been lost and two of them – against Spurs and City – heavily, there were huge reasons for encouragement amidst the agony of going down to late, late penalties against both Man United and Liverpool.",
      "So no crisis yet, but if they don’t register a win in one of their next two games against Leeds and Wolves it will be an uncomfortably antsy and potentially bottom-three-marooned team that welcomes Arsenal to Turf Moor early next month.",
      "",
      "Looks a lot like a crisis right now, sure, but we’re not worried. Wolves do this a lot. It’s a crisis for Vitor Pereira, definitely, because he might have to be sacrificed, but Wolves making a terrible start to the season and then ending up 14th in May after taking 30 points in the second half of the season and saying ‘What were you worried about?’",
      "They’ll be fine, but Pereira might unfortunately have to play his part by being unceremoniously sacked when they’re six points adrift of safety in mid-December.",
      "Sergio Conceicao, if you’re interested, is our pick as the man to steer Wolves to safety in impressive style, prompting confidence of a much better campaign in 25/26, only to sit 19th after losing eight of their first 10 games and having to be replaced by someone else to continue a perpetual cycle that will outlast us all.",
      "",
      "What a crash course in Barclays that is for Arne Slot, by the way. Hailed as a calm and quiet genius for delivering the title with a settled squad in his first season. Pretty much handed a second title after winning five games on the trot at the start of his second season.",
      "And now, after an admittedly quite ropey fortnight that has seen Liverpool plummet from the very summit of the Premier League all the way down to second place and one whole point behind the new leaders, he is as bald and fraudulent as any Premier League manager has ever been. And those are some high levels of bald fraudulence.",
      "His tactics are being questioned. His selections, his signings – even though they aren’t really his signings – his substitutions. Everything.",
      "The man who delivered only Liverpool’s second league title since the invention of football, and who was pretty much being handed a second by a league apparently collectively bending the knee just two weeks ago, now finds himself level with Scott Parker in the Sack Race.",
      "Of course the CRISIS talk around Liverpool is completely insane. But perhaps only Arsenal can rival Liverpool when it comes to a completely unhinged, overwrought and overplayed narrative. The good times are always the very best ever, but that means the lows are met with the same levels of wild overreaction.",
      "Still, though. Definitely feels true that something’s not quite right here, doesn’t it? Definitely not a Liverpool – or Slot – with the same quiet unfussed equilibrium that steered them so calmly through last season. We’re perhaps all already guilty of forgetting both how easily Liverpool won the title and how unexpected that actually was at the start of the season and based on the club’s Premier League history.",
      "They were so good, so quickly under Slot that it became normalised and perhaps even underappreciated.",
      "But that calm authority hasn’t been there this season. There’s been a madcap, desperate nature to Liverpool’s performances that was every bit as much present in their late wins as it has been in their late defeats.",
      "The late goals that have swung so many Liverpool games all bore the Hallmark of Champions™ when going in at the right end, so it’s only fair to ask what they have now they’ve started going in at the other.",
      "Of course, once again, we’re in territory where both are overplayed.",
      "But we nevertheless find ourselves already building up for what suddenly looks like an epic Liverpool-Man United clash on the other side of the international break, one where the loser will be unavoidably and inevitably plunged into a deep and lasting crisis.",
      "Is it accurate, fair, funny or clever to call that game El Crisico? Absolutely not. Is there even the slightest chance that will stop us? Absolutely not.",
      "",
      "Things will, one suspects, eventually calm down a bit under Nuno Espirito Santo but it’s a smaller, quieter, reduced West Ham now, ambition and joy squeezed and squashed into a grim fight for perpetual Premier League survival where there is no greater or larger long-term purpose.",
      "Maybe they’ll have the odd cup run. Maybe another season in Europe here or there. But it all just feels colourless and drab. They’re still in crisis, but it’s a boring and bland crisis. West Ham don’t even get entertaining crises now.",
      "Just all very dispiriting. And worst of all, ceding everything they stand for in the name of drab, colourless survival and the growing apathy of the fans inside their drab, colourless bowl of a stadium might not even work.",
      "The crisis might yet become very colourful indeed.",
      "",
      "You better believe that’s a crisis. It’s been an absolute masterclass in crisis creation, an almost entirely self-created and self-inflicted crisis full of dick-swinging and egos and very stupid men doing very stupid things for very stupid reasons.",
      "Even if you accept the shaky premise that Nuno was developing ideas above his station and getting too argumentative with the all-powerful transfer guru Edu, then deciding to replace him during the season with about the single most philosophically diverging manager imaginable was and remains a choice.",
      "It has now reached a point where sacking that manager after seven winless games might actually be less of a mad piece of behaviour than appointing him in the first place.",
      "And while the sheer speed and scale of the unravelling might be graver than expected, it can’t really be claimed with any real credibility by anyone involved that this sort of outcome was not just possible but probable. Sure, maybe seven months felt more likely than seven weeks, but it just never looked like it could or should work.",
      "If it didn’t work at Spurs with the squad profile they possessed – and in the Premier League, for about a year and a half, it very much did not work – how was it ever going to succeed for Forest’s squad with no time to adapt or adjust.",
      "To their credit, the players really seem to have bought into it. There are no tools being downed here, and it’s further evidence of just how beguiling and inspiring a speaker Ange Postecoglou is. We remain entirely convinced that he can propel people to achieve things they never thought possible. He got Spurs players to win a f*cking trophy, for crying out loud.",
      "But we’re just not at all convinced he can be a consistently successful Premier League football manager, and a club without the insulating protection provided by Big Six status – which still might not have been enough for Spurs in a more routine Premier League season without three catastrophically ill-equipped promoted sides – taking a gamble on him was just thoroughly reckless.",
      "What might save him for a while is a truly joyless and uninspiring list of potential replacements, but that’s of no use to Forest fans right now. Graham Potter being the latest name linked provokes a very different reaction now than it would have a few years ago. Brutal game, football.",
      "",
      "Of course they are in crisis. They have been pretty much permanently in crisis since Sir Alex Ferguson left, and he is, in his own way, one of the men most responsible for the fact that nobody else can match the impossible standards that became the norm across two ludicrous decades.",
      "The question with United, one that most clubs don’t need to ask but that even those who do can concoct a plausible answer, is not “Are Man United in crisis?” But “How do Man United get out of their crisis?”",
      "We genuinely don’t know what that would even look like any more. A non-crisis Manchester United. They’ve tried new players. They’ve tried new managers. They’ve tried new owners. If anything, it always just somehow gets worse. Despite that often appearing to be literally impossible.",
      "It’s still less than a year, for instance, since Erik Ten Hag’s embarrassing banter reign that was saved by outplaying and beating a peak Man City side to win the FA Cup after an eighth-place finish was seen as the lowest United could possibly, imaginably sink. By the time of his long-inevitable departure it was widely agreed that this was surely United’s nadir.",
      "Roll on 11 months and they’re ‘turning a corner’ by beating Sunderland at home to climb to 10th.",
      "It might be an impossible task to ever get Manchester United back to those outrageous levels of dominance and success they enjoyed during the 90s and 00s, but with every attempt to relocate that spark they just drift further and further from it.",
      "So you end up with a situation where United become the perfect storm. As the biggest club in the country it already takes far less for them to be in crisis than it does for Joe Mid-Table-Battler or Johnny Yo-Yo-Club, yet they have also contrived to be actually bad enough to constitute crisis at any of those clubs as well.",
      "In essence they are deeper down the crisis well than any other club you care to name, yet because TIMUFCWTA they also have much further to climb to escape it any way. We don’t know what a solution might even look like.",
      "But what we can say with some confidence is that it doesn’t look like Ruben Amorim. We really did think it might for a while there. He has the requisite charm and charisma to pull off the performance aspect of being Manchester United Manager. But while you can’t succeed in this job without that, it still isn’t enough on its own.",
      "It’s far more symptom than cause of Manchester United’s ongoing crisis status, but this continued inability to string two wins together is a great bit. It was a running joke during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s time that every month or so United would turn a corner down yet another cul-de-sac, but Amorim has perfected.",
      "The list of terrible Premier League managers who have managed to win two games in a row at least once is a hilarious one, and the fact Amorim talked openly about it before the botched chance at Brentford is revealing in itself.",
      "While the record is specifically around league games, it also highlights just how damaging United’s failure to a) qualify for Europe and then b) avoid total Carabao catastrophe at Grimsby has been.",
      "Because their near total lack of midweek football just gives no chance for any forward momentum to develop while allowing whatever the latest setback might be to moulder and fester for an entire week. United are definitely in their own heads to an uncomfortable degree on this ‘two wins’ thing.",
      "And it also means less chance of some easier games to help things along. You only have to look at Villa right now to see how even a bit of Thursday night Euroball can help change the mood.",
      "United don’t have that option. They don’t have any option. For this once-mighty club, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no end to the tunnel.",

      "If Ruben Amorim was expecting to hear from Sir Jim Ratcliffe during the current international break, he would have feared something rather bleaker than this…",
      "“Ruben is a good guy.” the United part-owner told The Business podcast. “He has not had the best of seasons. But he needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.”",
      "Compared to what Amorim might have expected post-Brentford, that’s a hug and squeeze. But the United boss will recognise lip-service by now. Three weeks, not three years, is the worry that will deprive him of yet more sleep while many of his players are doing their national service.",
      "Amorim is living international break to international break right now. He spared himself prior to the last one with a 97th-minute home win over Burnley in the wake of Grimsby-gate. In this latest three-week audition for his own job, Amorim won two, lost two, the odd signs of encouragement mixed with some familiar failings.",
      "United disproved little of what we already know of them, swaying no-one from the firmly entrenched positions they already held, leaving Amorim and Ratcliffe to kick the can down Sir Matt Busby Way a little longer until the one-year anniversary of his appointment draws nearer.",
      "That milestone is more of worry for Amorim than a cause for celebration. Reports suggest United will be liable for a much smaller pay-off if they wait 12 months before sacking another manager. Amid Ratcliffe’s quest to make United the most profitable circus football club in the world, every million quid counts.",
      "For Amorim, there is little respite to be found in the fixture list. Like the last four-game block, United will face two of the big six, Liverpool and Tottenham away, with Brighton at Old Trafford and a possible El Sackico at Forest in between. Three away trips is hardly ideal when United’s form on the road is so poor.",
      "Where is the bar for Amorim? Will six points keep him in a job again?",
      "Liverpool have been poor – are they the crisis club? – but surely not so sloppy as to let United win at Anfield for the first time in almost a decade. As Paul Scholes said, a point would be very nice, ta.",
      "Brighton at home. Sheesh. The Seagulls have had United on strings in recent seasons. The Red Devils might have won their last three at Old Trafford but so have Brighton. United have lost seven of the last eight meetings. Three points will be the expectation of Amorim at the Amex North, but none of us could be surprised if United are left looking to make up points elsewhere.",
      "Maybe at Forest? A year to the day since he was appointed, Amorim will go to the City Ground to face a manager for whom beating United in a European final was not enough to keep his job at Tottenham. Forest, perhaps breezier for also sacking Ange Postecoglou by then, could inflict a third defeat on Amorim on the very day it becomes cheaper to sack him.",
      "Should Amorim reach Tottenham before the next international break, there Ratcliffe could see for himself the positive impact of replacing a dogmatic manager with a pragmatist.",
      "MORE: Man Utd isn’t just a CRISIS club – it’s a CRISIS club in CRISIS purgatory with no means of escape",
      "If there is a dour tinge to the context above, that’s because pessimism prevails at Old Trafford these days. That six points might be seen as a creditable haul when This Is Manchester United Football Club We Are Talking About tells its own story. Whether half the available points will be enough to save him once more, only Ratcliffe and his cronies can decide.",
      "Whatever verdict they reach, it ought to be with a view beyond the next convenient sacking window. There are many reasons why the mess United find themselves in is not Amorim’s fault, just as there are plenty that make it true that, so far, he has not done enough to turn the Reds around. Ratcliffe, Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada; if they see a clearer picture than the “knee jerk reactions of journalists who go off on one every week”, then enlighten us and be decisive.",
      "Sack Amorim, or back him more decisively than telling the world he’s a nice bloke.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe could be “forced” to sack Ruben Amorim over results despite his claim that he’s ready to give him three years.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe mentioned Arsenal's faith in Mikel Arteta when saying he would like to give Ruben Amorim three years at Man Utd, but how does his record in his first 50 games in charge compare? Have your say in our poll",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",

      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",

      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",

      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",

      "\"There's too many defeats, the record's too poor so I don't think anybody will be celebrating too much tonight at Manchester United but I think they'll be relieved that there is a victory which allows a little bit of peace going into the international break.",
      "\"Manchester United win the odd game but that's nowhere near enough. I don't think anybody would be kidded on by the fact that Manchester United beat Sunderland at home. The fact that it was even in doubt before the game is probably the problem in itself.\"",
      "Amorim said ahead of the game that he is convinced criticism from within the media is affecting his players and their confidence in his much-maligned 3-4-3 system. He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me. So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys when you say the problem of our team is the system.\"",
      "That view was put to Neville, who hit back.",

      "\"They've been hopeless in the system. If it's not the system, then the players are a problem, the manager is a problem, the whole thing's a problem if you're losing football matches to the level that they've been doing.",
      "\"I never blamed anybody else when we lost football matches and I played in a dressing room that when you lost football matches you came in and you said sorry. There was accountability. Why would you blame other people. I've not got any time for excuse mentality shortcuts blaming other people - it's the worst thing that you can do in life.",
      "\"I think they just need to concentrate on doing their jobs and doing it well and winning football matches. The only thing that's going to shut anybody up is winning football matches and they've not won anywhere near enough.\"",

      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."
