      "Arne Slot accepts Liverpool are favourites for the Premier League title - but insists it shouldn’t be about the money they’ve spent.",
      "The Reds have splashed the cash this summer with their spending nearly reaching £300m and more to come. But the defending champions have raised almost £150m so far in player sales with further departures in the coming days and weeks before the window slams shut.",
      "The Liverpool boss said: “If you won it last season it's quite normal that you are part of the favourites again for next season. For me it would not be normal if it's about spending, because the net spend of us compared to the other teams is not in our favour, if you look at the last two seasons. But it's completely normal that we are one of the favourites, because we won it last season. And we brought in good players, like all the other ones did, by the way.”",
      "Liverpool only spent £10m last summer on Federico Chiesa while they earned more in outgoings. They’re set to smash the British transfer record with a £116m deal for Florian Wirtz while Alexander Isak would cost £120m at least to get from Newcastle this summer.",
      "Arsenal have spent close to £200m this summer and brought in just £9m while Manchester United's move for Benjamin Sesko will take their spending to the £200m mark with no money yet from outgoings. Manchester City have spent £151m in the summer but also splashed out in January and have made £42m this window. While Chelsea have also spent over £200m but raised over £100m as well.",
      "Slot added: “This is the Premier League, this is what makes this league so nice. I think there's only been one exception [who didn’t spend big] in the last two, three, four, five, six years, and that's been Liverpool last season.",
      "“Sunderland is spending money as if they... They have a lot of money, of course, because they're promoted. So that is what happens in the Premier League, that's why it is such a nice league.",
      "“So if we are only favourites because we've spent a bit, I would see that as weird, because we've lost a lot as well. But that we are favourites because we won it last season and we played so well, that's clear. And the ambitions haven't changed, because the ambition of this club is always to compete for every trophy.",
      "“So that hasn't changed compared to last season. Not because we lost players and not because we brought players in. The ambitions are always the same at this club.”",
      "Slot remained tight-lipped on the pursuit of Isak and the potential of an attacker coming in but they are ready to spend big if the Newcastle striker is available while a defender is also on the cards.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho wants Chelsea and Chelsea want Alejandro Garnacho. But whether he’s the next member of Manchester United's ‘bomb squad’ to depart remains in question.",
      "Of the five players Ruben Amorim pushed away from United’s first-team this summer was they expressed a desire to leave, only Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford has gone. Garnacho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho - ironically back in Manchester after Chelsea decided to pay a fine to cancel their summer transfer obligation - all remain in situ.",
      "Argentina international Garnacho looks the man most likely to be next through the exit door however. A regular under Ruben Amorim since his arrival, his talent isn’t in question, but the Portuguese has had enough of his attitude and the drama that comes with the 21 year-old.",
      "\"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” Amorim said earlier in the summer. His post-match comments after only being a substitute in the Europa League final were the final straw however.",
      "“I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that,” added Amorim. “So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection. Other times you want a new challenge.\"",
      "Chelsea believe that Garnacho, not taken on United’s pre-season tour of the US, can shine for them in the Premier League. Garnacho believes that too.",
      "He is desperate to move to Stamford Bridge and has already agreed personal terms over a switch to west London.",
      "The question is whether Chelsea will meet United’s £50m price tag. That’s considerably lower than the £80m the Red Devils were asking for in January when Napoli came calling, but positions have changed; United are, clearly, no longer so keen to keep him while Napoli instead moved on Noa Lang.",
      "Plus, United could do with bringing in some money having spent over £200m on their new-look attack of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Chelsea are keen to get a deal done as soon as possible, but still want to pay less than that. United have so far insisted that’s the price. Take it or leave it.",
      "Thus, Garnacho continues to train in red - away from United’s first-team - rather than in blue as Chelsea’s latest shiny new acquisition.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe believes Manchester United now have a “world-class facility” following the £50m transformation of the club's training ground - befitting a brand that \"stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.\"",
      "The Red Devils have called Carrington home since January 2000, when they left their longstanding base, The Cliff, to move into a facility that cost £14.3m to build at the time. The training ground has undergone renovations over the past 25 years but had fallen behind many Premier League clubs, leading United to announce plans to turn it into a state-of-the-art complex last June.",
      "The renovation work was completed during the 2024-25 season and Ruben Amorim’s squad moved into the men’s first team building this week having returned from their pre-season tour of the United States. Ratcliffe’s $300m (£236.7m at the time of the agreement) infrastructure investment as part of the deal to become minority owner funded a project that he believes will help United in their fight to return to the top.",
      "“This is one of the most recognised brands in the world,” the United co-owner said during a ceremony in which he cut a red ribbon in front of the first-team squad, club leadership and staff. “It stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.",
      "“The club has to compete at the highest level that is appropriate to the size and history of the club. While a world-class training facility won’t take us to that position alone, it is one of the key ingredients in the modern facility. Now we have one.",
      "“When I first came to Carrington two years ago, we had a presentation here. It was clear then. It is an excellent facility. It was (leading edge) I am sure in 2000 but 25 years later it wasn’t at quite at the level it needed to be for one of the top four or five clubs in the world.",
      "“It was the first big decision when we arrived in the first quarter of 2024, to invest in this training facility. There were lots of naysayers, who said ‘that won’t be done in 12 months’…but I am pleased to say the project has come in on budget and on time.”",
      "Foster + Partners – also appointed last September to develop a masterplan for the Old Trafford stadium district – led the biggest upgrade to Carrington since it opened at the turn of the millennium. The club say it has been “designed to inspire collaboration, innovation and excellence”, with top-tier equipment and technology throughout a building that is light and open.",
      "Reflecting on the old building, Ratcliffe said: “Downstairs, there weren’t many windows on the ground floor. It felt like you were in a hospital in the basement. It was a slightly gloomy place, a gloomy rabbit warren. Now it is open, fresh, quite modern. It encourages interaction. That is what we needed.”",
      "The medical areas have been vastly improved and players’ wellbeing has been at the forefront of the plans, which has even included a barbers being built next to the restaurant.",
      "Chief operating officer Collette Roche, who led the project, said: “I’m really, really proud of the team. As you know, with any project, it’s complex, and we’ve had to work in an environment while there’s lots of things going on in the background, lots of change in the club, and also make sure that we kept everything running.",
      "“So, it’s been fantastic, on budget and on time and I think it just proves, for me, if you do a project of this size and scale, and you involve people, and you plan it in the right way, just how amazing and transformative it can be.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United could turn to much cheaper alternatives if they are ultimately priced out of a move for Carlos Baleba. The Brighton midfielder has emerged as a potential target for Ruben Amorim, who is keen to strengthen his midfield ahead of his first full season at the helm.",
      "United have reportedly made contact with the Seagulls, who could ask for around £100m for Baleba, as he still has three years remaining on his contract. United are believed to value him at closer to £70m, and it's been suggested that Baleba might request Brighton to reduce their asking price.",
      "If any deal were to happen, though, United would need to offload further players to help boost their spending power.",
      "To add further intrigue, Manchester City are also believed to be monitoring Baleba, who cost Brighton £23.2m when they signed him from Lille in 2023. If City don’t swoop in, United could decide to wait until a later transfer window, by which time Brighton’s asking price may have dropped.",
      "But if Amorim determines that he needs midfield reinforcements before the September 1 deadline, here are some other, cheaper alternatives…",
      "Monaco’s highly-rated 21-year-old, who has previously been linked with Tottenham, could be an option. An asking price of around the £53m mark – almost half of what it could cost to sign Baleba – has been reported.",
      "Camara has already impressed at an English ground, starring for Senegal during their 3-1 friendly victory over England at the City Ground. Suited to the pressing game Amorim wants to play, Camara is adept at both stopping and starting attacks.",
      "There are a number of other cheaper options United could turn to, including Middlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney, 22. Having played under former United midfielder Michael Carrick, who was sacked by Boro earlier this summer, Hackney knows how to look after the ball.",
      "He also does an excellent job out of possession too, with the ability to cover a lot of ground. Having not played in the Premier League, he would be one for the future, but could be a very wise investment.",
      "It seems a matter of of time before Agoume finds himself in the Premier League, with Arsenal believed to hold an interest in the Sevilla middleman.",
      "The 23-year-old starred for France at the recent European Under-21 Championship, his final age-group tournament. He will now be looking to take his game to the next level for both club and country.",
      "A lofty, combative midfielder, Agoume doesn’t take any prisoners, which could be just what Amorim’s midfield needs. He’s not lacking technically either and is capable of swashbuckling runs forward.",
      "A more unlikely target compared to the aforementioned trio but Wharton could still be a cheaper option than Baleba. The England midfielder was linked with Liverpool earlier this summer, with a fee of £75-80m mooted.",
      "Contracted to Palace until 2029 and with no release clause, the FA Cup winners are in a mightily strong position when it comes to one of their prized assets. However, given his immense quality, interest in him is sure to grow. United should be keeping tabs on his situation.",

At the time of writing, United are yet to confirm Sesko’s switch to Old Trafford - but an announcement is not far off. It's expected the 22-year-old will officially be unveiled in front of fans ahead of the club’s pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",

      "Chelsea and Liverpool are not actively being linked with the midfielder, but have shown interest in him in the past. United are thought to be Baleba's biggest admirers considering a deal this summer, though the club are aware that agreeing a transfer for him will be incredibly difficult.",
      "Baleba joined Brighton from Lille in the summer of 2023 as part of a £23.m deal. Fast forward two years, and Fabian Hurzeler's side are reportedly hoping to fetch almost four times that amount if they're to part ways with the player this summer.",
      "It seems highly unlikely Ruben Amorim's side will be able to compete for Baleba's signature this summer on the current terms. United have agreed a £74m deal to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, which would take their summer spending to just north of £200m, and have already ruled out using Toby Collyer in a swap deal to save them some money up front.",
      "Liverpool, meanwhile, appear unlikely to move for a new midfielder after the quartet of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Dzobozslai, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones helped fire them to Premier League glory last season. They've also got Stefan Bajcetic back following his loan at Las Palmas, though reports suggest a loan move to Celtic could be in the offing.",
      "As for Chelsea, their midfield also appears settled as the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia look set to rule the roost. The Blues were also hit with £78.5m in UEFA fines, £51m of which is suspended, just last month for failing to comply with spending restrictions.",
      "Worryingly for United, that could leave City in the best position to meet Brighton's demands and sign Baleba this summer. Pep Guardiola already recruited £46m Tijjani Reijnders to replace Kevin De Bruyne, though City's summer spending has been relatively modest compared to some rivals, while Brighton are said to be extremely reluctant to cash in on him at the moment.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Dimitar Berbatov believes Benjamin Sesko's arrival at Manchester United provides the competition Ruben Amorim should desire with Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish striker endured a lacklustre season with the Red Devils last term, scoring just four Premier League goals.",
      "As a result, Ruben Amorim has wasted very little time in bolstering his front line this summer, securing the services of Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5million move, and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a package worth up to £71m. However, it now appears as though United will see RB Leipzig sensation Sesko also join the ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "The 22-year-old has been a highly sought-after prospect this summer as a result of impressing in the Bundesliga, with the Red Devils and Newcastle United embroiled in a tug-of-war for his signature. And it now appears as though United have walked away victorious in their pursuit, with Sesko landing in the UK for a medical on Friday after a deal totalling £73.7m was agreed.",
      "And as a result, Hojlund will now have stiff competition for his place. It's something that Berbatov, who scored 56 goals and provided 27 assists during his time under Sir Alex Ferguson between 2008 and 2012, believes may allow the youngster to flourish if he adopts the right mentality.",
      "\"I watched how they moved, how they bullied defenders, how they scored goals, but then going to the Premier League, they found it difficult to adjust. And the stats speak for themselves, right? Three goals, four goals, for a striker you are going to be disappointed with yourself.",
      "\"So it's not easy, and is it the speed? Is it the new team? Is it the new environment? Is it most of the time the expectation people put on you because when you are number nine of United, you need to score goals, you need to perform, this is your job, this is your job description.",
      "\"Of course, there is so much more to being number nine. Dropping down deep, getting the ball, then releasing your team-mates. Running of course, defending when you need to defend, release the spaces for the other team-mates. It's a lot more to [being a] number nine these days, but ultimately it's about the goals you score.",
      "\"It was difficult campaign for them and it's a difficult period that they are going through, and now with another striker coming in, of course the competition is going to be high. When you buy a striker now you start to think, 'Well am I going to play? Is my place in United? Am I still belonging here? Do I need to start looking for a club?'",
      "\"Or maybe then you start thinking, 'Alright, I like the competition. Now I'm going to show you. Now I'm going to fight for my place. Now I'm going to bring the fire.'",
      "\"So it's a two-way scenario. You choose the one I said or the other. So let's see what they are going to bring to the table as well.\" Berbatov also explained that Amorim must make Hojlund feel wanted and valued should he hope to get the best out of him in the future, and that competition could turn out to be positive for the youngster.",
      "He added: \"You always want the competition, but at the same time, as a striker, because we think we're special, you need to feel welcome and wanted in the team, by the coach, by everybody.",
      "\"Then your motivation is going to be higher and your self-esteem is going to be higher. It's a lot of factors. It's not easy, but it's all in the head.\"",
      "For that to happen, Amorim would need to block any incoming transfer interest for Hojlund as the summer transfer window starts to draw to a close. At present, United are willing to let Hojlund part ways with Old Trafford for around £30m, despite the striker insisting that he wants to stay and fight for his place.",
      "With Hojlund already on Berbatov's way of thinking, it's up to Amorim to change the board's stance on the player to see if healthy competition truly allows him to flourish in a fresh season. However, it now appears AC Milan are set to approach the Red Devils to take him to the San Siro on loan for the new season.",
      "A change of scenery could also, of course, help benefit Hojlund as he looks to find his footing again, especially since he has previously excelled in Serie A. The youngster scored 10 goals in 34 appearances for Atalanta before United signed him in a £72m deal back in 2023, and a temporary move to Milan could allow him to develop his game and return stronger than before next year.",

      "Manchester United skipper Bruno Fernandes has congratulated former team-mate Scott McTominay for his Ballon d'Or nomination. Fernandes, 30, was not included in the exclusive list after United's poor campaign last season.",
      "The best part of a year ago, McTominay parted ways with the Red Devils to move to Napoli. He instantly adapted to life in Serie A and quickly made a big impression on Antonio Conte.",
      "The Scot ended the campaign with 13 goals and six assists in 36 appearances in all competitions, as Napoli stormed to the Scudetto. His stellar performances earned him a place him among the elite of world football.",
      "He will be competing for the prize alongside Treble-winning Paris Saint-Germain star Ousmane Dembele, 17-year-old Barcelona sensation Lamine Yamal, ex-Leeds United star Raphinha, and many other top talents.",
      "McTominay's exit at United was orchestrated by ex-boss Erik ten Hag as part of a strategy to raise funds for a new central midfielder. United made a tidy sum of £25.7m in pure profit from the sale of the Scottish international.",
      "That was put towards the signing of Manuel Ugarte, who arrived from PSG for £42.1m with potential add-ons of £8.4m, but the sale of McTominay now looks like a big error of judgement.",
      "Despite missing out on the nomination, Fernandes showed his class by posting a personal congratulations to McTominay.",
      "He uploaded a post from the official Ballon d'Or Instagram account with the caption: \"Buzzing for you my friend.\"",
      "McTominay is set to find out where he ranks among the world's best at the 69th Ballon d'Or ceremony, scheduled for September 22 at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.",
      "Despite his exit from Old Trafford, McTominay, during a recent interview at Wimbledon, showed no animosity to his former side.",
      "He said: \"I always want the absolute best for Manchester United, it's been my life for 22-23 years. For me, I wish the club all the success in the world and I'll be with them every step of the way. I want them to do well.\"",
      "In another interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, he admitted his move to Naples was a huge step in his career and life. He said: \"It gives you more mental strength. I've always lived very close to my mum, so I could go whenever I wanted.",
      "\"Now I live 1,500 miles away so I can't just go home and see my mum, my family, my sister and my kids so it's different. But in life you sometimes have to take yourself out of your comfort zone and I've always prided myself on that.",
      "\"I would never want to be in my comfort zone, and if I can go away anywhere and establish myself and do well, why not? Who's to stop me doing that?\"",
      "While McTominay won Serie A, United endured a miserable campaign which saw them finish 15th. Their one chance of redemption in the Europa League also saw them lose 1-0 in the final to Tottenham Hotspur, ruling out any chance of them qualifying for Europe.",

      "Chelsea have moved one step closer to landing Alejandro Garnacho. The Blues are understood to have agreed terms with the Manchester United winger, though they have yet to find common ground with United on a transfer fee.",
      "Garnacho is out of favour at Old Trafford, with Ruben Amorim adding Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to his attacking options after falling out with his No.17. The Argentine was left at home while the Red Devils went to the United States for pre-season, with the expectation being that he will leave before deadline day.",
      "Garnacho is desperate to move to Stamford Bridge, having made Chelsea his first choice this summer and the 21-year-old has agreed personal terms. However, it will of course count for nothing without an agreement on the fee.",
      "United's asking price of £50m appears to be too steep for the Blues at the time of writing. There had been suggestions the Red Devils might pursue a part-exchange deal involving Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson, but their move for Benjamin Sesko appears to have put an end to those conversations.",
      "The asking price is lower than in January, when Chelsea and Napoli were both keen on Garnacho. Since then, though, the winger's stock has fallen as it has become clear Amorim doesn't see him as a regular starter.",
      "\"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” Amorim said earlier in the summer. \"But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that. So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection. Other times you want a new challenge.\"",
      "United have already offloaded one other member of their so-called 'bomb squad', with Marcus Rashford joining Barcelona on a season-long loan. The England international could move to Camp Nou permanently if he impresses during the campaign, with Barca holding an option.",
      "The club still hope to offload Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia after the trio ended last season out on loan. Real Betis remain keen on keeping Antony in Seville after he impressed there last term, while Sancho has attracted interest from Serie A despite Chelsea opting against a permanent swoop following a year on loan at Stamford Bridge.",
      "United will play their final pre-season friendly at home to Fiorentina on Saturday before beginning their Premier League campaign against Arsenal. Chelsea won't have Garnacho in time for their friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan this weekend, but he could arrive in time for their league opener against Crystal Palace.",

      "Paul Scholes believes Ruben Amorim ordered his Manchester United squad to raise their fitness levels before reporting for pre-season duty. The United legend closely monitored the team's pre-season tour in the USA, where he saw them clinch the Premier League Summer Series with a strong victory over West Ham United, a convincing 4-1 win over Bournemouth, and a 2-2 draw against Everton.",
      "Despite a commendable performance stateside, Amorim remained cautious in his outlook following last season's poor results. However, Scholes observed an uptick in the team's fitness and health compared to last term.",
      "The 11-time Premier League winner was confident Amorim challenged his players to overhaul their fitness. To support his theory, he picked out United academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, who has added more muscle to his previously slender physique.",
      "On The Overlap Fan Debate, Scholes, when asked about Mainoo, said: \"I thought he looked fitter. To be fair, I think they all looked a little bit fitter. I think it was a rule, they had to come back in a certain condition by the looks of all of them.\"",
      "In a recent chat with ESPN, Amorim discussed his commitment to elevating the club's culture by enhancing standards across the board. He said: \"You know that this is my job. Everyone knows that.",
      "\"That looks like a small thing, but it's a big thing. I think we improved in even the medical department, the nutrition. We are so much better. What we eat, the way we behave on tour, on the pitch.",
      "\"The rules. I think everything is important. I know that [the players] are not kids and I don't treat the players like kids. But I think these small rules can help a group to be strong.\"",
      "Amorim also added: \"I don't treat the players as babies. If you don't train in the right way, I have footage to show you and I show you in front of everybody.\"",
      "United have been active in the summer transfer market, kicking off with a £62.5million acquisition of Wolves' Matheus Cunha, followed by the signing of promising Paraguayan defender Diego Leon. The Red Devils then found themselves entangled in a protracted pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo, which culminated in him signing for a sum which could reach £71m.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is also on the cusp of joining Old Trafford in a deal worth up to £73.7m. But instead of focusing on the new faces, Scholes was particularly impressed with Mainoo's performances in the USA.",
      "Last season, the Carrington academy product was hampered by injuries and often struggled to earn Amorim's trust. After seeing him in pre-season, Scholes singled out the 20-year-old and urged him to cement his spot in Amorim's midfield duo.",
      "Scholes added: \"I think we spoke last year about, what they lack in the midfield is that controlling midfield player. I thought that was going to be him (Mainoo). It seems like it's a little bit confused now. Can he be that midfielder again?\".",
      "\"Can he be that midfielder who can play in a two, but he'll obviously need a lot of legs around him? Or, is he now one of the No. 10s? I'm just confused.\"",

      "Tom Victor has been part of the Mirror Sport team since 2021. He reports on a range of topics, predominantly focusing on football. Tom has previously written for BBC Sport, Shortlist and FourFourTwo, among others, and is based in London.",
      "The upcoming Premier League season will begin against the backdrop of a summer of attacking spending. Champions Liverpool have been busy in the market as they aim to win back-to-back league titles for the first time in the Premier League era, but they are not the only ones.",
      "They're not the only ones, though. Just as Arne Slot's side have strengthened, their rivals have recruited in an effort to bolster their front-line.",
      "Slot only added Federico Chiesa to the squad last summer, while Joshua Zirkzee was Manchester United's only attacking recruit. Arsenal didn't add any new forwards in the summer of 2024, and that led to them being forced to move midfielder Mikel Merino into an unfamiliar No.9 role when injuries hit.",
      "This year, though, it's all change. Liverpool, United and Arsenal have all added at least two new faces to their front-lines, while the likes of Chelsea and Aston Villa also have new options up front.",
      "Liverpool were the Premier League's highest scorers last season by some distance, scoring at least 14 more than any other club. A significant overhaul in attack doesn't sound like the obvious next move, but there are reasons for it.",
      "The tragic death of Diogo Jota might have forced Liverpool to think differently about their front-line, but there were already reasons to begin looking at making tweaks. Mohamed Salah top-scored in the league last season with 29 goals, but netted just twice in the final nine games and will miss some action this term while away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Record signing Florian Wirtz and the versatile Hugo Ekitike will bolster a front-line already including Salah and Cody Gakpo, even if Wirtz isn't an out-and-out goal-getter, while Chiesa will hope to contribute more with a full pre-season behind him. Luis Diaz is a bigger loss than Darwin Nunez, but the Reds look well-stocked in the wide forward roles, with Slot pointing to full-back Jeremie Frimpong's ability to operate as a right-winger during Salah's upcoming AFCON absence.",
      "The big question concerns Alexander Isak. A new bid for the Newcastle striker could arrive before the end of the window, and there's an argument that a front-line currently on a par with United and Arsenal would be comfortably elevated to the best of the bunch if the Swede joins this month.",
      "United scored just 44 league goals last season, with Everton the only team to stay up while finding the net less often. The case for reinforcements up front was a clear one, and Ruben Amorim and the club's transfer chiefs got to work early.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrived early, bringing with them a combination of Premier League experience and a strong goal return last term. Much has been made of the pair overperforming their xG numbers, but if they can get close to the 35 they scored between them last term then United will be laughing.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's impending arrival will take United's attacking outlay to roughly £200m - a little more than Liverpool's expenditure on Wirtz and Ekitike. He arrives without Premier League pedigree, but will hope to contribute more than Rasmus Hojlund managed last term.",
      "Hojlund could yet stick around, while Zirkzee remains as a rotation option, though Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are all tipped to follow Marcus Rashford in leaving either permanently or on loan. United have solid options on paper, but getting a brand new front three to gel represents the biggest challenge.",
      "Arsenal scored 91 goals in the 2023-24 season, and this was given as a justification for last summer's transfer policy. They were always at risk if injury struck, though, and it did so in a big way last term.",
      "Mikel Arteta would like to think being without Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli at various points in the season is not something likely to happen again. Even so, new transfer chief Andrea Berta has made sure the manager is well-prepared if there's a repeat.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has arrived to placate those who have shouted 'sign a striker' from the rooftops over the last couple of years, while winger Noni Madueke has arrived from Chelsea. Leandro Trossard could yet leave, while Gabriel Jesus won't return in time for the start of the season, but Ethan Nwaneri is a year older and more experienced and could contribute more.",
      "Gyokeres is an unknown quantity at this level, but the 54 goals he scored in 52 appearances last season don't count for nothing. The question, as with Sesko at United, is how quickly he can adapt to Premier League football.",
      "Manchester United still find themselves in third place, in part due to their lower starting point. Much will hinge on the manager as well as the personnel, with Amorim put to the test as he aims to bring three new faces together and create one coherent unit.",
      "Arsenal have a stronger base, especially with Havertz and Saka properly back after time on the sidelines last term. If the pair can get anywhere near where they were before those injuries, and if Gyokeres and Madueke hit the ground running (and introducing new parts to a working system ought to be easier than United's task) then they'll be in good shape.",
      "Liverpool's recruitment, combined with Salah's known quality, puts them more or less on a par with the Gunners as things stand. However, if they can add Isak to what they already have then it's hard to look past them as the top dogs in attack.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Fernandes was given a ludicrous offer that would have seen him bank more than £60million-per-year, with the Red Devils offered £105m for his services.",
      "However, despite revealing he had considered making the same move compatriot and former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo made, he opted to remain with United. And now it has emerged that Ronaldo’s current employers, Al Nassr, also made a tentative approach to try and sign the 30-year-old.",
      "Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus has confessed that he did hold talks with Fernandes, but was told that he wished to stay with Ruben Amorim. \"I wanted to [sign him], but Bruno is determined to stay,” Jesus told Sport Informa.",
      "“We already talked last year. This year I knew he had made the decision to continue with Amorim.",
      "“He's in a league that they say is the best in the world, but I don't agree. For me, it's the Spanish league.\"",
      "Fernandes will instead be the centrepoint of a United attacking spending spree that is set to eclipse £200m. Benjamin Sesko is set to be Amorim’s third recruit of the summer, joining from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m.",
      "The Slovenian will join Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo who signed after big money deals from Wolves and Brentford respectively. And it’s business United needed to complete after scoring just 44 league goals in last season’s miserable domestic campaign.",
      "The arrival of Sesko came after Fernandes made it clear that further improvements were needed. Speaking on their US tour, he said: “I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about.",
      "“I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "On his own transfer saga, Fernandes hinted that United’s defiant stance ultimately made his mind up. He said: . \"There was that possibility, the president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask me about it. There was a waiting period for me to think about the future.",
      "\"As I have always said, I would be willing to do it if Manchester United thought so. I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, was very annoying to me not to go. The club said they would not be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.\"",
      "United face Fiorentina at Old Trafford in their final pre-season game on Saturday, before their Premier League season kicks off when they face Arsenal on August 17.",

      "Manchester United are on the verge of completing a full refresh of their forward line for Ruben Amorim this summer. Benjamin Sesko is set to follow Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo through the doors at Old Trafford as the Red Devils attempt to put their goalscoring woes behind them.",
      "Sesko, 22, is set to undergo his medical before seeing a £73.3million deal to move from RB Leipzig confirmed as United's spending heads north of £200m in the transfer window. The striker opted for the 13-time Premier League champions over Newcastle United, despite the Magpies being able to offer European football.",
      "And despite this, the Old Trafford side were able to agree a smaller fee with the Bundesliga side to acquire Sesko's services. But that does not mean the forward came cheaply.",
      "Earlier deals for Cunha and Mbuemo paved the way for United to be able to make a third significant signing, despite concerns over the club's ability to abide by Premier League profit and sustainability rules. The club have a host of players up for sale including Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho but have so far only managed to move on Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.",
      "All of Rashford's salary is being covered by the Catalan club to help somewhat but United took precautions in order to ensure they could still pounce in the transfer market if required. The deals they agreed for Cunha and Mbeumo were pivotal to that.",
      "Despite costing in the region of £130m, the payments of that figure have been arranged in a way deemed favourable to allow United to keep spending, per BBC. That has proved advantageous in the quest to land Sesko, though the club may need more breathing space for a midfielder.",
      "Sesko's arrival could yet see Rasmus Hojlund depart Old Trafford. Despite the Dane being adamant he wants to fight for his place, United have made him available.",
      "The former Atalanta man, also 22, could be sold for as little as £30m with United willing to take a loss. Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes that tale should bring some caution.",
      "Scholes aired his concerns on The Overlap Fan Debate. He said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed - going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",

      "While Manchester United may not be able to conclude a move for Carlos Baleba this summer, Ruben Amorim has cause for optimism. The Premier League giants have potentially registered interest in the Brighton midfielder too late to do a deal in 2025, but Amorim already has a fit for the same role.",
      "It's understood United have baulked at Brighton's valuation of the player, who would reportedly cost more than £100million. But there are signs to suggest their decision to hand Casemiro a contract until 2026 could prove to be a masterstroke.",
      "Baleba, 21, joined the Seagulls from Lille in a £23m deal back in 2023, but the Cameroonian, who has earned huge praise from United icon Roy Keane, enjoyed a breakout campaign last season. That alerted European powerhouses such as United, who may have to wait until next year to launch a realistic approach for the player.",
      "But the timing may work out perfectly considering Casemiro, who has the option of an additional year in his deal, is likely to part ways with the club in 2026. The Brazilian, who is among the Premier League's highest earners on £350,000 a week, often occupies a key role at the base of United's midfield, though there have been concerns around his longevity at 33 years old.",
      "United copped criticism in some quarters for awarding their £60m signing such a long and lucrative deal in the summer of 2022 when he was already 30. The Brazilian has endured some ups and downs during his time in England, though he enjoyed a resurgence last term with 42 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Only 24 of those came in the Premier League, yet Casemiro still managed 83 tackles, four more than Baleba despite him playing 10 games more. The United linchpin's total tackle rate works out at around 3.5 tackles per game, while Baleba's is closer to 2.3 per game.",
      "Despite boasting a reputation as one of the best defensive midfielders of his generation, Casemiro has also proved himself a much more rounded threat than many perceive. He took 43 touches in opposition penalty areas during the last Premier League campaign, while Baleba had only 12.",
      "United's only other option as an established defensive midfield presence is Manuel Ugarte, who joined from PSG in a £50m deal last summer. The Uruguayan was one of the last statement signings made under Erik ten Hag's regime, however, and hasn't been the revelation fans were hoping for.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the other midfield gem with an important role to play in United's future, both in the short and long term. However, it appears he's better-suited to playing in a more advanced role rather than wasting certain attributes sat back.",
      "The powers that be at Old Trafford will be hoping five-time Champions League-winner Casemiro, who turns 34 in February, has at least one more stellar campaign in the tank. It then depends on whether United decide to trigger the one-year extension in his contract next year, or allow him to leave on a free and shed his huge salary from the wage bill.",
      "Brighton appear to have unearthed another rare gem in Baleba, as his supposed nine-figure valuation would suggest. And while this may not be the summer a move to Manchester materialises, the stars might align just right for him to take up Casemiro's mantle in one year's time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's Toby Collyer won't be used as a bargaining chip in a potential swap deal for Carlos Baleba. With the signing of Benjamin Sesko on the horizon, Ruben Amorim is keen to bolster his midfield options, and Brighton's Baleba has been linked with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Brighton have slapped a £100million price tag on Baleba, and there has been speculation that United's young talent Collyer could be offered as part of the deal amid the troubling financial position.",
      "United will need to sell in order to buy again after committing a large portion of their wage budget on Sesko, whose £74m move is expected to be confirmed soon.",
      "Rumours had suggested that Collyer might be used to sweeten the deal for Baleba this summer, given that the 21-year-old came through the ranks at Brighton before leaving in 2022.",
      "It was previously claimed that the opportunity to sign Collyer was unexpected. He was considered one of the best midfielders in his age group, and a source at United confessed they were taken aback by the chance to sign him, but they were thrilled to do so.",
      "It seems likely that Collyer will be heading out on loan. \"I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,\" he expressed during his time in the USA.",
      "He plans to have a discussion with the club's management about his future. \"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan,\" he said.",
      "\"The end goal for me is to play as many minutes as possible here, hopefully starting every week. So yeah, I'll sit down with them. Obviously, my feeling at this moment is I want to stay.",
      "\"I want to play as many games as possible. I've not really thought that far ahead to be honest. I'll just see how the next few weeks go and then we'll go over those conversations.",
      "\"I'll be able to sit down with them and see what's the best solution for that. But yeah, like you said there as well, obviously there's not a lot of time in football. You need to get the results and get the team progressing. So that's what we're working towards at the minute.\"",
      "Collyer made an impression last season when he debuted against Liverpool at Old Trafford, making 13 appearances overall despite a minor muscle injury. Last summer, insiders revealed Erik ten Hag's high regard for Collyer, and another source noted his exceptional 'freakish' running stats during training, surpassed only by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Amorim has also been vocal in his commendation of Collyer, noting the player's potential and work ethic in January, as he said: \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko could return to his first ever squad number when he moves to Manchester United. However, that would require Ruben Amorim to take the number from Antony in the anticipation the winger will leave.",
      "Amorim has already made that kind of move once this summer. Matheus Cunha inherited Marcus Rashford's No.10 shirt while the England international was still a United player, though Rashford has since joined Barcelona on loan.",
      "Sesko wore 30 for RB Leipzig last season, but that number already belongs to United new boy Diego Leon. When Sesko arrives at Old Trafford - and it now appears to be when rather than if - he'll have to choose an alternative.",
      "The No.11 he wore for Slovenia at Euro 2024 is also occupied, with Joshua Zirkzee going nowhere. However, 21, the number he wore as a teenager at Liefering, is likely to become available with Antony expected to leave the club.",
      "Sesko scored 21 league goals for Liefering in the 2020-21 season with 21 on his back. That's still his best single-season return in the league, though he netted 21 times in all competitions for Leipzig last term.",
      "United's move for Sesko will set them back up to £74million after an agreement was reached with Leipzig. He is due in for a medical on Friday after choosing Ruben Amorim's side over rivals Newcastle, and should be available for the Premier League opener against Arsenal a week on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's team might not be done there, though. Gianluigi Donnarumma continues to be linked with an Old Trafford switch, and reports on the continent suggest Lucas Chevalier - the man primed to take his place at Paris Saint-Germain - has passed his medical ahead of a big-money move from Lille.",
      "In terms of outgoings, Antony isn't the only one set to leave. Real Betis remain keen on the Brazilian after he thrived on loan with the club last season, though there is also interest from elsewhere amid questions over whether the La Liga side can meet United's asking price.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho are also expected to leave Old Trafford. Juventus have led the chase for Sancho for much of the summer, while Garnacho is the subject of renewed interest from Chelsea.",
      "United want £50m for Argentina star Garnacho, who finished last season with the club despite January interest from both Chelsea and Napoli. Enzo Maresca's Blues are also pursuing a move for Leipzig's Xavi Simons, though, and may need to complete sales of their own if they're to land both targets.",

      "Manchester United icon Paul Scholes believes Benjamin Sesko may have been better off choosing Newcastle over the Red Devils. After an extended transfer battle with the Magpies, United look to be closing in on the towering Slovenian centre-forward after a bid of £66.4million, and a further £7.6m in add-ons, was accepted by RB Leipzig.",
      "The 22-year-old is now jetting in for his medical as Ruben Amorim accelerates his transfer plans, but Scholes is concerned that United are shopping like-for-like. The 50-year-old is worried that Sesko hasn't got much more experience than under-fire United striker Rasmus Hojlund did when he signed for United in 2023, with the Dane's future now up in the air.",
      "The club legend believes the Magpies would have fostered a better environment for Sesko to develop, claiming strikers at United must hit the ground running while under intense scrutiny.",
      "Scholes aired his concerns for United's latest signing on The Overlap Fan Debate. He said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",

      "United have not only stolen a march ahead of Eddie Howe's side for Sesko, but have also beaten them to the punch for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who were signed earlier in the window from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Scholes, however, knows full well why United are a more attractive proposition than the north east side - but still isn't convinced it's the right deal for United to make.",
      "\"Which club are going to be successful first? Are Man United going to win the league before Newcastle - if they ever do? Of course they are,\" Scholes said. \"That's why he wants to go there, but I'm saying, from a United point of view, is it the best bit of business? I still think you're in the same boat as having Hojlund.\"",
      "Sesko's impending arrival, as well as the signings of Mbeumo and Cunha, looks certain to doom Hojlund's time at United. Sources close to the Dane have hinted that he may ultimately need to consider a move before the transfer deadline, if he remains out of favour.",
      "However, during the recent pre-season tour in America, Hojlund, who has scored 26 goals in 95 appearances for United, expressed his determination to secure a spot in Amorim's team.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said. \"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "The Blues are understood to have agreed personal terms with the Argentine and have now opened talks with United. But they're still some way off reaching a full agreement.",
      "According to The Telegraph, United are holding out for £50million, while Chelsea are pushing to lower the price to around £40m. The London club's stance is strengthened by Garnacho's strained relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim, as well as the Red Devils' need to raise funds.",
      "United are on the verge of signing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko – a move that will push their summer spending towards, and possibly beyond, the £200m mark – with £130m already spent on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Garnacho struggled for consistency last season, despite registering a career-best return of 11 goals and 10 assists. His campaign was also overshadowed by accusations of attitude issues, fuelled by his public bust-up with Amorim.",
      "But while his domestic reputation has taken a knock, Garnacho's stock remains high abroad. He continues to be regarded as a rare, high-potential talent – a view, it appears, that's shared not only by international team-mate Messi, but also by several other Ballon d'Or winners.",
      "Garnacho was among the nominees for last year's Kopa Trophy – awarded to the world's best player under the age of 21. Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal claimed the honour by a wide margin, but Garnacho still earned the backing of some illustrious names.",
      "According to L'Equipe, Messi was one of three voters to place him third, alongside Karim Benzema and German great Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Dutch legend Marco van Basten went a step further, ranking Garnacho second. It underlines the esteem Garnacho still commands despite his recent troubles at United.",
      "Messi – an eight-time Ballon d'Or winner – has witnessed the youngster's talent first-hand on international duty.",
      "Van Basten – one of only five players to win the Ballon d'Or more than twice, claiming the prize in 1988, 1989 and 1992 – is widely regarded as one of the greatest forwards in football history. Similarly, Rummenigge – a two-time winner (1980 and 1981) – is generally classed as one of the finest attackers of his generation, as is Benzema, who took the award in 2022.",
      "Should Garnacho join Chelsea, he will face fierce competition for minutes. Like United, the Blues have overhauled their forward line this summer, adding Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens and Brazilian wonderkid Estevao. A move for RB Leipzig playmaker Xavi Simons is also in the works.",
      "Nevertheless, a switch to Stamford Bridge would offer Garnacho both a fresh start and a significant challenge – exactly what he needs at this stage of his career. At 21, he still has ample time to develop and prove his worth at the highest level, but the pressure to perform consistently will be intense, especially given the competition for places in a squad eager to reclaim its status among Europe's elite.",
      "Chelsea's ambitious recruitment drive signals their intent to build a youthful, dynamic attack, and Garnacho's pace and flair could make him a key figure in that vision – provided he can regain his focus and maintain discipline.",
      "For now, Garnacho waits in a cloud of uncertainty, but buoyed by the silent endorsement of some of football's greatest figures, the promise of a bright future remains unmistakably within reach.",

      "The United squad spent more than a year in the recently-built £10m centre reserved for the women's and academy teams that opened in 2024.",
      "Architects from Foster + Partners had targeted an opening for the start of pre-season and for the the start of the new season, at the very latest.",
      "United have billed their new hub as \"a leading-edge, high-performance training environment designed to inspire collaboration, innovation and excellence\".",
      "The project, overseen by architect Lord Norman Foster, has been completed within budget. The new building boasts updated equipment and technology, with a focus on fitness, nutrition, recovery and team unity.",
      "Players and staff provided input for the design, which has an emphasis on open work spaces and collaboration. Designers have also ensured there is greater exposure to natural light.",
      "United players moved into their remodelled quarters this week and the majority of the club's executive leadership team has also moved in. Several staff members have also relocated from Old Trafford.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe were present at Carrington for the ribbon-cutting ceremony on Friday afternoon. United moved to Carrington from their storied training ground The Cliff in 2000, roughly midway through Ferguson's 26-and-a-half-year tenure as manager.",
      "Ferguson has since rued elements of the original design of Carrington, an area United first identified to relocate to back in 1996. Ferguson regretted that United's gymnasium was in a hall, rather than looking out onto the pitch.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo was scathing about the facilities at Carrington after he returned in 2021 and claimed the club \"stopped on a clock... Nothing changed, surprisingly. Not only the pool, the jacuzzi, even the gym.\"",
      "United made modifications after Ronaldo privately aired his qualms and a new canteen opened in 2022. The swimming pool was also upgraded but any other planned changes were halted by Ratcliffe.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first major announcements after he invested a minority stake in United in December 2023 was to sanction a major revamp of Carrington.",
      "Ratcliffe said: “Following a review of the facility last year, we made a quick decision to invest significantly in the creation of a world-class performance environment for staff and players to reflect our ambition and vision for Manchester United.",
      "\"We are delighted with the outcome and are confident the new facility will play an important role in building a winning culture at the club.”",

      "Benjamin Sesko hid from photographers at Manchester Airport on Thursday night. There is no hiding place for a Manchester United striker.",
      "Never mind one who has cost £73.7million. Sesko is a strapping presence yet he may have to beef up his frame just to shoulder the burden of leading the line for United.",
      "Sesko was born in 2003, played in Austria and has been operating in one of Europe's top five leagues for budding Champions League qualifiers. Just like Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "So the minimum target for Sesko this season is 16 goals, the number Hojlund tallied in his respectable first campaign in England. Hojlun's overall numbers are cause to look away: 26 goals in 95 United appearances.",
      "Hojlund was always destined to fail. Switching to the same agency that represented Erik ten Hag marked his card with some teammates.",
      "One United player shook their head at the mention of Hojlund. Another lamented how few tackles he won, his lack of pressing and aerial sickness. A senior figure at the club questioned Hojlund's work rate.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot have all given him short shrift on the pitch. Players were genuinely reluctant to pass the ball to Hojlund in his first season amid reservations about his hold-up play.",
      "In pre-season alone, Hojlund has vented at Dalot over a purportedly delayed pass. In Atlanta, he kicked the post after Patrick Dorgu kicked at goal.",
      "It is ironic that John Murtough is now employed by Atalanta, having agreed an overall £72m deal with them to sign Hojlund in 2023. Since that transfer, Atalanta have won the Europa League, with Ademola Lookman scoring a hat-trick in the Dublin final against Bayer Leverkusen, and Mateo Retegui was the top scorer in Serie A last season.",
      "Hojlund mustered three goals in his last 35 United games. This is what United can do to a £70m-odd striker.",
      "\"I'm still very young,\" the 22-year-old Hojlund protested last week. \"I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals in the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "What Hojlund was essentially saying was that not everyone is like Erling Haaland in their early 20s. Haaland, like Sesko, cut his teeth at Red Bull Salzburg before rejecting United to move to the Bundesliga.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me,\" Hojlund assured us in the Soldier Field mixed zone, \"it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Hojlund insisted \"my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens\". Some of those close to him think differently.",
      "Sesko is a different profile to Hojlund. He was more renowned as a teenager and United tried to sign him three years ago when he was 19. Murtough met Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic.",
      "United valued Sesko at £15m. Salzburg wanted £30m. Three years later, United have paid more than double. His fee is just shy of the £75m United parted with for Romelu Lukaku, their last Premier League-proven striker signing, in 2017.",
      "After Sesko joined RB Leipzig, it was telling that United still opened the doors to Basanovic at Carrington and Old Trafford, rather than burn their bridges. Keeping the line of dialogue open led to Matt Hargreaves greeting Basanovic and Sesko on the Manchester Airport tarmac.",
      "Sesko will likely line up for United for the first time against a club that was tipped to sign him. Arsenal will instead have Viktor Gyokeres at the apex of their attack. United enquired about Gyokeres before they turned to Sesko.",
      "That is another reality Sesko will have to blank out. Gyokeres, Liam Delap and Ollie Watkins were all sounded out before him. £73.7m is a steep fee for a fourth-choice striker. Delap cost £30m, Gyokeres went for a fee rising to £64m. There is no way Watkins would have commanded as much as Sesko has.",
      "Leipzig finished seventh last season. The only scrutiny on the reviled Red Bull franchise in Germany centres around their manufactured origins. They are a franchise club, anathema to the traditions of Germany's historic clubs. United is the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "As if this all wasn't onerous enough for Sesko, there is something he almost certainly hasn't considered. In my lifetime, there have been two forwards United and Newcastle United have vied for: Alan Shearer in 1996 and Wayne Rooney in 2004.",
      "That's the highest goalscorer and the third-highest goalscorer in the Premier League era. 468 goals between them. The leading scorers of Newcastle and United. They are English football greats not of the past 33 years but its entire history.",
      "That Sesko is mentioned in the same breath as them seems incongruous but it is fair. If he is mentioned in the same breath as them again in a different context, he will have been as totemic a buy as Fernandes.",
      "There is no hiding place.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "A senior United player assured the squad is \"very optimistic\" after a propitious pre-season tour of the United States, and that there is a \"much better feel\" around the camp.",
      "Other dressing room sources have described the atmosphere as \"very good\" and stressed the players benefited from team-bonding dinners in Chicago, where United were based for nine nights.",
      "Multiple United players enjoyed their stay in Chicago, where players could embark on sightseeing strolls with little hassle.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes' decision to remain at Old Trafford has also been particularly well received by the squad. Fernandes now fronts United's new six-man leadership group that also includes Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "United players were fully behind Amorim's decision to omit the 'bomb squad' members from the core squad's training sessions and tour. Marcus Rashford has now joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are still at the club.",
      "The quartet are still under instructions to report at United's Carrington training complex for sessions separate to the first team's schedule.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and trophyless last season, their worst since they were relegated in 1974. The campaign also marked only the second time United have failed to qualify for Europe in the past 35 years.",
      "Well-placed sources say United players are bullish about their prospects in the upcoming campaign partly because of the lack of midweek commitments.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Toby Collyer will not be considered as a makeweight in a swap deal for Carlos Baleba.",
      "With the signing of Benjamin Sesko now imminent, Ruben Amorim is targeting the signing of a midfielder and Baleba has been linked with move to Old Trafford from Brighton.",
      "Reports have speculated Collyer could be used as a sweetener to sign Baleba this summer because the 21-year-old progressed through Brighton's academy before leaving in 2022.",
      "The MEN previously reported the chance to sign Collyer arose unexpectedly. He was regarded as one of the finest midfielders in the country in his age group and a source at United admitted they were surprised to get the chance to sign him - but they were delighted that they did.",
      "Collyer was born in Worthing, which is around 10 miles from Brighton, and he was destined to break into the first-team at the Amex Stadium until he was let go from the club.",
      "Collyer's future is still up in the air this summer, though. The midfielder has received loan interest and there is thought to be interest from other clubs in signing him on a permanent transfer.",
      "The current indications suggest Collyer will go on loan. \"I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,\" he recently said in the USA.",
      "\"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan.",
      "\"The end goal for me is to play as many minutes as possible here, hopefully starting every week. So yeah, I'll sit down with them.",
      "\"Obviously, my feeling at this moment is I want to stay. I want to play as many games as possible. I've not really thought that far ahead to be honest. I'll just see how the next few weeks go and then we'll go over those conversations.",
      "\"I'll be able to sit down with them and see what's the best solution for that. But yeah, like you said there as well, obviously there's not a lot of time in football. You need to get the results and get the team progressing. So that's what we're working towards at the minute.\"",
      "Collyer made his Premier League debut against Liverpool at Old Trafford last season. He made 13 appearances for the first-team in total but was hampered by a small muscle injury.",
      "Last summer, a source discussed Erik ten Hag's fondness for Collyer and another source said he records 'freakish' running stats in training that are only bettered by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Ruben Amorim has also praised Collyer. \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity,\" said Amorim in January.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog on Friday, August 8,",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been busy this summer in an attempt to strengthen significantly following a disastrous 2024/25 campaign. Roughly £120million has been spent on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and that figure looks set to rise further with Benjamin Sesko's arrival imminent.",
      "The RB Leipzig star opted for a move to Old Trafford over Newcastle United with a £73.8million (€85m) package deal agreed.",

      "According to the Sheffield Star, cash-strapped Sheffield Wednesday are interested in signing Harry Amass and Toby Collyer on loan.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United are open to loaning both youngsters to the Championship so they can gain regular experience in first-team football.",
      "Wednesday are currently in the midst of a high profile financial dispute and are currently under transfer embargo.",
      "They are able to sign players on loan though, so long as no fee is paid for the duo but it remains to be seen if United will be happy to do a deal on that basis.",

      "With such a big fee spent on the 23-year-old, it seems unlikely he will not be the long-term No.1 which could result in Donnarumma considering a summer exit.",
      "Manchester United fans have made their feelings clear on the club's transfer interest in Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old is the latest midfield gem uncovered by Brighton with it no surprise those at Old Trafford have taken a keen interest.",
      "It is understood, he is open to the move but the Seagulls are likely to demand a high fee to sanction an exit. Despite that, it has been made perfectly clear to the United hierarchy that he should be signed.",

      "RB Leipzig have sent a classy message to Benjamin Sesko as he closes in on a move to Manchester United.",
      "Sesko flew into Manchester Airport via private jet on Thursday evening to complete his impending switch to the Premier League. The Slovenian, 22, underwent his medical on Friday and now it appears it is only a matter of time before the signing is officially confirmed.",
      "United are set to pay the German club a fee that could reach £74million for the centre-forward after he scored 21 goals in all competitions last season. The Reds will see that deal as a coup for themselves considering they fended off interest from Newcastle for the striker.",
      "It has been well documented that Sesko had a good understanding with his club about his future. After signing a new contract last summer, a gentleman's agreement was reached with Leipzig that would allow him to explore a new challenge should a club he deemed to be 'special' produced an offer that was acceptable.",
      "Such an offer from United was submitted and now Sesko is on the verge of being confirmed as a United player. It can be rare for clubs who are losing a major player to show good taste in their response to their player's inevitable exit.",
      "However, Leipzig bucked the trend on Thursday with their message to the striker on Instagram. Sharing a selection of Sesko's in-game celebrations, and action shots, the Bundesliga club captioned the post: \"Today is a great day for #AirSesko,\" a clear acknowledgement of his impending exit.",
      "Leipzig then confirmed their understanding of Sesko joining United in a squad update on Friday which confirmed the 22-year-old had been 'relieved of first-team duties to hold talks with another club.' Sesko's official announcement as a United player is unknown, but may coincide with tomorrow's pre-season clash with Fiorentina on Saturday lunchtime (12.45pm).",

      "Of course, the official announcement would coincide with United's pre-season fixture against Fiorentina at Old Trafford. The game is United's first - and last - at Old Trafford this summer before the Premier League returns on August 17 against Arsenal.",
      "Many are speculating as to whether United will use the fixture to unveil Sesko to his new club's supporters. The match is already considered to be a special occasion with David de Gea returning for the first time since leaving Old Trafford and United have hinted that Sesko's unveiling could coincide with this.",
      "In an official statement, United confirmed their three senior signings to date this summer - namely Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - will paraded to the home supporters before the game against Fiorentina. Understandably, there was no mention that Sesko would be involved in this unveiling.",
      "However, it can be expected that - should everything go according to plan - the Slovenian striker will join his new teammates on the pitch prior to the game. While Leon, Cunha and Mbeumo will all be expected to play some part in the match, Sesko will likely only have a watching brief - having only just joined the squad.",
      "Ruben Amorim is, then, likely to make a decision on whether Sesko is fit enough to feature against Arsenal in the week to follow.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe cut the ribbon at the grand opening of the impressive new facility which has been billed as a 'a world-class performance environment for staff and players'. It is a far cry from the scathing review that Cristiano Ronaldo gave in his infamous Piers Morgan interview.",
      "He effectively described the facilities as being out-dated and said that the Reds had 'stopped the clock' from when he was first making his name at Old Trafford. In total, Ratcliffe has spent £50m on the new facility, which should not affect the Reds' Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) position.",
      "Clubs are allowed to invest in their infrastructure - like training grounds - without the fear of hampering their losses generated. This deductable investment meant it was perhaps a no-brainer for Ineos to open their chequebook early and get the work underway.",
      "However, it will not be until January, at the earliest, that we will see whether or not this investment has been worth it. United supporters will not see the benefits of the new training ground immediately.",
      "The players will only have been using it for a week before Arsenal arrive at Old Trafford. But, once the club reaches January, we shall see whether the new environment at Carrington is fostering better performances on the pitch.",
      "What's more, January marks the start of the mid-season transfer window. United have proven in this window that they can still compete with clubs for players even when they are not in the Champions League.",
      "Should they enter that window and be in need of a signing that can turn the tide in their favour, it will be interesting to see whether the £50m new Carrington can entice top talent to sign. You have to wonder whether Jude Bellingham, for instance, would have chosen Borussia Dortmund all those years ago had Carrington kept pace with the 21st century.",
      "In truth, this new training ground was always going to be more important to United in the short term than a new stadium. While the new Old Trafford will diversify income streams and give supporters something to be proud of, Carrington should improve results on the pitch much quicker.",
      "If it doesn't, questions will likely be asked and further big decisions shall be made.",

United have just three more weeks to complete their business for the summer and add to the three new signings that have already been made to Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko looks set to become the fourth new signing at United this summer. United have fended off competition from Newcastle for the Slovenia international's signature after submitting a €75million (£65.3m) bid plus €10million (£8.7m) in add-ons earlier in the week.",
      "A deal for Sesko could therefore reach £74million if all add-ons are met. That money could then go on to see United spend more than £200million this summer with the potential for more to come.",

      "In terms of business finalised this summer, the first deal United got over the line was a move for Matheus Cunha from Wolves. United agreed to pay the £62.5million release clause in the Brazilian's contract, and will stagger the payments over five instalments.",
      "The next signing saw United bring Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford. After weeks of speculation, United finally agreed a £71million deal which includes a £65million initial fee plus £6million more in add-ons.",

      "However, it has been widely reported that Brighton value the midfielder at £100million, a figure close to the one they received for Moises Caicedo in 2023 - from Chelsea. It's clear United would have to construct a near-perfect financial package to reach an agreement.",
      "Despite Brighton's asking price, the latest figures released by the CIES Football Observatory indicate the midfielder should be valued between €75m (£65m) and €87m (£75.4m). Using a sample of over 8,000 transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression, with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable.",

      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United are aware that the Seagulls will be hard to negotiate with. However, it's still reckoned that Baleba would be ready to say yes to a move to Old Trafford this summer, even without the prospect of them playing in Europe.",

      "'Take me home, United road' is a pre-match staple at Old Trafford nowadays.",
      "And incoming signing Benjamin Sesko is poised to hear Manchester United fans belt it out for the very first time ahead of Saturday's pre-season finale against Fiorentina.",
      "The plan is for him to be unveiled to his new army of supporters ahead of the clash with the Italian side, similarly to the way Rasmus Hojlund was presented to the fans ahead of United's penultimate pre-season friendly of the summer against RC Lens two years ago.",
      "Like Hojlund, there is also a very high probability Sesko will make his United debut against Arsenal. Furthermore, they have also ended up at Old Trafford via spells in Austria.",
      "With the duo sharing a cluster of similarities, United supporters will just be hoping Sesko is more potent inside the penalty area. The Slovenian is on the cusp of joining the club from RB Leipzig in a deal that is going to cost £73.7million.",
      "He arrived in Manchester on Thursday evening and is now in the process of putting the finishing touches to the move. He will become United's fourth signing of the summer and their third new addition to the attacking department.",
      "After finishing last season with a negative goal difference of -10, United have prioritised attacking signings this summer. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrived from Wolves and Brentford on the back of highly successful seasons, scoring 17 and 20 goals respectively.",
      "Sesko is on the brink of joining the Reds on the back of a 21-goal season in Germany. Given he did not turn 22 until the very end of May, 21 goals in a season at the age of 21 marked a respectable haul.",
      "It marked the second time he had smashed his way through the 20-goal barrier in a single season in his senior career. He scored 13 times in the Bundesliga and chipped in with four goals apiece in the Champions League and DFB-Pokal.",
      "He previously went beyond the 20-goal barrier in 2020/21, also scoring 21 times, during a season-long loan spell at FC Liefering in the Austrian second division.",
      "In comparison, Hojlund has never scored 20 goals or more in a single season in his senior career. His best return in a single campaign is 16 - a landmark he reached in his first season at United and previously in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Hojlund's record in his first season at Old Trafford was very respectable. Considering he had joined United injured and immediately found himself at the top of the pecking order with no adequate support in his department, it was a promising maiden season at the club.",
      "However, he regressed last season, scoring just ten goals, of which only four of them were scored in the Premier League. United need to be able to rely on a striker who is capable of scoring 20 goals a season, and Hojlund does not look like being that player.",
      "With the exception of Erling Haaland, whose record can only be described as freakish, not many young strikers have arrived in the Premier League in recent seasons and immediately hit the ground running by scoring a lorry load of goals.",
      "There is no guarantee of Sesko, despite being compared with Haaland, following in the Norwegian's footsteps, but United will take confidence from the fact he has smashed his way through the 20-goal-a-season barrier - and so recently.",
      "At the age of 22, the weight of pressure on Sesko's shoulders will be unlike anything he has experienced before. Few positions in world football are scrutinised as much as the centre-forward position at United.",
      "Sesko built up a respectable record at Leipzig, scoring 39 goals in 87 games. His Bundesliga record stands at 27 goals in 64 games.",
      "Signing him for such an eye-watering fee, United will demand instant results from him. However, they will take comfort from the fact he will be playing alongside two attackers so well-versed in the Premier League - and that could make a world of difference.",
      "Hojlund, by contrast, did not have that luxury. He was brought in to be the main man with no support acts.",
      "The pair of them have taken similar routes to Old Trafford, and they could both make their debuts against the same opponent. United will just be hoping the end result is different.",

But this could change if United manage to offload surplus players such as Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, thereby increasing their budget. Andre Onana's pre-season injury hasn't helped matters, and his shaky form last season means an upgrade could still come in.",
      "At just 18 years old, it was reported Donnarumma had privately informed his friends he was Premier League-bound. During this time, David De Gea seemed set to join Real Madrid, only for a notorious fax machine mishap to thwart his move to the Bernabeu.",
      "United were overwhelming favourites for his signature, as reported by The Sun, and felt certain they could secure a deal for the youngster back in 2017. Nevertheless, Donnarumma executed a dramatic change of heart and went on to issue an apology to AC Milan fans, eventually penning a fresh long-term agreement at the San Siro.",
      "Following the collapsed transfer, he said: \"I'm delighted and proud to be at Milan. I was born and raised at this club and I never had any doubts about staying in my mind.",
      "\"I'm sorry to the fans who felt betrayed, but I repeat that was not my intention. I'm sorry to them and thank them for their affection for these two years. I am proud to be here.\"",
      "This summer, Manchester City have also been associated with a potential move for Donnarumma. This appears somewhat ironic, as rumours suggest Pep Guardiola personally stepped in to block a move for the Italian in the summer of 2023.",
      "PSG were reportedly so keen on signing City midfielder Bernardo Silva in 2023, they were prepared to offer both the goalkeeper and Marco Verratti in return. However, Guardiola was determined to retain Silva and is said to have personally quashed any possibility of the deal proceeding.",
      "Two years on, City have been linked with Donnarumma once more, according to Football Italia, despite their recent acquisition of James Trafford from Burnley.",
      "During the Euro 2020 final, Donnarumma was seen in a heated exchange with ex-Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson at half time. As both teams retreated to the dressing room for the interval, England were leading Italy 1-0, courtesy of Luke Shaw's early half-volley.",
      "However, as Donnarumma confidently made his way towards the tunnel, Henderson – an England substitute at the time – emerged to challenge the goalkeeper. The now Brentford midfielder was observed gesturing towards the penalty area whilst admonishing the goalkeeper.",
      "It's understood he took umbrage at Donnarumma's heated response to Raheem Sterling's fall in the penalty area during the first half, which resulted in the PSG star confronting the forward. When Henderson intervened, a member of the Italian team's staff was seen escorting Donnarumma away from the midfielder and down the tunnel.",
      "Italy, of course, went on to clinch the win in the final on penalties, with Donnarumma saving spot-kicks from Sancho and Bukayo Saka, leaving Three Lions supporters inside Wembley devastated.",
      "Following Chelsea's 3-0 victory over PSG in this summer's Club World Cup final, Donnarumma and his boss Luis Enrique were incensed by Joao Pedro's behaviour. The Brazilian forward, who chipped the Blues' third goal beyond the Italian goalkeeper's reach, was shoved in the throat by Donnarumma, whilst Enrique also sought to confront him physically.",
      "Pedro, who made the switch to the west London outfit from Brighton and Hove Albion for £60m this summer, collapsed to the ground, grasping his face. Donnarumma and Enrique persisted in their heated exchange with Chelsea players, who promptly waded into the melee.",
      "Ultimately, his push on Pedro turned out to be the most memorable moment of the post-match fracas. With Chelsea having shown prior interest in Donnarumma, there's a chance the Italian and Pedro could become colleagues in the future, although, United's search for a goalkeeper seems to be more urgent at present.",

      "Donnarumma has just a single season remaining on his contract with PSG, which is still the same deal as when he joined four years ago on a free transfer after leaving Milan. Chevalier could now become the club's new number one.",
      "French sports newspaper L'Equipe claims the Parisian club want to complete a deal so that the France international would be available for the UEFA Super Cup on Wednesday, when they play Europa League winners Tottenham Hotspur. PSG are said to be paying around £35million - plus add-ons - for Chevalier, with now just the finer details needing finalising.",

      "United head coach Ruben Amorim recently evaluated the club's goalkeeper department. \"I think even when you talk about Andre [Onana], you can see the goalkeepers... even Tom [Heaton] is leaner, he's a different goalkeeper; Altay [Bayindir] did really well, and Onana is going to be better, like the other guys, this year.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has suggested that Benjamin Sesko might have been better off opting for Newcastle over the Red Devils.",
      "Following a protracted transfer tussle with the Magpies, United appear to be on the verge of securing the towering Slovenian centre-forward after RB Leipzig accepted a bid of £66.4million, plus an additional £7.6m in add-ons.",
      "The 22-year-old is now flying in for his medical as Ruben Amorim steps up his transfer plans. However, Scholes has expressed concerns that United are simply replacing like for like and risk repeating history.",
      "The 50-year-old fears that Sesko doesn't have significantly more experience than under-fire United striker Rasmus Hojlund had when he joined the club in 2023, with his future at the club now uncertain.",
      "Scholes believes that Newcastle would have provided a more nurturing environment for Sesko to grow, arguing that strikers at United are expected to perform immediately under intense scrutiny.",
      "Scholes voiced his worries about United's latest signing during The Overlap Fan Debate. He said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed - going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",
      "United have not only edged out Eddie Howe's side for Sesko, but they've also outmanoeuvred them in securing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who joined earlier in the window from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Scholes acknowledges why United are a more appealing option than the Tyneside club, yet he remains sceptical about whether it's the wisest move for the club.",
      "\"Which club are going to be successful first? Are Man United going to win the league before Newcastle - if they ever do? Of course they are,\" Scholes added. \"That's why he wants to go there, but I'm saying, from a United point of view, is it the best bit of business? I still think you're in the same boat as having Hojlund.\"",
      "With Sesko's anticipated arrival and the acquisitions of Mbeumo and Cunha, it seems likely that Hojlund's tenure at United could be set to end. Insiders close to the Danish player suggest he might need to move before the deadline if he continues to be overlooked.",
      "Nonetheless, during the recent pre-season tour in America, Hojlund, who has 26 goals in 95 appearances for United, expressed his resolve to fight for his place in Amorim's squad.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said. \"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho may split opinions among Manchester United fans, but Lionel Messi holds no reservations about the winger's ability.",
      "The 21-year-old is expected to leave United this summer, with Chelsea emerging as the leading contenders for his signature. The Blues have reportedly reached an agreement on personal terms with the Argentine and have opened negotiations with United. However, a full agreement is still some distance away.",
      "The Telegraph reports that United are demanding £50million, while Chelsea are trying to reduce that figure to roughly £40m. The Blues' position is bolstered by Garnacho's strained relationship with manager Ruben Amorim, as well as United's need to generate funds.",
      "The Red Devils are close to securing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, a transfer that will push their summer expenditures near, if not past, £200m, following £130m spent on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Last season, Garnacho struggled for consistency despite achieving a personal best of 11 goals and 10 assists. His season was also marred by accusations of attitude problems, amplified by a public spat with Amorim.",
      "Though his reputation in England has suffered, Garnacho remains highly regarded internationally. He is still seen as a rare, promising talent – a view shared not only by Argentina team-mate Messi but also by several other Ballon d'Or recipients.",
      "Garnacho was nominated for last year's Kopa Trophy, awarded to the best player in the world under the age of 21. Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal won convincingly, but Garnacho gained support from several distinguished figures.",
      "According to L'Equipe, Messi was among three voters who placed Garnacho third, alongside Karim Benzema and German legend Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Dutch icon Marco van Basten ranked him second, underscoring the respect Garnacho commands despite his recent difficulties at United.",
      "Messi – who has won the Ballon d'Or a record eight times – has seen Garnacho's talent up close on international duty.",
      "Van Basten, a three-time Ballon d'Or winner (1988, 1989, and 1992), is widely considered one of football's all-time great forwards. Likewise, Rummenigge, a two-time recipient (1980 and 1981), is recognised as one of the finest attackers of his era, as is Benzema, the 2022 winner.",
      "If Garnacho moves to Chelsea, he will face stiff competition for playing time. Like United, Chelsea have revamped their attack this summer, bringing in Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, and Brazilian starlet Estevao. A potential transfer for RB Leipzig's creative midfielder Xavi Simons is also in the pipelines.",
      "Still, a move to Stamford Bridge would provide Garnacho with a fresh start and a significant challenge – just what he needs at this point in his career.",
      "At 21, he has plenty of time to grow and prove himself at the top level, but he will face intense pressure to deliver consistently, especially amid the fierce competition for spots in a squad determined to reassert itself among Europe's elite.",
      "Chelsea's aggressive recruitment highlights their goal to assemble a young, energetic attack, and Garnacho's speed and flair could make him an important part of that plan - if he can restore his focus and discipline.",
      "For now, Garnacho remains in limbo, but with silent support from some of football's greatest icons, the potential for a bright future is clearly still within his grasp.",

      "The Blues have already added Estevao Willian, Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro to their squad this summer, with Geovany Quenda also arriving next year, but more additions seem likely. They reportedly are negotiating with RB Leipzig to sign Xavi Simons, pursuing both Garnacho and the Netherlands international.",

      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is, but I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that, so it's not a problem.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt has praised Manchester United's signings in the summer transfer window.",
      "United began the transfer window by announcing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves. Cunha's release clause of £62.5million was triggered and he signed a five-year contract.",
      "Due to protracted negotiations, it took over a month to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, but a breakthrough was agreed before the USA tour and the forward arrived for £65million plus £6million in add-ons.",
      "Diego Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer window.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno to sign Leon.",
      "Speaking to club media in the USA, De Ligt shared his thoughts on the new additions and said: \"I think they have made a really good impression. Bryan [Mbeumo] has only been here a few days, so we can't say too much about him, but he's already scored some goals during training.",
      "\"I think we can be really happy with him. Matheus [Cunha] has been here for two weeks now and he's training really well. It's a new club and environment, but he's already been chatting and making jokes with teammates.",
      "\"I think that's a really good adaptation from him. Diego [Leon] is a little bit younger, but he is also a player with a lot of talent. He is really strong and physical. He comes from a different system, so tactically he has to learn a little bit, but all the physical and tactical abilities are with him to become a really good player.",
      "\"It's been a really good window and hopefully they can help us as much as possible.\"",
      "De Ligt competed against Cunha and Mbeumo last season and provided further insight.",
      "\"I think Matheus is a really technical player, with Brazilian flair, really good with the ball and really fast,\" he said. \"I didn't expect that. He scores goals and gives assists, so a really good addition.",
      "\"Bryan is more efficient; he just needs one action to go to his left foot, and he'll score. I think this is one of the biggest qualities in football, the ability to score and I think he can really help us with that.\"",
      "Reflecting on his first season in Manchester after signing from Bayern Munich, De Ligt added: \"I feel there’s still a lot more to come. Sometimes me and other football fans forget I’m still 25, and as a centre-back you’re normally in your prime at 28 or 29, so in that way, I’m still quite young.",
      "“Personally, I’d love to carry on from how I was in March, April – I feel that is the level I could show and should show on a consistent basis. That’s my personal goal, and also to stay fit, that is really important.",
      "\"And then the goal with the team is to really show everybody what it is to play for United, and to get a positive vibe again around the team and the club.",
      "“We want to show the fans what United is and that we want to win every game. It’s a nice feeling to start over again, because it gives you a clean slate, and hopefully from the start we can really get these positive vibes back.”",

      "Manchester United reportedly ‘could be next’ in terms of making contact for ‘one of the hottest names in European football’ after Tottenham were said to have failed with a bid for him.",
      "United have focussed on attacking reinforcements so far this summer. They have done well in adding some: first Matheus Cunha, then Bryan Mbeumo to improve the wide positions.",
      "Now, the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko – who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season – looks imminent to round out the attack.",
      "Once that move is complete, though finances might make it a struggle, United could look to improve the midfield. Caught Offside reports attention could be turned there, with Como midfielder Nico Paz looking ideal to add both quality and creativity to the Red Devils.",
      "After Tottenham began contact for the transfer, the report suggests United and Chelsea ‘could be next’. They state there could be a battle between the three sides for ‘one of the hottest names in European football’.",
      "Paz, in his first season with Como, scored six goals and assisted nine more in 35 games, and had his former side Real Madrid looking at him for a while before they reportedly opted against bringing him back.",
      "Paz is said to be valued around €70million (£60.6m), with it suggested there is a clause in place for him, as the report states Como would like to agree a new contract to remove those so they can cash in on him for more.",
      "Reports have suggested that Tottenham have already opened the bidding for Paz, at €40million (£34.6m) and it was said it was rejected, but those reports have been denied by Spurs sources.",
      "Though United are said to be showing strong interest, it seems it would be difficult for them to pay a big sum, given they have already parted with around £130million this summer, and another £74million will leave their account for Sesko.",
      "Chelsea too have paid big money for a lot of players this season, but they have also registered big sales, such as Noni Madueke and Joao Felix.",
      "As such, they might well be able to finance a deal for Paz, beating their Premier League rivals to the Spaniard’s signature.",
      "The report does also suggest there is a chance Real could activate their buyback clause for Paz, which is said to be much lower than what Como currently value him at.",
      "It rises by €1million each year, but will only reach €10million (£8.6m) by 2027, according to reports, so while Real are said to have left the scene for now, they might well be back at any point if Como don’t sell Paz."

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United flop ‘insists’ on staying at the club despite them having ‘definitively opened doors’ to his exit.",
      "United are moving to improve upon a 15th-placed Premier League finish last term. They have signed two quality Premier League attackers in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, and are closing in on RB Leipzig star striker Benjamin Sesko, who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "Current United striker Rasmus Hojlund‘s future has been up in the air all summer, with United reported at times to be unsure whether to keep him or let him go after he struggled massively in front of goal last season.",
      "Transfer insider Romano has revealed that United have opted for something in the middle of those two options, as they have ‘definitively opened doors’ for his loan exit, but there’s a twist.",
      "Indeed, Romano suggests that Hojlund ‘insists on staying at United’.",
      "He states AC Milan are in contact with his agents to advance for the deal, with the Red Devils angling for a loan fee of €6million (£5.2m) as well as having Hojlund’s full salary covered.",
      "But there seems a chance the striker could refuse the move in order to prove himself at United. That would be hard, though, as opportunities are likely to be limited after last season’s four-goal Premier League return, and the presence of current striker Joshua Zirkzee and soon Sesko, too.",
      "United’s thoughts on Hojlund have changed recently, too, as Romano said of late: “Højlund is saying, obviously, that he wants to stay at Manchester United, he wants to fight for his place, but if Man United sign a top striker like Sesko, Højlund can still leave the club.",
      "“No one from Man United told Højlund, ‘you have to go, you have to leave,’ but obviously if a top striker like Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, for Højlund it could be time to go and leave the club.",
      "“Don’t forget the interest from Italy, especially from AC Milan, who are looking for a striker. At the moment, financially, it’s still considered too expensive; it’s not the only option, because Milan are also considering a move for Dusan Vlahovic.”",
      "That differs from their current stance that the door is open for the striker to leave.",
      "Following on from that, it’s been suggested that Milan’s view is they’re ready to sign Hojlund, with United happy to see him go, but there’s been no green light from him, and it looks like it will stay that way.",
      "A new report has revealed when Rasmus Hojlund lost the support of Manchester United’s dressing room, while four concerns have come to light.",
      "Man Utd have ‘agreed a loan deal’ for Rasmus Hojlund with AC Milan in ‘pole position’ to get a deal over the line for the striker, according to reports.",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent arrival means one Man Utd star is ‘resigned’ to the exit in a stunning ‘waste of investment’.",
      "Man Utd are buying another Rasmus Hojlund this summer as Benjamin Sesko will “need to adapt” to the Premier League, according to Rene Meulensteen.",
      "A new report has revealed Manchester United’s next signing after Benjamin Sesko as they have ‘three deals to complete’ in the coming weeks.",
      "Man Utd will ‘end up’ signing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko this summer despite Newcastle’s latest bid, according to reports."

      "",
      "19) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are back in for the England defender after a failed pursuit last summer. Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £40m but Liverpool remain his preferred destination. And we wouldn’t be surprised to see Chelsea enter the race now Levi Colwill is crocked.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Bradley Barcola – PSG to Liverpool\nReports in France suggest Barcola is being considered as an alternative to Alexander Isak now that Darwin Nunez is on his way. But there are also suggestions that the Reds are not on the 23-year-old’s tail so we very much doubt this is a go-er. Nunez will be replaced, though.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "16) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Anyone\nIt was reported ages ago that an agreement had been reached with Juventus but nothing happened. Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens. This will almost certainly go the way we expected it to: a loan move, late in the window when United get desperate to shift Sancho’s salary. At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",
      "MORE: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nOoh. Baleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But we just can’t see it this summer.",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation.",
      "",
      "13) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nEverton want to give Grealish the get-out he needs from City but the Toffees will have to haggle hard over who pays the bulk of the winger’s wages since he currently earns well over double that of their highest earner. We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",
      "",
      "12) Samu Aghehowa – Porto to Newcastle\nVilla were interested before they spent £26million on Evann Guessand and we know Porto will sell if the price is right, so this could be a go-er. Assuming Newcastle bank a fee for Isak, Porto will want as close as possible to the £86million release clause in the 21-year-old’s contract. Or at least something like the Toon were willing to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. And the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Andrea Berta will doubtless spend weeks haggling over the number of instalments and Arsenal could really do with selling to make room in the squad and on the books for Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. Brentford want that to lose another of their top players and they can see the desperation dripping off Newcastle.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made a week ago and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. But we doubt this is dead yet. And it is in Newcastle’s interest to drag it out beyond August 25th.",

      "",
      "8) 🆕 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be around £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "7) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the one-time Arsenal target. Banking £20million for Broja will help.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThe Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Talks are now ‘advancing’ between Chelsea and United. The Red Devils want at least £40million having watched Noni Madueke move for more.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nAndoni Iraola is going to be very short at the back for his side’s Premier League opener against Liverpool. Zabarnyi is set to follow Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen out of Bournemouth this summer.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Mads Hermansen – Leicester to West Ham\nIt was going to be Big John Victor, but the “disgraceful” Hammers transfer team shifted to original number-one target Hermansen at the eleventh hour. Poor John. West Ham are reportedly closing in on the Leicester ‘keeper for £18m.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nA deal has been agreed with Al-Hilal to take Nunez to Saudi for £56million. PIF paying Liverpool big money – over the odds? –  so they can buy Alexander Isak is quite the situation. Given Nunez was so keen to remain in Europe, this one could have a twist yet.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko is in Manchester for a medical with United while Newcastle wipe more custard from their chops. It’s a win for the Red Devils but not all of us are convinced…",

      "The Red Devils paid around £64m plus add-ons to sign Hojlund from Serie A outfit Atalanta during the 2023 summer transfer window.",
      "Hojlund was targeted as an alternative to Harry Kane and the inexperienced did an admirable job of handling the responsibility of being United’s only fit striker during his debut season, scoring 16 goals in all competitions in 2023/24.",
      "However, the striker’s form fell off a cliff during the 2024/25 campaign as he became devoid of all confidence and struggled to do the basics as he was regularly criticised.",

      "It has even been suggested that the forward already has an agreement with a Serie A club with the view to leaving the Premier League giants on loan, though it remains to be seen whether this is legitimate.",
      "‘Hojlund was always destined to fail. Switching to the same agency that represented Erik ten Hag marked his card with some teammates.",
      "‘One United player shook their head at the mention of Hojlund. Another lamented how few tackles he won, his lack of pressing and aerial sickness. A senior figure at the club questioned Hojlund’s work rate.’",
      "Luke Shaw is another Man Utd player whose long-term future is in doubt, with club legend Paul Scholes insisting he needs to change positions.",

      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent arrival means one Man Utd star is ‘resigned’ to the exit in a stunning ‘waste of investment’.",

      "“He’s got a release clause which decreases the closer it gets to the end of his Bayern Munich contract. So he could be available from January for around £56million, which would be a bargain for Kane.",

      "“The question I would have is whether he’s going to be prepared to step back into the Premier League. But you also have to ask about the finances involved, and where the £54million is coming from.",
      "“If that’s going to come from player sales, the likes of Kobbie Mainoo or Alejandro Garnacho, then that’s not worth doing in my opinion.",

      "Liverpool, Manchester United, Man City and Real Madrid have all incorporated recycled plastic into their kits but more needs to be done for sustainability.",
      "",
      "Football kits have morphed from humble cotton shirts into technological, fashion-driven apparel packed with synthetic fibres.",
      "But beneath the slick designs and vibrant club badges lies a hidden environmental cost.",
      "Most kits are made from polyester, a plastic derived from fossil fuels that is notorious for its carbon footprint, microplastic shedding and waste generation. Major brands such as Adidas, Nike and Puma have unveiled sustainability initiatives. Yet questions remain about whether these efforts meaningfully change the game or simply greenwash it.",
      "From microplastic pollution to soaring carbon emissions and textile waste, the synthetic nature of modern football kits is problematic. Washing polyester garments releases tiny plastic particles into waterways, entering the food chain.",
      "It is estimated that only about nine per cent of all plastic is ever recycled. Most persists in the environment for centuries, as microplastics break down into smaller and smaller particles. Recycling and reuse may not be an adequate solution.",
      "“Recycling is the mop,” Jacqueline Savitz of Oceana, a non-profit organisation dedicated to protecting and restoring the world’s oceans, told PBS. “We need to first turn off the faucet.”",
      "The carbon cost of virgin polyester is also high. Producing new polyester consumes significant energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, while the fast turnaround of kit releases – driven by fan demand, marketing and trends – adds to the mountain of textile waste. Simply recycling used kits doesn’t address this systemic overproduction.",
      "Brand initiatives tackle some of these issues. Adidas, for example, launched the Primeblue and Primegreen programmes in collaboration with Parley for the Oceans, using recycled ocean plastic in their performance fabrics. Primeblue contains Parley Ocean Plastic, while Primegreen contains no virgin plastic. These fabrics were designed to help Adidas meet their commitment to eliminate virgin polyester use by the end of last year and reduce their carbon footprint by 30 per cent by 2030.",
      "In 2024, Adidas reported that 99 per cent of all polyester used in their products was recycled, painting a picture of early achievement of their goals.",
      "Nike’s sustainability push is centred on their “Move to Zero” campaign, which aims to reduce carbon, waste and reliance on virgin materials. Nike has produced kits composed of recycled polyester made from plastic bottles, diverting vast amounts of waste from landfill. These garments featured prominently in Liverpool’s recent kits before their switch to Adidas, aligning brand efforts with the club’s own sustainability objectives.",
      "Similarly, Puma have introduced their RE:FIBRE initiative, which recycles textile waste into new performance garments and pledges to reach 75 per cent recycled polyester use by 2025 across their products, including football kits.",
      "These efforts have influenced club policies. As well as Liverpool’s Nike kit including recycled polyester derived from plastic bottles, Manchester City’s Puma kits use materials from the RE:FIBRE program, reflecting a circular-economy approach driven by their sponsor’s sustainability targets. These partnerships are seen as aligning manufacturers’ material choices with club branding and green credentials.",
      "MORE ON SUSTAINABILITY IN FOOTBALL\n👉 Fan climate activism on the rise from Dortmund to Brentford and beyond\n👉 Youth academies stand ready to be football’s unsung eco-heroes\n👉 How non-league clubs are putting the Premier League to shame with eco charge",
      "Fan sentiment and market forces are playing their part, too. According to a study by Sport Positive Leagues, clubs that adopted kits made from recycled materials saw a significant uptick in positive feedback, indicating growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products.",
      "But the path forward is thorny. Using recycled polyester still means reliance on plastic. While Adidas and Puma reduce dependency on virgin polyester, the end-product is still synthetic fabric. Critics note that recycled polyester may not match the performance properties of virgin polymers precisely, though most advances in fabric engineering now close that gap. Brands may also overstate sustainability claims, with limited third-party certification or product lifecycle transparency.",
      "Industry observers stress that while recycled polyester reduces waste and carbon emissions compared to virgin polyester, it perpetuates a plastic-dependent model unless broader systemic change occurs. Performance trade-offs also remain a concern at the elite level – especially in high-wicking, breathable kits designed for extreme physical exertion. Fabric rebirth may necessitate compromises.",
      "Transparency is another hurdle. Brands release sustainability milestones, but independent verification is less common. Adidas’ claim of 96 per cent recycled polyester is laudable, yet independent auditors and lifecycle assessments are limited in public view. Consumers may not know how ocean plastic was collected, where recycling processes occurred or what happens at end-of-life for the garments themselves.",
      "Ultimately, sustainability in football fashion is caught at the intersection of ecology, economics and consumer culture. Big brands have undeniably propelled recycled materials into flagship football kits, driving clubs to align with sustainability narratives.",
      "Adidas’ Parley initiative brought recycled ocean plastic into jerseys worn by Manchester United and Real Madrid, signalling symbolic and practical change. Nike’s Move to Zero and Puma’s RE:FIBRE similarly reflect an industry-wide shift towards circularity.",

      "Most of United’s squad underperformed, but Fernandes is one player who can hold his head high after last season, as he carried his teammates for most of the campaign.",
      "Despite this, Fernandes looked likely to leave Man Utd at the start of this summer’s transfer window amid interest from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal ahead of the Club World Cup.",

      "It is also pointed out that this deal would set up a ‘reunion’ with Cristiano Ronaldo. Also, while the ‘decision to stay at Man Utd likely puts any talk of a transfer to bed this summer, that won’t stop the Saudi clubs from trying again in the near future’.",
      "Football Insider’s Pete O’Rourke suspects “clubs will continue to keep tabs on Fernandes”, with any potential deal deemed unlikely until next summer.",

      "“Earlier this summer, Fernandes rejected a lucrative offer to join Al Hilal. They made an attempt to sign the Portuguese international for over £80million, so it was a huge deal.",
      "“They wanted him ahead of the Club World Cup but they weren’t able to get a deal done because Fernandes decided to stay with Manchester United. I think it’ll be a similar situation now for Al-Nassr.",
      "“I don’t see any move happening this summer, but that doesn’t mean this interest will go away. He would be a dream signing for the Saudi Pro League, and I’m sure those clubs will continue to keep tabs on Fernandes.”",
      "David Ornstein said Liverpool target Alexander Isak would be back at Newcastle this week but The Sun have been entirely caught off guard by it.",

      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes is reportedly set to make a U-turn and show a desire to join Cristiano Ronaldo and Joao Felix at Al-Nassr this summer.",

      "Newcastle had been working on a deal for Sesko, and on Tuesday made a second bid of £69.7m plus add-ons, which was higher than Manchester United's - after an initial offer of just under £70m (€80m) plus add-ons.",
      "United are understood to be delighted with the deal they have struck with RB Leipzig. They did not want to get embroiled in a bidding war with Newcastle - and are paying less up front than Newcastle's improved second bid.",

      "The 22-year-old was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker, who told his team-mates that he will be leaving, trained indoors away from the team at Leipzig's training complex on Tuesday.",
      "Manchester United's agreement for Sesko could have ramifications for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.",

      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",

      "It is understood Leipzig are also interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",

      "Man Utd have agreed a deal to sign RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko ahead of rivals Newcastle; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Thursday 7 August 2025 16:00, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest ended after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Manchester United are now close to signing the Slovenian forward, having beaten Newcastle to his signature.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who look set to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",

      "Match report as Man Utd wrap up a Premier League Summer Series win with a 2-2 draw against Everton; Bruno Fernandes scored a penalty and Mason Mount was also on target; Iliman Ndiaye scored for Everton before an Ayden Heaven own goal",
      "Monday 4 August 2025 14:44, UK",
      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes was critical of Man Utd's \"lazy\" display in their 2-2 Premier League Summer Series draw with Everton before calling for further reinforcements in the transfer window.",
      "Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",

      "When asked about the success of Man Utd's tour to America and the display against Everton, Fernandes said: \"It's been positive. It's been positive to be together to create a bond between the players.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way,\" The United skipper added. \"Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",

      "The positives for United against Everton was a first appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford.",
      "He combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha on a number of occasions during the first half, showing the benefit of new additions to the squad.",
      "However, the United skipper called for more reinforcements when asked if the club was where it needed to be heading into the new season.",
      "\"It's improving,\" he said. \"But it's not the place it needs to be.",
      "\"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
      "\"You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.",
      "\"The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.",
      "\"It's not only the winning mentality that we need but it is other things too that the club are trying to improve like the facilities, the team, the staff and a lot of other things.",
      "\"A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.",
      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
      "\"I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.",
      "\"We are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].\"",
      "Reflecting on Mbeumo's debut, Amorim added: \"He played well. He needs to understand the position, the movement but the first touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in the perfect condition physically but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team so everything I was expecting, he delivered.\"",
