      "Morgan Schneiderlin was signed by Louis van Gaal at Manchester United in 2015, helping the Red Devils win the FA Cup before falling out of favour under Jose Mourinho",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin has announced his retirement from football aged 34.",
      "Schneiderlin spent 18 months at Old Trafford after joining from Southampton in 2015 and won the FA Cup. The £25million signing also made a total of 47 appearances for United, most of which came during his first season under Louis van Gaal.",
      "After Jose Mourinho took charge, Schneiderlin soon found himself out of favour and moved to Everton in January 2017, where he spent the next three-and-a-half years. A move to Nice in his homeland of France followed before a loan spell with Australian outfit Western Sydney Wanderers.",
      "Schneiderlin signed for Turkish club Konyaspor August 2023 but had his contract terminated by mutual agreement just nine days later. The Frenchman quickly found his next destination and played for Greek side AE Kifisia last season, his third move in the last two years.",
      "After his contract expired in June, Schneiderlin took time to consider his future and on Friday announced the end of his nomadic career via Instagram. \"For me, the chapter as a football player is coming to an end, which is why, before I start writing a new chapter in my professional career, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude,\" the 15-time France international wrote.",
      "\"Thank you to Racing Club de Strasbourg, who gave me an opportunity at the age of five, and where I stayed until I was 18. Thank you to the coaches I encountered from my youngest age there, thank you to the Racing training centre, thank you to those who believed in me.",
      "\"Thank you to Southampton FC, I truly spent my best years with you. Thank you to Manchester United, one of the greatest clubs in the world. Thank you to Everton FC, thank you to OGC Nice, thank you to Sydney Wanderers, thank you to Kifisia FC.\"",
      "Your turn! Was Morgan Schneiderlin underrated at Manchester United? Join the debate in the comments section",
      "Having helped Southampton reach the Premier League and establish themselves as a top-flight side, Schneiderlin's move to Van Gaal's United was seen as somewhat of a coup. The 34-year-old wasn't fancied by new manager Jose Mourinho, though, and in late 2016 he asked to join Everton, a decision which he'd go on to regret.",
      "\"I learned a lot from my departure from Manchester United. I had played 40 matches the previous season with Manchester,\" Schneiderlin told L'Equipe. \"When I come back from the Euros, I take ten days off and I play very little for three, four months. Then, I have Ronald Koeman and Everton who are pushing hard to get me, every day, from October.",
      "\"I will remember it all my life: I should have played against Liverpool, starter, and the coach (Mourinho) comes to see me. He tells me he doesn't feel me inside the group. I tell him that indeed, with what has happened in the last three months, I am not in it and I want to go to Everton. I regretted it very quickly.\"",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy is already showing his expertise in man-management after joining Erik ten Hag's coaching staff this summer.",
      "The former Manchester United sharpshooter returned to the club in an assistant role having already started his own managerial career with PSV Eindhoven, before departing the Eredivisie club little over 12 months ago do to lack of support. The Red Devils recruited the 48-year-old with hope he could help reinstill a winning mentality at Old Trafford.",
      "While that will include ensuring that lofty demands are met each day for the 13-time Premier League champions, Van Nistelrooy has shown after just one game he has the ability to put an arm around the shoulder. After United's 1-0 win over Fulham, the ex-Netherlands international came onto the pitch to greet players, putting an arm around goalscorer Joshua Zirkzee, and also embracing Andre Onana.",
      "The Dutchman made a beeline for Alejandro Garnacho following the full time whistle however, with the young winger looking frustrated, far away from the dugout. After arriving on the field as a substitute, the 20-year-old provided an assist for Zirkzee but was left to rue a dreadful miss in stoppage time with only Bernd Leno to beat.",
      "Van Nistelrooy quickly noticed Garnacho's reaction and made his way to the player to clasp hands and share a few words. The Argentina ace still trudged into the tunnel but it was a moment of class from the coach.",
      "Though Garnacho was left discontented, Zirkzee was much happier with his cameo. The former Bologna forward produced an impressive strike in the 87th minute to start life at Old Trafford on a very positive note.",
      "The 23-year-old described his move as a 'dream' thus far. \"To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn't be better,\" he told Sky Sports.",
      "\"I've been told [scoring at the Stretford End] is one of the best feelings at Man Utd. I'm so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It's an amazing feeling.",
      "\"At the end of the day we got the win, that's all we wanted. I can't really explain the feeling, it's just very nice. I feel very warm here. It's a great team. We want to achieve something great. It's been amazing, it's been a dream actually.",

      "Phil Jones spent 12 years at Manchester United following his move from Blackburn Rovers, helping the Red Devils to win the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League",
      "Phil Jones has announced his retirement from football at the age of 32.",
      "The defender spent 12 years as a senior player at Old Trafford after moving from fellow top-flight side Blackburn Rovers. He made 229 appearances for the Red Devils and won the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa league.",
      "However, the ex-England centre-back managed just 13 appearances in his final three seasons at United due to a slew of long-term injuries. The defender left as a free agent in 2023, then spent the following season in a coaching role with the Red Devils’ academy.",
      "And in an interview with the BBC on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Premier League, the former Blackburn starlet officially confirmed his playing days were behind him as he pursues a new venture in coaching.",
      "“My career finished shorter than I would have liked,” said Jones, who won 27 caps for England. \"[I'm] glass half full. [I have] completed my A licence and I want to get out there and challenge myself in coaching.",
      "\"Ultimately I want to take charge of a team. I am determined to get there.\" Jones added: \"I did everything I could [to return to playing] but with so many rehabs I was coming back from, it has an effect on you and your family.\"",
      "A product of Blackburn’s youth system, Jones’ move to United from Blackburn materialised after the defender’s impressive performance in a 1-1 draw between the sides on the day United clinched the title under manager Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "The Scottish manager was reportedly impressed with the teenage defender’s precocious conviction and leadership skills. In the summer of 2011, Jones signed for United in a £16.5million deal, after which Ferguson claimed he could go on to be the club’s greatest ever player.",
      "\"The way he is looking, he could be our best ever player,\" Ferguson said. \"He may be one of the best players we have ever had, no matter where we play him. At 21 years of age, he is going to be a phenomenal player. He can play anywhere on the pitch. He has such a massive influence, with his instinct and reading of the game.\"",

      "Liverpool are the only Premier League club that has yet to make a signing this summer, and Manchester United could be set to hijack their first signing - and Jadon Sancho has a role to play",
      "Jadon Sancho’s future could hold the key to Manchester United hijacking Liverpool ’s move for Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "It is understood Liverpool have already agreed personal terms with Mamardashvili, 23, who starred for Georgia in their run to the last 16 of Euro 2024.",
      "The deal could be the first signing of the Arne Slot era, but sources say the 6ft 6in keeper is also very much open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "United, who beat visitors Fulham 1-0 on Friday night in the Premier League ’s season opener, are long-time admirers of Mamardashvili but need to trim their squad before bringing in new faces.",
      "And the sale of winger Sancho, 24, who was banished back to Borussia Dortmund on loan in January after a bitter fall-out with boss Erik ten Hag, would give United significant room for manoeuvre.",
      "Sancho’s position remains uncertain, with Chelsea among those said to be interested in him, while he has also been linked with a swap deal to Paris Saint-Germain which would see Manuel Ugarte head to Old Trafford. Despite his absence on Friday night, Ten Hag stressed his absence from the squad for the Fulham game was only due to an ear infection.",
      "With superstar forward Kylian Mbappe now at Real Madrid, reinforcements are needed out wide at PSG, and Sancho, once touted to be one of Europe’s great wide-men, has caught their eye.",
      "The only issue surrounding the deal may be United's lack of PSR wiggle room, as they have already spent big on Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee, and Matthijs de Ligt during this window – so a sale would be preferable. The deal remains an unlikely one, but it could develop amid talks that reportedly began two weeks ago.",
      "Mamardashvili joined Valencia, initially on loan, in the summer of 2021 from Dinamo Tbilisi in his native country, and still has three years left on his contract with the La Liga club.",
      "Mamardashvili, meanwhile, has urged Valencia not to price him out of a dream move to Liverpool. The La Liga club are demanding £34million for the 23-year-old - and that asking price has proved too rich for the Reds. Liverpool have been unwilling to go beyond a package worth £30million, including add-ons for a player who will be No 2 behind Alisson.",
      "Now Mamardashvili's advisers have urged Valencia to break the negotiating deadlock so that a deal can be done. The hope is that a compromise can be reached which would see Liverpool pay an initial £30million, with a small package of bonuses based on appearances.",
      "There is a growing belief that Mamardashvili will become new Kop boss Arne Slot's first signing. The former Dinamo Tbilisi stopper was outstanding for Georgia at the Euros before they bowed out in the last 16 with a 4-1 defeat at the hands of Spain.",
      "His arrival would mean Caoimhin Kelleher is surplus to requirements at Anfield, but there is no shortage of interest in the talented Irishman.",

Carragher and Neville, meanwhile, believe both their former clubs will finish third and have decided to put their money where their mouths are.",

      "Carragher also believes United must \"make Old Trafford a fortress again\" if they are to compete this season, having suffered 19 defeats at home last season across all competitions. \"Manchester United have to start really well,\" he told Sky Sports.",
      "\"It's obvious the hierarchy were looking for a new manager in the summer and they couldn't quite find one so they stuck with the manager they had. He's been allowed to make signings and spend money this summer, but that is the nature of being Manchester United boss.",
      "\"He'll know, and I’m sure everyone at the club will know, that the pressure will intensify if they don't make a good start, starting against Fulham on Friday. Fulham beat them at Old Trafford last season so United know they have to be stronger at home this time around.",
      "\"They need to try and make Old Trafford a fortress again because they lost too many games last season – 19 in all competitions. That's far too many for a club the size and the stature of Manchester United.\"",

      "Manchester United kicked off the Premier League season with a win over Fulham but they remain without a number of experienced figures because of injuries sustained in pre-season",
      "Victor Lindelof has been pictured relying on crutches to walk as Manchester United ’s early season injury crisis shows no signs of abating.",
      "The Swedish centre back, who had been linked with a move away from Old Trafford earlier in the summer transfer window, missed the opening night win over Fulham.",
      "And he has since been spotted hobbling with the aid of a crutch - in a short video clip posted on Instagram by his wife Maja that included the short caption: “Doing everything in slow motion these days.”",
      "Lindelof is part of a walking-wounded list at Old Trafford also featuring new signing Leny Yoro, striker Rasmus Hojlund and left back Luke Shaw. But there remains a degree of mystery around the former's exact issue since head coach Erik ten Hag has not explained it.",
      "Lindelof was taken off in the pre-season friendly against Liverpool in the United States with the issue described as “precautionary.”",
      "But he was left out of the squad for last weekend’s Community Shield versus Manchester CIty and was not part of the group that edged out Fulham 1-0 thanks to debutant Josha Zirkzee’s late goal after coming off the bench.",
      "Zirkzee, a £36.5million signing from Bologna, said: “To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn’t be better. I’ve been told scoring at the Stretford End is one of the best feelings at Man United. I’m so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It’s an amazing feeling.",
      "“At the end of the day we got the win, that’s all we wanted. I can’t really explain the feeling, it’s just very nice. I feel very warm here. It’s a great team. We want to achieve something great. It’s been amazing, it’s been a dream actually.”",
      "Ten Hag named a back four featuring new signing Noussair Mazraoui while Matthijs de Ligt started on the bench. Asked about Zirkzee, the Dutch gaffer said: “Scoring for a striker is important and he should be where he was but he has more qualities and he has to get the right balance.",
      "“He has to be arriving in the box to get the finishes, but we also want him to link up. We have some great midfielders around him to make up combinations. It’s the first game, but it’s good to strengthen the belief. I’ve seen many spaces where we have to improve, but that’s normal.”",
      "Along with Lindelof’s injury, Yoro does not have a firm return date after breaking a foot in pre-season while Shaw is sidelined by a calf issue. Hojlund is expected to be missing for another month, while Tyrell Malacia is tipped to make a comeback in October after more than a year out following a serious knee injury. Academy product Will Fish also sustained a significant injury during pre-season.",

      "The Liverpool legend notably claimed Martinez, who is 5ft 9in, would struggle in the Premier League after he joined United back in 2022. \"We should never judge managers or players too early, but I'm convinced this can't work because the size of him playing in a back four,\" Carragher said.",
      "\"Maybe he could go left-back, maybe he could play in a back three, but in a back four, he cannot play there in the Premier League.\" And those comments were quickly referenced when Martinez joined a panel including Carragher, Gary Neville and Roy Keane following the win.",

      "Martinez then pointed at Carragher as he replied: \"You mean from him.\" Carragher then walked over to Martinez and the pair compared their heights, with Carragher joking: \"He is taller than me!\"",

He was heavily criticised and said he didn't play his best, but that type of personality to front it… he is a warrior, I thought he came across brilliantly.\"",

      "Garnacho got a half-hour run-out from the bench, making a telling contribution when his cross was turned home by Joshua Zirkzee for the winner. Joy soon turned to embarrassment, though, with the winger firing wide of an open goal when presented with a golden chance to make it 2-0.",
      "The Argentina international was visibly upset at full-time, having not had too long to reflect on his miss. However, Rashford was quick to console his team-mate.",
      "It was the second season in a row in which United have begun the campaign with a 1-0 win. Last season's opening weekend victory over Wolves was followed by a tricky run, though, and manager Erik ten Hag will hope things go rather better this time out.",
      "Speaking to the media after the win, United manager Erik ten Hag explained Garnacho and Zirkzee started on the bench because their international efforts saw them link up with the squad later than others. Garnacho was part of Argentina's Copa America winning squad, while Zirkzee was involved for the Netherlands as they reached the semi-finals of Euro 2024.",
      "\"I explained the same about Zirkzee, it is the same about Alejandro, you saw his background, he played in an FA Cup final and then in Copa America,\" Ten Hag said. \"He had one game and then he had his break. He needed a break and we had to bring him into the tour.",
      "\"Fitness-wise, it would have been the best decision to be in the tour, to work on his fitness. After a long season as a young player, he needed a break. He came late into pre-season and we have players in wide areas who have performed very well. That is why he started on the bench.\"",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva felt the game could have gone the other way. His Fulham side won at Old Trafford last season, but couldn't repeat the trick this time around.",
      "\"There were chances for Man United, we had some moments too, two against one, with Andreas Pereira and Alex (Iwobi) against Maguire that we should have done much better,\" he said. \"Four against two, three against two, so many counter attacks that with better decision, we have to create clear chances in that moment.",
      "\"In the last 10-15, minutes, the game went in the direction that we knew and the players, they were aware that you cannot let the game go in the emotional part. We know that is the part of the game where Man United are normal and they can punish, because the game is completely broken.

      "The Red Devils left it late but kicked off their 2024-25 Premier League campaign with a season-opening win over Fulham on Friday night. The game was heading towards a scoreless draw at Old Trafford - but summer signing Joshua Zirkzee ensured United would begin the campaign with a victory as he stretched to smartly direct home fellow substitute Alejandro Garnacho’s cross in the 87th minute.",
      "Ten Hag was understandably delighted following the result, and spoke to Sky Sports to give his thoughts to Keane, Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher. During the chat, it was Carragher and Neville who asked the majority of the questions, with Kelly Cates hosting Sky Sports' coverage.",
      "Near the end of the interview, Ten Hag noticed that Keane had yet to ask a question and the manager said: \"You’re quiet! You don’t want to kill the vibes?\" Man Utd legend Keane responded: \"Maybe next week!\"",
      "The pair then laughed, before former United midfielder Keane added: \"I'll be waiting. Just keep winning... No problem!\" Carragher and Neville awkwardly looked on before Ten Hag responded: \"So simple.\"",
      "Cates then brought Sky Sports' interview to an end, with Ten Hag seemingly in high spirits before parting ways with the three pundits. And the manager had plenty to smile about, having seen debutant Zirkzee hit the ground running.",
      "It was Zirkzee's first appearance for the Red Devils, having reported late for pre-season after going to Euro 2024 with the Netherlands and the former Bologna forward enjoyed a debut to cherish.",
      "“It is very good for a striker coming into Manchester United and to score the winning goal in his first game,” Ten Hag said. “I remember last season when Rasmus Hojlund in his first game scored a goal and we were all waiting on the halfway line, then VAR and after two minutes they came to the conclusion the ball was slightly over the line.",
      "“Then it took long (for him to score his first Premier League goal) and he was so frustrated. For him, it’s very pleasing, very happy for him and that will encourage him. That will give him belief. For the fans, for everyone – it’s a very good start.”",
      "Asked what made him want to sign Zirkzee, the United boss said: “There were more, he has some attributes we didn’t have. Straight (away) he showed it, but where he’s very good is his linking up, combinations.",
      "“We have some good ball-playing offensive players, so they can take benefit from this. But what I wanted to say is he has to arrive in the box and to score goals, because the main attribute from a striker is score goals and he did. If it’s then the winner, then it’s very pleasing for everyone.”",
      "Zirkzee was among three debutants on Friday night, with Noussair Mazraoui starting and Matthijs de Ligt brought off the bench following their Tuesday moves from Bayern Munich.",

But they are still actively pursuing more deals, with Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte the number one priority for Erik ten Hag with two weeks left of the window.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee came off the substitutes' bench alongside Alejandro Garnacho in the 61st minute - and the duo combined to score Manchester United's winner vs Fulham",
      "Joshua Zirkzee took just 28 minutes of his Manchester United career to show he could be the striker they so badly need.",
      "United looked like they would be frustrated in this opening Premier League encounter as Fulham soaked up everything they could throw at them. Erik ten Hag brought on Zirkzee for his debut with half an hour remaining and the super sub repaid him by making the all-important breakthrough with just three minutes remaining to earn a 1-0 win.",
      "It was a cool finish and suggests the Netherlands striker has more goals in him. Zirkzee, 23, scored 12 goals to help Bologna qualify for the Champions League last season and Ten Hag feels he can develop into the goalscorer they want.",
      "His timing was perfect and up until that moment it seemed the best striker United had brought in this summer was Ruud van Nistelrooy. Unfortunately the bespectacled Van Nistelrooy has long since retired and the 48-year-old is back at Old Trafford as Ten Hag’s new assistant manager.",
      "But compatriot Zirkzee, who grew up in The Netherlands pretending he was van Nistelrooy, could be the one. Goals are critical for United and their general play was good as England star Kobbie Mainoo buzzed about the pitch.",
      "Ten Hag will be delighted with this win and United have carried on the momentum from last season when they stunned Manchester City to win the FA Cup. They can improve and there was some rustiness about their display, which is understandable after ten Hag claimed they were not ready for the start of the new season. But they kept a clean sheet and Ten Hag blooded defenders Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "Fulham will be gutted to lose so late on after holding United so well and they had their moments on the counter. They began the brighter and the rocket-powered Adama Traore skinned Lisandro Martinez down the left before firing over from another opportunity.",
      "Debutant Emile Smith Rowe was pulling the strings in midfield for Fulham and Andre Onana made a fine right-handed save to touch away Kenny Tete’s 25-yard effort before it could nestle in the top corner.",
      "United were furious they had not been awarded a penalty seconds earlier when Amad Diallo went down under a challenge from Antonee Robinson, but referee Robert Jones ruled there was no illegal contact. United grew into the game and Bernd Leno saved from Bruno Fernandes after passing straight to Casemiro on the edge of his area with an errant ball.",
      "Casemiro fed Fernandes again and Leno did well to save his right-foot shot at close range. United kept pressing and Leno made another close-range save, this time from Mason Mount, before Mainoo fired just past the post from 20 yards out.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Fulham were still a threat and Rodrigo Muniz’s overhead kick came off Mainoo before Onana touched it over for a corner. They should have punished United on the break when they counter-attacked two on one, but Andreas Pereira picked out Harry Maguire instead of Alex Iwobi with a dreadful ball. United were living dangerously and Martinez did well to cut out Pereira’s dangerous ball from a swift counter.",
      "Then just as it seemed United would be frustrated, Alejandro Garnacho swung the ball in from the right and the fellow substitute beat Scott McTominay to score past Leno. Cue wild celebrations from the United fans as Zirkzee soaked up the love and he will hope that is the first of many times he will experience that.",

      "Gary Neville made his debut on NBC Sports as a pundit for Manchester United's Premier League opener against Fulham, but he was also on punditry duty for Sky Sports",
      "Gary Neville doubled up during the coverage of Manchester United and Fulham as he appeared on two broadcasts during the pre-match analysis of the Premier League opener.",
      "The former United captain is a regular on TV screens, dishing out analysis for Sky Sports and also featuring on Euro 2024's coverage. Yet, he amazed everyone by juggling appearances on both Sky Sports and NBC Sports' pre-game discussions.",
      "While he kicked off with Sky, alongside Roy Keane and Jamie Carragher, Neville vanished only to pop up on NBC's lineup alongside his old United teammate Tim Howard, presenter Rebecca Lowe, Robbie Earle and Robbie Mustoe. The appearance marked his first time on NBC, a move that was announced just a day prior, before Neville took to the gantry on co-commentary duty for the match.",
      "NBC calls Neville a \"special contributor\" for this season. While Sundays are flagged for his main insights, they couldn't resist debuting the Red Devils' icon as the new campaign sparked into life at Old Trafford.",
      "Neville was brutally honest about Manchester United's last season, saying to Sky: \"They were a mess everywhere. Injuries were a mess, the balance of the team was a mess, midfield was a mess, the amount of goals they conceded and shots they conceded, they didn't score goals. There was very little right about Manchester United last season at all. The only positive was the FA Cup success. They've got to change everything, it's got to be so much better.\"",
      "He went on to say that injuries and absentees cannot be an excuse for Erik ten Hag again this campaign, amid the Red Devils without Luke Shaw, Rasmus Hojlund, Leny Yoro, Jadon Sancho and Victor Lindelof for the opening game, Neville added: \"Injuries can't be an excuse for United this season. You are either signing the wrong players or doing the wrong training, that has to be removed as an excuse.\"",
      "Neville also praised the club's additions in the boardroom, with new executives CEO Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth, and technical director Jason Wilcox all arriving at Old Trafford this summer as part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' shake-up after they took control of the football side of the club.",
      "\"I feel more optimistic because of the changes at the top and the negligence has been disrupted,\" and highlighting the improved quality of recent signings: \"They have spent on the training ground but got some serious footballers in who are not going to make the same basic mistakes, the profile of player that has been signed is very different.\""

      "Erik ten Hag has admitted that Jadon Sancho was fit enough to play for Manchester United against Fulham but simply didn’t make the squad.",
      "Sancho came off the substitutes’ bench in the Community Shield defeat against Manchester City last weekend but was nowhere to be seen on Friday for the Premier League opener. Ten Hag opted to start with Amad on the right wing before introducing Alejandro Garnacho off the bench.",
      "His decision paid off, with Garnacho setting up the game’s only goal for fellow sub Joshua Zirkzee in the 87th minute at Old Trafford. Garnacho should have made it 2-0 in the final minutes but fluffed a simple chance after Marcus Rashford squared to leave him with an open goal.",
      "It was a positive start to the season for United, yet the absence of Sancho meant some awkward questions for Ten Hag to field in his post-match press conference. The Dutchman claims to have made peace with Sancho following last season’s falling out, but the winger could still leave in the closing stages of the summer transfer window.",
      "“First of all we need squad depth, this season will be survival of the fittest, I can only put 20 players in the squad,” Ten Hag said. “Then Jadon in the week had an ear infection, he was not 100 per cent fit. He could play but we made the choice, we preferred [to have] others on the bench. But that can change. It will change.",
      "“We can't play everyone the same, you see today how important the subs are. Sometimes frustrating for the player, but it's about team, club, there will be more players in this position, we expect them to fight for the club.”",
      "Speaking in July, Ten Hag said of Sancho: “As we said, we've drawn the line. Manchester United needs good players and Jadon is a good player. We have drawn that line and we move on.” But the club are now actively trying to move the 24-year-old winger on.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are interested in signing Sancho after he showed glimpses of his old self during last season’s loan spell at Borussia Dortmund. And United are trying to use that interest as a way of landing PSG midfielder Manuel Ugarte, who is their number one target after bringing in Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui for around £150million.",
      "Sancho is keen to leave Old Trafford behind but his £250,000-a-week wages could once again prove to be a stumbling block for him. PSG are one of the few clubs who could afford to take him, having lost Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid this summer.",

      "Erik ten Hag is convinced that there is more to come from Joshua Zirkzee after his summer signing scored on his Manchester United debut.",
      "Zirkzee came off the bench to score the winner in United’s 1-0 victory against Fulham on Friday night to give Ten Hag a positive start to the season. The 23-year-old striker signed from Bologna for £36million this summer and hit the ground running by converting Alejandro Garnacho’s cross in the 87th minute.",
      "His impact was much-needed for United, who had lacked a cutting edge until Zirkzee was introduced in the 61st minute alongside Garnacho. Bruno Fernandes was twice denied by Bernd Leno, while Mason Mount also spurned a good chance.",
      "\"Subs are always important and it was good to see in the first game that you bring a sub on and he scores the winner,” Ten Hag told Sky Sports. \"Everyone sees how important subs are and they have to be ready.”",
      "Asked about Zirkzee’s playing style, Ten Hag went into detail about the Dutchman, who will have to shoulder the burden up front while Rasmus Hojlund is unavailable. “Scoring for strikers is important,” Ten Hag said.",
      "“And he should be there where he was, to finish, to kill, but he has more qualities so he has to get the right balance. We have to work with him – I think that is one of the things I spoke with him about. He has to arrive in the box to get his finishes.",
      "“Of course, we want him to link up also. For that attribute, we bought him and he has great qualities to make that link-up play. We have some great midfielders around him who we can make combinations so we can take control of the game.”",
      "Zirkzee also earned praise from Roy Keane, who was very impressed with the technique of his deft finish. “I thought it was a really good finish. Joshua Zirkzee's link-up was neat and tidy,” Keane said. “It was a lovely goal and for a new player to come to a club and score on your debut, it's huge.”",
      "The Dutchman had a huge grin on his face when presented with the player of the match award. \"To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn't be better,” he said.",
      "\"I've been told [scoring at the Stretford End] is one of the best feelings at Man United. I'm so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It's an amazing feeling.",

      "\"The manager told me to bring an energy and help the team as much as possible, just that. Manchester United is a huge club. You should always strive for the best. That includes day by day giving 100 per cent, that's the plan. It's all good vibes.\"",

      "Ben Chilwell is edging closer to the Chelsea exit door after Enzo Maresca indicated the left-back is free to leave the club in pursuit of regular playing time - something he cannot offer at Stamford Bridge",
      "Enzo Maresca has told Ben Chilwell he is free to leave Chelsea.  The 27-year-old left-back has played just 64 minutes throughout pre-season and was an unused substitute in last weekend's 1-1 friendly draw against Inter Milan.  And Maresca has indicated the player does not feature within his plans, declaring: \"At this moment, Chilly is with us. He has not been training in the past two days because he was a little bit ill.  \"With Chilly it's quite clear, I love the way he trains, I love the way he is but the problem is that he struggles with us a little bit to find his best position.",
      "\"When you train everyday and you don't get minutes, it's not good for them and it's not good for me because I need to make decisions. For some players, it's sometimes better to leave and to go somewhere to get minutes. We will see what happens, the transfer window is open and we will see what happens.\"  It's been a tough summer for Chilwell, who was also left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for the European Championships. Marc Cucurella has made the left-back role his own in west London since nailing down a starting berth last season under Mauricio Pochettino, when he flourished as an inverted full-back. Manchester United are among the clubs in the market for a left-back and they are believed to be tracking Chilwell amid a host of other possible options.",
      "Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia have both failed to prove their fitness ahead of the 2024-25 campaign as new signing Noussair Mazraoui was drafted in as a makeshift solution against Fulham.  Chilwell did not feature in any of Chelsea's final three pre-season friendlies and the club are now open to offers, even though he is yet to be drafted into Maresca's 'bomb squad' - a collection of players that have been frozen out of the first-team picture.  Meanwhile, the Italian tactician refused to be drawn on links to Victor Osimhen and Joao Felix, stating: \"The only thing I can say is they are not our players, so it is not correct for me to talk about a Napoli player or an Atletico Madrid player. At this moment, the club knows exactly what I think in terms of what we need.\"  Chelsea remain in talks with Atletico over a move for Felix as if they fail to agree a transfer deal for the Portuguese attacker, Conor Gallagher's move in the opposite direction will collapse altogether and they will risk losing him on a free next summer, which could have damaging implications for FFP.",

      "MANCHESTER UNITED 1-0 FULHAM: Joshua Zirkzee climbs off the bench to score on his United debut to give Erik ten Hag's side a winning start to their Premier League campaign at Old Trafford",
      "Joshua Zirkzee scored on debut to give Manchester United victory over Fulham on the opening day of the Premier League season.",
      "United have splashed £150million on four new signings in the summer transfer window - and it was Zirkzee, a £36m arrival from Bologna, who made the difference. The Dutchman turned in fellow substitute Alejandro Garnacho's cross late on to win it for Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "The goal came at the perfect time for United, who had otherwise looked uninspired at Old Trafford, but did have the better chances through Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount.",
      "United started sluggishly but mustered the only two real chances of the first half only for Fernandes to twice be denied by Bernd Leno after being played in by Casemiro. Mount tested Leno again but Fulham looked to be holding on for a point before Zirkzee's impact. Here are the talking points.",
      "When the team sheet arrived at the new time of 75 minutes before kick-off, there was a brief glance to wonder how United would set up. The answer was: like they did in the FA Cup final win at the end of last season.",
      "With Rasmus Hojlund unavailable and Joshua Zirkzee on the bench, Ten Hag opted for the now tried and tested formation of 4-2-2-2, or a narrow 4-4-4, depending on how you view it. With Marcus Rashford and Amad wide, the idea is that Fernandes and Mason Mount test the Fulham backline with runs into the box.",
      "The strikerless formation took time to get going, but did show how it can function when Casemiro slid in Fernandes for the best chance of the first half. In general, though, it showed how important having a centre-forward will be for United this season, as the first half fizzled out.",
      "Most of Fulham's threat came down the right-hand side in the form of Adama Traore. His pace is well-known in the Premier League, but it is still very hard to defend against - and United struggled at times.",
      "There were just seven minutes on the clock when the former Wolves winger breezed past two United defenders, including Lisandro Martinez but couldn't pick out a team-mate in the middle. Martinez learned his lesson and ushered Traore out in a similar position.",
      "Yet the threat of Traore's pace on the break was constant - and with Dalot pushing up high on the left, there were some nervy moments for the home side.",
      "United's narrow box midfield has some benefits - it helps the team press from the front and can cause overloads in midfield - but there were also some clear weaknesses on show.",
      "They mainly came on the counter-attack, with Fulham's best moments coming when they won back the ball with United out of shape. This happened on a handful of times, and they were very fortunate not to concede at least one goal.",
      "Andreas Pereira fluffed a brilliant opportunity when he failed to find Alex Iwobi when two on one with Harry Maguire. And Martinez cleared Pereira's low cross after an Alejandro Garnacho dive at the other end left his side short-staffed. Ten Hag needs to iron out the mistakes, otherwise his team are going to pay the price this season.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui came straight into the starting line-up just days after completing a transfer from Bayern Munich, but he didn't play at left-back as some might have expected. Instead, the Morocco international was fielded in his preferred right-back role. He put in a solid if unspectacular display, but Ten Hag will be desperate to get Luke Shaw back fit so Diogo Dalot doesn't have to play at left-back.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt came off the substitutes' bench for United in the second half but there was little to get excited about. He didn't impacted the game much - and the sight of De Light and Jonny Evans climbing off the bench when United should have been chasing the game hardly inspired confidence.",
      "Leno had a good game in goal for Fulham and appeared to have earned them a point before Zirkzee's impact. Garnacho sent in a hopeful low cross and the 23-year-old managed to get a scuffed touch onto the ball to send it into the bottom corner.",
      "Zirkzee was United's first signing of the summer, but is perhaps the lowest profile, having come from Bologna. With Hojlund currently out, he has a great chance to show what he can do in the coming weeks - and he made the perfect start on Friday night.",

      "Manchester United's top transfer target for the remainder of the window Manuel Ugarte was left out of PSG's squad for the opening fixture, while Jadon Sancho is absent for United's match vs Fulham",
      "Manuel Ugarte has been left out of Paris Saint-Germain's squad ahead of their opening Ligue 1 match against Le Havre.",
      "The Uruguay international is Manchester United's top target as they look to strengthen in midfield before the end of the summer transfer window and will have been encouraged that the 23-year-old has not made the trip to Normandy to begin the season. United have been unable to come to an agreement over the valuation of the former Sporting CP star.",
      "The Red Devils have tracked Ugarte throughout the summer, with the French giants open to his sale after splashing out €60million on 19-year-old Joao Neves from Benfica. PSG spent a similar figure on Ugarte last summer and have been hopeful of recouping the bulk of it, but may be under some pressure to sell.",
      "Talks between the clubs have continued, with Ugarte's preference reported to be a move to Old Trafford just 12 months on from arriving in Paris. There is an expectation that a deal will get over the line.",
      "United are expected to move on some of their midfield players before the end of the month, with Christian Eriksen and Scott McTominay both being linked to transfers. The latter has fielded interest from Napoli already this month.",
      "While tracking Ugarte has proven difficult over recent weeks, United have also considered other midfielder stars. Burnley's Sander Berge has come under consideration in addition to brief interest in Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi.",
      "Jadon Sancho has been touted as an option to send in the opposite direction this summer too. The winger, who spent the latter half of last season on loan with Borussia Dortmund has been left out of Manchester United's squad for their Premier League curtain-raiser against Fulham, and has been pitched as a player to send to PSG.",
      "Sancho returned to United's first team squad during pre-season after meeting with Erik ten Hag. The 24-year-old missed a penalty against Manchester City in the Community Shield last weekend.",
      "“He’s a very good penalty taker and I had - and have - no doubts to let him score a penalty,\" said Ten Hag. \"Also in the future, he will take penalties.”",
      "Ten Hag also noted the pair have put their problems behind them. He said: \"As we said, we draw the line. Manchester United need good players and Jadon is a good player. We have drawn that line and we move on.\"",

      "Supporters of Premier League clubs have been forced to pay more for their season tickets for the 2024/25 campaign, with 18 of the 20 sides guilty of hiking their prices",
      "Premier League clubs have been accused of exploiting loyal fans after rising season ticket prices by up to 32 per cent.",
      "As the new season kicks off on Friday night, 18 of the 20 teams have upped the price of their cheapest adult season tickets. The biggest sinners are the Saints – with newly promoted Southampton hiking the cheapest adult season ticket rising by £120 from £379 to £499. That is a 32 per cent increase and the biggest out of all the Premier League clubs.",
      "A spokesperson for the side said: “After seven years of freezing prices, for the 2023/24 season, the club reduced the prices following relegation. We have been clear this season they will rise.” The club added that in recent years the cost of running match days has been increasing, including the price of energy and paying staff wages.",
      "Arsenal are the dearest to follow. The north London side increased the price of the cheapest season ticket from £974 to £1,073. The club pointed to “an environment where costs continue to rise”.",
      "Of the teams that played in the Premier League last season, Nottingham Forest have slapped the biggest price increase on their cheapest season tickets – with prices rising £85 from £465 to £550 – an 18 per cent rise.",
      "Forest chairman Tom Cartledge told the club’s official website: “We aspire to keep our season cards amongst the most affordable in the league. At the same time, it is imperative that the club continues to grow financially in order to remain competitive, particularly in light of the forthcoming squad cost ratio rules, which will cap spending as a percentage of club revenues.”",
      "Only Crystal Palace and Wolverhampton Wanderers have frozen the price of their cheapest adult season tickets. Consumer expert Scott Dixon said: “Fans were astonished to see these price hikes, given that the headline inflation rate is 2 per cent.",
      "“The cost-of-living crisis is seen as an excuse by football clubs to justify price hikes and exploit loyal fans at every opportunity. Football clubs cite a variety of factors to justify it, hoping that fans will simply pay without questioning it.”",
      "West Ham have the cheapest season ticket prices, following a comparatively modest price increase from £310 to £345. The average cost of the cheapest season ticket in the Premier League has increased to £598.83, up £41.28 from £558.55 last season – a 7 per cent increase.",
      "Season tickets are not the only product that has seen rises this year. A recent Mirror investigation found more than half of Premier League clubs have hiked the price of replica shirts this season, some by 15 per cent.",
      "The first Premier League game of the 2024/25 season will kick off on Friday at 8pm, with the first match taking place between Manchester United and Fulham at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United made a winning start to the new Premier League season on Friday night thanks to an 87th-minute winner from summer signing Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui also debuted during the opening game, with the latter starting the match at right-back and was replaced by his former Bayern Munich teammate inside the final ten minutes. Zirkzee had come on at the hour mark and combined with fellow substitute Alejandro Garnacho to break the deadlock.",
      "Throughout the summer, manager Erik Ten Hag and Ineos have been busy in the transfer market; De Ligt, Leny Yoro, Mazraoui and Zirkzee have arrived at Old Trafford, all with a point to prove. United have moved away from signing 'superstars' like Casemiro or Raphael Varane and opted for players 26 years old or under.",
      "Supporters should expect more movement before the window concludes with Jadon Sancho touted with a switch to Paris Saint-Germain despite rebuilding his relationship with the manager. Sancho is also said to be receiving interest from Chelsea in a surprise move.",
      "It comes amid uncertainty over the future of Scott McTominay at Old Trafford. The club will also continue to look to add to Ten Hag's options in midfield, with PSG's Manuel Ugarte a priority target.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly interested in Atalanta midfielder Ederson according to Express. Erik ten Hag is said to be keen on bringing in another central midfielder - particularly in the number six role with talk of Scott McTominay's future being away from Old Trafford alongside Casemiro, now 32, likely to have his playing time managed. This provides a spot for another midfielder - which Ederson could fill. It is reported that discussions are ongoing over a £51m deal.",
      "With less than two weeks of the transfer window remaining, we are asking United fans who they would be looking to keep and sell this summer if they were in Ten Hag's shoes.",
      "Michael Owen has told OLBG that United should stick with Marcus Rashford rather than sell the misfiring forward.",
      "It’s a really strange situation with Marcus Rashford. There are very few players that are so good like Marcus and score 30 goals in a season and then go and score eight goals last season.",
      "",
      "Having such a contrast in your output is quite rare, which leads you to believe that there's something going on that we just don't know.",
      "",
      "But the thing with Marcus, he can still be a great player. If you've got a ready-made, homegrown player that has all the ability in the world, that has been there, seen it, done it, that has proven that he can do it and scored the goals that Manchester United need and he's right under your nose. You've got to move heaven and earth to get him playing.",
      "",
      "People talk about moving him on and things like that but you've got someone that you know can do it already there. So I'd suggest you look a little bit more inward and try to improve what you've got.",
      "",
      "I would definitely be in the camp of keeping Marcus Rashford and trying to get the best out of him because his talent is there in black and white. We've seen it before. No one can doubt it's there, it’s just going to take someone to bring it out.",
      "McTominay has been on the radar for Fulham this summer as they look to strengthen their midfield.",
      "The Scottish international has been the subject of three bids from the London with the latest valued at £25m.",
      "United have rejected all the offers so far as they are hoping to attract bids in the region of £40m.",
      "According to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, McTominay is taking his future back into his own hands this summer by contacting Napoli boss Antonio Conte about his desire to leave the club.",
      "It is believed the Serie A club want to add McTominay to their midfield but they are waiting on Osimhen to leave before making an official bid.",
      "The Reds are thought to be keen on adding to their midfield this summer with a lack of central options in the squad.",
      "Casemiro is not seen as the long term solution to partner Mainoo and PSG's Ugarte has been eyed as an alternative.",
      "While De Jong was a target for the Reds in Ten Hag's first summer at the club it is not believed he is on the radar at this moment.",
      "According to reports on Football365, United have proposed a swap deal with Barcelona to sign De Jong this summer.",
      "They claim that the Reds would be willing to offer Sancho in return for De Jong.",
      "This propose is thought to be intriguing Barcelona with the La Liga giants believing the Englishman could drastically improve their forward line.",
      "News just in today that former United defender Phil Jones has announced his retirement from football.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Jones said:",
      "My career finished shorter than I would have liked. [I'm] glass half full. [I have] completed my A licence and I want to get out there and challenge myself in coaching. Ultimately I want to take charge of a team. I am determined to get there.",
      "The 32-year-old made 229 appearances for the Reds after moving to the club from Blackburn Rovers in 2011.",
      "Speaking to the media after the victory over Fulham, Ten Hag explained why Sancho had missed the game.",
      "Jadon in the week had an ear infection and was not 100% fit for this. He could play but if you can make choices, I made the choice that we preferred other players on the bench.",

      "Welcome back to the United transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be keeping you up to date with all the latest transfer news from Old Trafford after yesterday's 1-0 victory over Fulham.",
      "Rangers reportedly do not have the money to sign Hannibal Mejbri permanently this summer, which is the only way United will let the player depart.",
      "Football Insider claims the Tunisia international has been identified by the Glasgow club as a player they are keen on. However, it is acknowledged that moving for their targets will be tough after their midweek elimination from the Champions League.",
      "The outlet claimed last week the Celtic were seeking to hijack any deal done by their Old Firm rivals, which would be welcome for United. They would seemingly use any fee from selling Hannibal to fund further signings this summer.",
      "United have been credited with an interest in Rennes left-back Adrien Truffert.",
      "French sports newspaper L'Equipe claims that Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton Wanderers are among several clubs with their sights set on the 22-year-old. Truffert has only recently returned from representing France at the Olympic Games, resuming training on Tuesday.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are also said to be a fan of the full-back, but it is acknowledged that Rennes have previously rejected bids for the player. Truffert has two years remaining on his contract with the Breton club and is represented by the same agency, CAA Stellar, as Kobbie Mainoo and Luke Shaw.",
      "Morgan Schneiderlin has announced his retirement from football seven years after leaving United.",
      "The 34-year-old played in Greece for newly-promoted club A.E. Kifisia last season, who failed to stay in the top-flight at the first time of asking. That move came after a two-year contract with Turkish team Konyaspor was mutually terminated after only ten days.",
      "Before that, Schneiderlin spent three seasons at Nice, spending the last six months of that stint there on loan in Australia at Western Sydney Wanderers. The French club are the team he signed for from Everton following four seasons on Merseyside after two at United.",
      "United will reportedly step up their pursuit of Manuel Ugarte over the weekend and into next week",
      "Football Insider claims that the club are pushing to agree a deal with Paris Saint-Germain and advance talks to sign the Uruguay international. It is widely reported that Ugarte is keen to join United and the Parisian club's head coach Luis Enrique has frozen the midfielder out of his squad.",
      "The sticking point is still over a fee, as PSG are said to want over £50million. That is around the fee they paid Sporting to trigger the player's release clause last summer.",
      "United are reportedly in constant talks with Atalanta and the representatives of Ederson over signing the Brazil international.",
      "AS, who interviewed the midfielder earlier this summer, claims they are one of several clubs that have enquired about Ederson this summer. Aston Villa also reputedly want the player to replace Douglas Luiz.",
      "Juventus also tried to sign him this summer, but their relationship with the Bergamo club is said to have soured. Atletico Madrid are also said to have made a £38m bid, but Atalanta want £51m. The Spanish side have since moved on to signing Chelsea central midfielder Conor Gallagher.",
      "Napoli reportedly needs to cash in on Victor Osimhen before signing Scott McTominay.",
      "Repubblica reports that the Italian club can only advance negotiations after receiving that windfall from Osimhen. It is said that McTominay has told their head coach Antonio Conte he wants the move, but United are not considering loaning the player and want around £25.5m.",
      "Rai reports that United would only be open to a loan if it includes an obligation to buy the Scotland international. McTominay featured as a late substitute during the club's opening game of the Premier League season against Fulham last night at Old Trafford.",
      "Manuel Ugarte's representatives are reportedly confident their client will sign for United this summer.",
      "HITC claims that is the case, citing sources, with Jorge Mendes trying to break the deadlock between the Reds and Paris Saint-Germain. It is said that Ugarte is not considering offers from elsewhere as a result as he intends to sign for United.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reported on Friday night that the player is now pushing for a move after becoming tired of PSG at the stalemate that has gone on for months this summer. Ugarte was not named in the team's squad for their season-opener against Le Harve.",
      "Oscar Zambrano has signed for Hull City on a season-long loan mere months after being linked with a move to United.",
      "El Futbolero reported in January that the Reds were interested in the Ecuador international. Brighton & Hove Albion and Luton Town were also said to be keen on the midfielder, with Fabrizio Romano later claiming Bournemouth were also pushing to sign the player.",
      "Bundesliga clubs Freiburg and Stuttgart were also linked, while Zambrano previously went on trial with Ajax in 2022, with Colorado Rapids and Sao Paulo said to be interested the following year. However, a move to Hull has now materialised, with the Championship club having an option to make the deal permanent.",
      "Scott McTominay reportedly prioritises a move to Napoli, with talks said to be taking place with the player's agent.",
      "Sportitalia reports that Antonio Conte is keen to sign the midfielder and claims figures are being discussed with the Italian club. McTominay came on as a late substitute last night against Fulham, another club interested in signing the Scotland international.",
      "However, he reputedly prefers a move to Naples rather than west London. United rejected multiple bids from the Cottagers this summer, and it remains to be seen whether Napoli will pay what United want for McTominay, with the Reds needing to sell before sanctioning another signing.",
      "\"This morning we had 22 players training and if you ask all of them they want to play against City on Sunday but that is impossible,\" Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said speaking ahead of Sunday's clash with reigning champions, City.",
      "\"When you train every day and not get any minutes it is not good for them or for me and I need to make a decision. Probably it is better to leave and go and get minutes. The transfer window is open so we will see what will happen.\"",
      "According to BBC Sport, the new Chelsea manager has told England defender Ben Chilwell that he can leave the club this summer. The full-back has suffered with injury problems since arriving at Stamford Bridge.",

      "Jadon Sancho's future at Old Trafford reportedly remains open as we enter the last fortnight of the summer transfer window.",
      "Before the beginning of pre-season, it seemed almost set in stone that Sancho would be leaving the Reds. Both the Englishman and Erik ten Hag had a difficult relationship last season after the winger was dropped for the Arsenal defeat at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Sancho declared himself a 'scapegoat' and was subsequently exiled with immediate effect and sent on loan to Borussia Dortmund in January. Since his return to the UK, the 24-year-old has buried the hatchet with Ten Hag which seems to have opened the door to him staying at the club.",
      "Read the full story",
      "Manuel Ugarte is reportedly pushing like crazy to join United from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims that has become the case over recent days after tiring with PSG for their failure to find an agreement for him to leave the club. Ugarte, like Jadon Sancho, was not in the squad for their season-opener against Le Havre, but unlike Sancho, there was no reason for that absence.",
      "Romano also reiterated that United must sell a midfielder, likely Scott McTominay, before signing the Uruguay international unless PSG drop their price enough. He has also insisted it remains possible that Sancho will leave",
      "Jadon Sancho was not named in the Manchester United squad against Fulham partly due to an ear infection.",
      "Sancho made his first competitive United appearance in nearly a year as a substitute in the Community Shield against Manchester City last week but was absent from the matchday squad for the 1-0 opening Premier League win against Fulham.",
      "United manager Erik ten Hag clarified Sancho was fit enough to be included but opted to name Alejandro Garnacho, Joshua Zirkzee and Antony as the attacking substitutes.",

      "Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Martinez said:",
      "It is difficult to play for this big club but we love that pressure. We have to take that pressure and responsibility and for me I am really proud to play for this club. I did not play many games as left back but as a player, if the team need me, I will play at full-back. As a player we are ready to be criticised. If we are to make excuses we are not ready to be at this club.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports after the Fulham win, Ten Hag said:",
      "Against Fulham it is always difficult but we defended and pressed very well. We kept them under pressure and we created a lot of chances and we should have scored earlier - that is my only criticism. I know Mazraoui well, he is a great defender and very composed on the ball. He is not in full condition but once he gets there he will be great. Strikers scoring is important but he has more qualities than that, I have told him he needs to arrive in the box but also to link up. It is just the first game but it is good to get that belief and confidence in the team, I have seen many places where we have to improve. Maguire was not injured but I had to bring him off as a precaution. I am so happy that there was no injuries today.",
      "Here is what Zirkzee said after the victory over Fulham.",
      "To win here in my first home game and score could not be better. I have been told to score in front of the Stretford End is one of the best feelings as a United player and it was amazing. I can't really explain the feeling but it is nice. The squad is very nice, I want to achieve something great here. It has been a dream actually. It is all just good vibes. It is a great feeling to win man of the match - this is going at the top of the shelf.",
      "One match down and one win in the bag for United in 2024/25.",
      "A late Joshua Zirkzee goal seals the three points. Garnacho should have made it more comfortable with a late chance but squandered it.",
      "Not thoroughly convincing but the job is done."

      "Joshua Zirkzee strolled into the mixed zone and towered over a handful of journalists.",
      "Zirkzee had just scored on his debut for Manchester United, a late matchwinner on the opening day of the season, but produced just a few words to describe how it made him feel.",
      "\"A great feeling, a great feeling, it couldn’t be any better,\" he said. Zirkzee was incredibly laidback in his first interview with club media last month and was equally relaxed when speaking to reporters, despite having scored the winner at Old Trafford around an hour previously.",
      "\"What can I say? Debut, winning, scoring in front of the Stretford End, so yeah, it’s unbelievable,\" Zirkzee added. Most players would still be riding the crest of the wave when speaking in the mixed zone after scoring on their debut but it was as if the 23-year-old had just played in a park.",
      "Some may interpret Zirkzee doesn't care because of his laidback nature but it's part of his charm - there won't be an occasion that fazes him and that will help at the world's biggest club.",
      "United are the most scrutinised team in the world and Zirkzee looks tailor-made to deal with the pressure, simply because he chooses not to feel it. \"Where does this moment rank? Somewhere between my debuts and it’s a bit below winning the Champions League with Bayern and my national team debut, but it’s up there,\" he said with an endearing grin on his face.",
      "\"I'm just trying to be the best version I can be, help the team and club, so no specific goals.\" However, Zirkzee does want to start for United and many believed he should have featured in the Community Shield last weekend, a game in which even Jadon Sancho was used in.",
      "\"I’m sure the manager had a good reason for it, I’m not too difficult with these things. It’s his choice and today, my debut, wasn’t too bad,\" Zirkzee replied about that decision.",
      "So is he a natural goalscorer? \"I’m not going to talk about myself like that, but it was a good touch today, so hopefully more of that,\" said Zirkzee. \"Not really [doesn't come naturally], it’s something you really have to work for and my role is probably what works best for the team.",
      "\"I’m a striker that’s comfortable coming in deep and helping the team play football, so it doesn’t really matter. This was my game in Italy [dropping in deep positions] and previously in Anderlecht, so that could be an option but if the manager needs me to do something else, I’m here.\"",
      "Zirkzee became the sixth Dutchman to score on his Old Trafford debut for United after Jordi Cruyff, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Robin van Persie, Alexander Buttner and Donny van de Beek.",
      "The goal extended United's opening day record in the Premier League - they have won more opening games than any other team - and also provided Zirkzee with 'relief'.",
      "\"I mean yeah, first game, first goal, it’s always a relief to have that off your shoulders, but it goes on,\" he explained. \"I saw the replay of my goal and it didn’t look too bad.\"",
      "United paid €42.5million (£35.8m) to sign Zirkzee from Bologna this summer and he made the best possible start to vindicating that investment by scoring the winner against Fulham.",
      "\"Why Manchester United?,\" he laughed. \"For some people, it might be crazy, but for me, this is the biggest club in the world, so it wasn’t a difficult choice to make, to be honest.\"",
      "Zirkzee is being coached by Ruud van Nistelrooy at Carrington and he described the opportunity to work with the legendary former striker as a privilege. \"Yeah, it’s a privilege to have someone like that. As a striker, it’s not every day you have someone that you grew up watching,\" he said.",
      "\"That’s pretty much it, but everybody in the staff up to now has been great and I enjoy working with these people a lot. It’s not just him, but obviously it’s an extra privilege.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy is a familiar face to Zirkzee, given he idolised him as a child, but he has established friendships with United's latest signings, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "\"I mean they’re two great players and we’ll see in the future what they can bring,\" said Zirkzee, who played with both players during his time spent with Bayern Munich.",
      "\"I’m sure they’ll do a lot of great things here. I think Mazaroui had a great game today as well and I think De Ligt came in with a lot of good energy as well, so yeah, it’s good to have familiar faces around, but everybody in the team has been very kind and it’s top being part of this group.",
      "\"He [Mazraoui] arrived this week and it’s not easy to come into a team and play the way he did. I think it all looked natural and that was the most special part of his game today.",
      "\"But yeah, that’s just the player he is, he’s there to do his job and perform the best way he can and I think he did great today… and I'm not just saying that because he’s my friend!\"",
      "Most United fans will want Zirkzee to start against Brighton next weekend and in the meantime, they might find him walking his dog around the leafy suburbs of Manchester.",
      "\"I don’t do much, I have my dog, I take him for a walk and sit in the house and watch a TV series, play PlayStation or do whatever,\" he said about his hobbies. \"I’ve just finished The Umbrella Academy on Netflix and it wasn’t too good of an ending but I enjoyed it, it was good.\"",
      "If Zirkzee was any more laidback he'd be horizontal - he can deal with the pressure of United.",

      "United instructed Zirkzee to start training at their Carrington training complex even though he was holidaying in Los Angeles - where United were based for their pre-season tour. The 23-year-old was an unused substitute in the Community Shield against Manchester City last week before he emerged on the hour against Fulham.",

      "\"Remember last season in his first game, Rasmus Hojlund scored in his first game (at Old Trafford against Brighton), we were waiting on the halfway line, VAR, and after two minutes they came to the conclusion the ball was slightly over the line. Then it took (Hojlund) long and it was so frustrating. It’s very pleasing, very happy for him (Zirkzee), it will encourage him, give him belief, for the fans, for everyone, it’s a very good start.",

      "When asked about Zirkzee's integration, Ten Hag added: \"We looked to everyone individually as to what is the right programme. He had an injury at the end of his career at Bologna and then he wasn’t selected and I think that was due to the injury that they didn’t select him for the Euros.",

      "Chelsea have numerous players to offer Manchester United in exchange for Jadon Sancho. Despite settling his dispute with Erik ten Hag, the 24-year-old winger has continued to be linked with an exit from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "In fact, according to the MailOnline, Paris Saint-Germain recently held talks with the Red Devils over a deal worth £51m, but negotiations collapsed. With the French giants pulling out of the race to secure Sancho's signature, German outlet Fussball.news claims that Chelsea are now interested.",
      "The report states that the Blues are willing to offer a transfer fee and two players as makeweights for the England international. It's said that, alternatively, Chelsea would also be open to signing Sancho on a loan deal, which includes an obligation to buy.",
      "As it stands, it remains to be seen whether the West Londoners will submit an offer. So, with that being said, the Manchester Evening News have looked at what players Chelsea could include in a potential part-exchange deal.",
      "Lukaku has faced an uncertain future at Stamford Bridge for a while now, having spent the last two years on loan in the Serie A. With the 31-year-old striker not in Enzo Maresca's plans, United can welcome hime back to Old Trafford to provide Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee with strong competition.",
      "If Ten Hag would rather somebody a bit younger to join his strike force then Broja could prove to be a bargain. While the 22-year-old frontman has struggled to impress since suffering a nasty ACL injury in December 2022, he's got lots of potential waiting to be unlocked.",
      "The Reds could ruffle a few feathers and bring Sterling to Old Trafford. The 29-year-old winger hasn't lived up to expectations since joining Chelsea from Manchester City in July 2022, but maybe Ten Hag can reignite his flame.",
      "While Casadei may not be as much of an attractive name as other on this list, the 21-year-old midfielder has all the qualities to succeed as a midfielder for Ten Hag. With Scott McTominay facing an uncertain future, he could replace the Scot's physicality and eye for a goal off the bench.",
      "If Ten Hag fancies trialling a back-five then Chilwell could prove to be shrewd acquisition. However, the 27-year-old defender has only started 24 Premier League games in the last two seasons, having suffered hamstring injuries and a knee problem.",
      "Chalobah would be an excellent signing for United; not only can he played anywhere across the backline, he also has experience playing as a holding midfielder. With Leny Yoro nursing an injury and Jonny Evans still playing, the 25-year-old defender would solve a lot of Ten Hag's problems.",
      "Arrizabalaga may be the least desirable player that Chelsea could offer United in a swap deal for Sancho, but the 29-year-old could be respectable backup option to Andre Onana if Altay Bayindir wanted to seek regular first-team football.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

After the match, Erik ten Hag stressed that his side needed to be more clinical if they are to be successful in the Premier League this season.",
      "While he did not mention Fernandes directly, the Reds' skipper missed a couple of chances in the first half to put his team into a more comfortable position going into half-time. Meanwhile, Garnacho was left wondering how he did not score as his shot missed the target when it was easier to score.",
      "Fernandes has been a popular pick with Fantasy Football managers this summer and would have bagged teams some good points if he had got on the scoresheet. While it did not work out for him last night, he promised those playing the online game that he will repay their faith soon.",

      "Sancho declared himself a 'scapegoat' and was subsequently exiled with immediate effect and sent on loan to Borussia Dortmund in January. Since his return to the UK, the 24-year-old has buried the hatchet with Ten Hag which seems to have opened the door to him staying at the club.",
      "According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, all options remain open for Sancho's future at the club. While PSG did enquire about the winger in July, no formal bid was placed.",
      "Speculation about Sancho's future intensified last night when he was not named in the starting XI or among the substitutes for the clash with Fulham. Elsewhere, journalist Florian Plettenberg has revealed United's stance on signing Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong.",
      "De Jong has been constantly linked with the Reds since Ten Hag joined United in 2022. Speculation had been growing as to whether the Dutchman would go after his fellow countryman again this summer as he searched for a new central midfielder.",
      "However, the Sky Sport Deutschland reporter has insisted that United have no interest in De Jong this summer with no talks nor negotiations beginning. However, the Reds are thought to be considering alternatives if they are not able to reach an agreement with PSG for Manuel Ugarte.",

      "New assistant coaches Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake, and new goalkeeping coach Jelle ten Rouwellar are also Dutch. Six of Ten Hag's additions have played for Ajax yet the United manager said last October he \"can't play like Ajax (at United) because I have different players\".",
      "\"Not for favourite,\" Ten Hag stressed of his penchant for bringing in Dutch players. \"First of all, it is club decisions, none of them is only my decision. It is always backed or even brought up through the scouting, recruitment, technical director, sporting director, it is a decision made by more than only one. But, some, you know also players and personalities and it has to fit also in the finance.\"",
      "De Ligt and Mazraoui arrived from Bayern Munich on Tuesday while Joshua Zirkzee, also formerly of Bayern, joined from Italian side Bologna last month.

With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",

Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",

      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present.

      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",

Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",

He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Manchester United opened their new Premier League campaign with a 1-0 win against Fulham.",
      "United were defeated by Manchester City on penalties in the Community Shield last weekend but began the new season with a victory thanks to Joshua Zirkzee's late goal.",
      "It wasn't a vintage performance from United and Fulham created their fair share of chances, but Zirkzee's goal was enough for the three points and to ensure a winning start.",
      "Although Erik ten Hag warned United weren't prepared for the new season, the Reds have the best opening day record in Premier League history and delivered again at home.",
      "Here are the main talking points from the season opener...",
      "Was Zirkzee frustrated?",
      "Zirkzee was the first player to emerge from the dressing room for the second half. The new signing walked out, wearing his green substitute bib, and unusually took his seat on the bench well before any of his teammates had left the comfort of the players' tunnel.",
      "You rarely see a player take their seat on the bench early and perhaps it was a sign of frustration from Zirkzee, or simply just the striker deciding to come out early and nothing more.",
      "Either way, Zirkzee was finally given his debut on the hour mark when he replaced Mason Mount, but he was quiet when he was introduced and the game looked to be heading to a stalemate - until the Dutchman poked home from an Alejandro Garnacho cross and Old Trafford erupted.",
      "With Rasmus Hojlund still sidelined with a hamstring injury, United needed Zirkzee to step up to the plate and his finish, using the studs of his boot, was intelligent. Zirkzee celebrated wildly at the Stretford End as United grabbed the three points.",
      "Amad got what he wanted",
      "Amad was the standout performer of pre-season for United, but it still felt like the possibility of him starting on the opening day of the campaign against Fulham was slim.",
      "It turns out everyone who thought that was wrong. Amad got the nod to start on the right wing on Friday night and Alejandro Garnacho was named on the bench again.",
      "Ten Hag challenged Amad to make this season 'his' in pre-season and he made an excellent start to the game against Fulham when bursting into the box after the 10-minute mark.",
      "Amad went to the ground and wanted a penalty. It was correctly not given, but that didn't disrupt his flow and he continued to be the most creative player in a red shirt.",
      "Whether he did enough to start against Brighton remains to be seen, though, because his influence wasn't significant and he was eventually replaced by Garnacho.",
      "Confident debut from Mazraoui",
      "Fulham winger Adama Traore is one of the fastest players in the world - he might give Usain Bolt food for thought in a foot race - and he embarked on a tremendous run in the first half.",
      "Who was there to stop him? Noussair Mazraoui. Although the Morrocan started at right-back, he anticipated the Fulham counter-attack and intercepted Traore on the other side with a brilliant slide tackle in the box, which was needed because Diogo Dalot was nowhere to be seen.",
      "United insisted they were signing a technically exceptional and versatile defender when they confirmed Mazraoui's transfer from Bayern Munich earlier in the week and the 26-year-old lived up to that billing on his debut, looking assured at the back and athletic going forward.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka was brilliant at defending but poor in attacking scenarios and Mazraoui's first impression suggested he is a better all-round player, which is why he was signed.",
      "Introduction of the new signings",
      "There were whispers in the press room that United's four summer signings, Leny Yoro, Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt and Mazraoui, would be introduced to the crowd before the game.",
      "One of the best new signing unveilings in recent memory was when Raphael Varane signed from Real Madrid, as he oozed class emerging on the Old Trafford pitch dressed in a Hugo Boss suit.",
      "Varane was unveiled before the opening game of the 2021/22 season against Leeds and United thumped their West Yorkshire rivals 5-1, with Bruno Fernandes netting a hat-trick. Paul Pogba recorded four assists and every fan leaving the ground that day dreamt of a title challenge.",
      "Fast forward three years and fans are merely hoping to finish in the Premier League top four again, despite the four new signings being widely regarded as good additions.",
      "United's new signings received rapturous applause as they were presented to the crowd and Yoro, who was standing on crutches after his foot surgery, received the biggest cheer. It's a genuine shame that he sustained an injury in pre-season which robbed him of the chance of making his debut against Fulham, but his scheduled return in October is something for supporters to look forward to.",
      "Sancho dropped from the squad",
      "Jadon Sancho was given an appearance off the bench in the second half of the Community Shield and that seemed like a bizarre decision when Zirkzee could have been brought on instead.",
      "That decision became even more confusing when the teams were confirmed to face Fulham, as it became clear that Sancho had been dropped and completely left out of the squad.",
      "Ten Hag said he'd 'drawn the line' under his dispute with Sancho when speaking to Manchester-based reporters after the opening game of pre-season this summer, but the winger's omission from the squad suggested - if it wasn't already obvious - that not everything is rosy.",
      "A permanent sale of Sancho before deadline day is still the ideal scenario, despite Paris Saint-Germain being said to have cooled their interest in the 23-year-old. Chelsea has also been touted as a potential destination for Sancho this week and they are bonkers enough to sign him.",
      "Todd Boehly has made Chelsea a laughing stock since he acquired the keys to Stamford Bridge and United fans would be laughing if Sancho rocked up in West London.",

However, Smith Rowe pulled his left leg away before connecting with Maguire, but that did not stop the defender from appealing for a penalty after taking a tumble.",

      "Amad was spotted screaming at his teammates for the ball at Wembley and he did the same at Old Trafford on Friday night, urging the ball to be played down right wing.",
      "When Amad finally received the ball, he showed what he can do, bursting into the Fulham box and going down in between two defenders. The winger appealed for a penalty but referee Robert Jones wasn't interested and that only encouraged Amad to pick himself up and go again.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was named on the bench again to accommodate Amad on the right wing and he patiently waited to be introduced to the game in the second half.",
      "With Garnacho waiting and primed to make his mark, it felt like Amad had to dazzle against Fulham to ensure he retained his starting role against Brighton next weekend and although he didn't score or assist, he might have done enough to make the starting side at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Whether Mason Mount has done enough is questionable. The midfielder started as the No.10, which is his preferred position, for the second game in a row and looked better when United were out of possession, which has been a regular observation during his time in Manchester.",
      "Chelsea fans found a tweet about Mount looking energetic and fist-pumping the crowd when it was half-time and they mocked the post, suggesting that's all he is good for.",
      "Mount was brilliant at Stamford Bridge and deserves better treatment from Chelsea fans - he was booed in West London upon his return in April - but their argument might have some merit if he doesn't begin to influence games when United have possession of the ball.",
      "There's no doubting Mount's commitment, he doesn't stop running and presses diligently, but how much he contributes in other phases of play is questionable.",
      "Ten Hag made a double change just after the hour mark and both Amad and Mount were hooked, with Garnacho and Joshua Zirkzee replacing the pair. Mount missed a chance that ricocheted through off Marcus Rashford before he was replaced and that was another sliding doors moment.",
      "It would be a surprise to see Mount start next week because it's logical to move Bruno Fernandes back to central attacking midfield and play Zirkzee through the middle. The Dutchman did brilliantly to provide the matchwinner and that should guarantee his starting place",
      "The decision between Amad and Garnacho seems more contentious, although the latter delivered each week last season and has a lot of credit in the bank with his manager.",

      "After representing his country during their home Olympic Games and winning a silver medal for reaching the tournament's final, where they lost to Spain, the winger did not play for his new club during pre-season. But his bow did come in the cup, replacing Serge Gnabry for the final quarter of an hour with Bayern leading 2-0.",

Mere minutes later in Normandy, the former Benfica midfielder Joao Neves assisted two goals in as many minutes to help put PSG ahead against Le Havre.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Eric Cantona has starred in a bizarre advertisement that saw him hijack Premier League coverage of the Reds' clash with Fulham.",
      "In an unusual stunt that may never be repeated, Cantona joined host Julia Stuart and fellow ex-Reds midfielder Owen Hargreaves in the studio for analysis of the opening game of the season. All seemed normal until Stuart asked the Frenchman: \"What can you and the millions of Manchester United fans around the world expect; what will be unfolding as the season progresses on their television sets?\"",
      "This question appeared to spark something in Cantona as he sarcastically chuckled: \"Television,\" before taking off his microphone, jacket and tie and performing a passionate rant directly into the camera. \"We call this the beautiful game but how many people in this world do not even own a television. What of them? How do we sell this to them?\" He began.",
      "\"To be truly beautiful as a game, it should be everywhere. Should not be stuck on a wall or just in a bar. It must fly. And my friends, no one should believe that the Premier League is out of their league.",
      "\"And this marks the beginning. The revolution has begun.\"",
      "The feed to the studio then cut out and when it returned Cantona was leading the broadcast and triumphantly declared: \"The revolution will not be televised; the revolution will be live.\" Of course, this was not some sensational plot by Cantona to monopolise Premier League coverage but was actually an advertisement promoting a new streaming surface for the division in Africa, Showmax.",
      "For the first time, supporters in Africa will be able to watch their clubs via their mobile phones instead of exclusively on television.",

      "Manchester United’s eighth-place finish last term - a Premier League record low - has put the impetus on INEOUS and Erik ten Hag to bring new recruits in this summer.",
      "Earlier in the summer, United welcomed 18-year-old centre-back Leny Yoro from Ligue 1 side Lille as well as Joshua Zirkzee - who impressed in Serie A with Bologna last term, scoring 11 goals in 34 league appearances.",
      "As ever, there were several links and reported bids for Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite but the Toffees rejected United’s approach and he looks set for another season at Goodison Park. However, the arrival of former Ajax and Bayern Munich central defender Matthijs de Ligt should sure up United’s defence - last season Ten Hag’s side conceded 58 goals - finishing on a negative goal difference.",
      "In previous years, United have pursued older, experienced players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Casemiro - who tend to have a low sell-on value and struggle with fitness in Varane’s case.",
      "This window has been different - the average age of the players acquired is 23 with Noussair Mazraoi the oldest at 26. This is a step in the right direction, even if the transfers do not go to plan these players will retain or even increase their value - which for United, creates a more sustainable policy around transfers.",
      "After being reintegrated into Ten Hag’s squad after rebuilding their relationship, Sancho has been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain despite featuring in pre-season preparations ahead of the Premier League season.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, the winger’s representatives were in talks with the French side over a potential transfer in July but no formal bids were forthcoming. It is thought that no decision has been made yet with other options available for a move.",
      "United have been linked with the midfielder all summer and the player is reported to be keen on the move to Old Trafford. The 23-year-old was left out of PSG’s squad for their trip to Le Havre - which could be an indicator that a move is close.",
      "The Uruguayan featured in 25 league games last season but looks out of favour in Paris. Ugarte is a defensive midfielder - a position United are relatively short in with Casemiro aging and likely to have his game time managed. At 23, this could be a savvy move for all parties involved.",
      "The 'number six' position should be a priority in the final weeks of the transfer window. Scott McTominay will be able to play a role but has developed into a box-to-box player rather than a 'destroyer'. With the UEFA Europa League and the two domestic cup competitions to consider, a defensive midfielder is a must for Ten Hag.",

      "Manchester United have received fresh hope of selling Victor Lindelof this summer with Eintracht Frankfurt eyeing a move for the Swedish defender.",
      "Following the arrival of Matthijs de Ligt this week, pressure has intensified at Old Trafford to sell Lindelof this summer to recoup some money back for their Financial Fair Play (FFP) commitments. MEN Sport understands the Reds have been actively looking to sell the 30-year-old due to his contract running out at the end of next year.",
      "While Lindelof is not in hot water with the powers that be, he is seen as a player who would not be offered a new deal in 2025 so the time is now to recoup some money. So far, interest in the centre-back has been limited but that could be changing.",
      "According to Frankfurter Rundschau, the Bundesliga club's director of football Markus Krosche is experiencing pressure to bring in a centre-back as options in this position are thin on the ground. It is understood one target Frankfurt had their eye on this window decided to go elsewhere in Krosche is believed to be scrambling to find a replacement.",
      "On that list is Lindelof who has evidently been pushed down the pecking order after the arrivals of De Ligt and Leny Yoro. Frankfurt are thought to be in a strong position to pay for the Swede having bagged £38m for Willian Pacho after his switch to PSG last week.",
      "Lindelof could be missing from the bench tonight when United open their Premier League campaign against Fulham at Old Trafford.

      "Manchester United have a clear transfer alternative to Youssouf Fofana with his move from AS Monaco to AC Milan in the process of being finalised. The France international was identified as an option to strengthen Erik ten Hag's midfield alongside the likes of Manuel Ugarte, Sander Berge and Martin Zubimendi.",
      "With his contract in France set to expire in 2025, a summer departure for Fofana was expected with AC Milan quickly opening talks. Though a deal stalled as the two clubs attempted to agree on a fee, the latest bid from the Italian club was accepted with a medical scheduled for him to complete the switch.",
      "As the 26-year-old is now off the table, with Zubimendi also likely to remain at Real Sociedad given his decision to turn down an approach from Liverpool, options for Ten Hag and Ineos are dwindling. Ugarte and Berge are still on the market but they are very different midfielders to Fofana, so it really depends on the profile United want.",
      "With Fofana much more of a box-to-box midfielder, there are several options available to United if they wish to pursue a player with obvious similarities to AC Milan's newest arrival. Courtesy of stats gathered by Macro Football, Fofana is nearly an identical midfielder, in terms of strengths, to new AS Roma signing Enzo Le Fee.",
      "Of course as he has recently arrived in Italy from Rennes in a deal worth £19.6million (€23m), any chance of a move over the coming windows is unlikely. Maxence Caqueret, however, has been at Lyon for the past four years and could be perfect for United's midfield.",
      "The 24-year-old has a contract until 2027 and is currently valued at £17million (€20m), as per transfermarkt. If United decide to pursue a deal and can reach an agreement around that figure, it would be an absolute steal.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee re-emerged for the second half long before the rest of his teammates to take his place back on the bench and was hardly noticed. They noticed him at full-time.",
      "No striker and no goals. Once Manchester United had a striker on, they got their goal. Zirkzee's integration has now been vindicated with a goalscoring Old Trafford debut, just like the returning Dutchman in the dugout.",
      "Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho started warming up within five minutes of the restart. Eight minutes later, Erik ten Hag hollered their names. Ruud van Nistelrooy was stood next to Ten Hag when Garnacho and Zirkzee combined for United's winner.",
      "Zirkzee holidayed in Los Angeles when United were based there yet reported for training at Carrington, He was unused against Manchester City in the Community Shield. The wait was worth it for the 70,000 optimistic United matchgoers.",
      "Ten Hag summoned his compatriot on the hour. The £36.5million Zirkzee was thoroughly briefed by the new set-piece coach Andreas Georgson yet was rarely in sync with his new teammates until the moment it mattered. Zirkzee is the fourth United Dutchman to score on his Old Trafford bow after Jordi Cruyff, Van Nistelrooy, Robin van Persie, Alexander Buttner and Donny van de Beek.",
      "Scoring without performing is an invaluable knack. It would be an exaggeration to say Zirkzee did not perform before he connected with Garnacho's cross yet he was well marshalled by Fulham up until that point. He deftly converted one of United's more difficult chances on a night they created clearer openings.",
      "The absence of a focal point ought to have been rendered moot. There were three glaring chances for Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, United's two most central attackers. United passed up presentable opportunities against Manchester City in the Community Shield and Liverpool in South Carolina earlier this month. They won the one that mattered.",
      "Ten Hag resorted to throwing on Scott McTominay, a veteran of several salvage operations last season. Zirkzee appeared to prod the ball ahead of McTominay and it was immediately unclear who had got the final touch. The unflappable Zirkzee's celebration was borderline muted.",
      "United ended last season with a minus goal difference and are positive again. Positivity reigns again.",
      "The palpable optimism at kick-off had gradually ebbed until the debutant's 87th-minute intervention. United players applauded all four corners of the ground to a chorus of \"Take me home, United road\". The regulars are happy to be home.",
      "Ten Hag, clad in a two-piece suit with ankle socks and trainers, started jotting notes before the 20-minute mark. He repeatedly referenced United's \"game model\" during pre-season yet this was not a model performance.",
      "Casemiro waned as the intensity increased yet briefly rallied to play two perfect passes for Fernandes, who struck bluntly on both occasions. Casemiro now thrives more in the final third than his own, an additional incentive for United to add a defensive midfielder.",
      "The cumbersome Casemiro did not even attempt to bust a gut when Andreas Pereira botched Fulham's pivotal two-on-one at 0-0. As much of an asset as the Brazilian evidently is in the final third, he cannot be entrusted as the United sentry over the next nine months.",
      "The game was played around United's playmaker, Mount. Mount is at his most impressive off the ball, pressing and harrying opponents. His work on it leaves him vulnerable whenever Ten Hag adds a striker to the starting XI. He was hooked on the hour.",
      "Mount attempted to commit a cynical foul before he was booked for halting a breakaway. He had the nearest of United's one-on-ones yet prodded the ball at Leno.",
      "The new brains trust was sat in one of the front rows of the directors' box: Dave Brailsford, Omar Berrada, Dan Ashworth, Jason Wilcox... and Kees Vos. Ten Hag's agent was flanked by the United manager's wife, Bianca, and son, Nigel.",
      "Towards the back was Avram Glazer on only his third visit to Old Trafford in the past five years. The co-chairman is by far the most visible of the six siblings and with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now the face of this new United, Old Trafford is not the danger zone it was for a Glazer this time last year. There was still a fleeting rendition of \"We want Glazers out\".",
      "United's four new signings were paraded before kick-off. The loudest reaction for an individual was reserved for Garnacho as he embarked on a warm-up. United missed his dynamism and directness in the goalless first half and it yielded Zirkzee's winner.",
      "Ten Hag retreated to the dugout after spending the majority of the first half in the technical area to consult his new Dutch sounding boards in the absence of former assistant Mitchell van der Gaag.",
      "The United players had emerged for their warm-up to the sound of I Wanna Be Adored by The Stone Roses. Van Nistelrooy followed with his own chorus of \"Ruuuuud\". Younger fans inside the ground will now realise how adored he was as a player.",

      "Forward Joshua Zirkzee, who was recruited from Bologna last month, stepped off the bench to mark his debut with a goal. He steered home Alejandro Garnacho's cross to net an 87th-minute winner.",
      "It was by no means a vintage performance from United on the opening night of the campaign, but they did enough to get themselves over the line and secure all three points. Both sides had been guilty of wasting opportunities prior to Zirkzee's moment in the spotlight, the best of which fell to Bruno Fernandes.",

      "Below, MEN Sport has picked out some of the moments you might have missed from United's Premier League opener.",
      "After a relatively slow and uninspiring start, United got better as the first half developed. They increased the tempo and were eventually finding some joy inside the final third after initially struggling to find a way through Fulham's midfield.",
      "Despite being the holding midfielder, much of United's forward play was driven by Casemiro, who continues to look better in attacking scenarios than defensive ones. He pressed Fulham high and his commitment led to him sliding in on Cottagers left-back Antonee Robinson.",
      "His determination and desire to make the challenge earned plaudits from teammate Mason Mount, who celebrated it almost like a goal, highlighting his appreciation for his midfield compatriot's commitment to the cause. The former Chelsea man then turned around and rallied the crowd, urging them to be energised by Casemiro's determination.",
      "With the scoreline level at 0-0 as the game went into its final 10 minutes, the contest became stretched and it looked as though either side would be capable of grabbing a winner. United's best hope of finding something looked as though it would come via the energy of Garnacho - and so it nearly proved.",
      "After shaking off Robinson, the winger got to the byline and cut the ball back for Marcus Rashford, who looked set to tap home from close range. However, Kenny Tete got just enough on it to stop it from arriving at the academy graduate's feet.",
      "Garnacho sank to his knees and put his head in his hands. He was just as frustrated as those on the other side of the advertising hoardings.",
      "After Zirkzee had taken a swipe at Garnacho's cross with 87 minutes on the clock, Old Trafford exploded. It had been a frustrating night, with a cluster of great opportunities being wasted.",
      "After seeing his effort creep beyond Bernd Leno and into the bottom corner, Zirkzee wheeled away to celebrate, racing behind the net at the Stretford End. He was immediately chased after by his teammates, with Rashford the first to congratulate him.",
      "But as the majority of United's players raced after Zirkzee to embrace him, Fernandes, after raising his arms aloft to celebrate the goal just inside the penalty area, bent forward, dropped his head and sank to his haunches.",

He joined in with the celebrations just as United's players were dispersing from the main huddle, giving Zirkzee a hug to congratulate him.",
      "As United's players made their way back towards the tunnel following a short acknowledgement of the crowd after full-time, Zirkzee walked into the path of a beaming Ruud van Nistelrooy. The latter scored on his Premier League debut for United in 2001, scoring twice against Fulham, and he knows how special a feeling it is to make your mark in United colours.",
      "As Zirkzee walked towards the tunnel, Van Nistelrooy attracted his attention and smiled at him, the duo slapped each other on the hand and proceeded to put an arm around one another. Donning a huge smile through the exchange, it was clear the United assistant boss was delighted for his fellow countryman.",
      "Van Nistelrooy also gave a hug to three players who were directly behind Zirkzee, those being Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot and Casemiro.",

      "With the new Premier League campaign officially up and running, Manchester United know time is against them in their quest to complete their transfer business.",
      "United increased their tally of new additions to four in midweek, landing defenders Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt from Bayern Munich.",
      "With less than a fortnight to go until the window closes, United are understood to be focusing on strengthening their midfield options. Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte remains a top target and there is growing confidence a deal can be done.",
      "As much as it is necessary for the Reds to bring in a midfielder before the bell, there also needs to be a much-needed increase in departures. Aaron Wan-Bissaka became the fifth headline departure from Old Trafford in midweek, joining West Ham United, but more are needed.",
      "United's hierarchy planned to oversee a squad exodus this summer but that has not come to fruition. The exits of Mason Greenwood and Wan-Bissaka have been the headline acts, but United need to try and raise more funds.",
      "Selling Victor Lindelof and Scott McTominay, who are both facing the likelihood of a reduction in minutes this season, would represent United's best hope of generating some much-needed cash out of the players they would be happy to sell before the deadline.",
      "However, few need to leave United more than Facundo Pellistri. Since joining the club from Uruguayan outfit Penarol in 2020, he has played just 25 times, failed to score and been sent out on loan twice.",
      "If his cameo appearance at right-back in the Community Shield at Wembley last weekend turns out to be his final outing for the club, it would sum up his United career. It is understood he was left out of the squad against Fulham at Old Trafford as he is likely to be offloaded.",
      "Although he has offered flashes of his quality, regularly having a positive impact when he has stepped off the bench in the Erik ten Hag era, it is overwhelmingly clear that he does not have a long-term future at Old Trafford. United are bloated in the wide areas and they need to address that issue before the window shuts.",
      "With Alejandro Garnacho and Amad closer to Ten Hag's first XI than ever before, United still hopeful of Marcus Rashford getting back to his best levels, Jadon Sancho still at Old Trafford and Antony almost impossible to shift, it makes sense for Pellistri to be moved on, both for United's sake and for the sake of his own career.",
      "Despite struggling for regular minutes at Old Trafford, he has established himself as a regular fixture at international level with Uruguay, starting each of their six games at the Copa America earlier this summer. He has earned Marcelo Bielsa's trust and he is evidently key to his plans.",
      "With that said, Pellistri has earned the right to establish himself as a regular first-team player elsewhere. He is only 22 and his performances for United have proven he has potential.",
      "He has been linked with a handful of overseas clubs in recent weeks, including Italian outfit Bologna and Greek champions Panathinaikos. Spanish outfit Real Valladolid also declared interest in him at the beginning of last month.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",
      "With Ultra HD included at no extra cost, football fans can enjoy the 2024/25 season with crystal clear picture quality.",
      "£43",
      "With less than 12 months remaining on his contract, United are making the right call to try and sell him. A permanent exit would generate funds for the club to reinvest and it would give the winger the opportunity develop his career.",
      "Valued at £8.5million by data specialists Transfermarkt, Pellistri could be a bargain for a lot of clubs in need of a winger. The Uruguayan is a throwback winger who loves to drive at his full-back, get to the byline and deliver a cross.",
      "If deployed in the right system and he has a target to aim at in the middle, he could prove to be a very valuable asset who could quickly rack up plenty of assists.",
      "Ultimately, it is a shame that Pellistri has fallen short of making the grade at Old Trafford. However, it would be in his and United's best interests to get a deal done within the next 13 days.",

      "Sancho made his first competitive United appearance in nearly a year as a substitute in the Community Shield against Manchester City last week but he was absent from the matchday squad for the 1-0 opening Premier League win against Fulham.",
      "United manager Erik ten Hag clarified Sancho was fit enough to be included but he opted to name Alejandro Garnacho, Joshua Zirkzee and Antony as the attacking substitutes.",
      "\"First of all, we need squad depth,\" Ten Hag said. \"This season is the survival of the fittest but I can only put 20 players in the squad, I have to make choices.",
      "\"And Jadon in the week had an ear infection and was not 100% fit for this. He could play but if you can make choices, I made the choice that we preferred other players on the bench.",
      "\"That can change and will definitely change in the season where we have to rotate because we can’t play every game with the same. You see today how important subs are, we need the right bench and the right balance.",
      "\"Sometimes it is frustrating for the player but it’s about the team, it’s about the club, there will be more players in this position but we expect them to fight for the club. We have so many games to play, everyone will have their minutes and then they have to prove it.\"",
      "United beat Fulham through debutant Zirkzee's 87th-minute prod. Zirkzee came on after 60 minutes as United squandered three great chances, having performed profligately in the 1-1 draw with City and the 3-0 friendly defeat to Liverpool in South Carolina two weeks ago.",
      "Ten Hag reiterated United have to be more clinical. \"One space that we have to fill is to kill in the box, we saw it in the friendlies, we saw it last week against City, we create enough chances not to wait for a late winner,\" he said.",
      "\"So we could have earlier been in the winning position. We have to be more composed and we have to kill and execute in front of the goal.",
      "\"It’s the start of the season, players have to come into full speed, we have enough players in the squad with scoring abilities and the most important thing is we created chances.\"",

      "United have been pursuing the Paris St-Germain midfielder all summer and the Uruguayan is determined to make the move to Old Trafford, but so far there is a gap between the two clubs when it comes to a valuation.",
      "Despite the ongoing stalemate, there is an expectation in some quarters that a deal will be done that will see the 23-year-old move to United. Ugarte has been left out of PSG's 21-man squad for the Ligue 1 opener at Le Havre this week, although new signing Joao Neves is included.",
      "The French champions spent €60m on signing 19-year-old Neves from Benfica earlier this month and that has increased expectations that Ugarte will depart, with PSG now under some pressure to do a deal. Ugarte's preference is to move to United and talks between the two clubs are to continue.",
      "Ugarte has always been United's priority target for that position this summer, although a lack of sales has compromised their ability to spend after a £156m outlay on Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "There was brief interest in Spain international Martin Zubimendi before he signalled his intention to remain with Real Sociedad, while Sofyan Amrabat could still return to Old Trafford this summer. Amrabat is set to leave Fiorentina before the closure of the transfer window.",
      "Talks have also been held with Burnley over a move for Norway international Sander Berge, but there is other Premier League interest in the 26-year-old and talks are more advanced with other clubs. Berge has been offered guarantees over playing time that he wouldn't get at Old Trafford.",
      "United could yet sign more than one midfielder before the window closes on Friday, August 30, but that will depend on departures. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen could still leave before the window shuts and there is significant interest in Scott McTominay.",

      "Jadon Sancho was mooted as a potential bargaining chip for Manchester United to put forward in their attempts to sign Manuel Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain this summer. However, as it plays out, it's actually the United man who could be the ace card in a proposed swap deal in and out of Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho to Chelsea is the sort of fantasy move Football Manager players would revel in. But, even though Chelsea are doing their best to prove otherwise, the transfer market is no computer game.",
      "United have spent similarly haphazardly in recent years. Now that Ineos are on board, though, there's proper hope that will become a thing of the past, although that notion won't be properly proven one way or another until their new signings bed in and start producing the goods.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee will fly the Ineos flag for the early stages of the recently-established co-ownership. There's still a whole lot of work to be done but, from here on in this summer, it will be about outgoings and generating much-needed funds for further additions.",
      "Step forward Sancho. The ex-Borussia Dortmund forward has been re-integrated by Ten Hag this summer, despite their public spat last season, but there's every chance he could still leave Old Trafford before August 30 comes and goes if someone stumps up the right amount of cash.",
      "Have money, will spend. That ought to be the Chelsea motto.",
      "Reports (albeit tentative) from fussball.news indicate the Blues are about to come calling for Sancho this summer, in their latest blockbuster move, which if true presents United with a transfer conundrum. It's something Ineos will have to consider carefully - financially and otherwise - owing to past mistakes.",
      "Among the worst spenders in elite world football for a decade, United spent more than £200million on four right wingers - namely Facundo Pellistri, Amad, Sancho and Antony - in a near-three year time frame between October 2020 and August 2023. However, while they each remain at the club, the best operator in that area is an Academy graduate who cost pennies and actually prefers to drift in from the left.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho arguably carries United's biggest threat, wherever he plays. Sancho and Marcus Rashford add up to an ongoing imbalance on the right-hand side.",
      "Reports from Germany on Sancho reckon Chelsea could put together a package featuring cash and two unnamed Academy players in a part-swap deal. In order to re-stack the odds in their favour, United ought to consider asking them for England U21s international Noni Madueke instead.",
      "Madueke - schooled in the Eredivisie - ticks a whole lot of boxes for Ten Hag beyond that Dutch link. The ex-PSV Eindhoven man is a left-footed right winger with bags of style and promise, even though it hasn't worked out for him quite yet upon his return to the UK.",
      "Well-known to United assistant manager Ruud van Nistelrooy from their PSV days, Madueke is thought to be up for grabs this summer, with Newcastle among the sides chasing his signature. What he might cost is up in the air, but in any case it wouldn't be more than Sancho; offering scope for United to make a mini profit on a double deal that might just benefit them, Chelsea and the two players involved.",

      "United have signed Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui so far, although Yoro fractured his metatarsal in pre-season and won't return until October.",
      "The signings of De Ligt and Mazraoui from Bayern Munich were confirmed on Tuesday night and both will be included in the matchday squad to face Fulham at Old Trafford. Regarding the team news elsewhere, Luke Shaw (calf) and Rasmus Hojlund (hamstring) are unavailable and Ten Hag didn't clarify whether Victor Lindelof would return to the squad.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up against Fulham...",
      "There is absolutely no chance that Ten Hag will pick this team. De Ligt and Mazraoui would offer some balance but there is logic to only starting one of them given the fitness of Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo has to be the midfield duo as long as United go without signing a new one. Amad and Alejandro Garnacho are the in-form wingers who merit starts and Joshua Zirkzee is a striker, so has to be used sooner or later. United are fortunate Bruno Fernandes performs wherever he plays.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "The new season is finally here and doesn't it feel good? De Ligt's arrival was confirmed earlier in the week and he should make his debut here, starting alongside Maguire in central defence. Martinez was at left-back in the Community Shield and it's logical to stick with him in that role.",
      "Fernandes is likely to start as a false nine again, but I'd start the club captain in his natural position and give Zirkzee, who has taken part in training for three weeks, his debut.",
      "There is a big decision to be made on Rashford, who I think Ten Hag will start. However, Amad has been excellent in pre-season, he was one of the standout performers at Wembley last weekend and deserves to start, so I'd play Garnahco on the left and bench Rashford.",
      "George Smith",
      "Ten Hag has confirmed that both Mazraoui and De Ligt will be in the matchday squad, but it remains to be seen if they will start or be on the bench. However a lack of defensive options should force his hand, even if it does feel somewhat unlikely.",
      "United have failed to recruit a new holding midfielder so far this summer, meaning Casemiro is an automatic starter. Mainoo will rightfully join him in the engine room, as should Mount, who did offer flashes of his capabilities in pre-season.",
      "Amad and Garnacho are worthy of occupying the two wide areas after their contributions both in pre-season and at Wembley last weekend. Fernandes should lead the line again, despite Zirkzee being available and waiting in the wings.",

The former Brazil international has played five times against United during that time, including in their 2-1 defeat at the City Ground late last year.",

      "When Casemiro's name vanished from the Manchester United team sheet between it being submitted at Wembley for the FA Cup final and then confirmed to the public it looked like a bizarre final act in his Old Trafford career.",
      "The Brazilian had been struggling with tightness in the lead-up to the final game of the season but the 15-minute turnaround between being named as a sub and then withdrawing himself led to questions. After a difficult season, Casemiro's spot in the team was always likely to go to Sofyan Amrabat.",
      "So difficult had his second season at Old Trafford been that it was expected Casemiro's time was up. A high-earning 32-year-old whose worth to the team had diminished was an obvious candidate to be axed by Ineos, who would never have sanctioned a £60m (rising to £70m) fee for a 30-year-old two summers ago.",
      "The problem with that plan was finding a suitor and as interest from Saudi Arabia cooled, United were left with little option but to keep the former Real Madrid man and try and make it work. Casemiro was back at Wembley for the Community Shield last week and will start on the opening night of the Premier League season.",
      "The signs in pre-season have been mixed. He has looked better but still far from faultless. He has had his pocket picked on a few occasions and that is a concern given he looked sluggish last season and his desire to launch into slide tackles saw him become a regular in the referee's notebook.",
      "With no new holding midfielder in the squad, which version of Casemiro turns up will be pivotal to the early weeks of United's season? Will it be the influential leader from his first year at the club or the player who seemed to be regressing at an alarming rate last term?",
      "You can be sure opposition teams will be targeting him early in the season. They will be closing him down quickly to see whether the speed in his game has returned for the benefit of a free summer. If he is back to his best, able to shut down attacks and get United on the front foot quickly, he remains an asset.",
      "That is a big if, however. In an ideal world, United would have moved on from him by now. A new holding midfielder has been a target all summer. Manuel Ugarte is still determined to swap Paris from Manchester and United's interest has been live throughout the window. They briefly held an interest in Martin Zubimendi before he decided to stay with Real Sociedad.",
      "Then there is the strange case of Amrabat, whose loan deal expired at the end of June but who is still listed as a United player on the club website. They have gone to the effort of uploading a picture of him in this season's kit, which suggests a return is more than possible.",
      "The issue is finding the funds to make any of this happen. The anticipated number of sales hasn't come to fruition, as evidenced by the lack of a market for Casemiro. United didn't want to sell Scott McTominay but there is at least significant interest in him and a sale could add to the transfer budget, allowing another midfielder to be signed.",
      "If Casemiro's struggles continue in the opening couple of weeks of the season, it will make finding the finance to sign an alternative even more pressing. The five-times Champions League winner might begin this season as the most important cog in the machine for Erik ten Hag.",

      "Frenkie de Jong's relationship with Barcelona appears to be deteriorating - but for reasons Manchester United won't like.",
      "United continue to be linked with De Jong, who was first targeted by Erik ten Hag upon his arrival in 2022. The Dutch pair worked together at Ajax - something five of Ten Hag's signings at Old Trafford have in common.",
      "A fee was agreed with Nou Camp chiefs for the transfer, but De Jong opted to stay in Spain. His cash-strapped club have struggled to sell him as hoped because he's their highest-earning player and contracted until 2026.",
      "Requests for the 27-year-old to renegotiate on a smaller salary have repeatedly fallen on deaf ears, which has been a constant source of frustration for them. According to AS, they suspect he's waiting to leave as a free agent at the end of his deal - which would position him well to secure another mega-money wage.",
      "There's also said to be increasing annoyance about De Jong's injury status. The ankle injury he suffered in April's El Clasico came with an estimated recovery time of six to eight weeks.",
      "But De Jong missed Euro 2024 with the Netherlands before returning from his holiday out of shape and with a swollen foot, it's claimed. Four months have passed and he's not expected to return before the September international break, with Barca \"bewildered\" at the difference in his attitude to others around him.",
      "In stark contrast, team-mate Pedri has recovered in double-quick time from the knee problem he suffered for Spain in Germany, putting himself in contention for the start of the La Liga season. There might therefore be scope for United to try and capitalise on those issues before the summer window closes on August 30.",
      "However, the question marks which have been raised about De Jong's attitude, as well as his injury record woes, don't correlate with the transfer approach Sir Jim Ratcliffe's team have been taking this summer. The signings of Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui appear to have been made with one eye on the future, adopting a more sensible strategy than the one used under the Glazers' rule.",
      "Not only would De Jong not be able to make an immediate impact due to his current problem, but Barcelona's complaints about his application don't bode well long-term. Ill-discipline and injury-prone are characteristics which have plagued United teams of recent years, perhaps hence why other targets like PSG's Manuel Ugarte have been explored this summer.",

      "The England star, who has expressed a desire to leave west London, has been linked with Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal, but Erik ten Hag's side have now entered the fray. With Rasmus Hojlund sidelined for an expected six weeks, Joshua Zirkzee - who made an immediate impact with a winner off the bench against Fulham - is his only recognised striker available.",
      "Toney, who would bring a proven goal-scoring record to Old Trafford, could be subject to the same strategy that saw United secure Mason Mount and £58m man Leny Yoro - bidding above market rate for a player nearing the end of his contract.",
      "Brentford are holding firm on their £60m asking price for their star player, even though he has publicly stated his readiness for a big move. United could employ the same shrewd tactic used to secure Mount and Yoro, attempting to snatch Toney for a fee while other clubs wait to sign him on a free deal next year.",
      "With the financial support of new minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has already facilitated big-money moves for £36.5m Zirkzee and £42m Matthijs de Ligt, United could meet Brentford's asking price and, as with previous transfers, win the race for Toney.",
      "Mount made a surprise switch to Manchester United in 2023, with the Red Devils shelling out £55m for the English talent. Liverpool had been in the frame but reportedly backed out due to protracted talks with Chelsea, allowing United to swoop in.",
      "United pulled off a similar coup this summer, snatching Yoro from Real Madrid's grasp. The defender was on course to join the Spanish giants on a free transfer in 2025, but United stepped in, agreed to Lille's £58m asking price and secured his services.",
      "With competition heating up for Toney, United might need to employ the same aggressive strategy they used for Mount and Yoro. Brentford manager Thomas Frank expressed his desire for Toney to remain at the Gtech Community Stadium amid the speculation, telling Sky Sports post-Euro 2024: \"You never know.",
      "\"He is a Brentford player. I would love him to stay. They'll give me a very positive challenge. But, you know, I haven't met a coach that didn't want as many good players as possible. So, right now, Ivan is a Brentford player.",

The former Watford and Sheffield United man has been credited with making massive improvements in the academy, and that is now filtering into the first team.",
      "After impressing Erik ten Hag this time last year during pre-season, midfielder Kobbie Mainoo went onto play a key role in the season. His performances earned him a call up to the England team for Euro 2024.",
      "The 19-year-old made a total of 32 first team appearances for United in all competitions last season, scoring five goals. He was hailed for his performance in the FA Cup final against Man City as United came out as 2-1 winners.",

      "Ten Hag has shown with Mainoo that he is not afraid of putting young players in if they impress. That’s a good sign for both Collyer and Amass ahead of the new season, but their development is good news for United, even if they don’t break into the first team.",
      "Their performances mean that clubs will be willing to pay good money if they are sold now or in the future. The fact that they are both academy graduates means that any fee made will go down as pure profit on the club’s accounts.",
      "If that is the case, then it will be a big boost for United given the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs).

      "Just ask Harry Amass, who started against Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool on tour in the USA.",
      "\"I enjoy it, man,\" he said. \"In front of the crowds, playing with the best players, I’m enjoying it. You’ve just got to show your aggressive side. You might be young, smaller than the opponent, but you have to show you are aggressive and don’t back down. Then you can have a good game.\"",
      "Amass spoke to Manchester-based reporters in the mixed zone in the Snapdragon Stadium last week and a start against Liverpool in Columbia followed that conversation.",
      "The youngster was asked about a potential start in the Community Shield against Manchester City and said: \"No conversations have been had yet, but this pre-season is a chance to prove that if I am picked I can do it. Obviously we’ll see what happens when Luke [Shaw] and Tyrell [Malacia] come back.",
      "\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career. I am just waiting for that moment, I am ready.\"",
      "Luke Shaw started for England in the final of the European Championship against Spain and has been given an extended break, while Tyrell Malacia is still recovering from injury.",
      "Malacia last played a competitive fixture for the Netherlands in June last year and has faced a prolonged period on the sidelines due to a knee injury, which required two rounds of surgery.",
      "The 24-year-old is expected to be available again in two months, which opens the door for Amass, and the London-born full-back intends to capitalise on the opportunity.",
      "After just one year at United, Amass has already drawn comparisons to Shaw, who swapped the South for the North himself when he was a teenager. \"It is a good comparison,\" he said.",
      "\"In my opinion, [Shaw is] one of the best left-backs in the Premier League, if not the best for a long time. So I am not gonna complain at the comparisons!\"",
      "United thought Shaw had the quality to play at Old Trafford for 10 years when he was signed from Southampton in 2014 and they recognised similar potential in Amass when he was signed from Watford last summer, a move that was considered a coup given the interest from other clubs.",
      "Amass was persuaded to sign for United and hasn't looked back. He was tremendous for the Under-18s last season, playing a key role in a supremely talented team that won a treble, and is now on the cusp of making his senior debut after delivering mature pre-season performances.",
      "Anyone who has watched Amass will understand there can be no concerns about his ability, talent or mentality. He is a technically exceptional, modern-day full-back, but the only question mark against the youngster was whether he was physical enough for senior football.",
      "Amass is diminutive but proved himself on the pre-season tour. His 'aggression' compensates for his lack of stature and he got the better of Mohamed Salah at the weekend.",
      "Malacia won't be involved in the squad for the Community Shield against City on Saturday and Shaw won't have the fitness to play 90 minutes at Wembley.",
      "Amass is almost guaranteed to be involved in some capacity and that will highlight his impressive progress in the space of just a few months, as the youngster only got close to the pitch when he warmed up on the sidelines when he was last at Wembley for the FA Cup semi-final.",
      "Erik ten Hag named Amass, Ethan Wheatley, Habeeb Ogunneye and Louis Jackson on a handful of benches at the end of last season due to the injury crisis and any observers would have noticed how slight they looked, which is normal at their age, in the pre-match warm-ups.",
      "However, what Amass lacks in physicality, he makes up for in character, aggression and talent, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see him start against City in the Community Shield.",

      "Southerners Collyer and Amass are doing their utmost to extend the number to 251 as soon as possible. United expect Collyer, Amass and Wheatley to remain with the squad beyond the transfer window.",
      "Collyer, 20, has started in three of United's four pre-season games and strapped on the captain's armband for the second half against Rosenborg. The 17-year-old Amass has lined up in both tour games in the United States.",
      "Left back Amass followed up his invaluable 45 minutes against Arsenal in Los Angeles, where he was blindsided by Gabriel Jesus for the equalising goal, with a complete performance against Real Betis in San Diego. He capped it with an assist for Amad and drew approval from the crowd with his tenacious tackling.",

You’ve just got to show your aggressive side, you might be young, smaller than the opponent, but you have to show you are aggressive and don’t back down. Then you can have a good game.\"",
      "Amass only joined the United academy from Watford last year. Such was his importance during the run-in last season, Erik ten Hag checked on his well-being in the Carrington canteen when the academy squad returned from their title-clinching win at Wolves in April.",
      "Luke Shaw only played 15 times for United last term and Tyrell Malacia's absence from club football is nearing 15 months. Amass could conceivably start the Community Shield against Manchester City on Saturday.",

      "Diminutive, fleet-footed and attack-minded, there are obvious parallels with the great Barcelona and Spain left back Jordi Alba. Shaw is another Cockney left back who has settled in Manchester for a decade.",
      "Amass approves of that comparison. \"It is a good comparison. In my opinion one of the best left-backs in the Premier League, if not the best for a long time. So I am not gonna complain about the comparison!\"",
      "\"We have to make progress,\" Ten Hag said on Amass. \"But we all see here a potential where we have seen in previous years, for instance two years ago, Garnacho last season. We had it during last season with Kobbie, but he (Amass) is not that far now at this moment. But if we train him well, if we coach him well, then in three months it's possible that he can be on that point.",
      "\"But in this moment he needs to catch up and he has to develop some skills already to play for Manchester United, competing for the highest positions in the league. But with big talent it can go up very quickly and that is very interesting to see if he is capable of doing this.\"",
      "Collyer, signed from Brighton as an 18-year-old two years ago, trained under Ten Hag as early as September 2022. He is one of only three academy players whose contract signing Ten Hag insisted on attending. The other two were Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"I think it's a massive boost,\" Collyer says of Ten Hag's attendance for his signing ceremony. \"It shows obviously he rates me as a player. Just onwards and upwards really, just got to give my best every day and see what happens.\"",
      "Collyer came on for half-an-hour at the Snapdragon Stadium and thwarted Betis twice in injury time with valiant interventions. He has acquitted himself impressively and United need to bring down the average age of their midfield department.",
      "\"When you're on the bench I think it's really valuable just to be in and around it, experience what it's like on a matchday,\" Collyer explains. \"In the changing room, on the bench, with a crowd, getting used to it. Now I've managed to get quite a lot of minutes in pre-season, so I'm happy.",
      "\"I'd say with me, a lot of my work is off the ball as well. Predominantly, I'm a really busy player, I like to get about the pitch and an area of my game I'd like to improve on is in possession. So I think the only way you're going to get better is by demanding the ball, getting on it and not backing away from situations when you could.\"",
      "Ten Hag made a beeline for Mainoo after United's League Cup victory last year and back at Wembley 15 months later, did likewise with Collyer after United won the FA Cup. \"He just said take it all in, enjoy myself and keep working hard and you never know what can happen,\" Collyer reveals.",
      "\"He's a really good guy, the manager. With everyone, he tells you what he wants from each player, he tries his best to help you out, as well as with the other coaching staff as well.",
      "\"At the end of the day, they do everything for us and we have to put it out on the pitch and give everything for them.\"",
      "Stockport-born Wheatley was one of a handful of positives from the listless defeat to Rosenborg last month. He can expect to continue training with the first team amid Rasmus Hojlund's six-week absence with a hamstring strain.",
      "\"I'm just taking everything as it comes, to be honest,\" he cautions. \"Obviously, I had a little taste of it last season. This season, I just want to keep my head down, keep developing as a player and keep impressing, so hopefully get more chances.",
      "\"The club, its history is of bringing through loads of academy players, the likes of Kobbie, playing with us less than a year ago and breaking into the first team, inspires us and motivates us. Because we know the pathway is there. If we impress, get the chances that will be given at this club we'll take them.\"",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy has not rejoined United as a striker coach but Wheatley, born in the same year that Van Nistelrooy left United, is picking his brains. \"I think especially since Ruud came in, obviously he was a top striker, he was probably one of the best strikers we've had at the club.",

      "Manchester United have a number of areas that need to be improved, but the club selected three priority areas this summer.",
      "A striker and a centre-back have arrived, while it is thought that Erik ten Hag is closing in on a new midfielder, Manuel Ugarte. While Leny Yoro’s three-month setback could push United into another centre-half signing this window, other positions may need some attention.",
      "One of those is left-back, given how injuries decimated options there last season. Luke Shaw is back to fitness but only played 15 matches last term due to issues and is yet to go through a full season at United without injury.",
      "Meanwhile, Tyrell Malacia is not expected to return until October, having not played in more than a year due to setbacks in his rehabilitation from serious surgery. Sergio Reguilon was acquired on loan last deadline day but returned to Tottenham in January after Ten Hag ended his stay early, with Shaw and Malacia both expected back soon. That never happened.",
      "As a result, Diogo Dalot, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and even Victor Lindelof had to cover in the role with full-back options stretched. Sorting another loan this summer to cover for Malacia would be sensible.",
      "But meanwhile, academy recruit Harry Amass has impressed so far in pre-season, most notably against Real Betis. The 17-year-old joined from Watford last August with big hopes for the future, and the first fruits of his potential are starting to show.",
      "A few first-team stints this coming season followed by consistent progress, and United might not need to find a new left-back when Shaw’s contract runs out in 2027, saving a good few million. For now, third-choice at United is an ample status, and the reality is that the team might still need more experienced cover at left-back via a loanee until Malacia returns.",
      "Another area of debate is the right-wing position. On paper, United have a number of options there, with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford able to play in the role, Alejandro Garnacho too, albeit to limited effect.",
      "In reality, the spot has hardly been nailed down in Ten Hag’s tenure, with Antony underwhelming his £85m price tag, Rashford preferring the left flank far more, and Sancho falling out with the manager, a feud that has now been quashed.",
      "There has been good reason to suggest that the right wing needs a new addition, but United need not bother. Amad can save United a good few quid in the short term with his assets from the right, as shown against Real Betis.",
      "His breakaway goal against Liverpool in last season’s FA Cup tie showed the raw talent he has, something that former Sunderland boss Tony Mowbray was never shy to underline during Amad’s 14-goal loan spell at the Black Cats two seasons ago.",
      "Amad has now scored twice in pre-season, for what that is worth. His goal against Rangers might have felt sweet given his torrid former prior loan spell in Scotland.",
      "But it was against Real Betis that he showed what he can do when he has minutes under his belt, scoring United’s second of the game after winning a penalty for their first. After recovering from a long-term injury in time for the second half of the season, Amad only managed to start the final three league games.",
      "Now 22, the attacker has the confidence and ability to show he can challenge and perhaps usurp Antony on the right for more starts. Either way, his resurgence has saved United from forking out millions for another",

      "Manchester United are closing in on the signing of promising young talent Chido Martin-Obi after the youngster turned down a new contract at Premier League rivals Arsenal. The Gunners are said to have pulled out all the stops to tie the 16-year-old down to fresh terms, but it's United who look set to win the race for the Denmark-born striker.",
      "Obi-Martin, who scored 29 goals in 17 league matches for Arsenal's Under-18s last year, went from strength to strength last season, notably scoring 10 goals in a single game against Liverpool. It's understood United's head of the academy, Nick Cox, and the head of academy recruitment, Luke Fedorenko, are the main driving forces behind the deal.",
      "Once the i's have been dotted and the t's crossed, it will be a significant coup for United's youth set-up which has been undergoing a renaissance after a period of underachieving and Cox's appointment as head of academy in 2019 was a key moment.",
      "The Manchester Evening News spoke with football.london's chief Arsenal writer Kaya Kaynak for an insight into Martin-Obi, his understanding of the deal and what sort of player he is ahead of his arrival in Manchester.",
      "Kaya Kaynak: \"It's a bit hard to say as he's still so young, but one thing he seems to be very good at is scoring goals. He's quite a bit taller than most others around his age group right now and looks stylistically a bit similar to Alexander Isak with his languid running and technical ability.\"",
      "KK: \"Arsenal were really keen to keep him. They pulled out all the stops and were confident of doing so after keeping other young talents like Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly in recent years.",
      "\"However, they do feel they offered all they were willing to offer. With that in mind, there's a feeling of acceptance at the decision Chido has decided to take.\"",
      "KK: \"Any player who scores as many goals as Chido did at such a young age is going to be thought of very highly. It's probably fair to say was viewed as one of the top three or four prospects right now.",
      "\"Arsenal are constantly using internal analytics to assess the trajectory of their players and he did look to be a promising talent. At the same time though, it's so hard to tell at 16 and many were intrigued to see how he would have coped at a higher age level.\"",
      "KK: \"I'd say so. There's clearly a high-potential player in there. He's someone who can score lots of goals and that's not easy to find.",
      "\"The big test for him will be seeing how he steps up through the age groups. If he manages that though, United have a real player on their hands.\"",
      "KK: \"I think the fact that he was in such high demand this summer tells you what a good player he is. He was wanted by clubs across Europe as well as in England.\"",

      "Dan Ashworth has met with Manchester United Women's players after a turbulent summer for Marc Skinner's side.",
      "United have come in for criticism of late number after a number of high-profile players, including England goalkeeper Mary Earps and captain Katie Zelem, were allowed to leave the club on free transfers, while co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy when he admitted plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "Fan frustration was further compounded when it emerged Skinner's side were set to be moved out of their state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate the men's team while a £50m refurbishment of their Carrington facilities was underway.",
      "However, Ashworth's long-awaited arrival from Newcastle United last month has offered some cause for optimism, with the sporting director having previously been a huge advocate for the growth of the women's game during his time with the Magpies and in his previous role at Brighton & Hove Albion. And the 53-year-old has now met with Skinner and his players as they ramp up their pre-season preparations at St George's Park.",
      "Pictures shared on the club's website show Ashworth giving a speech to the women's first-team squad and shaking hands with stars such as Ella Toone and Millie Turner. This comes after he outlined his vision for the Reds in an open letter to supporters.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said last month. \"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United.",
      "\"Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that. Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",

Awujo made her senior international debut for Canada at 18-years-old and has 19 caps for her country to date, reaching the quarter-finals of this summer’s Paris 2024 Olympic games.",
      "Reflecting on her move to Manchester, Awujo said: “To say that I’m a professional footballer for Manchester United is insane. I’m so excited for the season ahead, what the future holds here and just to be a red devil. I cannot wait to play in front of the great Manchester United fans.”",
      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “Simi is an exciting young talent who we are delighted has chosen to continue her football journey with us here at Manchester United. Our wonderful fans can expect a midfielder with international pedigree, who will only develop further in our competitive English game.”",
      "Awujo is United's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Melvine Malard, Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandber.

      "Earps joined the Reds in 2019 and helped the club win the FA Cup last year. However, the shot-stopper opted to embark on a new chapter when her contract expired in June after a disappointing Women's Super League (WSL) campaign saw United finished fifth last term - 21 points worse off than in the previous campaign.",
      "Despite being linked with a move to Arsenal, Earps chose to join PSG, who have qualified for the Women's Champions League for six consecutive seasons. Speaking on the latest episode of the BBC's Tooney & Russo Show, Earps said she has established some \"great relationships\" in Manchester, but her decision to leave was fueled by \"the opportunity to play for a great team in top competitions\" and be \"in a position to win silverware\".",
      "\"It's like an itch you can never scratch enough,” Earps said. And the 31-year-old's former United teammate Ella Toone, who also plays alongside Earps for the Lionesses, was full of praise for the goalkeeper.",
      "\"She deserves everything,\" said Toone. \"Mary's dream - and it always has been - is to play at the highest level, play in the Champions League and that's what she's done.\"",
      "Earps is not the only player to have left United this summer, with captain Katie Zelem and forward Lucia Garcia also having departed. Reflecting last month on her decision to move overseas, Earps wrote on Instagram: \"The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don’t feel it aligns with the timing of where I’m at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.\"",

      "As Manchester United set to work dismantling Tottenham Hotspur in the Women's FA Cup final, there was one player inside Wembley Stadium whose loyalties were split.",
      "Grace Clinton, who joined United from Everton in 2022, had spent the season on loan at Spurs and was therefore ineligible to feature against her parent club. Her absence was a huge blow for Robert Vilahamn's side, who ultimately fell to a 4-0 defeat in north-west London as the Reds romped to their first major piece of silverware.",
      "Clinton had been a revelation during her season-long stint at Brisbane Road, completing a clean sweep of Tottenham's Player of the Season awards and breaking into the senior Lionesses squad. \"She will be the next superstar in this country if you ask me,\" Vilahamn said after the midfielder's impressive start to life on loan. \"I think she's brilliant and has the potential to be so good.\"",
      "Clinton form was so good, in fact, that Tottenham were keen to make her stay in the capital permanent. “She cannot stay because she’s not a part of us next year,\" Vilahamn told The Athletic in April. \"But if you ask me if I want to buy her, there would be a high potential I want to do that.\"",
      "The 21-year-old - who also excelled on loan at Championship side Bristol City in 2022/23 - seemed to relish her time at Spurs, forging a close friendship with teammate Celin Bizet and flourishing under the watchful eye of Vilahamn. “Confidence for me comes from the manager, and both Robert and (England boss) Sarina (Wiegman) have given me so much of that this season,” Clinton told the MEN earlier this year.",
      "“This season I’ve just been filled with confidence and I think you can see that on the pitch. That freedom and confidence from them has allowed me to go and express myself.”",
      "This week, however, seemed to draw a definite line under Clinton's Tottenham adventure, with the midfielder taking to social media to pen an emotional farewell to the Lilywhites. \"This past year was by far my happiest season of football,\" she wrote on Instagram.",
      "\"I loved every minute at this club and I’ve made friends for life along the way. I’m so beyond grateful to the staff and my teammates for making this club so special to be a part of. Most importantly thank you to our fans for your unbelievable support this past year, you truly helped us make history and those are moments I will cherish with me.\"",
      "While part of Clinton's heart might always belong to Spurs, her focus will now turn to transforming United into a consistent force in the Women's Super League (WSL), with the former Everton prodigy set to return to Leigh Sports Village as Marc Skinner's side ramp up their pre-season preparations. Despite beating Tottenham to the FA Cup trophy last term, the Reds faltered in the top flight, finishing in fifth place and winning just 10 of their league games.",
      "In spite of United's turbulent campaign, manager Skinner was somewhat controversially awarded a one-year contract extension by the club's hierarchy and the 41-year-old will surely now be delighted to have Clinton to call upon as he bids to turn the Reds' WSL fortunes around.",
      "Though he has always been unequivocal in his stance on the 21-year-old, insisting that her long-term future lies in Manchester, her return will be a huge boost for Skinner, particularly considering the club have parted company with midfield duo Katie Zelem and Irene Guerrero this summer.",
      "\"All I hear is Tottenham want to keep Grace, of course they want to keep Grace,\" the United boss said when quizzed on the club's plans for Clinton back in May. \"She's a fantastic player.",
      "\"We don't get the credit that we identified her qualities at Everton, we brought her to Manchester United, gave her six months, sent her on loan at Bristol – she got experience. She then went on loan to Tottenham to get more experience. I don't think people recognise that – there is a plan for each individual we bring into the club.",
      "\"With Grace, it's absolutely worked. I want to bring her back to the club and be part of what we're doing because I think she has a huge say in how we'll play.\"",
      "Certainly, Clinton returns to United a much more well-rounded player than when she left, having gained valuable experience on both the domestic and international stage. The midfielder won her first senior cap for the Lionesses against Austria in February and took just 19 minutes to crown her eye-catching debut with a goal.",
      "\"She plays like a natural,\" Wiegman said after the game. \"She wants to have the ball. She picks up the things we talk about very quickly and that's what you see on the pitch too. She just goes out there and plays.\"",
      "Clinton has won a further two caps over the past five months and is surely destined for many more. But it is not only on the pitch where the youngster has learnt some valuable lessons of late.",
      "“Grace is a great girl,” Manchester City and England defender Alex Greenwood told the MEN in April. “You see her about and she's always wanting to ask questions, learn from everyone, and she's a really confident girl as well. She believes in herself and she always wants to improve, and I love that about Grace.",
      "“She was doing a press conference and so she came up to me and Lucy (Bronze) and said: ‘What can’t I say?’ That’s just an innocent question and that’s not even about football but it’s stuff that comes hand-in-hand now with playing for the Lionesses.",
      "“At dinner she asks questions like ‘What do you eat Al?’ I remember her first camp, we were on a walk before the game and I said: ‘Grace, you haven’t shut up this whole walk’...but it’s nice.”",
      "While it's clear Clinton still has plenty to learn - both on and off the pitch - her return could spell very good news for United as they look to bounce back from the disappointment of last season. Her time at Spurs may have played a vital role in shaping her career to date but it is the Reds who must now help England's \"next superstar\" fulfil her true potential.",
