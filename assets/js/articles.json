      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim wants Kobbie Mainoo to STAY at Old Trafford. The Red Devils boss was adamant in his press conference ahead of his side's clash at Burnley despite speculation mounting over a possible exit.",
      "Napoli are among the club's said to be interested in Mainoo's signature with the midfielder desperate for playing time ahead of next summer's World Cup. The 20-year-old was not selected in Ruben Amorim's latest England squad ahead of fixtures in September, falling behind figures such as Elliot Andereson and Adam Wharton.",
      "Mainoo has yet to play a Premier League minute this season. And the starlet has told United chiefs he wants to make the move to Serie A permanently.",
      "Antonio Conte's side are ready to offer a four-year deal having signed star player Scott McTominay 12 months ago. And Mainoo is hopeful of undergoing a similar progression if a £50million move materialises with negotiations over an extension to his current contract having stalled with United.",
      "But Amorim has attempted to pour cold water on the suggestion of a move, and says the club need Mainoo at their disposal. The Portuguese coach has called on his charge to fight for his place.",
      "\"I want Kobbie to stay,\" Amorim said. \"He needs to fight for his place.",
      "And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed.",
      "\"Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "United will see some exits in the final days of the summer transfer window however. The club have agreed a £40m deal to see Alejandro Garnacho depart for Chelsea with a transfer being almost finalised.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Antony look set to leave Old Trafford on loan too. Deals with Napoli and Real Betis respectively are expected before the deadline, with neither playing having been included in a squad this season.",
      "United will be hopeful of finding destinations for Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia. Both players spent time on loan last season and have not been involved with the club's first team this summer. Roma are interested in a deal to sign ex-Borussia Dortmund star Sancho.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United risk facing yet another transfer embarrassment if they opt to offload Kobbie Mainoo as well as Alejandro Garnacho before the transfer deadline. Such moves could provide Erik ten Hag with another opportunity to be vindicated nearly 12 months after his sacking.",
      "A troubling trend has developed, with players who struggled to flourish at United being loaned out or sold, only to excel at their new teams. Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa) and Antony (Real Betis) both experienced revivals during loan spells last term, while Anthony Elanga, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Alvaro Carreras have undergone comparable upturns after leaving.",
      "However, no case looks more regrettable than Scott McTominay. That's after the Scot claimed the Serie A Player of the Year award after steering Napoli to the league crown in his debut campaign off the back of departing United.",
      "Given those examples, it's easy to imagine how rival clubs might extract superior performances from promising youngsters like Mainoo and Garnacho should they depart before Monday. And Ten Hag was transparent about his feelings regarding McTominay's switch to Naples last summer, insisting it wasn't his choice.",
      "\"I am a little mixed. I am very happy for him but I would prefer not to lose him because he was so important for our team,\" he told reporters shortly after the sale.",
      "\"He was at Manchester United for over 22 years. But unfortunately, it's the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales. Obviously, homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It's not the right thing to do, but for everyone, for all parts, it's a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it. Of course, for Napoli, a very good player, but also for us.\"",
      "Ten Hag, who handed Mainoo his senior debut at United, heaped praise on the midfielder in August 2024 when he suggested the youngster possessed the qualities to eventually become a \"perfect midfielder.\" That assessment related to the youngster's capacity to excel in all facets of his central role.",
      "Previously hailed as the most promising talent to emerge from United's youth setup in recent memory, Mainoo now finds himself marginalised under Ruben Amorim. The 20-year-old hasn't featured in the Premier League this season and has sought a move to Napoli too, though United are believed to have blocked that prospect for now.",
      "Garnacho was also championed by his former manager before his standing at Old Trafford plummeted, with the player now destined for a switch to Chelsea. Just 12 months ago, Ten Hag was effusive in his praise of Garnacho, positioning him as one of United's most precious assets.",
      "When the Dutchman was questioned last summer about whether the South American could become one of football's elite, he replied: \"A world-class player? He has to go a long way. He has high potential.",
      "\"He showed last season he can contribute and be a starting XI player. To make the jump and become a world-class player, it starts with very hard work. That brought him to where he is now and that will bring him to being that world-class player. I agree he has the potential.\"",
      "Garnacho's attitude appears to have put him in Amorim's bad books ahead of what seems a probable switch to west London. The Argentinian was forced to train separately from the main group in December 2024, coinciding with reports he and his brother were connected to allegations someone within the team was leaking tactical information.",
      "Across the last two campaigns, only skipper Bruno Fernandes (34 goals) and frontman Rasmus Hojlund (26) have netted more times than Garnacho (21) among United players. For a side that has struggled going forward, it's understandable why some fans don't want to see the winger go.",
      "United faced ridicule from supporters for offloading McTominay for under £30million considering his rapid success in Italy. Mainoo might remain for now, but there's genuine concern the £40m price-tag placed on 21-year-old Chelsea-bound Garnacho suggests the same mistake could happen again.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "“So I'm trying to accept that and I'm going to be who I am. That's why I have the passion that I have. At that moment I was really upset and really disappointed, because I felt that we had a very good pre-season, we were playing better, we were being consistent in the way we played. We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham.",
      "“With that kind of performance, I was really disappointed with everything. But now it's a new game and I'm focused on the next one. I'm just focused on this game and I need to live this day by day. I understand that. And I'm going to be like that all the time. So prepare yourself.",
      "“If you are in one way, if you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that are good on that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin.",
      "“So I understand that. And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years, sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don't want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It's going to be hard.”",
      "Amorim insisted he wants Kobbie Mainoo to stay, after the United and England midfielder asked to leave on loan because of a lack of playing time.",

      "Mainoo believes a move to Napoli could have the same effect on his career, but United have so far blocked his exit. And Ferdinand wants Mainoo to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford.",
      "In response to the news, Ferdinand said: \"I don't want to hear that. So Kobbie, if you're watching, please don't let me hear that, please man, I need you to stay at the club. Be patient please, I know it's difficult. It's easy for me to say, but I want to see you here.",
      "\"You couldn't have bet me any money that after his exploits with England that we'd be sitting here going, 'Kobbie Mainoo can't get in the Man United team, they're thinking about selling him and he wants to go'.\"",
      "Mainoo has been an unused substitute in United's opening Premier League games, with manager Ruben Amorim stating that the 20-year-old is competing with club captain Bruno Fernandes for a spot in the team.",
      "\"Mainoo is fighting for his position with Bruno,\" Amorim said after United's 1-1 draw with Fulham. \"I changed two midfielders, I left Mason Mount there because we wanted to score a goal and when I changed, I felt the team needed one holding midfielder. So he needs to fight for his position with Bruno. At the moment he is fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "Mainoo did make his first start of the season in United's humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby on Wednesday, but struggled to make much of an impact. And if he does end up staying at United, Ferdinand has urged Mainoo to make sure that he is ready to make the most of any opportunities he gets.",
      "\"We've all had these moments in our careers where you're like, 'S*** man, I'm not playing. What do I do?' Well, the first thing you do is go to the manager and go, 'What am I not doing that I need to be doing to get in this team?' Right. He's going to tell me. Then I go to work on a training pitch.",

      "Manchester United chiefs will be hoping Ruben Amorim can turn his fortunes around as serious concerns have been raised over the club's mindset. The Portuguese head coach is currently under huge pressure after the Red Devils were dumped out of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night after losing to League Two side Grimsby on penalties.",
      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss himself appeared to voice doubts over whether he's the right man for the job in the wake of United's latest humiliation. However, the possibility of ditching Amorim just ten months into his tenure poses a serious problem for the club's hierarchy after backing him to the tune of more than £200million during the summer transfer window.",
      "And former United goalkeeper Ben Foster says they will just have to keep their fingers crossed for now that he delivers. Even so, the ex-Wrexham shot-stopper suggested they should switch focus if they do decided to dispense with Amorim's services by bringing in a manager who can fix the Premier League giants' weak mentality.",
      "The 42-year-old reckons they could do a lot worse than appoint former England boss Gareth Southgate as his replacement to achieve that aim if it comes down to it.",
      "Speaking during an appearance on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"I don't know what the answer is, because if you look at the history of recent managers for Man United, you've had some proper big boys in there. You've had Jose Mourinho, Van Gaal and Solskjaer, when he was doing fantastic for a little while.",
      "\"I don't know whether they need to adopt a completely fresh approach. The pressure that's involved in playing for that club is like nowhere else and maybe they've got to go a different way. Even if it's somebody like Gareth Southgate, just give it a go.",
      "He added: \"It's somebody that's going to maybe change the mentality of the players and take a more pragmatic approach, because I think what they're doing just isn't working at the moment.",
      "\"They've put all their eggs in this basket with Ruben Amorim and they're just going to have to try and ride it out. The top brass at that club are hoping and praying to god that it turns around.\"",
      "Southgate is one of the bookies' favourites to replace Amorim if he is removed from his post. The 54-year-old has been without a job since stepping down from his England role after they lost to Spain in the Euro 2024 final.",
      "Meanwhile, Foster has criticised Amorim's negative body language during United's cup exit against Grimsby. The manager appeared unable to watch the penalty shootout at times and later criticised his players after the match.",
      "Foster, who spent five years at Old Trafford between 2005 and 2010 said: \"It's tough going at the minute. I thought in the summer that they've got this big, new energy, with some fantastic signings, and it's all going to be different.",
      "\"The first few weeks of the season, it seems to be pretty much the same old really. The other night against Grimsby was just the epitome of it as well. The worry of it was seeing the manager in the dugout.",
      "\"It's really not a good look if you're on the pitch about to take your penalties, and you look back in the dugout, and the manager is sitting there and he's burying his head in his hands. It doesn't scream that we're all in this together.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo could be on the verge of a Manchester United exit, and the Red Devils could be losing a player Alejandro Garnacho once hailed as the \"the best player in the squad.\" While Garnacho's future also looks set to lie elsewhere, with a move to Chelsea pending, Mainoo could be in line to join Serie A champions Napoli before Monday's transfer deadline with the midfielder pushing for a move.",
      "Mainoo, 20, was once considered as a key component of United's future due to his performances over the last two seasons. The youngster racked up an impressive collection of wonder goals and earned his England debut just over a year ago.",
      "He also claimed the man of the match performance in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2024 after scoring the winner. It was in the aftermath of the game against City where Garnacho showered his team-mate with the highest praise.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, alongside Mainoo, Garnacho reflected on the midfielder's instrumental contribution to the victory.",
      "\"Just incredible,\" Garnacho said. \"I always say, for me, he's the best player in the squad and he's the youngest. We are also very good friends so I am very happy for him\" Upon handing the man of the match trophy to Mainoo, Garnacho said: \"My man, I love you.\"",
      "With a squad littered with talent, it spoke volumes to Mainoo's ability, that at just 20, he was given such an accolade. The England midfielder’s club contract runs until 2027 at United but negotiations over an extension have stalled.",
      "The Italian champions reportedly have a four-year contract waiting for Mainoo, with the player having told United bosses he wants to go to Serie A, but on a permanent deal.",
      "United, however, are rightfully mindful of the stunning impact made by another of their cast-offs at Napoli, Scott McTominay, and have so far blocked Mainoo's move. Although they are said to value him at £50million and will listen to offers.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, Mainoo has started just 16 out of 44 games, and he was left on the bench for the second successive Premier League match this season as United drew 1-1 with Fulham on Sunday. However, Mainoo did play the full 90 minutes in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby.",
      "A social media video of Mainoo at the full-time whistle at Fulham also went viral, as it showed the youngster looking despondent, with rumours of his potential departure continuing to grow ahead of Monday's deadline.",
      "Meanwhile, United have agreed a £40m deal with Chelsea for Garnacho. It comes after he had fallen out of favour with Amorim in recent months.",
      "The Red Devils have secured a 10 per cent sell-on fee after United dug their heels in and stood firm on their valuation of Garnacho, having rejected Chelsea's initial offer of £25m. Garnacho was left out of United's starting line-up for their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and publicly criticised Amorim in the immediate aftermath of the loss in Bilbao.",
      "Should Mainoo make a move to Napoli he will be hoping to emulate the success of McTominay. The Scotsman was allowed to leave Old Trafford last summer for Antonio Conte's side in a £25m switch.",
      "He has since left produced a string of man of the match performances domestically, and in Europe, to become the first Scot to be shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or since former Rangers striker Ally McCoist in 1987.",

      "Following a shocking Carabao Cup defeat to League Two's Grimsby Town, the heat is certainly on Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim. Many would argue that it's only August, we're just three games into the season, and the club still has some business to sort in the transfer market – but, all the optimism built up in pre-season is fading fast.",
      "The first international break of the season is looming, and the pressure is mounting on Amorim. United must secure a win against Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The Clarets are one of the favourites to suffer relegation from the Premier League, so anything less than a victory for United will be seen as a disappointment. Off the back of the embarrassing Grimsby defeat, crunch talks are planned for the Portuguese boss – and he has hinted discussions will take place behind the scenes after the Burnley clash.",
      "Speaking after their Carabao Cup exit, Amorim said: \"Let’s focus on the next game and then we have time to think about things. We have a lot of debts with our fans so let’s focus on the game.\"",
      "He added: \"We have a job to do, a job to prepare and then we’ll stop and think things through.\"",
      "So, fans may be wondering if Burnley's visit is the make-or-break for Amorim – but he could call in his previous good graces with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "The United chief praised the head coach just months ago, and it is safe to assume this would still be his stance now. Speaking to the BBC in March, Ratcliffe said: \"I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do.",
      "\"I think he is an excellent manager and I think he'll be there for a long time.\"",
      "United have had their fair share of managers since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, leading many to believe that the club should stick with Amorim in the hope he can turn things around. Nearly every United fan agreed that he needed a full pre-season and summer transfer window before they could make a solid judgement.",
      "However, after the manner of Wednesday night's loss on the Lincolnshire coast, questions are being raised about the Portuguese boss just three games into the season.",
      "It seems improbable that United will axe Amorim at this stage, but previous sackings have proven that nothing is impossible in Manchester.",
      "United look to be crying out for stability after numerous years of uncertainty. Amorim was regarded as one of Europe's brightest coaching talents last year and represented United's primary choice to succeed Erik ten Hag last November, suggesting he retains the backing of the club's leadership.",
      "Speaking in the same interview he conducted earlier this year, Ratcliffe added: \"I think if you look at the squad he has got at his disposal, with the injury list he has got at his disposal, and he comes in mid-season where he has had no time to train the players in his style of play, I think he has done really well.",
      "\"I think you are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce.\"",
      "To Amorim's credit, United have shown flashes of their potential under his guidance. But, with just four victories from their previous 17 matches spanning the summer break, the mounting pressure is proving to be increasingly challenging for Amorim.",

      "Grimsby Town owner Jason Stockwood has revealed he was left baffled when a Manchester United official asked him where Ruben Amorim's dressing room was. Stockwood, 55, watched his side complete one of the biggest shocks in League Cup history when the Mariners overcame the Red Devils in a penalty shootout.",
      "Initially, it appeared the League Two side's hearts were going to be broken, as they allowed a 2-0 lead to slip from their grasp. After Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren both took advantage of poor goalkeeping from Andre Onana in the first half, Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire found the net after the break to level the game.",
      "However, a marathon penalty shootout saw Grimsby win 12-11, sparking scenes of jubilation at Blundell Park. After the game, Stockwood revealed an amusing exchange he had with an official at United, which highlighted the stark difference in the clubs' sizes.",
      "Speaking to the Athletic, Stockwood said: \"I'll tell you one funny quick thing. With Manchester United coming to town, they sent us almost a rider for the manager, and it was like, 'Where's the manager's changing room?'",
      "\"And I was like, 'F***ing hell, the manager's changing room?' For us, it is the back of his car. The manager has a changing room at Man United? I thought that was quite amusing.\"",
      "Grimsby's triumph saw them become the first ever club from the fourth division in English football to knock United out of a cup competition. It was another poor showing from the Red Devils, who are yet to win a game in the new campaign.",
      "Initially, there was plenty of promise after they pushed Arsenal all the way at Old Trafford before losing 1-0 to the north Londoners. A sticky 1-1 draw away to Fulham brought United down a peg, but the loss to Grimsby has seen the mood at Old Trafford nosedive.",
      "After watching United arrive, Stockwood noted the Red Devils players looked unprepared for the rainy and physical challenge facing them at Blundell Park. He added: \"They clearly didn't know what they were coming into.",
      "\"When the players came off the bus and onto the pitch, I stood around and the United players did not look like they were up for it. It was all the cliches.",
      "\"They have got all those incredible talents and I'm a massive fan of the Premier League. The individual talent on display last night was extraordinary.",
      "\"The team performance speaks for itself from United. But seeing them coming in, they did not look like they wanted to be there, which I really enjoyed!\"",
      "United face another uncomfortable challenge on the weekend as they host Burnley at Old Trafford. The newly promoted side have their tails up after beating Sunderland in their last Premier League clash, before overcoming Derby County 2-1 in the League Cup.",
      "Considering the mood within and outside United, a clash against Scott Parker's side may be an uncomfortable prospect. United desperately need a victory as they travel to fierce rivals Manchester City and host Chelsea in their next Premier League games.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is at the centre of a bizarre £50million tug of war between Italian champions Napoli and Manchester United.",
      "The Italian champions - who are now targeting the Champions League - have a four-year contract waiting for the 20-year-old midfielder. And Mainoo has told United bosses he wants to go to Serie A - on a permanent deal.",
      "United, mindful of the stunning impact made by another of their rejects, Scott McTominay, have so far blocked the move.",
      "But Mainoo is adamant that he wants to leave before Monday's transfer deadline.",
      "Midfielder McTominay was allowed to leave Old Trafford last summer for Antonio Conte ’s Napoli in a £25million switch.",
      "He has since left produced a string of game-changing performances domestically and in Europe to become the first Scot to be shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or since former Rangers striker Ally McCoist in 1987. McTominay was also named last season’s MVP award - in his debut season at Napoli.",
      "Under Conte, McTominay - much derided and eventually sidelined at Old Trafford - was instrumental in the club’s title success.",
      "The 28-year-old scored 12 times in 34 league appearances and provided a crucial goal on the final day of the season to secure the Scudetto.",
      "Mainoo believes Conte could have a similar effect on his own footballing future and, as a result, wants to leave on a permanent basis rather than on loan as had been previously believed.",
      "Conte believes his quick feet, impressive passing range and speed in tight spaces will help his side as Napoli defend their title and target the Champions League.",
      "Still highly rated by many United fans, the England midfielder’s club contract runs until 2027 but negotiations over an extension have stalled.",
      "It is also understood United would be willing to listen to offers for him as his regular first-team opportunities have stalled under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Mainoo played the full 90 minutes in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby.",
      "Before that, however, he was an unused substitute for United's opening two Premier League games with Amorim insistent he is fighting for a place with skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Stockport-born Mainoo has had an unhappy 12 months at Old Trafford since his fabulous end to the 2023-24 campaign which saw him play at the European Championships with England.",
      "His confidence and form dipped, and he was injured when Erik ten Hag was sacked and Amorim took his place.",
      "As the players struggled with the Portuguese head coach’s system of three at the back, Mainoo was involved in a string of damaging defeats.",
      "Injury struck again in February and, by the time he returned, Amorim’s focus on the Europa League limited his chances.",
      "McTominay, however, is not the only player to have left United and since flourished. Antony was outstanding at Betis and Marcus Rashford helped Aston Villa to the brink of the Champions League semi-finals, earning himself a move to Barcelona.",
      "Chelsea have seen enough in winger Alejandro Garnacho to invest £40million. Now Napoli are determined to take their push for Mainoo to Monday’s transfer deadline wire.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney believes \"something's broken\" at Old Trafford following the club's humiliating League Cup exit to Grimsby. And it's Ruben Amorim's post-match comments about his squad that have left United's all-time top scorer concerned.",
      "The Red Devils crashed out of the competition's second round on Wednesday after losing 12-11 on penalties to the Mariners. United fought back from two goals behind to level and force a shootout, only to endure fresh heartbreak as another miserable start to a campaign continued.",
      "Amorim, who is reportedly set for crunch talks with his employers, sparked concern after the match when he declared: \"My players spoke for me, really loud.\" Some took this to suggest the manager believes his squad's display reflected their commitment levels towards their boss.",
      "Following a record-low 15th-place Premier League finish last term and a raft of new arrivals, many anticipated improvement from United this season. But an opening-day loss at home to Arsenal, followed by a frustrating stalemate at Fulham and their collapse at Grimsby, indicates further suffering awaits.",
      "\"His words were damning on the players. If your manager comes out with those words, there's something broken.\"",
      "Legions of United supporters would share that view. The years following Sir Alex Ferguson's departure have been littered with let-downs, and there's no obvious sign improvements are on the horizon.",
      "Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, was at the helm when the club secured the FA Cup last year, having captured the League Cup the season prior. And precisely when it appeared United couldn't perform worse than their then-record-low eighth-place finish under the Dutchman, Amorim failed to lift results as they tumbled into the bottom half.",
      "There is now growing speculation suggesting Amorim could face the axe before completing his first year at Old Trafford. And Rooney's remarks highlight a worry that the manager himself may be losing belief in what can be achieved with his current squad.",
      "\"What we forget is he's only 40. He's a young manager,\" added Rooney. \"Manchester United is so different to where he's been before. You come in and there's the media team, the commercial team, the fans and the media.",
      "\"There's a pressure with United, which he will never have felt before. When you're not winning games, that can start to get [to you], and it looked like he was at a breaking point.\"",
      "One persistent critique that's emerged regarding United's players in the post-Ferguson era is an absence of leadership despite Amorim's finest efforts to address that problem. Ferguson deliberately identified and signed players with particular character traits throughout his 27-year reign at Old Trafford.",
      "The lack of similar personalities to those under the Scot's reign may be the biggest difference between his success and the subsequent 12 years. This shortfall could potentially trigger another leadership change, and Rooney's concerns about Amorim's attitude may signal cause for alarm.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have no plans to green light Kobbie Mainoo's request for a loan move away - maintaining that they value the young midfielder despite his lack of playing time.",
      "Mainoo is yet to play a minute of Premier League football after the opening two games of the season and has told the hierarchy that he'd like to pursue a temporary move away from Old Trafford, especially with the World Cup coming up in the summer.",
      "However the BBC has claimed that those in Manchester have told the 20-year-old they want him to remain where he is to fight for his place. Chelsea have previously been linked with the player, who would represent pure profit due to his academy status.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute in the loss to Arsenal and then the draw ay Fulham. Ruben Amorim has instead preferred to use Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro as the two midfielders in his system, leaving Mainoo to watch on from the sidelines. Manuel Ugarte has twice appeared from the bench above of the academy graduate.",
      "He did get his first outing of the season in United's embarrassing Carabao Cup loss at Grimsby in midweek, which will have done little to aid Mainoo's chances of more involvement. The midfielder had enjoyed a rapid rise under Erik ten Hag, but that has stalled since Amorim arrived.",
      "The Portuguese coach has been happy to speak publicly regarding what he demands from the midfielder. \"The same as any player in that position. I expect a lot from Kobbie Mainoo,\" he said after leaving him out of the draw with Fulham.",
      "\"Again, people think that sometimes you need to just give... I think it is important for Kobbie to fight for his place. I believe a lot in Kobbie; more than what everyone thinks. I believe a lot in Kobbie. I expect a lot from him. He is playing in one position and is fighting with Bruno. They can play together.\"",
      "Mainoo's previous rise was such that he played in the Euro 2024 final for England less than a year after making his United debut. His presence at Old Trafford also helps retain a proud 88 year record of the club always boasting an academy graduate in their matchday squad – a staggering run of 4,324 matches.",
      "Back in April the United boss highlighted the areas where he wanted to see more from Mainoo. \"I think that is also a little bit the problem,\" he said. \"When I see Kobbie Mainoo, I see a lot of talent but in the way I see it – I could be wrong, that is for sure – I see some things that Kobbie Mainoo has to improve. The pace during the game, he has qualities we can use, in build-up he needs to improve.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko wasn't one of Manchester United's selected penalty takers because he had cramp, it's been claimed. Ruben Amorim’s side suffered a humiliating penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby on Wednesday and the striker has found himself in the spotlight after being United's last outfield player to take a spot kick.",
      "Sesko joined United from RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74million earlier this summer, being the third forward through the door after the earlier arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. The 22-year-old had come on as a substitute in United’s first two Premier League games but was trusted from the start against League Two side Grimsby at Blundell Park.",
      "The Slovenia international had six shots in total, with two being on target, but failed to find a winner for the Red Devils, who forced a penalty shootout after being 2-0 down at half-time. However, Sesko’s place in United’s list of penalty takers arguably captured more attention than his overall performance, though a potential reason for him taking the 10th spot kick has emerged.",
      "BBC Sport reports that Sesko was listed as United’s last outfield penalty taker as he had been experiencing cramp. The defeat to Grimsby was the first 90 minutes the striker had completed since scoring for Leipzig in a 1-1 draw with Holstein Kiel on April 19.",
      "Sesko did score United’s 10th penalty to level the shootout at 9-9 before goalkeepers Andre Onana and Christy Pym also found the net. The order then restarted, with Grimsby winning 12-11 on penalties after a miss from Mbeumo.",
      "The striker suffering from cramp would explain why Amorim was perhaps reluctant to rely on him. However, defenders Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Matthijs de Ligt all stepping up before him did little to instill confidence around Sesko at the start of his United career.",
      "Amorim has already explained that he's still adapting to English football after arriving from Germany, unlike Cunha and Mbeumo, who were signed from Wolves and Brentford, respectively. Sesko’s initial displays have prompted a slight concern from pundits, but Amorim called for patience.",
      "“He needs time. It’s not easy to come off the bench when the game is really fast,” the United boss said after his team’s draw with Fulham last weekend. “He is learning the game is faster than the Bundesliga, but he had some good connections with his team-mates.”",
      "When asked why Sesko was named a substitute, Amorim added: “We tried to imagine what is going to happen during the game. Our team needs to be consistent in the way that we control the game and we need to have options to play a different game on the bench.",
      "“Sesko has had two weeks for us, he is trying to understand everything. We need to wait a little bit to help the player. We just want to win the game and try to help all of our players.”",
      "United will hope to respond positively to their Carabao Cup exit when they host Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday. It remains to be seen whether Sesko will keep his place in attack or again be named on the bench in the Premier League. However, Amorim made his feelings clear about the team after United’s shock defeat in midweek.",
      "\"I know that the best team won, the only team that was on the pitch,” he said after the Grimsby defeat. “I think the team and the players spoke really loud today. So that's it.",
      "\"We lost, the best team won. I think it was really clear for everybody what happened today. It's not just the space [we gave them], but the way we started the game without any intensity - we were completely lost.",
      "\"It's hard to explain. That's why I think they spoke really well. I think they gave the response on the pitch today. When you see something that, like today, it's hard to talk.\"",

      "Talks are planned over how to get the team out of the mess they find themselves in, reports the Telegraph, but Amorim has cast doubt over whether he is the man to lead the revival having struggled to find the answers thus far.",
      "If Amorim does leave - whether by his own choosing or because he's axed - then he could find himself on the radar of Benfica. He played for years with the Portuguese giants and their presidential candidate, Joao Noronha Lopes, is a big fan.",
      "Lopes announced this week that he will be assisted in his campaign by Nuno Gomes, the former Benfica and Portugal frontman, who is also one of Amorim’s closest friends.",
      "Amorim's stock in his homeland remains sky high. He began his managerial career impressively with Braga before Sporting spent big to hire him. There he would make them Portugal's dominant force and end their 19 year wait for a league title, adding more honours after that.",
      "Lopes has been quizzed about Amorim previously and didn't hide his admiration as told Record: “He’s an excellent coach, under contract with Manchester United. I won’t destabilise Benfica. They have a very important match ahead of them.”",
      "United face a huge decision regarding Amorim, whom they have just backed with more than £200million worth of new talent in the summer. Much of that was bought to aid his system, which he has defiantly stuck to despite it not bringing the results many had hoped.",
      "It is almost a year since Ineos axed Erik ten Hag, just months after backing him with a new contract despite the warning signs being in clear view. They also gave the Dutchman millions to spend in the market and another managerial miss step will see their judgement severely called into question.",

      "Amorim is set to hold showdown talks with club chiefs after United's clash with Burnley on Saturday following their poor start to the new season, with the former Sporting boss having won just seven of his 29 Premier League games in charge.",
      "\"Ultimately, though, there is a different set of managers that you have got to be looking at because of the situation that United are in. I would take Zidane, but is he the right man for the job at Manchester United [as we] speak at the moment and how we see them, probably not.",
      "\"My honest opinion is that you have to look at the jobs that Sean Dyche has done at Burnley, what he did at Everton. He stabilised the club, at least he is going to put structure in there. What Manchester United need right now is structure.",
      "\"That is something they do not have. I know that Manchester United fans would look at me and say 'oh, you said we need Sean Dyche', but no, you need structure.",
      "\"That's a man that will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing at the moment. Last night we didn't see a team. We see players just go out there and do what they want.\"",
      "Austin's comments come after Dyche himself claimed he could do a better job than Amorim earlier this month, stating on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast : \"I may get hammered for it, but I bet I could win more games with that squad playing a 4-4-2.",
      "\"People keep talking about his [Amorim's] philosophy and it isn't working. It's fine getting to five or 10 games, but once you get to 20 games, it clearly isn't working.

      "Amorim's interviews made it impossible not to reflect on previous admissions that a resignation could be up for discussion. The 40-year-old suggested last season he could walk away, even without compensation.",
      "And Ratcliffe, along with chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox, must be left asking their own questions. They pushed for Amorim's signature and Berrada is the figure to have informed Amorim that he must join Old Trafford immediately rather than in the following summer.",
      "There have been few signs of success thus far. And Ratcliffe and Co are likely reflecting on the decisions that led to this position. To appoint Amorim, the advice of a director they courted more than any other was ignored.",
      "United chased Dan Ashworth from Newcastle and were forced to pay significant compensation before parting ways with him — a spell that cost the Red Devils more than £4m. The former club chief recommended Thomas Frank, Marco Silva and Graham Potter last year, who have had contrasting outcomes in their own careers.",
      "But, having so publicly sought Ashworth only to then reject one of his first major suggestions, ignoring the former Newcastle chief could play on the minds of those at the club. Was Amorim worth such a parting of ways and was he worth ignoring the advice from a figure so eagerly chased just months before?",
      "In many respects, United went all-in on Amorim and his system. Players like Alejandro Garnacho are set to depart Old Trafford, while Marcus Rashford has already made a loan to Barcelona with little future remaining at United.",
      "And even Kobbie Mainoo's lack of involvement in recent weeks could see him depart if a suitable bid arrives. A substantial fee could be achieved but facilitating the exits of the club's talented homegrown stars is unlikely to be the identity anyone desired.",
      "And unless things pick up, more decisions will be made on the club's futures. But it won't be squad members in the firing line.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has told Manchester United he wants to leave on loan before the transfer window closes next week as he looks to play regularly having sat on the bench for the team's opening Premier League games - but the two parties are not aligned.",
      "Mainoo made it clear to the club's bosses on Thursday that he has no intention to cut ties permanently, but does want to further his development and believes that sitting on the bench is not serving that ambition.",
      "Ruben Amorim has not used the 20-year-old and appears to have others above him in the midfield pecking order. As a result Mainoo wants to leave for the season, especially with a World Cup coming up this summer. His rapid rise under Erik ten Hag was such that he started the Euro 2024 final.",
      "However a lack of minutes for the Manchester outfit will make it harder for him to impress Thomas Tuchel. Despite the United star laying all this out his club have told him that they have no intention of sanctioning his loan exit.",
      "Instead they made it clear that he is valued and the expectation is that he remains and fights for his place, reports the Athletic. Chelsea are among the clubs to have been linked in the past whilst Bayern Munich too have kept tabs on the situation, but never put in a bid.",
      "Ten Hag, the man who gave Mainoo his debut, was keen to reunite with him at Bayer Leverkusen but a deal was never feasible. The midfielder signed a new deal in February 2023 and his existing United contract runs to 2027, with the option of an extra year, and includes pay rises depending on performances.",
      "It has been reported previously that United would reluctantly consider selling Mainoo should a suitable offer come along. This is largely motivated by the midfielder’s status as a homegrown player, with a potential sale representing pure accounting profit and helping their PSR situation.",
      "After being overlooked Mainoo for the draw at Fulham Amorim was questioned on his used of the midfielder and insisted it was on the youngster to prove his worth. \"The same as any player in that position. I expect a lot from Kobbie Mainoo,\" he said.",
      "\"Again, people think that sometimes you need to just give... I think it is important for Kobbie to fight for his place. I believe a lot in Kobbie; more than what everyone thinks. I believe a lot in Kobbie. I expect a lot from him. He is playing in one position and is fighting with Bruno. They can play together.\"",

      "\"If there is a number more than 100 - I would even say more than 100. I am confident, yes.\"",
      "With their interest in Carlos Baleba cooling as a result of Brighton's demands, Manchester United are weighing up moves for potential alternatives.",

      "Still reeling from their embarrassing midweek EFL Cup exit, a deflated Manchester United side will host newly-promoted Burnley at Old Trafford for their latest Premier League clash on Saturday afternoon. This encounter marks the first meeting between the two teams since April 2024, when the Clarets held the Red Devils to a 1-1 draw in Manchester.",
      "On Wednesday night, Manchester United traveled to Blundell Park as clear favourites, but it was League Two’s Grimsby Town who pulled off a stunning upset, handing Ruben Amorim’s men a humiliating defeat in the EFL Cup’s second round. The Red Devils found themselves two goals down within the first 30 minutes against the Mariners. Summer signing Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire managed to force a penalty shootout, but Mbeumo missed the decisive 26th spot kick in a marathon shootout, allowing Grimsby to progress with a dramatic 12-11 victory.",
      "Burnley, meanwhile, bounced back from a 3-0 opening day defeat at Tottenham Hotspur by giving their fans plenty to celebrate at Turf Moor. The Clarets secured their first Premier League points of the season with a 2-0 win over fellow promoted side Sunderland last weekend, and followed that up with a late 2-1 victory against Derby County in the EFL Cup second round on Tuesday, courtesy of Oliver Sonne’s stoppage-time winner.",
      "Lisandro Martinez remains unavailable for Manchester United as he continues his recovery from a long-term knee injury. Meanwhile, Noussair Mazraoui is nearing a return from a thigh issue, but Saturday’s match is expected to come too soon for the defender. After making eight changes to his lineup in midweek, manager Ruben Amorim is likely to rotate his squad again, which could see Andre Onana—who struggled once more against Grimsby—replaced in goal by Altay Bayindir, who himself has had a shaky start to the season.",
      "In defence, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro, and Luke Shaw are all in contention for a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes is set to partner either Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte in midfield; notably, Fernandes has directly contributed to 10 goals (four goals, six assists) in his last eight Premier League appearances against newly-promoted sides. Up front, new signing Benjamin Sesko, who made his first start for United in midweek after two substitute appearances, is likely to continue as the central striker, supported by fellow newcomers Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in attack.",
      "For Burnley, Zeki Amdouni (ACL), Manuel Benson (Achilles), and Jordan Beyer (knee) remain sidelined, while Connor Roberts (knock) is close to returning but is unlikely to be fit in time for Saturday’s game. Recent signings Armando Broja, Axel Tuanzebe, and Bashir Humphreys, who all made their season debuts in midweek after joining the Clarets this summer, could feature in the squad again this weekend.",
      "Manager Scott Parker is expected to revert to a starting lineup similar to the one that secured victory over Sunderland, with former Manchester United duo Martin Dubravka and Hannibal Mejbri, ex-Manchester City defender Kyle Walker, and last weekend’s goalscorers Josh Cullen and Jaidon Anthony all pushing for a recall.",
      "Man United: Bayindir; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Diallo, Fernandes, Casemiro, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko",

      "Besiktas have announced the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer just hours after failing to qualify for the Conference League. The Turkish giants were beaten 1-0 at home to Swiss side Lausanne-Sport in the second leg of their play-off tie on Thursday.",
      "The result means that Besiktas won't be involved in European competition this season. Solskjaer's side previously failed to make it into the Europa League via the play-offs but did win their opening game of the Turkish Super Lig campaign, beating Eyupspor 2-1.",
      "Bestikas chiefs have wielded the axe eight months after hiring the Manchester United legend as their manager. In a statement, the club said: \"Our contract with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been terminated following a decision made at the board meeting.",
      "\"Following the meeting, our chairman, Serdal Adali, thanked Solskjaer for his services to date. We respectfully submit this for the public's information.",
      "Solskjaer, 52, won more than half of his 29 games in charge, helping Besiktas secure a fourth-place finish last term. Having been sacked by United in November 2021, the Norwegian had been out of coaching for three years prior to his appointment.",
      "Besiktas drew the first leg of their clash with Lausanne-Sport - who are run by Man United's part-owners, INEOS - 1-1 last week. When the teams met for round two in Istanbul, the home side were the favourites to advance.",
      "In the starting line-up for Besiktas was former Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista, Wilfred Ndidi - who recently signed from Leicester - ex-West Ham midfielder Joao Mario and former Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham. The hosts were left stunned when Nathan Butler-Oyedeji, who joined from Arsenal, this summer, put Lausanne-Sport ahead on the brink of half-time.",
      "Besiktas' night went from bad to worse when Felix Uduokhai was shown a straight red card less than one minute into the second half. Solskjaer made a series of substitutions in a bid to swing the momentum but their Swiss opponents saw the game out and will compete in the Conference League this season.",
      "Solskjaer's position was under threat following a loss to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Europa League qualification play-offs. Ex-Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid midfielder Nuri Sahin has been linked with the job.",
      "As for what's next for Solskjaer, he's previously been tipped to take over the Norwegian national team, who he represented 67 times and scored 23 goals for during his illustrious playing career. Current Norway boss Stale Solbakken, who's friends with Solskjaer, has said that he'll step down when his contract expires after the 2026 World Cup campaign.",

      "As part of the deal, the fourth largest sale United's history after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria, the Red Devils have secured a 10 per cent sell-on fee. United dug their heels in and stood firm on their valuation of Garnacho, having rejected Chelsea's initial offer of £25m.",
      "Garnacho was left out of United's starting line-up for their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and publicly criticised Amorim in the immediate aftermath of the loss in Bilbao. That led to the 20-year-old winger being exiled by Amorim and omitted from United's pre-season tour of the US and made to train in isolation with fellow outcasts Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Marcus Rashford, who has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan.",
      "A frustrated Garnacho said after the loss to Spurs: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "His brother, Roberto, fanned the flames by stating on social media: \"Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus.\"",
      "Garnacho wasn't involved in United's opening three games of the season, starting with a 1-0 loss at home to Arsenal. The Red Devils then followed up the defeat with a 1-1 draw away to Fulham on Sunday.",
      "That was before the biggest humiliation of Amorim's tenure. Wednesday saw United dumped out of the Carabao Cup by fourth-tier side Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim's men were 2-0 down until the closing stages, as Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire scored to send the game to penalties. But misses from Mbeumo and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha saw Grimbsy win 12-11 on penalties, booking their place in the second round.",

      "The Portuguese has won eight of his 34 domestic matches in charge of United but the team have had a winless start to the season and do not have a cup tie now until the FA Cup third round in January.",
      "Amorim warned the United players he will continue to be frank in his assessment of the team if they suffer more galling defeats in the future, with newly-promoted Burnley due at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "United sources clarified that Amorim's \"quit\" comment is meant as tongue-in-cheek, rather than an outright threat.",
      "\"Guys, to be really honest with you guys, every time that we have or have in the future one defeat like that, I'm going to be like that,\" Amorim said. \"I'm going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players.",
      "\"I think this is my way of doing things and I'm going to be like that. And I felt that in that moment I was so frustrated and [annoyed]. And I know, again, that you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I'm not going to be like that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to accept that and I'm going to be who I am. That's why I have the passion that I have. In that moment I was really upset and really disappointed because I felt that we had a very good pre-season, we were playing better, we were being consistent in the way we played.",
      "\"We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham. And then that kind of performance, I was really disappointed with everything. But now it's a new game and I'm focused on the next one.",
      "\"If you are in one way, if you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that is good on that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin. So I understand that.",
      "\"And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years, sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don't want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It's going to be hard. But now I'm good with the next one.\"",
      "Amorim admitted after United lost the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur in May that he would walk away without compensation if he no longer had the backing of the hierarchy.",
      "When asked if he still had that feeling now, Amorim replied: \"I felt that after the game (at Grimsby). I don't feel that now. So it's a little bit like that. I think that is the hardest part of the defeat. Sometimes it's not the result, it's the way we lost that game or draw that game. That is the thing that is hard to accept. Because we can do better.",

      "Amorim believes the midfielder still has to develop aspects of his game to regain his place in the starting XI. Mainoo sustained a muscular injury in February that effectively cost him his first-team role but he has started only 15 times under Amorim.",
      "Mainoo has played in midfield, as one of the two No.10s and even up front in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system but more experienced options and new signings now occupy those roles.",

      "Mainoo was one of a handful of United players regarded as untouchable last summer but his failure to agree a new contract has created uncertainty around his future.",
      "United negotiated a new deal with Mainoo in February 2023 when he was still only 17 and had played twice for the club. Mainoo has now appeared 73 times for United and Mainoo scored the winner in the 2024 FA Cup final against Manchester City before he started for England in the European Championship final later that year.",
      "The discrepancy in Mainoo's status and salary has led to an impasse in contract talks. Mainoo rejected United's opening offer at the start of the year and Amorim confirmed last week there was \"no news\" on the matter.",

      "Amorim believes the midfielder still has to develop aspects of his game to regain his place in the starting XI. Mainoo sustained a muscular injury in February that effectively cost him his first-team role but he has started only 15 times under Amorim.",
      "Mainoo has played in midfield, as one of the two No.10s and even up front in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system but more experienced options and new signings now occupy those roles.",

    "body": [
      "A parting shot via email from Marcus Rashford's cousin, Lois, last month read, verbatim: \"get 4th round carabao, out to norwich in the p****n rain looooooooooll.\" Manchester United did not even get that far.",
      "There was biblical rain in Grimsby, another storm that has gathered overhead for Ruben Amorim. Amorim conducted his post-match press conference in a huddle on the pitch. He appeared to be agitating to get on it all night.",
      "When Amorim was about to start his first chat with Natalie Gedra, the Grimsby fans broke into another rendition of \"Sacked in the morning\". They had the courtesy to stop when Amorim started speaking.",
      "Amorim's equanimity was striking. He had gone through the ringer and was cowering in the dugout during the penalty shootout. They say a manager loosens up when he has entered the end game.",
      "Amorim is not there yet. He retains the backing of the United hierarchy, though that is always worthless. Omar Berrada assured us on September 1 last year that Erik ten Hag had \"full backing\". Ten Hag was sacked in October.",
      "There was no rendition of the Amorim chant from the 1,200 United supporters at Blundell Park. They were strikingly subdued at 0-0. One season-ticket holder of more than 30 years messaged: \"I feel like the countdown has begun.\" That was after the draw at Fulham.",
      "Amorim's body language has never been as defeatist as it was at fourth-tier Grimsby. His head dropped repeatedly, he had to stop himself from stepping onto the pitch and several players were berated. Amorim was on his haunches so frequently he might as well have been on his knees.",
      "After Bryan Mbeumo pinged the crossbar, the United players could not get off the pitch quickly enough. Harry Maguire pointed towards the tunnel and security personnel urgently ordered them in that direction.",
      "The mass pitch invasion spared them. Friends in the away end confirmed mutiny was simmering, with Andre Onana and Diogo Dalot the two whipping boys. Onana could not have been further away from them when the contest ended and it is just as well. He was booed.",
      "After the 90 minutes, Onana rushed down the tunnel, followed by the goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital. The referee tossed the coin for the shootout with Onana still indoors.",
      "Altay Bayindir looked anxiously down the tunnel. Reading between the lines, Onana and Vital must have headed out of sight to do some last-minute analysis on Grimsby's penalty takers.",
      "The logical assumption is they were unprepared. Watching the shootout, it looked that way. Onana made one genuinely superb save yet gloved five other kicks that beat him. He dived the wrong way at least as many times. Where was the water bottle with guidance on which way Grimsby's players place their penalties?",
      "Bruno Fernandes had urged Onana to remain calm when he re-emerged yet he snapped after the first few kicks and vented at Bayindir. Fernandes was unhappy that Onana was not handing the ball to United's next taker to ensure their routine was uninterrupted.",
      "Fans may now wonder whether Bayindir, in goal for United's only shootout win since the start of last season, ought to have replaced Onana, a la Tim Krul. That would have crushed the Cameroonian's already fragile confidence into dust.",
      "Amorim cannot legislate for Onana being beaten at his near post and misreading a cross but he has to shoulder some responsibility. He has mismanaged the goalkeeper situation, starting Bayindir when Onana was available not once but twice, all while United are in discussions to sign Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp and bristling at a question about Tom Heaton.",
      "He has also erred at the other end, where Benjamin Sesko has had a worse start to his United career than Rasmus Hojlund. United confirmed cramp meant Sesko was down as the tenth outfield penalty taker but it was still an odd look for a £73.66million striker.",
      "We would have doubtless seen a more bullish Sesko had he started against Arsenal on the opening weekend. He had been training with his new teammates for a week. By delaying a start, Sesko's confidence has subsided and his fitness is not as robust.",
      "Sesko was always going to be compared with other strikers involved in big-money transfers. Hugo Ekitike has three in three and Viktor Gyokeres two in two. Already it is three games and no goals for Sesko.",
      "United have unravelled through the manager mismanaging the two most important positions in the team and the absence of a single sale. That is about to change with Alejandro Garnacho, flogged on the cheap to Chelsea for £40m.",
      "In the United players' family section for the Europa League semi-final first leg at Athletic Bilbao, the only players whose agents were visible were Garnacho's and Kobbie Mainoo's. On the same day that United agreed to sell one, the other requested to leave.",
      "The continued presence of bomb squad members is undoubtedly affecting what else United can do to strengthen. Casemiro is bed-blocking a midfield reinforcement (and Mainoo), yet his probable stay was practically celebrated by tone-deaf members of club media last week.",
      "United could have easily shifted Bayindir, a £4.3m signing two years ago, early in the summer to make room for a new goalkeeper. Instead, they regarded a new goalkeeper as a non-priority and United's two main 'keepers have become worse.",
      "Amorim's bold calls with individuals used to be for the betterment of the club but it has been to United's detriment over the last month. Removing Hojlund from the squad, playing without a striker and then delaying Sesko's first start were costly. His choices in goal have caused indecision and directly led to three goals.",
      "We have seen it enough times from a press box to have an inkling when a manager has passed the point of no return. That already appears to be the case with Amorim. He is a good guy and a good coach but his record is indefensible",
      "For a manager to be considered a success at United, they have to win the title. When Amorim was hired, you could imagine him ending United's championship drought. Now? He's drowning in a downpour.",

      "United lost 5-0 and 7-0 home and away to Liverpool in the past four years, while there have been seven 4-0 humblings since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, but the players acknowledge elimination by League Two Grimsby was a new nadir.",
      "A number of players are also uneasy about the goalkeeping situation. Altay Bayindir committed a costly error in United's opening Premier League defeat to Arsenal and Andre Onana was culpable for both of Grimsby's goals.",
      "Onana made his first appearance since the Europa League final at Blundell Park, where he was beaten at his near post by Charles Vernam and failed to claim a corner that was bundled in by Tyrell Warren. The 29-year-old made one save in the penalty shootout but got his glove onto five other spotkicks that still beat him.",
      "Bayindir conceded to Arsenal left back Riccardo Calafiori from a corner and the Turkey international was targeted from set pieces in the 1-1 draw with Fulham a week later. Third-choice goalie, Tom Heaton, has not played since February 2023 but is fully fit.",
      "Onana could be back on the bench for the Premier League visit of Burnley as he has effectively lost his No.1 status and there remains uncertainty over his future.",
      "United have held discussions about the possible signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens but Onana is determined to stay at the club.",
      "A befuddled Ruben Amorim was reluctant to speak at length about Onana's 'keeping. \"It's not about Andre. We are here with all due respect. I already said that the best team won. But this is a fourth division team. Andre should play just with his feet during this game? It's not that that happened.",

United sources believe they have secured a good, pragmatic deal for a player who had agitated to leave but Garnacho was valued at more than €100m by the CIES Football Observatory last year.

      "Mainoo broke through as one of Europe's brightest talents under Erik ten Hag in 2023/24. The midfielder scored in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City before earning a call-up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024 where he started in the final against Spain.",
      "But the 20-year-old has struggled for game time since Ruben Amorim replaced Ten Hag at Old Trafford in November last year. The Reds academy graduate has yet to start for Amorim's men in the Premier League this season and struggled like most of his teammates in Wednesday's shock League Cup defeat at Grimsby Town.",

      "Real Madrid and fierce rival Atletico Madrid are said to be among the European heavyweights keeping an eye on Mainoo amid ongoing uncertainty around his future at Old Trafford.

Whether they can get in what they want in this window or whether they're going to have to wait, we'll have to wait and see but I think it's going to be really tough. You look at what the top four or five have spent and then there's the chasing pack, maybe Man United might and I say might, be one of them but even still, they will find it tough to get anywhere near the top five this season. They're a million miles away from where they were or where they want to be.\"",

      "Drawing their first away game 1-1 after taking the lead was followed by League Cup second round exits in embarrassing fashion to lower league opposition. Then, next up, Burnley.",
      "Van Gaal's United drew 0-0 at Turf Moor heading into the September international break 11 years ago. It remains unclear whether Amorim would be able to remain in charge after a fourth winless match to start this campaign.",
      "That season, however, shows that such a situation can still be salvagable. United did not hit their stride until after the November international break, winning just four of their first 11 in the Premier League.",
      "From then on, though, they won five straight matches, starting away against Arsenal. United lost only twice more until a run of three defeats beginning in mid-April.",
      "Amorim should be afforded similar grace despite much of last season already counting against him. The next five games, taking United through to the next international break, should provide a better gauge of whether to persist with the Portuguese",
      "United cannot keep sacking managers and expect things to change. And Amorim cannot last much longer unless things change. Both these things are true as the club lurches towards a familiar crossroads.",
      "Amorim's post-match interviews at Grimsby were telling: his English is impressive, but had they been conducted in his native Portuguese, you'd expect the coach would have edged even closer to the point of no return.",
      "I think Amorim deserves more time to work with his new signings, but if he does really believe he has lost the dressing room, then you have to ask whether he can lead a turnaround - or whether he even wants to, for that matter.",
      "His loyalty to his system is one part admirable, one part naive: if your players are found out by League Two teams within 20 minutes, that says it all.",
      "As a United fan, I want Amorim to succeed, but the coach and the players must show passion, bravery and some joy against Burnley: if it's more of the same, I think Ratcliffe will have to act.",
      "The saving grace for United is that while Amorim is wedded to his system, the new signings - Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha - are all capable of quickly adapting to a new style. And Ruud van Nistelrooy may have tanked at Leicester, but United could do worse than bringing him back for another interim spell.",
      "Another huge managerial decision awaits at Manchester United, but this should really be the most straightforward one for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the club's hierarchy.",
      "Amorim's words and tactics should be a real concern, alongside his reluctance to adapt with that further evidenced by still using a back five when his side were 2-0 down to Grimsby. Mikel Arteta is often the reference point for allowing struggling managers to be given time.",
      "However, it must be remembered that Arsenal squad from a number of years ago was very made while there are several good players at United, but they are certainly not a team. A significant amount of money has been spent to sign three attackers and given the quality now in the team, United will be better off going elsewhere.",
      "It feels like United are stuck in somewhat of a vicious circle at the minute, and I don't know if continually chopping an changing managers is the way to get out of it.",
      "Amorim was quickly identified as the number one target when Erik ten Hag was sacked last season, and they moved quickly for him. Last season he could use the excuse of not having his own squad, but that won't really stand this time around given how much he has been backed in the transfer window.",
      "Spending so much money only to sack a manager again feels like too much of a repeat of last year, so I think United will be best to stick with Amorim for now. It does feel like the head coach needs to adapt himself a bit more, but if he can do that and help bed in the new arrivals then he could turn things around at Old Trafford.",
      "It still feels like Amorim has the backing of the majority of fans, so, for now I think it's best to stick rather than twist.",

      "Manchester United bosses will be praying Ruben Amorim can reverse his fortunes as major worries have emerged about the club's mentality.",
      "The Portuguese head coach finds himself under enormous scrutiny following the Red Devils' Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two outfit Grimsby on Wednesday evening. The former Sporting Lisbon manager seemed to question whether he's suited for the role following United's most recent embarrassment after being knocked out by the Mariners on penalties.",
      "However, the prospect of ditching Amorim less than 10 months into his reign creates a significant headache for the club's leadership after supporting him with over £200million worth of summer signings. Ex-United and Wrexham goalkeeper Ben Foster believes they'll simply have to cross their fingers and hope he comes good.",
      "In the long-run, he said they should shift their approach if they choose to part ways with Amorim by recruiting a manager capable of addressing the team's fragile mindset. The 42-year-old thinks they could do far worse than installing former England boss Gareth Southgate as his successor to accomplish that objective.",
      "During an appearance on talkSPORT, Foster said: \"I don't know what the answer is, because if you look at the history of recent managers for Man United, you've had some proper big boys in there. You've had Jose Mourinho, Van Gaal and Solskjaer, when he was doing fantastic for a little while.",
      "\"I don't know whether they need to adopt a completely fresh approach. The pressure that's involved in playing for that club is like nowhere else and maybe they've got to go a different way. Even if it's somebody like Gareth Southgate, just give it a go.",
      "\"It's somebody that's going to maybe change the mentality of the players and take a more pragmatic approach, because I think what they're doing just isn't working at the moment.\"",
      "Discussing the position co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy find themselves in, Foster continued: \"They've put all their eggs in this basket with Ruben Amorim and they're just going to have to try and ride it out. The top brass at that club are hoping and praying to God that it turns around.\"",
      "Southgate finds himself among the bookmakers' leading contenders to take over from Amorim if he is dismissed from his position. The 54-year-old has been without a job since stepping down from his England duties following their defeat to Spain in the Euro 2024 final.",
      "Meanwhile, Foster has slammed Amorim's dejected body language during United's cup elimination at the hands of Grimsby. The head coach seemed unable to bear watching the penalty shootout on occasions and later hit out at his players following the tie.",
      "Foster, who had a five-year stint at Old Trafford from 2005 to 2010, said: \"It's tough going at the minute. I thought in the summer that they've got this big, new energy, with some fantastic signings, and it's all going to be different.",
      "\"The first few weeks of the season, it seems to be pretty much the same old really. The other night against Grimsby was just the epitome of it as well. The worry of it was seeing the manager in the dugout.",
      "\"It's really not a good look if you're on the pitch about to take your penalties, and you look back in the dugout, and the manager is sitting there and he's burying his head in his hands. It doesn't scream that we're all in this together.\"",

      "Fenerbahce have sacked Jose Mourinho following their Champions League play-off defeat to Benfica.",
      "Former Manchester United manager Mourinho was appointed as Fenerbahce's new head coach on a two-year deal in June 2024 as the club looked to win the Super Lig title for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "However, Mourinho was unable to guide Fenerbahce to the title, as they finished second for the FOURTH season in succession. The Turkish outfit won 26 and drew six of their 36 league matches, ending up on a mammoth 90 points, but that wasn't enough to get them over the line, as Galatasaray came out on top once again.",
      "Following another second place finish, Fenerbache qualified for the Champions League third qualifying round. They got past Eredivisie side Feyenoord with a 6-4 aggregate win before going up against Primeira Liga giants Benfica in the play-off for a place in the league phase of Europe's elite club competition.",
      "Unfortunately for Mourinho, he was unable to spearhead Fenerbahce into the Champions League, as they lost 1-0 on aggregate in a tight play-off clash with Benfica on Wednesday.",
      "In the aftermath to Fenerbahce's defeat, the club have made the decision to axe Mourinho from his position. During his time in Istanbul, Mourinho won 37 and drew 14 of his 62 games in charge, recording a 59.7 per cent win rate.",
      "A club statement read: \"Our Professional Football First Team's technical director, Jose Mourinho, who has been carrying out his duties starting from the 2024-2025 season, has parted ways with us. We thank him for his efforts for our team until today and wish him success in his future career.\"",
      "Mourinho is the second former United manager to have been axed in the past 12 hours after Besiktas made the decision to fire Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following their Conference League defeat to Lausanne-Sport.",
      "In a statement on the club's website on Thursday, Besiktas said: \"Our contract with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been terminated following a decision made at the board meeting.",
      "\"Following the meeting, our chairman, Serdal Adali, thanked Solskjaer for his services to date. We respectfully present this for the public's information.\"",
      "Both Mourinho and Solskjaer enjoyed success at United.",
      "First, Mourinho spent two-and-a-half years in Manchester, winning the Carabao Cup and Europa League and helping the Reds to a second-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "After he was sacked in December 2018, Solskjaer replaced him on an interim basis before getting the job permanently. He lasted almost three years in the position before he was axed in November 2021.",
      "Since, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim have been in situe at Old Trafford but none have got close to returning United to the top of English football. In fact, the Reds are falling further behind and suffered a humiliating defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round on Wednesday.",

      "United crashed out of the Carabao Cup on penalties against Grimsby at Blundell Park on Wednesday night.",
      "The team arrived back at Carrington just after 1am, but Amorim was back to work just hours later.",
      "Amorim arrived at the training complex shortly after 7am on Thursday morning. The full squad reported for training for 11am and will now have two days to prepare to face Burnley in the Premier League.",
      "United's players were pictured with glum faces as they drove into Carrington this morning.",

      "Luke Shaw and Leny Yoro were rested for the trip to Grimsby and are set to return on Saturday.",
      "When asked what went wrong after Grimsby, Amorim said: \"Everything. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened, it's a problem in our club, we should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans.",
      "\"I felt my players spoke really loud today what they want. I think it's easy for you [how to interpret it]. Let's focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through.",
      "\"Doesn't matter [that we lost on penalties]. In the penalties, the feeling is the same. I think football was really fair today. The best team won.",
      "\"I'm the manager. It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I'm really sorry for our fans. Let's focus on the next game. That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today.",
      "\"I would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I'm really sorry for our fans. It's too much sometimes.",
      "\"You cannot change so much. You cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance. I think this is a little bit the limit.",
      "\"I think something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.\"",
      "The international break will begin following United's game against Burnley at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United are running out of time to finish shaping their squad for the 2025/26 season.",
      "The summer transfer window will officially close for business at 7pm on Monday evening, meaning the clock is ticking for United in their quest to bring new faces in and offload those who do not feature in head coach Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "With just a few days of the window remaining, United have enjoyed a relatively successful summer thus far, bringing in four new faces, three of whom have been drafted in in the hope of transforming their attack. Matheus Cunha has arrived from Wolves, Bryan Mbeumo has checked in from Brentford and Benjamin Sesko has been signed from RB Leipzig.",
      "However, there is no doubt other areas of the team still need strengthening before the bell. Analysing both possible incomings and potential outgoings, MEN Sport has had a close look at what United's main aims should be between now and the deadline.",
      "Determined to sign a goalkeeper ahead of the window closing, Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens is looking increasingly likely that he could be the latest addition to the club's goalkeeping department.",
      "Linked with a move to Old Trafford earlier this year, the Belgian, 23, was left out of the Antwerp squad for their 2-1 win over K.V. Mechelen at the weekend as the Belgian club did not want to run the risk of him encountering an injury and scuppering the prospect of them being able to generate a cash sale for him.",
      "United boss Amorim has wanted to add a goalkeeper throughout the summer to increase the level of competition between the posts. Altay Bayindir has started the Reds' opening two Premier League games despite supporters' reservations about him.",
      "Andre Onana did little to boost his chances of reclaiming the starting gloves against Grimsby Town in midweek, meaning Lammens could find himself immediately installed as the club's No.1.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's future at United is shaping up to be the biggest talking point heading into the closing stages of the transfer window. No progress has been made on contract talks between him and the club, meaning an exit ahead of the deadline cannot be dismissed.",
      "He has not featured for United in the Premier League so far this season, failing to make it off the bench against Arsenal and Fulham, meaning it would be understandable if the midfielder was to push for an exit.",
      "However, having demonstrated just how talented a player he is, it would be a real shame for United if they were to lose him. Amorim should be finding a way to include a player of his talent in his plans.",
      "Almost every United supporter would be gutted if he were to leave after making such a sharp rise to the first-team in the last two years.",
      "Hojlund was left out of the matchday squad against Arsenal, Fulham and most recently Grimsby.",
      "Clearly not part of Amorim's plans, it would make little sense for United to retain him, particularly after such a regressive season last term. He has proven he is not good enough to spearhead United's attack and he is need of game time with the World Cup less than a year away.",
      "United paid over the odds for the Dane two years ago and they have paid the price for that mistake. It will be in everyone's best interests to go their separate ways at this juncture.",
      "Whatever happens in relation to Mainoo's future, United need a midfielder. They lack athleticism in the middle of the pitch, likewise a player that can compliment Bruno Fernandes' qualities.",
      "Following the addition of Cunha, Fernandes is set to play the bulk of his football as a No.8 this season, meaning he needs a regular partner. Amorim has said Mainoo is competing with Fernandes for the same role, suggesting he has no plans to play them alongside each other.",
      "United need a midfielder who can do a little bit of everything, meaning Brighton & Hove Albion ace Carlos Baleba, who has been of interest to United recently, would be a suitable choice. However, it is hard to imagine them being able to sign him before the end of this window.",
      "Nevertheless, they need to find a suitable midfielder from somewhere.",
      "After Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona last month, United supporters hoped further departures from bomb squad group would follow. However, at the time of writing, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony all remain United players.",
      "Fortunately, it is looking increasingly likely Antony will depart, re-joining Real Betis. It also feels inevitable that Garnacho will move to Chelsea.",
      "However, there is currently a lot less certainty about United's chances of shifting Malacia and Sancho. Deals to take those two away from Old Trafford might go right down to the wire.",

      "Manchester United have been down this road before.",
      "After amassing one point from their opening two Premier League games, Ruben Amorim and his players must have travelled to Blundell Park to face Grimsby Town on Wednesday night confident of securing their first win of the new season against League Two opposition.",
      "But just as Louis van Gaal did back in 2014, Amorim fell foul to a League Cup giant-killing. The scoreline on the Lincolnshire coast was not quite as harrowing as the 4-0 drubbing United experienced in their last second round appearance in the competition at the hands of MK Dons 11 years ago, but the inquest will require greater scrutiny.",
      "Despite making eight changes to his starting line-up from the weekend's 1-1 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage, Amorim still named an XI littered with international caps and talent.",
      "United's front-three cost £147.9million before taking add-ons into account. By comparison, Grimsby's average weekly wage is reportedly just £1,809.",
      "There can be no excuses for Amorim or his players after Wednesday night's horror show. The Reds were incredibly fortunate to take the tie to a penalty shootout after finding themselves 2-0 down at half-time, and Amorim admitted afterwards it would have been \"so unfair\" on Grimsby had his team scraped through.",
      "For the first 75 minutes, United's performance was worse than the one that was served up by Van Gaal's Reds at Stadium MK 11 years ago. Facing League One opposition that night, the Dutchman named a mixture of youth and experience in his starting XI.",
      "The one Amorim named at Blundell Park, with the exception of Tyler Fredricson at right-sided centre-back, was made up of first-team regulars.",
      "United had a Champions League finalist between the posts, European Championship finalists in defence and midfield, and a striker at the top end of the pitch who could end up costing them north of £70m.",
      "There was simply no excuse for the limp performance United served up. They were appalling.",
      "After being appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor last November, no right-minded United supporter thought Amorim was going to be able to wave a magic wand and instantly turn things around. He inherited a messy situation and he was going to require time.",
      "Less than a year into his tenure, it is fair to suggest he still needs time, but how much time can he be afforded? His trademark 3-4-2-1 system isn't working and United, either side of the summer break, have now won just four of their last 17 matches.",
      "As much as it is seemingly trendy nowadays for some managers to prioritise style over results, football is all about winning. Right now, United are not winning anywhere near enough football matches.",
      "Just like in 2014, United have failed to win their opening two league games, earning one point, and have crashed out of the League Cup at the second round stage to a side two or more divisions beneath them in the pyramid. Funnily enough, this weekend's opponent, Burnley, were next on the agenda after that infamous MK Dons defeat.",
      "United travelled to Turf Moor to bring August to a close 11 years ago and drew 0-0. Failure to win at Old Trafford this weekend will only add to the pressure on Amorim's shoulders.",
      "The transfer window will slam shut a little over 48 hours after Saturday's clash with the Clarets ends and United will be planning to make more additions before the 7pm cut-off.",
      "Andre Onana's calamitous performance only reinforced United's need for a new goalkeeper. Their need for a midfielder is also well-documented.",
      "However, as vital as it is to address those two weaknesses, United need to make serious improvements under Amorim. Supporters are becoming increasingly restless and Amorim's refusal to alter his ways is not helping matters.",
      "Van Gaal led United to a top-four finish in 2014/15, but the competition was weaker then than it is now. Right now, United don't even look as though they are capable of mounting a top half finish for the second season running.",

      "Andre Onana's performance against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night only strengthened the argument for United to bring in a new goalkeeper, while their need for a midfielder has been well-documented throughout the summer.",
      "With the start of the new campaign marking a difficult period for the Reds, MEN Sport conducted an online survey asking supporters for their opinions on the start to the season, Amorim's future and the current situation on the transfer front.",
      "Of the 6,000 participants, 94 per cent of voters said they believe United are still short of bodies ahead of the window closing. Although attacking signings took priority at the start of this summer, the Reds still want to add to the goalkeeping and midfield departments.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is a live target for the Reds and could be added to the squad ahead of the bell sounding, but there is currently less certainty about who could be drafted in to strengthen Amorim's midfield options.",
      "Additionally, supporters were asked to select what they believe is the priority position United must strengthen ahead of the deadline and 50 per cent of voters said the addition of a goalkeeper has to be the main focus, while 44 per cent said the addition of a midfielder must take priority.",
      "United are expected to oversee more outgoings before the window closes, with both Alejandro Garnacho and Antony expected to depart, meaning their anticipated departures could bring in funds that are reinvested.",

      "MEN Sport says: The optics of missing out on Lammens to Galatasaray, especially after the starts Bayindir and Onana have made this season, would be awful. However, after what happened at Blundell Park, they will not play in another competition until the FA Cup third round on the second weekend of January, by when Onana, if still at the club, will presumably be away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",

      "MEN Sport says: Hopes of signing Baleba this summer went away long ago, and Hurzeler has now only rubber-stamped Brighton's refusal to sell the midfielder. If United end up signing a central midfielder over the coming days, it will almost certainly be anyone except the Cameroon international, as Hurzeler has emphasised.",

      "Following Wednesday night's shock Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town, pressure is naturally increasing on Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Yes, it's only August. Yes, the season is only three games old. Yes, United still have work to do in the transfer market. However, all of the positivity generated throughout pre-season is already a distant memory.",
      "With the first international break of the season almost upon us, there is already pressure on Amorim and United to deliver a result against Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The Clarets are among the favourites for relegation from the Premier League this season and anything less than three points for United will be frowned upon, resulting in the pressure on Amorim's shoulders increasing further.",
      "United, of course, have been through their fair share of managers and coaches since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, meaning many believe the club should stand by Amorim in the hope of him turning the club's fortunes around. Almost every United supporter acknowledged he needed a full pre-season and full summer transfer window before making a firm judgement on him.",
      "However, following the manner of Wednesday night's defeat on the Lincolnshire coast, questions are being asked of the Portuguese chief just three games into the season.",
      "It feels unlikely that United will pull the plug on Amorim just yet, particularly if co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments on the former Sporting Lisbon boss are anything to go by.",
      "Ratcliffe told the BBC back in March: \"I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do.",
      "\"I think he is an excellent manager and I think he'll be there for a long time.\"",
      "United, following several comings and goings in recent years, desperately need a sense of continuity. Amorim ranked as one of Europe's most promising coaches last year and was United's top target to replace Erik ten Hag last November, meaning he carries the belief of the club's hierarchy in him.",
      "\"I think if you look at the squad he has got at his disposal, with the injury list he has got at his disposal, and he comes in mid-season where he has had no time to train the players in his style of play, I think he has done really well,\" Ratcliffe continued, speaking in the same interview he conducted earlier this year.",
      "\"I think you are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce. I think you saw a glimpse of that against Arsenal yesterday.\"",
      "To Amorim's credit, United have offered glimpses of what they can do under him. However, they have now won just four of their last 17 games either side of the summer break - and that record is becoming increasingly difficult for Amorim to defend.",

Let’s see if being bombed from the matchday squad changes his tune…",

      "15) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend.",
      "Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Maximilian Beier – Borussia Dortmund to Brentford\nBeier would indeed be a Wissa replacement though and Bild are claiming Brentford are ready to pay €70m [£60m], because it’s now apparently a requirement for Premier League teams to pay at least double what Bundesliga strikers are worth.",

      "13) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay.

Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement.

Strand Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar amid conflicting reports on whether he would serve as a replacement for the Swede or Callum Wilson. Newcastle insist on the latter, which suggests this could still happen with Nick Woltemade said to very much be the new Isak.",

Will some hijacking history hilariously repeat itself after the Ebere Eze debacle? That would be quite something and is looking likely with personal terms reached, though the Gunners have been ‘sent a firm message’ as Leverkusen are not open to a loan with buy obligation.",

      "9) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him, which they appear set to do with a £140m bid ‘ready’.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has moved to clarify Kobbie Mainoo’s transfer stance amid conflicting reports over his Manchester United future.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder has been the subject of strong speculation this week, with suggestions in The Mirror that he has told Man Utd he wants to quit permanently for a £50m move to Napoli.",
      "The report claimed Antonio Conte’s Italian champions have a long-term contract ready for Mainoo, who views the Serie A club as the best place to develop.",
      "According to The Mirror, United’s reluctance to sell stems from their regret at allowing Scott McTominay to leave last summer.",
      "He joined Napoli for £25m and went on to become a key part of Conte’s title-winning team, even making the Ballon d’Or shortlist after an outstanding first season in Italy. Mainoo, it was claimed, wants to follow that path.",
      "United have so far stood firm. The England international was an unused substitute for the first two Premier League games under Ruben Amorim and only started in the midweek EFL Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "With competition for places intense, Mainoo’s frustration has grown, but the club insist he must fight for a role rather than leave. His current contract runs until 2027, though talks over an extension have stalled.",
      "Gary Neville has made his feelings on the matter clear. Speaking on The Overlap, he said: “Kobbie Mainoo can’t leave. They haven’t got any midfielders! They can’t let him go.",
      "“If they’re letting him go, they have to bring someone in. They can’t let him go!”",
      "Romano has since addressed the situation, moving to counter the permanent exit narrative.",
      "🚨 “Kobbie Mainoo has no intention to leave Man United on permanent deal despite reports, only loan in his view.",
      "Kobbie wants to go and play on regular basis, Man United keep blocking his exit.”",
      "That clarification underlines the real source of tension. While Napoli’s interest is genuine and Mainoo is keen for regular football, his preference is for a temporary move, not a permanent break from Old Trafford.",
      "The sticking point is United’s refusal to sanction a loan, mindful of their lack of depth and their experience with McTominay.",
      "Mainoo remains highly rated at Old Trafford, having broken into the first team under Erik ten Hag and scored in the 2024 FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "But with Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte ahead of him, opportunities look scarce.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists he wants Kobbie Mainoo “to stay” at Old Trafford and “fight for his place” this season.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is demanding a loan move before the transfer deadline with numerous clubs interested, according to reports.",
      "Newcastle United have made contact with Manchester United over a deal to sign Kobbie Mainoo, Football365 understands.",
      "We are trying to move on from Liverpool, Newcastle and Alexander Isak but there’s still plenty of that. Man Utd first though…",
      "Kobbie Mainoo’s agent briefed that his client was interested in Champions League football, and just a few hours later Real Madrid were interested. Shocker.",
      "According to reports, Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on his transfer ‘preference’ as he is ‘deeply frustrated’ at Manchester United."

However, this move bears an uncanny resemblance to Ten Hag, who did the same last year following a devastating 3-0 defeat to Tottenham. And many pinpointed that moment as the start of the Dutchman’s downfall at the time.",
      "Does Mediawatch really need to point out the obvious here? Is the more pertinent ‘eerily similar’ uncanny footstep-following here in fact more likely to be the actual humiliating results part itself, rather than turning up to work quite early the next day?",

      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is demanding a loan move before the transfer deadline with numerous clubs interested, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have had a poor start to the new season with Ruben Amorim’s men taking just one point from their opening two Premier League matches.",
      "Mainoo did not feature in either of those matches with his one appearance so far coming against Grimsby Town in the League Cup as Man Utd lost on penalties to the League Two side.",
      "The England international is seen as one of the best prospects Man Utd have produced in recent years but Amorim has struggled to fit him into his side.",
      "And now transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Mainoo has demanded that Man Utd allow him to leave on loan before the transfer window shuts on Monday.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘BREAKING: Kobbie Mainoo makes clear to Man United that he wants to leave the club on loan this summer. The decision has been made and it’s only for a LOAN move, not for permanent exit. Kobbie wants to play regular football, he doesn’t want to leave #MUFC on permanent deal.’",
      "READ: Mailbox: Southgate for Amorim the answer for ‘entitled’ Man Utd vs the Glazers as ‘only one good player signed’",
      "Romano added on his YouTube channel: “Kobbie Mainoo went to Manchester United offices together with his agent and said directly to Manchester United I want to leave on loan.",
      "“Kobbie Mainoo doesn’t want to leave Manchester United on permanent transfer, Kobbie Mainoo doesn’t want to leave the project, Kobbie Mainoo still loves the club but it’s a World Cup season and he needs to play.",
      "“The answer Mainoo received from Manchester United was very clear: we don’t want you to go on loan or permanent transfer. Many clubs calling, over 15 clubs calling for loan deal of Kobbie Mainoo from Spain, from England, from Italy, Napoli called from Italy so several clubs calling.”",
      "As we exclusively revealed earlier this week, Newcastle are interested in Mainoo, while Real Madrid and a number of other clubs are also believed to be monitoring the situation.",
      "Earlier this week, Rio Ferdinand’s podcast co-host Joel Beya brought up Paul Scholes’ comments comparing Mainoo to Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane.",
      "Beya said on the podcast: “Kobbie Mainoo has been a ghost man throughout this period. We’ve got the likes of Paul Scholes saying, ‘He’s the nearest thing I’ve seen to Zidane in taking the ball, receiving the ball, cruising past people. I’ve read a few comparisons between me and him and this kid. Don’t waste your time. He is 10 times the player I was at 19.’",
      "“If I’m Kobbie Mainoo bro, and you’re not playing me and obviously the fans are still cheering for Amorim to stay, I could be looking for another club at the end of the season?”",
      "To which Ferdinand replied: “I think he’s more of a Seedorf player, that’s what I think. I think his style of football is more Seedorf.”",
      "Ferdinand added: “But Scholes saying he is 10 times the player he was, and I think you’ve got to remember that telling number there at 19. At 19.",
      "“That’s what he’s saying, Scholesy wasn’t developed yet, still had fantastic potential, but Scholes had asthma, he couldn’t finish games properly at a young age and stuff. He wasn’t nowhere near the player he became at 19.",
      "“At 19, this kid is playing in European championships, do you know what I mean? It’s not like he’s a kid who was there and you’re going, ‘Oh, he’s just in the youth team, just got out of the youth team or the under-21s.’",
      "“He was playing for England, starting for England. Scholesy at 19 wasn’t doing that. So that’s where he’s talking about the comparison. But listen, I’m a massive fan of Kobbie.”",
      "On Mainoo’s absence from the Man Utd team this season, Ferdinand continued: “But he has to work out, ‘What do I need to do to get back in his team?’",
      "“And we’ve all had these moments in our careers where you’re like, ‘S*** man, I’m not playing. What do I do?’ Well, the first thing you do is go to the manager and go, ‘What am I not doing that I need to be doing to get in this team?’ Right. He’s going to tell me. Then I go to work on a training pitch.",
      "“Every day I go to work. I play up against whoever, Bruno [Fernandes] etc, and I start dominating them. Just that’s the type of mentality and mindset he has to go with. And then when the chance comes to play, take it with both hands.",
      "“Now his argument right now will be I’m not getting the chance to take it. And that’s a fair argument. But what I would say is do not let the chance come and you’re not ready. So train hard, be focused.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists he wants Kobbie Mainoo “to stay” at Old Trafford and “fight for his place” this season.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has clarified Kobbie Mainoo’s transfer stance amid conflicting reports as a standoff between the Man Utd midfielder and the club brews.",
      "Newcastle United have made contact with Manchester United over a deal to sign Kobbie Mainoo, Football365 understands.",
      "We are trying to move on from Liverpool, Newcastle and Alexander Isak but there’s still plenty of that. Man Utd first though…",
      "Kobbie Mainoo’s agent briefed that his client was interested in Champions League football, and just a few hours later Real Madrid were interested. Shocker.",
      "According to reports, Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on his transfer ‘preference’ as he is ‘deeply frustrated’ at Manchester United."

      "The Ruben Amorim sack, Manchester United disaster chat continues to dominate the Mailbox as the Glazers get their customary kicking and Sir Gareth Southgate is a tempting replacement, at least for a Liverpool fan.",
      "But might the only solution to Red Devil woes and the ‘blind entitlement’ of their fans be relegation from the Premier League?",
      "Send your thoughts on United or anything else to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "I don’t know if it’s still a thing … but many moons ago, I used to hear a bit about ‘sick buildings’ where employess in certain office blocks would experience health issues that seemed to be linked to the time they spent in a particular building, but no specific illness or cause could be identified.",
      "It feels like that’s where Utd are at as a club at this point – talented players come in and begin to suffer, winning managers come in and become rabbits in headlights – all resulting in much misery and mistrust amongst the fan base, mockery from rival fans/media and a slow descent into some kind of groundhog day horror.",
      "So what to do? Well it seems from afar ( Irish Liverpool fan here ) that the situation isn’t totally dissimilar to where England have found themselves in the past. Whether it was Graham Taylor and Swedes/Turnips, whether it was JT being JT under Capello, whether it was Roy wondering why he was having to do a press conference – the whole non-relationships between players from rival clubs, toxic interactions with the media, perceived team underperformance and a frustrated fan base – difficult times.",
      "So at some point, whether by luck or by design, a decent, honest man of integrity was appointed and over time, club animosities were put to one side, a likeable group of players emerged, relationships with the media seemed to improve, players seemed to want to play for their country again and lo and behold, moderate success was achieved.",
      "Of course, the level achieved feel short of what some felt was possible – but you’ll always have that when you don’t ultimately win.",
      "Back to Utd and Sir Jim might have had his one and only correct idea when he, supposedly, wanted Sir Gareth of Southdate appointed.",
      "The isolating of players would have ended, honest post-match appraisals would have replaced the absolute bs cryptic post-match comments from the current occupant, decency and integrity would be the order of the day, calmness would ensue, the weight of the jersey would be lifted, the joy of playing would return and lo and behold, moderate success, maybe even great success, would be possible again.",
      "I say all this while being aware of the reaction emails and comments from the Utd fanbase over many years and realising that there might be too many of the, “Hated, Adored, Never Ignored” contingent who do not really long for stability, calm and slow forward progress in their club.",
      "They remind me of that toxic gf ( or bf ) who seems to mostly want the chaos and the drama. Being thought of as irrelevant is their greatest fear so even the shocking results that guarantee headlines is still preferable than no attention at all.",
      "Those supporters, sorry fans, need to break this abusive co-dependant relationship and strive for something that’s actually healthy and which will work out better in the medium to long term.",
      "So appoint someone who will foster a culture of harmony, honest endeavour and respect for all and see where it takes you.",
      "Appoint Sir Gareth.\nMark. LFC, An Mhí\nps – and honeslty, like the toxic ex-gf, I might actually want you happy again at this point",
      "",
      "Obviously, it appears from every conceivable angle that Amorim is not the guy to resurrect the fortunes at Old Trafford. But despite all the warning signs, how can they possibly sack a manager who hasn’t been at the club a year, has only had one pre-season and one truly productive transfer window? A transfer window where a club that the part-owner wants us to believe is under huge financial pressure just spent £200m buying players to fit into the new manager’s plans.",
      "It would be madness to make a knee-jerk reaction and bin him, especially when the mooted replacements include managerial behemoths like Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Michael Carrick.",
      "Yet, if the comments section here is to be believed, this is what the fans want.",

      "United have only had three successful (ie title winning) managers in their 147 year (including the Newton Heath years) history, which means for the vast majority of their existence, they have been a very ordinary football team. Liverpool have had ten, in comparison.",
      "Manchester United do not deserve their place at the top table, and have no right to success, and despite ignominy after ignominy, most of their fans still don’t get it. Gary Neville tipped them to come fourth this season, for crying out loud. What is that, if it isn’t blind entitlement?",
      "I saw Badwolf – the leader of the Amorim-out brigade – declaring the other day that sacking David Moyes was the right decision, and this just shows that even with hindsight and history, he can’t see the wood for the trees. United’s entire fall from grace was fueled by sacking Moyes, and since then it has been one poor and rushed appointment after another. Moyes was sacked because of the entitlement of the club, because he didn’t oversee a seamless transition (with an ageing, disjointed squad, far too reliant on players in their twilight years) after the most successful manager in English football history. He wasn’t backed in the transfer market (Fellaini in the summer and Mata in January), and was given no period of grace at all.",
      "And why? Because Man Utd think that they should always be winning trophies, and when they are not, they get rid of the latest plan A, even though they don’t have a plan B. And now the fans want it to happen again.",
      "How do you think this is going to work out, fellas?",
      "United have to stand by Amorim, even though he looks certain to fail, because getting someone in – Southgate would be the best and the highlight of his club managerial career was to not get Middlesbrough relegated for two whole seasons – is not going to fix the problem. They might shore things up and get a top ten place. And then what? Keep them on, like they did Solksjaer, and hope for some progress?",
      "United are so far off the pace from every reasonable metric. The squad. The manager. The stadium. The owners. And the fans, who have forgotten that supporting the club is a part of the job description. And these same fans scream entitlement every time they speak. Well, the ones who frequent this website, anyway.",

You’ll work at a massive club which will raise your profile, but simultaneously a club which is on life support in every way but financially (despite what earthworm Jim claims as he cuts sandwiches from low paid staff) which means when you fail (and you will) you get to blame the club instead of yourself.",
      "And because everyone hates the owners of the club, they’ll accept it’s the club and not you.",
      "You’ll work for two years and then sail off into the sunset with a bag of cash so big they’ll still be paying you four years after being fired.",
      "That was an extremely pessimistic view, and yet amorim is trying to speed run even my pessimistic timeline.",
      "It’s still early season but so far the only signing which seems to be a good one is Cunha. Sesko looks as unconvincing as he did in Germany and if you believe in stats then you’ll already know mbuemo was having a one off season last year and punching well above his weight. I think he’s a good player but I can’t see him moving the needle at United really. Time will tell.",
      "It’s tempting and customary to blame Obama for everything and he was at fault for the second goal but the first one is squarely on whoever vacated the entire of United’s right hand defensive side and allowed Grimsby a totally unchallenged free shot – thats exactly the kind of the thing that national news and social media used to flame Trent for doing all the time.  That’s a coaching issue because it’s been happening in every game , it’s just the first time United got punished for it.",
      "I know United fans don’t want to hear it, and it’s not the first time I’ve said it, but a relegation would actually be a good thing for the club. It would force you to sell the overpaid underperforming players who drift around the club. It would take you out of the limelight for at least a year, crucially it would massively lower expectations at every level and bring the temperature down a lot. It would be like a cleansing fire.",
      "The fact this exact same process happens to every manager and the fact that almost every former United players performs way better once they’re out the club tells you the problem IS United. It’s not the players per se. Its not the managers either. It’s not even the owners because…they keep spending money and united are still shit. The Human criticism shield that is earthworm Jim and his ludicrous cuts to all the lowest paid staff didn’t help, nor did dropping a a couple of hundred million.",

      "",
      "Well that’s a new one and the funny thing is that I’m not even upset about the result because this has been coming for a while and shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. The humour on Subreddits and instagram were objectively hilarious and I’m going to avoid the obvious points of Amorim Out, Onana has fewer football IQ points than hands etc",
      "I think what we’re seeing here is the result of Late Capitalism and aggressive private equity tactics and how it affects businesses. Yes other businesses have bought other clubs and they’re doing well but has any other club been lumped with huge debts like United got from the Glazers’ leveraged buyout garbage. I have no idea how it’s been legal but this is classic PE and the Glazers can enjoy their time milking the club for as much as they can until it’s gone. Their priority is financial returns at the end of the year and paying off their debts; they don’t care about reinvesting into the club. They don’t care what happens to United because even if, god forbid, the club does fold into bankruptcy under the weight of their avarice they can use the failure/loss as a tax cut on their other assets.",
      "This is why they only care about short term investment. Buying players isn’t a good long term investment and even then they buy poorly just to be able to sell the idea of progress. A boring but reliable Defensive mid? Nope two strikers who won’t get service. Reinvest into stadium infrastructure and youth facilities? Nope let’s push the idea of a flash new stadium when we’re playing in the Championship. Build a club ethic and use our money more efficiently? Nope let’s cut jobs, employee benefits and mess around with season ticket holders (Sir Jim is a massive neoliberal twat and has no idea what he’s doing)",
      "And that’s the root of the issue – It’s all board room guff. It’s financial smoke and mirrors. We’re seeing in real time the long term effects of short term, capitalist thinking. This is what happens when you don’t plan long term and keep thinking flashy short term solutions will fix the cracks. This is what happens when it’s money over people and greed over soul. This issue is bigger than Amorim and until the Glazers return to their special circle of hell we will continue to see United circle the drain.",

      "But that’s not the only classic refrain they’ve dusted off. Since Sir Alex “Wakey-wakey, meat-and-two-veg decisive masterclass” Ferguson retired, Man Utd’s strategy always seems to be: “Let’s rely on a player the fans don’t exactly adore to drag us out of the mire.” Cue the parade: Fellaini, McTominay, Maguire, pick your scapegoat-of-the-week, the one the fans quietly mutter about while cleaning out their earwax. It’s become as predictable as Arsenal opponents moaning about VAR.",

      "So, dear reader: I just wanted to highlight how surreal this throwback result was, peppered with the usual United tropes post-Fergie.

      "Whether Eddie Howe actually trusts him is another matter. Reports suggest Osula could even leave the club, leaving Newcastle strikerless – albeit with a seventh-choice £73m striker coming soon – and Howe has done little to dispel that notion. Still, his late goal in Monday’s dramatic 3-2 defeat to Liverpool should be enough to earn him a start, or at the very least, more minutes off the bench.",
      "Once he’s on the pitch, Osula has to seize the moment. Few believe he’s the long-term answer to Newcastle’s striker problem, but he can change perceptions. His instinctive finish under Alisson almost salvaged a point against Liverpool, and if the 22-year-old can help inspire Newcastle to their first win of the season, who knows what doors might open?",

      "A little over three months after Ruben Amorim told Alejandro Garnacho to find a new club in front of his teammates, the 21-year-old is on his way to Chelsea for £40m. Any chance you’ve backed the wrong horse, lads?",
      "It’s a transfer which we’re now in danger of seeing as a Manchester United win but should unquestionably be viewed as a huge missed opportunity for the Red Devils and yet another significant blot on the copybook of their under pressure manager. Just imagine how this move would have been viewed when Amorim first arrived in November.",
      "Negotiations with Chelsea have been fruitful for United. They quoted £50m for their academy graduate, Chelsea came in at £25m, and BlueCo have ended up paying a £40m fixed fee, with the deal also including a 10 per cent sell-on clause which could prove very worthwhile for United should Chelsea continue to treat the transfer market like a car boot sale.",
      "Quite staggeringly, as well as the sale marking the largest for a United academy graduate, it’s also the fourth largest in United’s history after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria. It still feels significantly lower than his value.",
      "Chelsea will require no marked improvement – or any at all – on what Garnacho achieved last season, with ten goals and ten assists in all competitions, to make a profit on him next summer should the Stamford Bridge saloon doors continue to swing unencumbered. Anthony Elanga got 18 goal contributions before Newcastle bought him for £52m. Chelsea sold Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £48m after just 15.",
      "And that’s what Garnacho produced under a manager who never fancied him. His 58 appearances for United were a product of long-term absences for Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad Diallo, while Marcus Rashford and Antony leaving on loan in January left Amorim very little option but to play Garnacho. He found a way in the Europa League final though.",
      "That was the final straw for Garnacho, who called out their “sh*t season” after playing just 19 minutes of the defeat to Tottenham having started every knockout game to help United get there. He then ensured bridges were burned entirely by wearing Rashford’s Aston Villa shirt over the summer and insisting he would rather not play football this season at all than work under Amorim again.",

      "It’s easy to suggest United are better off without his petulance, and many fans over the summer will no doubt have seen their manager’s call to rid the club of a ‘bad apple’ as a good one. But we wonder if, amid the backdrop of a new nadir for Amorim in the form of defeat to League Two Grimsby Town to prompt calls for his sacking, whether United fans able to pause and reflect on their manager’s awful reign at Old Trafford are now thinking about the damage he’s done to their football club.",
      "United named Garnacho as one of three ‘untouchable’ players shortly before he arrived, one of the great hopes of the future along with Rasmus Hojlund, who’s now also on his way out of the club, and Kobbie Mainoo, who wants out, with any hope that he won’t leave resting on the Amorim sack preceding the next transfer window. Would Marcus Rashford currently be playing for Barcelona had any other manager replace Erik ten Hag? Doubt it.",
      "Were Manchester United considered better off with the quality we had seen from Garnacho, Hojlund and Mainoo when Amorim first arrived, along with their high ceilings for improvement, or now with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko? It’s at best a toss up and it’s certainly not the £100m+ upgrade the net spend will suggest it is when all is said and done.",
      "Garnacho’s departure will be tinged with sadness and regret for many, given his goal in the FA Cup final win over Manchester City in 2024, his masterful overhead kick at Goodison Park and plenty of other off-your-seat moments besides in what was an all-too brief time at Old Trafford for a player tipped for the very top almost from the very first time he stepped onto the pitch.",
      "And while his infantile actions may also leave some with a sense of relief at him now being Chelsea’s problem, there’s at least as good a chance he will fly as flop at Stamford Bridge, which will leave Manchester United fans wondering whether they backed the right horse in Amorim, who looks set to be taken out back anyway, after he’s turned Garnacho and his fellow Red Devil untouchables into pariahs in the space of eight months.",

Yeah sure, it’s going very badly, well done for noticing boss, but how are you going to fix it?",

But then one of the goalkeepers does something stupid and the team melts.",
      "United have a massive goalkeeper problem and no one in midfield with any legs. If you think Bruno can play in a midfield two then you’re very much mistaken. With a goalkeeper, United probably have 4 points in the league and escape Grimsby with a stinky win. With a midfield as well they quite conceivably have 3 wins from three (though I wouldn’t have bet on it).",

Hiding when your team is taking penalties is absolutely pathetic and gives zero confidence to your team. And if nothing else he should have to endure this when he makes us put up with watching absolute dross on a twice weekly basis. I don’t think he’s getting a midfielder so he needs to get over himself quickly and figure out how to get the best out of what he’s got. Maybe he is? Who knows.",

But the moment you start having -‘s or worst /’s then the final result is way below organisations where most parts are + and x’s.",
      "As an Arsenal fan, our club was on the brink of this same situation a few years ago.The final Wenger years was the spark, and then it was progressively getting worse. Some more of the same and the club would have tipped over the edge and hit freefall. The harder we tried the deeper the hole we kept digging ourselves into. And again this was not the fault of one element, rather a mess compounded by ownership, management, players, tactics, fans and media. How this has turned around is nothing short of a miracle, and while credit should be shared amongst all involved, the catalyst for the change was Mikel Arteta.",
      "Say what you want about his methods, but he found the right mix of passion, strategy and bullshit to harmonize a disjointed club heading in the wrong direction. Tough decisions were made to move on big names. There was also luck.",
      "In Saka, you couldn’t have picked a more likable player to get behind. Louis Dunford and the new anthem, may be cringe to outsiders but further strengthened the bond between the fanbase and the team again. As a fan of course we want to win a trophy/championship again, but it is not the be all and end all. If we are ultimately beaten by better teams along the way, that is the nature of professional sport and life. Which is why the vast majority of fans will not subscribe to Arteta ‘must win’ or he’s a ‘failure’ nonsense.",
      "He is possibly the most influential and transformative Manager for Arsenal since Wenger, even if he never wins another match let alone another trophy. Rival fans can laugh at his cartoons, LEGO hair and lack ‘success’. He may never get a statue outside the Emirates, but he damn sure deserves one.",

      "It’s Nottingham Forest so of course one of the few unbeaten Premier League managers this season could get sacked. But at least he is now behind Graham Potter and Ruben Amorim.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days but really not much more Thomas Frank could have done. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’d get on operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. Remarkably, he appears to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, and it really might just be that West Ham are that bad.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "We’ll know far more pretty soon given Burnley face Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and a lacklustre defeat to a Bournemouth side with plenty of problems of their own.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "",
      "Always felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he?",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Losing late in the Carabao Cup certainly hasn’t helped.",

      "Ruben Amorim has always been a surprisingly blunt manager of Manchester United but his comments after their latest embarrassment may hint at a change of mindset from the former Sporting boss.",
      "United conspired to go 2-0 down to League Two Grimsby Town only to give their fans a small sliver of hope by pushing the game to penalties. Football being the relentless source of punishment that it is made United fans sit through – and the rest of us delight in – 26 penalties that resulted in £65m Bryan Mbeumo missing the decisive kick, all while Amorim sat alone with his head down in the dugout.",
      "The whole night was an examination of how far a man can be bent before he breaks. 300 days on from his appointment, the Amorim in front of the cameras sure looks the same as the one that arrived, but his whole demeanour has changed.",
      "Back in November, Amorim’s first interview came with Gary Neville on Sky, the biggest of free hits for the new United boss. He was smiling, no bags under his eyes, making jokes about Manchester providing the perfect conditions to train in.",
      "The 39-year-old at the time spoke of a dream for the club, the return to Fergie’s United. He said there was a connection with the club, even laughing about how much media he has had to do. Now that media has become a near-daily examination of a sinking ship.",
      "A few months after he was unveiled as United boss, his tone began to shift. Talks of dreams had become admissions that this crop of players may be the worst in the 147-year history of the club.",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n👉 ‘Looking like a right plonker’ – What the pundits had to say about Ruben Amorim and his tactics board\n👉 ‘Anonymous’ and ‘spineless’ Benjamin Sesko destroyed for letting nine United players go first in shootout\n👉 Amorim and Man Utd reach sack-worthy new nadir as Sesko shrinks in shocking Grimsby defeat",
      "“We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United,” he said after a 3-1 defeat against Brighton in January. “I know you want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.",
      "“Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United, imagine what this is for me. We are getting a new coach who is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that. I am not going to change [his 3-4-3 system], no matter what. I know we can succeed but we need to survive this moment. I am not naive. We need to survive now.”",
      "Even then, it was an alarming admission – one that made United fans put their heads in their hands and the rest of the world laugh at the latest episode of the Old Trafford soap opera. The reason as to why it was so shocking is that managers do not tend to point the finger at themselves so often – just look at Amorim’s Portuguese compatriot Jose Mourinho.",
      "The man who was once where Amorim is now was a master of deflecting blame. Referees, star players not performing, even medical staff have all been put in Jose’s spotlight, long before he admitted he had anything to do with the problem. Sir Alex was the same, as are countless other managers.",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, was happy to make himself public enemy no.1.",
      "But even in that admission, Amorim’s pronoun choice was key. “We are the worst team.” “We need to survive now.” “We can succeed”.",
      "That theme was not unique to the Brighton game either. In March, Sir Jim Ratcliffe called some of the players “not good enough and probably overpaid”, clearly pointing the gun at the squad. Amorim decided to step in front of the bullet.",
      "“I think if we are being honest, everybody – me and the players – we are underperforming this season, so we can change that,” Amorim said.",
      "Amorim’s first season in charge ended with the calamity of losing the Europa League final to a Tottenham side that finished 17th, in a battle of managers wedded to their idea (it’s who we are mate).",
      "Ange paid with his job, Amorim may have sensed he was safe, for now.",
      "His words as the white-and-blue confetti fell were notable. Amorim defended himself but said he still believed he was the best man for the job, going as far as saying he would walk away without compensation should the board wish to get rid. A decision that would have cost his bank balance around £11.9m.",
      "“In this moment, I’m not going to be here defending myself,” he said, looking a lot more beleaguered than when he first arrived. “It’s not my style, I cannot do it. It’s really hard for me.",
      "“I have nothing to show to the fans to say, I am going to improve because of this, I will not do that. In this moment, it is faith. Let’s see.",
      "“I’m always open, if the board and the fans feel I am not the right guy I will go in the next day without any conversation of compensation.",
      "“Yes, I am confident I am still the guy, more than the beginning.",
      "“I know the patience of the fans is going to be really short in the next season but I guarantee you I will not quit. I will not go away, I am really confident.",
      "“I’m not worried about that. If they (the club) say ‘Ruben, it is better to change’ I will leave the next day with no compensation.",
      "“I rely so much on my confidence I am not worried about that. The biggest pain is to lose the game and lose this final, not to give something to the fans and my players.",
      "“I am really confident with myself and I will continue to do my job if the board wants me.”",
      "The board did want him, backing him with a summer spend of almost £300m in transfers but even if the opening game against Arsenal provided hope, subsequent matches make it feel like last season all over again.",
      "Losing to Grimsby, a town with a population smaller than Old Trafford’s capacity and one which Amorim would perhaps not even have heard of before the draw was made, may well have been the last straw – not for the United hierarchy but for Amorim himself.",
      "For the first time, Amorim pointed the fingers at the players, saying they “spoke really loud today about what they want.”",
      "“Everything [was wrong]. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened – it’s a problem in our club. We should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans. I felt my players spoke really loud today about what they want.",
      "“In the penalties, the feeling is the same. I think football was really fair today – the best team won.",
      "“That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today. I would like to say very smart things and very important things but I have nothing to say.",
      "“At half-time, I said: ‘We have 45 minutes to try to win the game.’ In the first half, I told them that they were speaking really loud to me – I understand what you are doing, what I am seeing. Let’s try to change that in the last 45 minutes.”",
      "His demeanour was also far removed from his first arrival in Manchester. With Neville, he sat with broad shoulders, smiling and looking Neville in the eyes. In an interview with ITV after the game, Amorim is hunched over, looking down and barely making eye contact. Crucially as well, he spoke of “the limit” as if referring to his own ability to move on from another lacklustre display.",
      "“You cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance.",
      "“I think this is a little bit the limit. I think something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.",
      "“If we don’t show up, something has to change, and you’re not going to change 22 players again. We need to be different and that is the job of the coach and you can see that nothing changed.”",
      "Notably, there was also no mention of walking away without his £11.9m…",
      "It may have been something said in the heat of the moment, but Grimsby away may be looked back upon as the defining moment of Amorim’s tenure, the time when he realised that the faces and players can change but there is something about modern era United that is rotten.",
      "He has a team that either doesn’t understand or doesn’t want to understand his tactics.

      "Who’d be Manchester United manager, eh? Someone eyeing a delicious compensation package, probably…",
      "It’s all gone sour under current head coach Ruben Amorim, who took on the poisoned chalice last November and boasts a worse win percentage in the Premier League than Graham Potter at West Ham.",
      "The Portuguese reached a sack-worthy new nadir as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two opposition.",
      "Amorim is the seventh manager appointed since Sir Alex Ferguson retired as a title winner in 2013. We’ve ranked them all.",
      "",
      "To be fair to Amorim, he wanted to join at the end of 2024/25 and was given a now-or-never ultimatum from CEO Omar Berrada. But after a full pre-season, over £300million in new signings, and nine months of knowing the players and personalities he’s working with, there’s no excuse for losing to and being outplayed by League Two Grimsby bloody Town.",
      "It’s remarkable to see this club make the same mistake over and over. They gave Erik ten Hag a club-record war chest in his first summer, which didn’t look like an awful idea when United went on to finish third in the Premier League and win the Carabao Cup. He was then heavily backed again in 2023 and when it all went to pot, the club was left with a bunch of players unsuited to Amorim’s system.",
      "System is a keyword in Amorim’s tenure. Not having his players was a constant excuse throughout 24/25, even though a manager deemed viable for the Man United job should be expected to get a tune out of an £800m squad full of international footballers. The whole 3-4-2-1 schtick has been Amorim’s downfall from day one. His stubbornness, unwillingness, or simply put, inability to adapt is what will lose the 40-year-old his job.",
      "When the United hierarchy put their pride to one side and realise he’s not the man for the job, it will cost an absolute fortune, just as it did to bring him from Sporting. That’s a key part of their stubbornness in inevitably sticking with Amorim. They don’t want to look stupid and inept, though that ship might’ve sailed a long time ago.",
      "Amorim’s United look absolutely terrible. An actual defeat on matchday one to Arsenal deceived us into thinking they might be quite good this season after a positive pre-season in which Luke Shaw claimed the Red Devils could win the Premier League. Imagine Adam Smith claiming Bournemouth could win the league. He’d be laughed into the Channel, yet Bournemouth finished a whole six places above Amorim’s side last season.",
      "Finishing 15th with 18 defeats and a -10 goal difference is astonishing. And then Amorim bottled the Europa League final and a chance at £100m and Champions League football. Ultimately, that could’ve been the worst possible outcome, because the embarrassment might’ve been enough for Amorim’s head to explode had they qualified for Europe’s premier competition and met teams like Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich in a competitive setting.",
      "That Europa final defeat was supposed to leave United hamstrung this summer, yet they’ve spent over £60m on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and over £70m on a striker scared to take a penalty against a League Two team. That sort of backing of a wildly underperforming head coach, who’s shown no sign that he’ll be a success, is astonishing and outright idiotic.",
      "Look at Liverpool, for instance. With Jurgen Klopp, it was clear there was something there and they waited to spend big money on the playing squad — and look at what happened when they did. Then Arne Slot came in, got backed with a £12m back-up winger, won the title at a canter, and has now been backed with a lucrative transfer window. That’s because it’s clear that he’s a good manager. A title-winning manager. Amorim won bugger all and led Manchester United Football Club to fifteenth.",
      "The football is dire, the results are even worse, but yes, everything will be fine after Amorim spends another £100m on a goalkeeper and midfielder.",
      "",
      "On one hand, you can say Moyes was always destined to fail given the monumental challenge of replacing Ferguson, but he still inherited a Premier League-winning squad and turned them into a group incapable of challenging for Champions League qualification.",
      "The United board put a lot of faith in Ferguson’s recommendation, handing Moyes a whopping six-year contract. He lasted a grand total of 10 months after winning 26 of 51 matches across all competitions, with the reigning champions sat seventh in the Premier League.",
      "Moyes did, at least, beat Wigan Athletic in the Community Shield, but that wasn’t enough to stop him being the club’s first managerial sacking since November 1986.",
      "MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n👉 Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Hojlund, Sancho, Antony awful, but Mourinho buy bottom\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘waiting to be sacked’ as Man Utd ‘more Spursy than Spurs’\n👉 ‘Looking like a right plonker’ – What the pundits had to say about Ruben Amorim and his tactics board",
      "",
      "Man Utd brought in gegenpressing extraordinaire Rangnick to help steady the ship following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021/22. His appointment was made with the view of his stepping into a role behind the scenes, where he appeared to be better suited. Ten Hag had other ideas, though, and did not give the thought of working with Rangnick the time of day when he arrived from Ajax in May 2022.",
      "Rangnick’s time at Old Trafford epitomised the colossal mess at the club. He only took the manager job to become a consultant months later, which he probably would have been excellent at, only for him to leave before getting the chance, swiftly becoming Austria manager after entering free agency.",
      "The German spoke well — almost too well at times — saying the sort of thing the Manchester United hierarchy did not want to hear. His “open-heart surgery” claim had a brutal truth to it and did not go down well.",
      "On the pitch, results did not improve following Rangnick’s arrival and United ended up finishing sixth in the league, 13 points off fourth.",
      "",
      "From his rants in press conferences to throwing himself on the ground in remonstration to the fourth official after an alleged Alexis Sanchez dive, Van Gaal brought light to Our League, and for that, we will forever be grateful.",
      "While the experienced Dutch manager entertained the masses with his antics, his football — which does have an element of importance — left a lot to be desired. He was very pragmatic and adopted the patient, possession-based approach that has served him well throughout his career. That’s the nice way of putting it. More bluntly, it was dull as f**k.",
      "Said style did bring an FA Cup to Old Trafford, the first trophy post-Fergie. And the club’s hierarchy was so thankful to Van Gaal that they decided to sack him straight after the Wembley triumph.",
      "",
      "Ten Hag should have been sacked at the end of 2023/24 after the club’s worst finish in Premier League history. An unlikely FA Cup final win over Manchester City saved him. The club spoke to a few managers, yet Sir Jim Ratcliffe decided to extend the Dutchman’s contract after he and his minions swallowed his mitigation around injuries.",
      "It proved to be the silly decision we all knew it was at the time. The summer transfer window was filled with promise but none of the new faces impressed and the football did not improve. In fact, you could say it somehow got worse.",
      "Ten Hag won the Carabao Cup in his first campaign, which went along nicely with a top-three finish in the league and an FA Cup final, which his side lost to Man City. His second season was a direct contrast: beating Pep Guardiola’s side at Wembley after shambling their way to eighth in the Premier League.",
      "The 2023/24 Champions League campaign was truly awful, finishing bottom of a group when it seemed harder not to. Their Carabao Cup defence ended painfully when the Red Devils were hammered by Newcastle United — the team they beat in the previous season’s final — at home, and results in the Premier League were mind-bogglingly inconsistent.",
      "Still, on paper, two trophies in two seasons is a fine return. On grass, it was a different story. Ten Hag’s dismissal was inevitable and one of many clear signs that Ratcliffe might not know what he’s doing.",
      "",
      "Say what you want about the man. Take into account all of the semi-final defeats. Do whatever you want, mate. We don’t care. United played their best football post-Fergie under Solskjaer, who was sacked in November 2021 after a harrowing defeat at Watford.",
      "The club legend got the job full-time after a mightily impressive spell as caretaker boss that included an iconic Champions League comeback away to Paris Saint-Germain, to which Rio Ferdinand reacted in a completely normal manner:",
      "Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table, let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there – given what he’s done since he’s come in – and let him sign the contract and go. Ole’s at the wheel, man – he’s doing his thing. Man United are back!",
      "In fairness, we all egged Man Utd on. He was having a ball at the wheel during his caretaker stint but his permanent spell eventually became a write-off.",
      "Solskjaer did bring the best out of Bruno Fernandes, giving him the freedom to express himself, and the Portuguese thrived as a result. He even made Anthony Martial look like a competent footballer. The comeback wins, counter-attacking football, and incredible 20-minute spurts in games when United would kill the opposition were the highlights of a fun time with the Norwegian at the helm.",
      "",
      "The Special One got the job after Van Gaal’s sacking and has been the club’s most successful boss since Ferguson retired in 2013. Again, his football was far from incredible to watch, but it provided results in a results business.",
      "His first season saw Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic shine as the Red Devils won the Carabao Cup and Europa League. They might’ve finished sixth in the Premier League, but that was insignificant as Europa glory brought the club Champions League football anyway.",
      "The following season brought two-time Champions League-winning manager Mourinho one of his “greatest” achievements: finishing second in the Premier League, 19 points behind centurions Manchester City.",
      "As it usually does, things went sour in Mourinho’s third season in charge, losing his job in December 2018, which saw Solskjaer take charge.",

      "After a weekend display against Fulham that saw Gary Neville describe the Slovenian as “nowhere near”, Sesko did not do much to prove the pundit wrong, registering a Fotmob rating of 5.8, a score only Andrea Onana failed to beat.",
      "As such, the striker has been put in the crosshairs, but while his performance was described as ‘anonymous’, his most egregious offence for many came in the shootout when nine other United players stepped up before him.",
      "The Independent said: ‘Perhaps nothing summed up another spineless showing more than Benjamin Sesko, United’s new £74m central striker, the one tasked with firing the goals to restore United to their former glories, stepping up second-from-last – just before Onana – to take his spot kick.’",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n👉 ‘Looking like a right plonker’ – What the pundits had to say about Ruben Amorim and his tactics board\n👉 Amorim throws ‘completely lost’ Man Utd players under the bus as ‘one team on the pitch’\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘waiting to be sacked’ as Man Utd ‘more Spursy than Spurs’",
      "While the Mail said: ‘It felt like a big night for Sesko too on his full debut after a big-money move from RB Leipzig and two rather subdued appearances off the bench against Arsenal and Fulham. The Slovenian was largely anonymous and then curiously chose to be the last outfield player to step up in the shootout. Not exactly the kind of confidence you expect from a £74m striker.’",
      "The Express were particularly critical, giving him a 1 in their player ratings and saying he was ‘unconvincing’.",
      "‘His first start since a £74million transfer to United. Talk about a rough welcome… Unconvincing is an understatement. Clearly didn’t fancy a penalty, either.’",
      "The Sun said the 6ft 5’ striker was ‘way off it’ and said that if he was given leniency for a slow start in the Premier League, you cannot use the same excuse against a League Two side.",
      "‘I know the talk has been that the Slovenian ace has not been up to pace for the Prem, but he didn’t give a good account of himself against English rough-houses here.",
      "‘He towered over the League Two side’s back-line, but United hardly made use of it.",
      "‘Beat his man on occasion, but his shooting was way off it. Twice easily blocked and another weak one for the keeper to collect.",
      "‘Can’t remember Sesko touching the ball in the second half before he failed to win it for his side when his sitter was sent into row Z from two yards at the death.",
      "‘The £74 million striker went 10th in the shootout. Bizarre.’",
      "‘Out of kilter with his new teammates for most of the evening but came closest to scoring in the first half. Slotted in his penalty.’",
      "The Guardian though said even the sight of Sesko shooting was a reminder that United were allowed to attack.",
      "‘Grimsby were in cruise control, toying with their shell-shocked guest. When Sesko managed a header, you were reminded that United were allowed to attack – too.",
      "‘Amorim was not spotted on the touchline witnessing the kicks – as odd as the decision to have his new £70m leader of the attack, Sesko, as taker No 10. Again, expect this to be dissected.’",

      "Image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo celebrating in February 2024 went viral but 16 months on all three could be heading for the Manchester United exit door; what went wrong for promising young trio and who is to blame for their failure to fire for Ruben Amorim?",
      "Friday 29 August 2025 13:32, UK",
      "Instantly iconic. But now, for the wrong reasons.",
      "The image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, sat on the advertising boards at Old Trafford in celebration in February 2024, appeared to showcase Man Utd's bright future.",
      "A year-and-a-half on, Hojlund and Garnacho look set to leave before the end of this transfer window, Mainoo is out of the first-team frame in the Premier League, while the club lurches into another crisis.",
      "How did it come to this? And who is to blame?",
      "Hojlund, then aged 21, had opened the scoring against West Ham. Alejandro Garnacho, just 19, struck two more. Kobbie Mainoo, the 18-year-old academy starlet, would go on to start a Euros final for England a few months later.",
      "Their combined celebration for Garnacho's first goal was a cheeky dig back at West Ham's Mohammed Kudus, who had marked his goal in the reverse fixture a couple of months earlier in similar fashion.",
      "But it came to stand for more than that. This was a snapshot of hope, an image to believe better times were ahead.",
      "Hojlund was in the hot streak of his Man Utd career, in the midst of a run which saw him bag seven goals in six games.",
      "Garnacho recorded his best figures for goal involvements that season, scoring seven in the Premier League - including that Puskás winner at Everton - and the opener in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Mainoo also netted at Wembley, seemingly confirming his rise would inevitably take him to the top.",
      "Sitting down with then-United boss Erik ten Hag in the days after the Old Trafford photo was taken, the Dutchman sounded a warning to the trio.",
      "But unquestionably the feeling at that point was optimism. \"We have some exciting players,\" said Ten Hag, when he was asked about the celebration. There was a smile from a manager who is typically more interested in tactical talk than emotions.",
      "He could see the importance of the symbolism and also what it meant to Man Utd supporters.",
      "After all, this is a club which prides itself on its history of developing and honing young talents.",
      "Yet, fast forward to the final days of this summer's transfer window and Hojlund is off to Napoli, Garnacho to Chelsea and Mainoo - that prized, homegrown asset - can't get in the first team, has requested a loan and is expected to be the subject of offers from elsewhere.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho, in particular, feel victims of circumstance - and Ruben Amorim's fixation on 3-4-3.",
      "The Englishman isn't trusted in the central midfield two - despite playing a similar role alongside Declan Rice at the Euros. Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte are favoured there.",
      "He got a runout in the disastrous defeat to Grimsby but it is clear Amorim isn't convinced he has the attributes for the position.",
      "A short-lived experiment to play Mainoo off the striker seems over too, with United spending big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With Fernandes also deployed in that more advanced role, Mainoo, again, could count him fourth-choice in another position.",
      "Garnacho, meanwhile, finds himself a winger for a team which no longer uses them - and a wing-back role never looked like a conversion to maximise his talents.",
      "There have been strops at substitutions and friction off the field but attitude is not a core reason for his exit.",
      "For Hojlund, too many misses have ultimately been his undoing, with Benjamin Sesko now signed to lead the line. However, he could justifiably point to a far from fully-functioning attack around him.",
      "And there should also be sympathy for a young forward who was never intended to carry the weight of being United's lead striker, having arrived in a summer when they intended to also go for Harry Kane.",
      "Interestingly, Hojlund had more goals than Kane when he turned 22 but United want to move on.",
      "It is not hard to imagine this trio following Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Antony in rejuvenating their careers away from Old Trafford.",
      "They are all talented and will surely enjoy good times again. And that will raise more questions about the environment and culture at United - and perhaps, down the line, regrets.",
      "Where, for instance, will Mainoo be in a couple of years time, when Fernandes, Casemiro and Ugarte will likely have departed?",
      "Would Amorim's successor - whether he arrives sooner or later - not wish to have a winger with Garnacho's threat?",
      "The pair could be jettisoned in favour of the ideas of a head coach with the worst Man Utd managerial record in the modern era.",
      "It has been the story of United since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement: veering from one direction to another with little thought of the long-term plan.",
      "Hojlund, Garnacho and Mainoo looked set to be the future when they were pictured together on that promising day at Old Trafford. Just 16 months on they are out of the frame.",

      "Friday 29 August 2025 08:57, UK",
      "Manchester United are arguably at their lowest ebb after an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were very much second-best against their fourth-tier opponents, falling 2-0 down at half-time. And while Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire rescued a 2-2 draw, they then crashed out after a marathon penalty shoot-out.",
      "After the game Amorim made some concerning comments, insisting his players \"spoke really loud to him\" and that \"something has to change\" - but adding he cannot change 22 players again.",
      "I watched the whole game and all the way through to the penalties and: hard work. You have to put in the hard work. You could be some of the most talented players in the world but you have to work hard.",
      "No disrespect to Grimsby, they shouldn't be on the same pitch as Man Utd. If Man Utd turn up with the attitude Grimsby had, there's only one result and everyone would have been turning over at half-time, looking for something else to watch. That wasn't the case.",
      "Half of them turned up thinking: 'I'm only playing because it's Grimsby. I won't be playing against Burnley on Saturday'. Instead of: 'When I walk off that game, those Grimsby fans and players will go: I didn't know he was that good.' That's not the case.",

      "He didn't want to come in during the middle of the season because he knew they were not his players. No wing-backs. Then he had to come in, it was a mad struggle and this season he hasn't got it.",
      "Amorim has probably just gone: 'I just have to outscore teams', with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko up front. Bruno Fernandes playing as well. And I don't think he'll do that.",
      "I will be shocked if he's still in charge if Man Utd don't beat Burnley. But they will beat Burnley! It's a nice game.",
      "Erik ten Hag had that as well: three or four games without a win and then second-bottom of the league came. They just won that game and then lost three or four games again.",
      "It's just going to keep on covering the cracks. They will be called Pollyfilla United!",
      "I don't think Amorim will be shy to go: 'I've had enough. I can't do anything. I've done what I can'.",
      "I don't think he is one to put himself through pain to get his pay-off. I don't know the man, but [the way he is] coming across, I think he's an honest man and will be honest with himself. But I think they will beat Burnley.",
      "For me, I would have said yes. You don't win league titles, World Cups or European Championships without good goalkeepers.",
      "Onana doesn't save points, the goalkeepers lose points at Man Utd. So as soon as you lose points, that's a worry.",
      "They need a new goalkeeper. I see Gianluigi Donnarumma's around - why don't they go for him? But again, they've used their money in other positions.",
      "They need legs in midfield. No one has ever won a tournament or league without legs in midfield.",
      "They bought Sesko for £70m and he's taking the 10th penalty? I thought he had a broken leg when he stepped up. I thought he must be that injured that he's taking the 10th penalty.",
      "And then I heard people saying that he didn't want to miss or take that pressure. He's a £70m player! He's coming to score goals for Man Utd to take them back to where they should belong and he's taking the 10th penalty?",
      "He has to be in the top five. He's taking a penalty from 12 yards and the goalkeeper can't come off his line!",
      "I forgot that he was playing and then when he stepped up for the 10th penalty... wow."

      "Thursday 28 August 2025 22:17, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows is back to offer his predictions and insight across the Premier League, tipping a 5/1 double.",
      "This is one of those fixtures that jumps off the page if you are into backing cards. We have a London derby and crucially we're in a matchday before an international break where historically the card count climbs.",
      "Across the last 10 Premier League seasons, there have typically been 0.64 more yellow cards per game during the final matchday before the first international break, compared with the season average.",
      "Last season for example, the 10 games on Matchday Three produced 5.6 cards per game. That's a big number.",
      "So, why the spike?",
      "Tough one, but perhaps players, particularly those on the fringes of their national team, want to stay sharp, show commitment and impress selectors. And with no club fixture for two weeks, suspensions feel a little less weighty. So perhaps tackles fly in.",
      "The over 4.5 cards line here is 10/11 with Sky Bet and that rates as a great starting point for building a bet.",
      "Some prices scream value, others scream \"trap.\" Manchester United to beat Burnley at 4/11? As MC Hammer once suggested, don't touch this.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have been consistently an unreliable betting proposition, especially against any side that can string three passes together under pressure. See Grimsby.",
      "Of course, Amorim overall has lost 16 of 29 Premier League games in charge. That doesn't help.",
      "United's name alone keeps them falsely short in markets which has been a cracking edge to exploit in recent years. It's certainly relevant here as the bulky transfer fees to bring in the new strike force are influencing United's probabilities of winning matches without any evidence to back it up yet. The end might be near for Amorim if he can't find the answers.",
      "Burnley on the draw no bet at 11/2 with Sky Bet is a real runner.",
      "This one has that delicious mix of ingredients I crave when searching for an edge: a dangerous set-piece side like Brentford possessing a centre-back who is due a goal.",
      "Even without Thomas Frank, Brentford continue to be the most effective side in the league from dead-ball situations. The clue is hiring the set piece as manager in that regard.",
      "Since the start of the 23/24 season, they rank second for expected goals from set pieces (33.2) and opened this campaign already creating 1.3 worth of expected goals from such situations, including scoring from one against Bournemouth in midweek.",
      "The set-up is relentlessly rehearsed and it's producing chances for the same players every week.",
      "Sepp van den Berg has had at least a shot in 14 of his last 16 starts at centre-back for the Bees, posting a total of 17 shots in total. At a first goalscorer price of 25/1, he's an outrageous value for a defender with clear licence to attack. His first goal for Brentford could be just around the corner.",
      "The Richarlison redemption movement is not a narrative many saw coming this season.",
      "Thomas Frank is a master at coaching forward players, just look at his body of work at Brentford: Ollie Watkins, Ivan Toney, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. Frank has unlocked the Richarlison we saw at Everton - playing aggressively and looking hungry to make a difference. Of course, he scored twice in their last home game with Burnley and looks the bet here at 9/2 to score first.",
      "Bournemouth under Andoni Iraola want to press high, play front foot, and squeeze opponents, but that leaves big gaps in behind, particularly through the middle where their centre-backs are encouraged to play aggressively. It's going to take time to settle into a new defensive rhythm having lost Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi. Home win.",
      "This is a great time of the season for spotting players the markets haven't quite priced up correctly yet. And right now, Jack Grealish to register an assist is exactly that.",
      "Grealish could be about to cook up a storm. In his new role at Everton, the early signs are very positive for him having a huge influence on games. He's been drifting into left-half space, just outside the box and Everton have been feeding the ball down that flank.",
      "The markets still price Grealish's assist odds like he's stuck in his Manchester City mode, where he was tasked with cutting inside, recycling the ball and making the safe play. But at Everton, under a more direct and counter-attacking system, he's playing with far more verticality and is a creative force - as shown by his two assists last weekend against Brighton and three chances created in midweek against Mansfield.",
      "He is 7/2 with Sky Bet to grab another in a very winnable game for the Toffees.",
      "One of the early trends to put lots of weight on is promoted teams being very hard to beat at home.",
      "Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester only won six home games between them in the last campaign, but Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland are three from three so far. The atmosphere, energy and early-season excitement mean places like Elland Road are horrible places for opposition teams to play. Everton found that out on the opening matchday.",
      "And, let's call it as it is: no Alexander Isak, no Anthony Gordon and no proven striker means the chance of no goals for Newcastle is live. Strip away the strikers, throw in a midfield missing bite without Joelinton and Sandro Tonali, and Leeds have a fantastic chance of registering another maximum points haul. The home win at 12/5 with Sky Bet merits respect.",
      "The market is completely overlooking a new strand of Erling Haaland that might be about to explode. His headed goals numbers.",
      "Of his 87 Premier League strikes, 15 of them have been headers anyway but that metric is going to be on the increase based on City's new stylistic approach in the final third. It was clear from the outset of the game against Wolves that the inclusion of Tijjani Reijnders has added a directness to what City now do.",
      "City weren't turning back inside looking for options, they were looking to hit Haaland inside the area with early crosses.",
      "Haaland is 6ft 4in remember, and built like an Olympic discus thrower - he is suited to this style. He's recorded five headed shots in his two games this season and a headed goal is on the way. Timing is everything so jumping on now at 9/2 with Sky Bet for Haaland to score a header could be a wise move.",
      "The matchday before the first international break always hits hard.",
      "Just as the season is gathering momentum, we're hit with the prospect of England vs Andorra again. Sigh.",
      "An interesting betting angle developing in this final matchday before an international break is that the goal average goes up when analysing it against the season average.",
      "In the last six seasons on the matchday before the first international break, the goals per game average is at 3.3, from a sample size of 60 games. If you compare that figure to the average goals per game across those six seasons in the Premier League, which is at 2.8, we're seeing 0.5 more goals scored per game in this matchday. A huge difference in a low-scoring sport like football.",
      "That makes the over 2.5 goals line of interest here at Evens with Sky Bet. Having watched West Ham in all three of their matches so far this season, Forest could clear this line on their own. The Hammers have conceded 11 goals and there doesn't seem to be any signs of Graham Potter going back to basics to address the clear problem.",
      "Ask yourself this: would Arne Slot and Mikel Arteta take a draw right now? The answer is yes, isn't it? Categorically.",
      "That makes the draw a huge runner from a betting point of view.",
      "It's very unusual to have a fixture played before Gameweek four involving two title rivals. Looking at the past trends when looking at this type of fixture played early on in the season, draws are very common.",
      "The last five fixtures in the Premier League before Gameweek four to be played between teams that finished that season in the top three all ended in stalemates - the most recent of which was Arsenal's 2-2 with Manchester City last season.",
      "The draw here is the bet at 23/10 with Sky Bet. It's the bet of the weekend.",
      "If you need some evidence of why Oliver Glasner is such an incredible manager, just look at his record against Unai Emery, who is arguably regarded as the best pound-for-pound manager in Europe.",
      "Glasner has won four of the last five meetings with Emery with the aggregate score reading a hefty 17-4 in favour of the Austrian.",
      "Emery just hasn't found a way of breaking down Palace's mid-to-low block and Glasner's tactic of utilising Ismaila Sarr's pace and power has been so dangerous.",
      "Sarr has been phenomenal in these fixtures, registering seven goal involvements in his last three appearances against Villa. That included two goals and an assist in the 3-0 FA Cup semi-final win. He is 2/1 with Sky Bet to either score or assist again.",
