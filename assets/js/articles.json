      "Manchester United have jetted off to the United States for their pre-season tour with their squad overhaul only part-complete. United came into the summer transfer window with big plans to rip up their squad and start again after a dreadful campaign, but it’s been slow going so far.",
      "Defeat in the Europa League final after finishing 15th in the Premier League sparked serious questions in the camp. The idea was that Ruben Amorim would be backed in the transfer market, with the unwanted players discarded and the reset button pressed.",
      "The early arrival of Matheus Cunha, in a £62.5million transfer from Wolves, appeared to be a statement of intent. But it has taken six more weeks for the second arrival to be sealed, with Bryan Mbeumo joining for £71m from Brentford on Monday.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are major signings for United, who have managed to capture two of the most exciting players in the Premier League, despite not being able to offer them any European football in the upcoming campaign. But there remains lots of work to do before the transfer window shuts on September 1.",
      "Firstly, the club needs to find buyers for the five members of their ‘bomb squad’ – Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. Rashford is heading to Barcelona on loan and Sancho is joining Juventus, but the other three are works in progress.",
      "In the meantime the search goes on for other targets. One avenue that has attracted more column inches in recent weeks is in goal, with interest in Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez clear. United reportedly made an offer to sign the World Cup winner on loan, only to see it rejected by Villa.",
      "Andre Onana’s mistakes have been well documented and back-up Altay Bayindir was no better when he stepped into the void last season. Emi Martinez would undoubtedly be a step up, if United can get a deal over the line; the issue is that he is under contract with Villa until June 2029 and they are unlikely to sanction a sale to a direct rival.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is another player United are considering, with Onana currently on the comeback from a hamstring injury. Lammens is valued at £17m by the Belgian club, making him a more realistic alternative.",
      "The Athletic says that another area Amorim wants improvement in is deep-lying midfield, where Casemiro is over the hill, Manuel Ugarte hasn’t impressed consistently and Kobbie Mainoo – like Scott McTominay before him – is better suited to playing further forward.",
      "United have been credited with an interest in Atalanta star Ederson – and the Brazilian would appear to be a perfect fit. Juventus and Inter Milan have also been linked with Ederson, who Atalanta value at €60m (£52m), but United have the potential advantage of having good relations with the Italian side, having previously signed Rasmus Hojlund and Amad from them.",
      "Ederson’s presence at the base of midfield would allow Amorim to field captain Bruno Fernandes in one of his two central midfield roles, with new signings Mbeumo and Cunha operating in the No.10 positions. Sporting Lisbon’s Morten Hjulmand, who Amorim knows well, is another option.",
      "Up front, United are searching for a centre-forward. They made enquiries over Hugo Ekitike, who is now joining Liverpool, and Viktor Gyokeres, who is Arsenal-bound, while Nicolas Jackson and Ollie Watkins are on their long list.",
      "United would likely need to sell Hojlund this summer to help open up space and fund a move for a striker, and there have been rumours of interest from Serie A in the Danish striker, who managed just 10 goals in 52 games last season.",
      "Benjamin Sesko first came to United’s attention as a 16-year-old in Slovenia and the club held talks last summer. Earlier this summer it looked as though Arsenal preferred him to Gyokeres, but they ultimately changed their minds.",
      "Sesko is thought to be valued at €70m (£60m) by RB Leipzig and has the all-round game to play as a loan centre-forward in Amorim’s system.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s dream Man Utd XI: E Martinez; Yoro, De Ligt, L Martinez; Dalot, Ederson, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha, Sesko.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United face a fight to secure the signature of Sporting CP captain Morten Hjulmand. The Red Devils have just wrapped up a deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, shelling out an initial £65million plus £6m in potential add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo joins Ruben Amorim's squad alongside fellow newcomer Matheus Cunha, but United could still make plenty of moves before the transfer window shuts. The club have been linked with Sporting skipper Hjulmand, who Amorim has previously worked with during his time at the Portuguese club.",
      "It has already been a busy summer for Sporting, having been locked in transfer discussions over star striker Viktor Gyokeres. However, one of Hjulmand's team-mates is not expecting the holding midfielder to also head for the exit this summer.",
      "Following Sporting's recent pre-season win over Sunderland, defender Ivan Fresneda was quizzed about the possibility of Hjulmand leaving. \"Hjulmand is our captain and he's very happy here with us, I have no doubt,\" Fresneda bluntly told O Jogo.",
      "According to Teamtalk, United have earmarked Hjulmand as a potential solution to strengthen their midfield, with Amorim keen on a reunion with the Denmark international. The 26-year-old joined Sporting after current United midfielder Manuel Ugarte joined Paris Saint-Germain in 2023.",
      "He featured in 47 matches across all competitions as Sporting clinched both the Primeira Liga and Taca de Portugal last term.",
      "The report indicates that Hjulmand, who has also caught the eye of Juventus, could set United back as much as £52m. Portuguese publication A Bola claims the midfielder also possesses a release clause worth approximately £69m (€80m).",
      "Following Hjulmand's debut campaign at Sporting, Amorim appointed him as the club's new skipper. Yet the Dane was open about his emotions after the manager agreed to join United in November 2024.",
      "\"I told him in front of the other players that we were disappointed with his departure,\" Hjulmand told A Bola. \"We were counting on him to help us all fight for the second title.",
      "\"He himself said the same thing at the start of the season. But afterwards, I also told Ruben that we understood his decision.\"",
      "He added: \"Many players wanted to stay at Sporting with Ruben Amorim because he is a great coach.\"",
      "The admiration is mutual as Amorim previously branded Hjulmand as the most \"complete\" midfielder he had coached at Sporting. When comparing Hjulmand to his Sporting predecessors Manuel Ugarte and Joao Palhinha, the United manager was effusive in his praise.",
      "\"It's a normal evolution and then there's also the merit of scouting,\" Amorim said. \"I love Palhinha and Ugarte, but I would say that Hjulmand is the most complete player in his position.\"",
      "The defensive midfielder made 65 appearances under Amorim, clinching the Primeira Liga title together in 2024. Hjulmand still has three years left on his Sporting contract."

      "Marcus Rashford has been warned that he needs to step up his work ethic if he's to make it big at Barcelona. The Manchester United striker is on the verge of sealing a season-long loan move to the La Liga titans, marking his second consecutive spell away from Old Trafford after spending the second half of last season at Aston Villa.",
      "Barcelona emerged as a possible new home for him last year when he revealed in late 2024 his desire for a fresh challenge away from the club he grew up at. And they've been his desired club since then.",
      "Rashford, who arrived in Barcelona on Sunday, is set to become the first Englishman to don the Blaugrana kit since Gary Lineker's signing back in 1986. As he prepares for his switch, Cucurella, a product of Barcelona's famed La Masia academy, has offered some sage advice.",
      "The Spanish international has called on Rashford to enhance his work rate and mindset to thrive at the Catalan giants, who reportedly hold an option to purchase him following his loan spell.",
      "In a chat with Jijantes FC, Cucurella said: \"He's very fast and will notice the difference in pace between the leagues. He's not used to that league, and I think he'll [need to] do quite a bit of work because he'll notice that difference.\"",
      "Rashford's on-field demeanour has previously come under fire, notably from United manager Ruben Amorim. He pointed to lacklustre work rate as the reason for his omission from the team for last December's Manchester derby.",
      "Following that, Rashford didn't make another appearance for United, and amid his prolonged absence from the starting lineup, Amorim made a scathing remark about the necessity for players to give their all.",
      "The 40-year-old confessed he'd prefer to play his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach over a player lacking full commitment. \"If you do the maximum and do the right things, we can use every player,\" Amorim stated at the time.",
      "\"And you can see today on the bench, we missed a bit of pace to go, to change the game. I will put [Jorge] Vital [on the pitch] before I put a player that does not give the maximum. I will not change in that department.\"",
      "With Rashford's departure from Old Trafford anticipated to be finalised soon, Amorim has already secured replacement attacking options in the form of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, the latter completing his move from Brentford on Monday.",

      "United were interested in Viktor Gyokeres earlier in the year but haven't followed up on that interest since and have had no intention of fighting Arsenal for his signature since he decided to join the Gunners. According to the Athletic, a late attempt to sign Hugo Ekitike has been contemplated, but the Frenchman had already decided to join Liverpool when intermediaries sought to see if a deal was possible.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko was briefly considered, but the entire cost of a transfer, plus his salary demands, weighed up against his output in the Bundesliga last term quickly put Unied chiefs off. Aston Villa star Ollie Watkins is a player admired, but the Villans don't want to sell.",

      "United have managed to raise extra funds due to sell-on clauses, with Alvaro Carreras, Anthony Elanga and Maxi Oyedele all joining new clubs this summer. The Red Devils have earned a percentage of each player's transfer fee, while Marcus Rashford's impending loan move will also help.",

      "That comment in particular hints at Mbeumo's drive to not only get the best out of himself but those around him as well. And the ability to deliver that message without grating on one's team-mates can be a rare quality.",
      "Mbeumo also opened up about the kind of behaviour he feels tends to optimise his play. And it's apparent Amorim and his squad may need to give their new signing the arm-round-the-shoulder treatment, rather than tough love, should he not hit the ground running straight away at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I’m someone who needs support and love to give my best performances,\" said the Cameroonian. \"I’m really lucky to have someone like Wissa, who always wants the best for me.",
      "\"I always want to give 100%, but there are some times when I’m feeling down, so having someone like him who will help and push you in the right direction is brilliant to have.\""

      "Manchester United have almost halved their demands for Alejandro Garnacho - and will now accepted £40million for the Argentine as he looks to leave the club this summer.",
      "The youngster was once seen as one of the club's future stars but his performances have dipped whilst he's also struggled to find a role that brings the best out of him in Ruben Amorim's system, which has complicated matters.",
      "Chelsea were previously linked with Garnacho, who scored 11 times last term, whilst Napoli too have been interested in the past. So far no bidders have been forthcoming but a massive drop in the Manchester club's demands may now see that change.",
      "Garnacho angered major figures at Old Trafford once the season finished as he wore an Aston Villa shirt with Rashford's name on the back whilst on holiday with the image going viral on social media. That also came after his reaction to his Europa League snub did not impressed his manager.",
      "The Argentine was named on the bench for the clash in Bilbao, which United lost. Garnacho arrived late to wam up on the pitch and was seen chatting with Tottenham defender Sergio Reguilon. Hours before kick off he also share pictures of him scoring against local rivals Manchester City during the FA Cup final win on social media, with many drawing their own conclusions.",
      "After the match the player said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Garnacho isn't the only player United will be prepared to lose millions on. Marcus Rashford is heading to Barcelona on loan with the Spanish club having the option to buy next summer. They can do so for £26m, despite the Red Devils telling Aston Villa just months ago the price was £40m.",
      "Jadon Sancho was signed back in 2021 from Borussia Dortmund for just over £70m. He's since had two loan spells away and the Red Devils will let him leave permanently for £15m. Antony joined United for £86m in 2022, but his value has also plummeted, with interested clubs now being quoted around £30m to sign him."

      "The Villa goalkeeper's last outing ironically saw him sent-off at Old Trafford on the final day of the season. United were able to secure a 2-0 victory which meant that Unai Emery's side missed out on the Champions League, instead settling for the Europa League.",
      "After that defeat Emery was quizzed on Martinez's future potential exit and said: “I don’t know. He has a contract with us. We are very happy and we will see how the summer goes.” Pressed on if there have been discussions over Martinez leaving, Emery added: “I don’t know. You can ask him.”",
      "Doubts remain over Andre Onana, who is heading into his third season in Manchester, but he will miss pre-season with a hamstring injury and is in a race against time to be fit for the Premier League opener due to a torn hamstring. Amorim's side begin their season at home to Arsenal on August 17.",
      "The Red Devils have been linked with Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens. The Belgian club have slapped a £17m price tag on the Belgian star amid interest from the Premier League giants. On Monday they finally announced the signing of Bryan Mbeumo after weeks on negotiating with Brentford.",
      "He becomes the club's second summer signing, joining Matheus Cunha who headed to Manchester from Wolves. Mbeumo has cost United £71m, once add-ons are included, which makes him the most expensive player to ever leave the Bees as they maximised their profits."

The two new strikers both made an impression during Chelsea's triumphant Club World Cup campaign and Jackson is now considering his options.",

      "Manchester United completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo for £71million – then blasted Brentford for trying to sell him elsewhere and scupper their deal.",
      "United landed Mbeumo with a third offer of £65m plus £6m in add-ons, but it emerged Brentford put pressure on the forward to go to Newcastle or Tottenham. Arsenal were also in for the 25-year-old and Chelsea made a late move for him, but Mbeumo was only ever interested in joining United and told Brentford he was not prepared to go anywhere else.",
      "It also emerged Brentford put pressure on Mbeumo to reduce his wage demands, to increase the size of the fee they would receive, but United honoured his desire to join them by agreeing to pay him £200,000-a-week.",
      "Sources involved in the deal claim Brentford wanted a fee of £70m plus £7m in add-ons for Mbeumo, but United managed to negotiate down that final figure, with the £6m add-ons relating to a mix of team and individual performances.",
      "Brentford felt United agreed a high wage with Mbeumo to take rival clubs out of the running for him, then began negotiations over the fee at a low starting point - £45m plus £10m in add-ons. Former Brentford boss Thomas Frank, now at Tottenham, knew the price his old club wanted for Mbeumo, so Spurs were prepared to pay more than United, but the player insisted he would only go to Old Trafford.",
      "Mbeumo will fly with the rest of the United squad today for their pre-season tour of the US and will make his debut on Saturday against West Ham in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. The Cameroon international has signed a contract until June 2030, with the option of an extra year and will earn £200,000-a-week.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United's Director of Football, said: “Bryan’s goals and assists record in the Premier League is exceptional, his remarkable consistency has put him amongst the most productive players in England for the last three seasons.",
      "“Bryan’s belief in our project and determination to join the club confirmed that he was the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture that we are developing.",
      "“We are delighted to have secured another one of our primary targets ahead of the pre-season tour. The experience in the US will be the perfect opportunity for Bryan to work with Ruben and his new team-mates as we prepare for an exciting season ahead.”",
      "Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season and produced eight assists, said: “As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams - the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "“My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "“Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.”"

      "It is the he-said-she-said season. If we are to take Manchester United at face value, they beat Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United to the signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "One imagines some of those clubs would contest the strength of their interest in Mbeumo. Tottenham and Newcastle's was certainly genuine. So much so that. there were some typically theatrical reaction from sections of the latter at how United could possibly afford Mbeumo.",
      "Thomas Frank's switch from Brentford to Spurs prompted a sudden and serious approach. Mbeumo cherishes Frank for helping him to develop into one of the most productive forwards in the Premier League but he was set on joining United.",
      "A United source said Mbeumo \"never budged\". United did not budge when Brentford demanded an up-front fee of at least £70million. Having gone the entirety of last summer without breaking the £60m barrier for a signing, the no-go figure has been upped to £70m this summer.",
      "There was a pro and con of Matheus Cunha's release clause. It made his signing swift and straightforward for United but also raised the price of Mbeumo, such a similar profile of player he was born only a few months later. The Cameroon international has played twice as long in the Premier League and scored five more league goals last term. He is also slightly younger. On those counts, he is arguably a more valuable asset.",
      "But United have got the two prime targets for their positions. They have remained coy on Mbeumo's specific role but it is unlikely to be up front. Club sources were careful not to bill them as their \"top two targets\", mindful of the need for a new goalscorer.",
      "That said, United were keen to highlight that only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Ollie Watkins - four strikers - have scored more Premier League goals than Mbeumo in the past three years. Whatever the mitigation of such a stat, it is a genuinely impressive return from a winger who was operating at a stable mid-table side.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are not statement signings. United prised the best players from Brentford and Wolves. But they are statements of intent.",
      "Only seven players tallied more league goals than Cunha last season. Salah, Haaland and Isak were the three above Mbeumo in the charts. The clear caveat is that it will be trickier for the pair to match their goals hauls at the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "Arsenal were in for Cunha in the winter transfer window and at least two Champions League qualifiers wanted Mbeumo. United believe committing £133.5m on two signings reiterates their football first approach, an old line that they are still prone to trotting out.",
      "More significant is United retain some clout even after their worst season in 51 years. Yes, they moved for convenient targets at clubs lower down the food chain but there was concrete competition.",
      "Mbeumo is arguably more of a coup than Cunha, whose ill-discipline was a deterrent for some admirers. Mbeumo's character seems sound and he could have had an easier life, staying in London, reuniting with Frank and playing in the Champions League for Tottenham.",
      "A close relative of Mbeumo's is a United fan. Mbeumo revealed United was \"the team whose shirt I wore growing up\" in his unveiling statement. That may convince undecided fans to get 'Mbeumo 19' on the back of their new replica.",
      "There is a more bullish tone about United this summer. Twelve months ago, every significant decision that was taken during pre-season revolved around the manager and posed more questions than it answered.",
      "Keeping Erik ten Hag having looked to sack him and extending his contract rather than offering a renewal undermined the club's apparent confidence. Anyone who could see the wood for the trees could see United had gone past the point of no return under Ten Hag before they punched above their weight in the FA Cup final.",
      "The irony is Ruben Amorim presided over a Premier League finish that was almost twice as bad as Ten Hag's in 2023-24. Yet Amorim is Ineos' man. Amorim has seen off Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho amid unequivocal backing. You can count Dan Ashworth, too, given he was opposed to the choice of Amorim as head coach and favoured a British option.",
      "This is Amorim's first full season and he will not be afforded anywhere near as much slack as he was during those months when United prioritised the Europa League at the cost of their domestic form. There have been substantial squad investments in time for the pre-season tour and an XI with Mbeumo, Cunha, Bruno Fernandes, Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Amad has to climb the league table.",
      "The squad is still short of a proven goalscorer, there is a potential midfield minefield if that area is not enhanced, and Andre Onana does not instil confidence in the majority of supporters. The transfer window is open for just under six more weeks and at least one more starting signing is targeted. That has to be a number nine.",
      "For now, they have Mbeumo with the '9' in his squad number, drawing envious glances from north London and Tyneside."

      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens has already admitted he would find it difficult to turn down a move to Man United.",
      "Lammens, who kept 10 clean sheets for Antwerp last season, was linked with United earlier this year and was asked about the prospect of a move to Old Trafford at the time, admitting he would have to give serious consideration to the prospect of moving to M16.",
      "\"Wow, [it's] hard to say,\" Lammens told GVA back in February. \"I've only played one full season at Antwerp. If something comes along that I can hardly say no to and that will benefit the club, I'll have to think about it seriously. But if I'm the first 'keeper here for another year, that's no problem.",
      "\"The first time I heard it, I thought. 'Wow, a world team that follows you. That is special'. Of course, I was also spoken to about it a lot and when I made a save in training, it was United this, United that. Funny, I would do it the other way around too. But you can't dwell on it for too long. They are still just rumours.",
      "\"Those top clubs have so many scouts and follow so many players. So it doesn't have to mean anything yet. It will only become clear in the summer whether anything comes of it. But of course it's only positive. Especially because it's the best competition in the world and my profile – my stature and way of playing – is similar to English football.",

      "\"It's great for Barcelona to be honest. I'm not even talking about United, because they've bought a few new players and the new manager wants to do his thing I guess. It's not really his fault, if he doesn't believe in someone. He needs to win. If he doesn't win they're going to sack him.\"",

      "Gyokeres looks destined to sign for Arsenal. Mikel Arteta's side have finished runners-up in the Premier League for three successive seasons and signing a prolific striker has been their main aim this summer.",
      "According to Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg, Jackson remains a candidate to reinfoce Man United's attack this summer.",
      "Plettenberg said: \"Benjamin Sesko is a player who says, 'Okay, if there is not the right offer this summer, I can also imagine staying at RB Leipzig.' But there are also now many, many movements in the background, and there are also talks with interested clubs to our clear understanding that Manchester United is targeting him.",
      "\"He's one of two or three candidates as a new number nine striker for United. Then the other one is Nicolas Jackson. I cannot close the door for a possible Chelsea interest. Let's see what will happen in the next two or three weeks with Benjamin Sesko ahead.\"",
      "Man United have tried to hijack a move for Viktor Gyokeres from Arsenal as the transfer saga continues.",
      "The Gunners have been in talks with the Portuguese side for some time and were optimistic about finalising a deal before their pre-season tour to Singapore. However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has remained firm on his valuation of the Swedish player.",
      "Meanwhile, United have stayed alert to the situation, and when complications arose between Arsenal and Sporting, the Reds attempted to sign the Swedish goalscorer.",
      "That said, MEN Sport brings you the latest updates on Gyokeres from Portugal.",
      "Galatasaray have reportedly reached an agreement with Napoli to sign Man United-linked Victor Osimhen on a permanent deal.",
      "While United are believed to be interested in signing a striker this summer, the deal taking Osimhen to Galatasaray removes one of the options they had available. United have seen their options further limited with the news that Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres looks almost certain to join top-flight rivals Arsenal.",
      "It is said that a €75million (around £70m) transfer fee will be paid in two instalments, including a down payment. The report claims that the two clubs have agreed to a €40m (£35m) upfront payment and €35m (£30m) in instalments to be paid until July 2026.",
      "The issues are at the back and up front. United have prioritised their attack over the goalkeeper and the timing of Andre Onana's injury could work in his favour ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "The more pressing matter is the striker. With Joshua Zirkzee back in Manchester nursing a minor injury, Rasmus Hojlund did not even start against Leeds United. Amorim picked a rotational XI that was demonstrably not the strongest available to him, with two auxiliary centre backs in the back three and rookie Diego Leon in from the start.",
      "After Mbeumo, it's understood that a goalkeeper and striker will be prioritised by Man United.",
      "And according to Fabrizio Romano, the Reds have made initial contact with Royal Antwerp to request information about their conditions for a potential deal to sign Senne Lammens.",
      "Sunday was a strange one with Viktor Gyokeres. Reports in Portugal claimed that United had made an approach for the striker which was higher than the fee Arsenal are said to be willing to pay.",
      "However, that was then swiftly played down by the likes of Fabrizio Romano and Ben Jacobs. He is still expected to join Arsenal."

      "In the years since signing for the Bundesliga outfit, the 22-year-old has scored 27 goals in 64 league appearances in Germany, resulting in him regularly being linked with a move to the Premier League. Leipzig would consider a fee of around £70m for the forward.",

      "Back in January, the word from Barcelona was that the club’s sporting director, Deco, was “not that fussed” about Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rashford ended up playing in a different shade of claret and blue at Aston Villa, underwhelmed and has now ended up at Barcelona.",
      "It is a move that does not make much sense yet also makes sense. Barcelona have a deluxe back-up to a front three of Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski. Manchester United have found a club prepared to cover Rashford’s £325,000-a-week salary. It was always going to be a loan with an option to buy.",
      "Barca have admired Rashford for several years yet are signing him at one of his lowest ebbs. Villa declined the chance to buy him for £40million, Rashford had his squad number revoked and was ordered to report at United’s Carrington training complex after the first team had left this month.",
      "An agency source said Rashford has “done extremely well” to get Barcelona. The Spanish agent, Arturo Canales, helped broker Rashford’s loan to Villa in February and was re-hired to specifically secure a move to Barcelona.",
      "United have done extremely well to get Rashford off the books before August. Liverpool merit a mention. They resisted selling Luis Diaz to Barca after their prime target, Inaki Williams, signed a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Rashford is Barca’s plan C and, on paper, a substitute for La Liga's champions. He has broken double figures in only one of the past four seasons for United.",
      "High-ranking figures at United expected him to move abroad. Rashford mischievously refused to discount crossing the divide to Manchester City or heading down the East Lancs Road to Liverpool. There was no concrete evidence either of United’s rivals were interested in him.",
      "It is in United’s interests that Rashford performs in Spain. It would make him more sellable next year, when he will have entered the final two years of his United contract. While Ruben Amorim is in situ, there is no chance of United reintegrating Rashford back into their first team squad.",
      "Rashford has put in the hours over the summer. His Instagram account, almost certainly run by his brother and former agent, Dwaine, has charted a rigorous training schedule of gym-work and ball-work. Rashford spent four hours in a Salford gym last Monday.",
      "Hangers-on weighed Rashford down in recent years but his entourage on holiday in Cannes were on the grass with him. He was joined by brothers Dwaine, Dane, cousin Lois and former United academy teammate Roshaun Williams.",
      "Rashford shone at Camp Nou in United's engrossing 2-2 Europa League knockout draw in February 2023, scoring their equaliser and single-handedly forcing Jules Kounde's own goal. He was at his zenith that season, with the caveat that Rashford's form came with his camp in the midst of contract negotiations.",
      "Have a glance at Rashford's goals tallies over the past four seasons: five, 30, eight and seven. You can pinpoint the one that preceded a lucrative salary hike.",
      "Despite that 30-goal season, privately he bristled at some of Erik ten Hag's methods and how dogmatic the Dutchman could be. Their working relationship disintegrated during Ten Hag's final year at United.",
      "Rashford was irritated to start the 2023-24 season up front while Rasmus Hojlund recovered from a stress fracture of the back. At Villa, Unai Emery regularly played Rashford through the middle. Lewandowski, 37, is not showing many signs of slowing down but he is out of contract at Barcelona next year.",
      "After Amorim discounted Rashford from selection, the player exercised some moderate PR, attending a game in his hospitality box at Old Trafford. There was polite applause from the Stretford End on his final squad appearance when he warmed up against Newcastle in December.",
      "Figures at United are continuing to tread on eggshells with Rashford, still keen to highlight his legacy as one of their most striking academy graduates. Rashford has long since abandoned diplomacy, thanking Alejandro Garnacho for his puerile post in a Villa 'Rashford 9' shirt last month.",
      "One down, three to go for United. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Garnacho will, by hook or by crook, be gone by 7pm on September 1. United will then have a leaner, fresher and more harmonious forward line. One that has to be sharpened by a new striker.",

      "The 27-year-old was one of five players who were told to delay their returns to Carrington after each expressed a desire to leave. United have arranged Rashford's exit with favourable terms and now must address the futures of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia to offset incomings.",
      "United have not sold Rashford on a permanent deal, but removing one of the highest earners from the books is a boost, and Barcelona are expected to trigger their option to sign him at the end of the season.",
      "It feels inevitable Rashford will show enough for Barcelona to activate their option to sign him. He may well impress and pundits will then doubtless suggest United made a mistake by allowing him to leave.",
      "The script with Rashford over the next 12 months at Barcelona is predictable, but it will be a surprise if he can sustain strong performances across successive seasons in Spain.",
      "United's attention now turns to the four other players on the naughty step. Garnacho retains the highest value and arranging his sale will unlock much-needed funds for Ruben Amorim.",
      "An initial £127.5million has been splashed on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, so selling Garnacho is now at the top of the transfer agenda.",

      "The suggestion is that Garnacho would prefer to remain in the Premier League, but United will try to offload him to the highest bidder because. They should be trying to get £50million-plus for a player who has proven himself in the Premier League and still has considerable upside. The only problem is potential suitors know Amorim wants rid.",
      "Antony deserves credit for creating a market for himself. The Brazilian was utterly hopeless in Manchester but looked a completely new player during his loan with Real Betis last season.",
      "If you pretend his £86m transfer to United never happened, Antony would look like a decent prospect and a permanent move to a European club is on the cards for him this summer.",
      "United must sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR loss. The club will also look to negotiate a permanent deal for Jadon Sancho and the Italian press claim Juventus are advancing.",
      "Juventus will be asked to cough up a fee for Sancho, although United will get peanuts from the last player of the out-of-favour-five, Tyrell Malacia, who looked unconvincing during his PSV loan last term.",
      "The nightmare scenario was that all five players would still be at Old Trafford near the end of the window, but United have shifted Rashford and it's hoped the floodgates will now open for the other exits."

      "Although there is still just under a month to go until their Premier League curtain-raiser, some places in Amorim's starting XI are already nailed down. The likes of Leny Yoro, Patrick Dorgu, Bruno Fernandes, Mathes Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo will all believe they are guaranteed starters.",
      "Occupants of other positions within the XI remain to be decided, with United's four remaining friendlies set to dictate Amorim's thinking.",

      "Cunha operated as the left-sided No.10 in Stockholm and Toby Collyer, much to everyone's surprise, started as the right-sided No.10. Mbemo and Amad will be the leading contenders to occupy that role come mid-August.",
      "Casemiro and Fernandes started alongside each other in midfield in Stockholm before Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte were partnered together for the second half. United were better after the break and Mainoo was a bright spark.",
      "Amorim struggled to determine Mainoo's best position last season, tasking him as either a No.8 or as one of the playmakers. On Saturday's evidence, Mainoo looks more than comfortable in midfield.",
      "However, he was playing alongside Ugarte, who is a defensive specialist, meaning the England international had the freedom to get forward and be adventurous with the ball. If he starts the season next to Fernandes, he will not have that luxury amid the latter's hunger to attack.",
      "To ensure United, who still want to sign a midfielder this summer, strike the right balance in the engine room, Ugarte and Fernandes look the best partnership on paper. Ugarte is an excellent ball-winner and his qualities compliment Fernandes.",
      "Mainoo, though, will believe he has lost time to make up for after a stop-start 2024/25 campaign. However, the prospect of him and Fernandes working side-by-side could leave United vulnerable and potentially exposed in the middle.",
      "Casemiro returned for pre-season looking leaner and fitter, meaning he will be refusing to give up hope of becoming a regular starter this season.",

      "Mbeumo has signed a five-year contract with the option of another year, and the forward will travel to the United States on Tuesday with his new teammates for the pre-season tour.",
      "It was important to complete a deal in time for Mbeumo to feature in the US and United got the transfer over the line in the end, despite discussions with Brentford dragging on.",
      "Some fans were concerned when Mbeumo had not signed in time for the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Stockholm, but that game was essentially a training exercise.",
      "It wouldn't have made much difference if Mbeumo had travelled to Sweden last weekend, although it was obvious why United wanted him to arrive ahead of their trip across the Atlantic.",
      "The USA tour will provide Amorim with the opportunity to intensely work with his players across the next fortnight. The Reds boss will hope to lay the foundations for a successful campaign while in the States.",

      "United have received some flak for taking so long to sign Mbeumo. However, he will feature in America, which is a huge positive, and it was important that the structure of the deal was deemed fair.",
      "Brentford will receive the fee they wanted from the start, but United did not surrender to their demands immediately, submitting two unsuccessful bids before a breakthrough, and negotiating a favourable deal structure.",
      "The London club held the aces during talks. Mbeumo had entered the final year of his contract, but Brentford had the option of extending by 12-months, which helped their bargaining power.",
      "The player indicated his desire to move to Manchester, though, which has been key during the transfer saga over the last month. He desperately wanted a summer switch to United.",
      "The Cameroon international completed his medical over the weekend and was pictured in a suit at Carrington - appearances go a long way and Mbeumo has already made a good first impression.",
      "Rival fans have questioned the transfer fee, but they only need to look at the market for home truths. Anthony Elanga (six goals) signed for Newcastle in a £50m deal, Chelsea signed Jamie Gittens (12 goals) from Borussia Dortmund for £51.5m and Noni Madueke (11 goals) signed for Arsenal for £48.5m.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League - his statistics weren't inflated by cup competitions - and also contributed eight assists, so the initial £65m fee seems like fair market value.",

      "Just like last year, Manchester United's pre-season schedile began without them scoring. Unlike that unwatchable friendly against Rosenborg, they avoided defeat to Leeds United in Stockholm.",
      "Ruben Amorim fielded two different XIs in each half as the United players build up match fitness ahead of next Saturday's first tour test against West Ham United in New Jersey.",
      "Overall, 24 players were used as Tyler Fredricson and Jack Fletcher emerged for minutes in the second half. United fly to Chicago, their base while they are in the United States, on Tuesday and should have Bryan Mbeumo on board their flight.",
      "Here are five talking points from their first friendly in Sweden:",
      "Each player will be at different stages of their fitness and the rotational XI indicated that. The second XI for the second half was arguably stronger.",
      "It was still mystifying that Amorim opted for Toby Collyer as one of the two playmakers when it is the one area of the squad where United have a surfeit of options.",
      "Collyer said on tour last season he needed to improve on his ball-work. Shifting from a deep role to such an advanced position for a central midfielder by trade is unlikely to do him any favours. Collyer looked as lost as a playmaker as he did at left back against Barnsley last year.",
      "Midfield is one of United's weakest areas. The brains trust possibly believe they can cope with a quintet of Collyer, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo in a season devoid of European football. United cannot shift Casemiro, which is partly blocking an upgrade to that department.",
      "Fernandes has excelled from deep in the past and United are banking on him to carry the midfield. Ugarte was dropped for the Europa League final, Mainoo lost his first-team status several months ago, Casemiro could be redundant with no UEFA competition to participate in and Collyer has started three games against teams from League One, Scotland and Romania.",
      "Mainoo lined up in midfield in the second half and Amorim has to make his mind up on where he will primarily play next season.",
      "Shortly before the hour, Diogo Dalot charged into the Leeds third and played the ball into the channel for Rasmus Hojlund. Hojlund may have strayed offside and nothing came of his backheel.",
      "Before Hojlund got back to his feet, he was ready to let rip at Dalot. \"F**k's sake,\" he shouted, clearly irked that Dalot had not passed the ball sooner.",
      "It is not the first time Hojlund has vented at Dalot's end product. The most infamous flashpoint was in San Sebastian in March. Dalot was apologetic that night. On this occasion, he kept on running and blanked out the noise from Hojlund.",
      "Amad is the one winger who has survived United's cull as he has the defensive discipline to complement his attacking instincts. He has never been a problem for United, either, unlike Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Amorim said he prefers to use the Ivory Coast winger closer to goal but he played Amad on the flank in Sweden. Bryan Mbeumo is waiting in the wings and time will tell if he is used on the wing.",
      "Matheus Cunha was fouled a couple of times on his first United start and one or two other challenges arguably warranted a stoppage. Cunha got plenty of attention at Wolves and markers will doubtless be tighter and nastier now he is United's No.10.",
      "Fernandes was quick to impose himself on his United debut in February 2020 and Cunha is not a shrinking violet. He was well within his rights to rebuke Chido Obi for shooting while off balance when Cunha was well poised to at least hit the target as the ball rolled towards him. Obi offered an apologetic low-five.",
      "Even from 45 minutes that may have sent plenty of viewers to sleep, there were glimpses that Cunha is United material.",
      "Sean Longstaff and Daniel James lined up together for United. Leeds United. If Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had it his way, it would have been for Manchester United six years ago.",
      "United's pursuit of Longstaff ended in 2019 when Newcastle quoted them £50million. James did join the club and he has regressed to his true level since that purple patch at the beginning of his Old Trafford career, signing for relegation fodder, suffering relegation and a couple of seasons in the Championship."

      "Rashford was left in Manchester - he has been training away from the main group at Carrington - while Ruben Amorim oversaw United's opening pre-season friendly of the summer against Leeds on Saturday.",
      "The relationship between Amorim and Rashford became frosty in mid-December when the academy graduate was dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby at the Etihad.",
      "Rashford has been looking for a new club this summer, along with Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, and he will get his dream move to Barcelona.",
      "After the 0-0 draw against Leeds, Amad walked through the mixed zone at the Strawberry Arena and briefly shared his thoughts on Rashford's impending departure to Barcelona. \"Well, the only thing I can say is good luck to him, but I’m more focused on United and my team,\" said Amad.",
      "Amad is close friends with Garnacho, who is also expected to leave this summer, and he was asked whether it would a shame to see the winger depart, considering their relationship.",
      "\"I think this is not really my problem,\" said Amad in a thoughtful tone. \"The only thing I’m thinking right now is how we will learn together as a team and yeah, that’s the only thing I’m trying to think about right now.\"",
      "Amad has regularly shared photos with Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo from within the dressing room at Old Trafford. The trio are understood to be particularly close.",
      "Garnacho attracted interest from Napoli and Chelsea in the January transfer window, and the outright sale of the 21-year-old would be hugely beneficial to United to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR)."

      "His place in the XI for United's pre-season opener in the Swedish capital marked his first start of any kind since January 30.",
      "United beat FCSB 2-0 in their final Europa League league phase match that evening and Collyer had been withdrawn by the time goals from Diogo Dalot and Kobbie Mainoo steered the Reds safely through to the last-16.",
      "He was deployed alongside Bruno Fernandes in midfield in Bucharest, with Christian Eriksen and Mainoo preferred in the two No.10 positions.",
      "When the teamsheet dropped at the Strawberry Arena, it appeared as though Collyer was going to operate next to Casemiro in the centre of midfield, with Fernandes supporting new signing Matheus Cunha and Chido Obi in attack.",
      "However, it was Collyer who was deployed further forward. He occupied the right-sided No.10 spot and Fernandes joined Casemiro in the engine room.",
      "Pre-season is all about experimenting ahead of the competitive action so Ruben Amorim is entitled to test the water in matches where the outcome means very little.",
      "However, the United head coach's decision to deploy Collyer further forward was perhaps his way of trying to help Fernandes. Following the addition of Cunha, the feeling throughout the summer has been that the United captain will start the 2025/26 campaign in midfield.",
      "Fernandes regularly dropped deep in the second half of last season and was arguably more effective. He enjoyed a real purple patch in March when he was stationed as one of the two No.8s.",
      "With Bryan Mbeumo closing in on a move to Old Trafford, he is set to battle it out with Amad to land the right-sided No.10 spot. It is unlikely Amorim considers that position as Collyer's long-term habitat.",
      "Widely considered as a midfielder that tends to sit deep and try and marshal proceedings, it would be a drastic shift if he was to suddenly be transformed into a playmaker.",
      "With four more friendlies still to come, Amorim has plenty of time to experiment. However, the closer United get to the end of their pre-season schedule, the more likely it is the former Sporting Lisbon boss will field an XI that resembles something close to the one he has in mind for the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "United's starting XI in Stockholm had a rotational feel to it. As interesting as Amorim's decision to start Collyer in such an advanced role was, it is likely he did it to try and get another look at Fernandes as a No.8.",
      "Having previously admitting he could see himself dropping deeper as his career progresses, Fernandes might be about to make a permanent position change at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "Manchester United drew 0-0 with Leeds in their opening pre-season friendly of the summer. The game was essentially about getting minutes into players' legs ahead of the United States tour.",
      "Ruben Amorim didn't speak to the media after the game, aside from MUTV. Erik ten Hag did after facing Rosenborg in Norway and facing Rangers in Edinburgh last summer, but Amorim will speak to journalists when he travels to the States.",
      "Amorim walked briskly through the mixed zone towards the team bus, following Casemiro out of the stadium.",
      "The mixed zone at Old Trafford is makeshift, which means players are brought out to speak to journalists. But the idea is that players walk through the area as they leave the stadium, which gives the media a chance to politely ask if they would answer few questions.",
      "The Strawberry Arena has a 'proper' mixed zone and Amad briefly touched on the futures of Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, who are both set to leave the club this summer.",
      "He was also asked about which position he prefers. Amad started at right wing-back against Leeds, but he's capable of playing in the No.10 role in Amorim's system. \"I think I have to adapt in every moment and every situation,\" he said.",
      "\"No matter where I play, if the manager wants me to play as a right wing-back or a number 10, then I’m here to help the team. I have no problems with one position, I have no preference. I can play anywhere where the manager wants me.\"",
      "Amad was one of the only players to emerge with credit from last season.",
      "\"I think they [fans] have to be patient with us,\" he said. \"There’s a new manager, with new players and new tactics, so we know last season wasn’t really good for the team, but I think this season we will win a lot with him.",
      "\"I hope this season we are going to achieve a lot of good things by the end of the season. Honestly, I can’t say how long it will take, but what I can say is every player will give their best in training and try to do their best, also in the game.\"",
      "So, what could be considered a good campaign in 2025/2026?",

      "Tom Heaton",
      "Arguably United's best player. He made a couple of impressive saves in the second half and certainly offered the thought that he could be United's number two ahead of Altay Bayindir. Heaton will hope for more opportunities in the States with Andre Onana yet to feature owing to injury.",
      "Bendito Mantato",
      "The 17-year-old is highly thought of at Old Trafford and of all the youngsters, it was the winger who Amorim handed a shirt to when he rang the changes at the break. Mantato played 35 minutes before being replaced by Jack Fletcher and will hope to earn further chances over the coming weeks.",
      "Mason Mount",
      "It's been a case of 'what if' for Mount at United. Highly regarded by Amorim, injuries have stopped him getting any rhythm since his arrival from Chelsea in 2023. He offered some incision in the second half in Sweden and served a reminder that he still has something to offer this side.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Another who played his part in an improved second half showing from United. The midfielder has struggled to nail down a place in the first XI since Amorim's arrival but operated in the pivot position against Leeds and caught the eye. A year ago the midfielder was part of an England squad that nearly won the European Championships, he will hope to hit similar highs for club and country in the upcoming campaign.",
      "Casemiro",
      "Part of the first half XI and the midfielder struggled to impose himself on the contest. His best performances last term were in Europe and with no continental football on offer this season, it's hard to see the Brazilian gets regular minutes. That school of thought will not have altered based on his showing in Scandinavia.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund",
      "Was omitted from the XI in favour of Chido Obi and while we cannot read too much into that given it's the first game of pre-season, the Dane has work to do to convince United he can lead their line this term.",
      "On a couple of occasions against Leeds he could have held the ball up better and with United still searching for a striker, Hojlund knows he has to take every opportunity that comes his way. He didn't quite do that in Stockholm."

      "Manchester City are prominent in a list of the 20 most expensive forwards in transfer history. Cunha and Mbeumo are in but No 1) will never be shifted",
      "",
      "1) Neymar – £200m/€222m (Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2017)\nA fee so ridiculous La Liga refused to receive the payment so PSG said LOL to FFP and handed the money straight to Barcelona, activating one of those stratospheric release clauses designed to typically make such transfers essentially impossible.",
      "",
      "2) Eden Hazard – £143m/€160m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, July 2019)\nThe initial payment of £88.5m alone would have been a disastrous transfer, but Hazard accidentally activated enough variables in between numerous injuries before his retirement to make this an all-time great waste of money.",
      "",
      "3) Philippe Coutinho – £142m/€160m (Liverpool to Barcelona, January 2018)\nIt’s difficult to pinpoint the most damning aspect of this deal from a buyer’s perspective, but it’s somewhere between the £106m initial fee, the £26.4m in clauses paid out for Coutinho’s first 90 appearances, the £89m premium Barcelona reluctantly agreed to pay if they signed any further Liverpool players in the next two years, the fact Coutinho won the Champions League with Bayern Munich while on loan from the Nou Camp, scoring twice in the 8-2 quarter-final humiliation of the Catalans, or the knockdown price of £17m paid by Aston Villa after four underwhelming years.",
      "",
      "4) Ousmane Dembele – £135m/€147m (Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona, August 2017)\nWith a bruised ego and the Neymar cash burning a hole in their back pocket, Barcelona had tried all summer to sign Coutinho but after facing resistance from Liverpool, they went cap in hand to Dortmund for their back-up instead. And lessons were learned with a £369.6m release clause inserted this time – not that the Frenchman has ever come close to warranting such lavish interest until he found his ambipedal feet at PSG.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Felix – £113m/€126m (Benfica to Atletico Madrid, July 2019)\nPerhaps the worst match of player and manager there has ever been for a club-record transfer. How strange that the skilful individualist forward who doesn’t track back never meshed with a totalitarian coach who demands suffering and sacrifice from his subordinates. How strange that Atletico committed such sums on a teenager with 45 career first-team appearances. How strange that they couldn’t find anyone to buy him until Chelsea rocked up again.",
      "",
      "6) Antoine Griezmann – £107m/€120m (Atletico Madrid to Barcelona, July 2019)\nAfter The Decision favoured Atletico in 2018, the Frenchman could no longer avoid the Barcelona pull a year later in a sale which enraged Los Rojiblancos, considering a £180m release clause had only expired a couple of weeks before. Griezmann has somehow managed to remain without a La Liga winner’s medal through it all, timing his moves back and forth to Atletico and Barca comedically poorly.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish – £100m/€117.5m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nWhile it looked like an ungainly fit at first, Grealish went an awfully long way towards justifying his astronomical fee as a key part of a Treble-winning, mass-celebrating machine in his second season at the Etihad. Then it all started to fall apart again as he lost his way.",
      "",
      "8) Neymar – £86.3m/€100m (Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal, August 2023)\nThat world-record, market-breaking move to France delivered neither the Ballon d’Or nor the non-Barcelona Champions League that Neymar craved, so the Brazilian decided to cheat by joining the most successful side in AFC Champions League history for loadsa money, loadsa cars, loadsa bedrooms and loadsa saunas. A ruptured knee ligament meant he played seven times in Saudi Arabia before being released by mutual consent.",
      "",
      "9) Gareth Bale – £85.2m/€100m (Tottenham to Real Madrid, September 2013)\nAfter cramming half of his total Premier League goals by that point into a single phenomenal season, Bale became the latest obsession of a Real Madrid side desperate to win La Decima. The Welshman helped deliver that in his first campaign with a decisive goal in the Champions League final – the first of five European Cups and second of 15 trophies for a player the supporters nevertheless came to hate.",
      "",
      "10) Antony – £82m/€95m (Ajax to Man Utd, September 2022)\nErik ten Hag put all his eggs in the Antony basket but a few must have cracked in transit from Amsterdam, the relatively slow and predominantly one-footed winger scoring eight goals and assisting three in a 44-game debut season.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – £73m/€85m (Borussia Dortmund to Man Utd, July 2021)\nIn his three full seasons with Borussia Dortmund, Sancho’s least productive campaign was his first, when he scored 13 goals and provided 20 assists in 43 games. Across an entire Man Utd career which still technically remains a live thing after Chelsea paid £5m to return him rather than £25m to sign him, the forward has scored 12 goals and assisted six in 83 games.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe – £72m/€80m (Lille to Arsenal, August 2019)\nAfter offering the closest challenge to Kylian Mbappe for the Ligue Un Golden Boot, Arsenal spent what was a club-record fee on a player who has popped up around France, Turkey and Spain since being long outgrown by the upwardly mobile Gunners.",
      "",
      "13) Neymar – £71.5m/€86.2m (Santos to Barcelona, June 2013)\nThe financial details are wonderfully murky but official documents submitted to the authority revealed the final fee, as well as a €40m payment to Neymar’s parents.",
      "",
      "14) Kai Havertz – £71m/€80m (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, September 2020)\nExpensive flop who never fit into one defined position and suffered for regular managerial upheaval? Or scorer of the winning goals in the Champions League and Club World Cup finals? A little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "",
      "15) Bryan Mbeumo – £65m/€75m (Brentford to Manchester United, July 2025)\nIt is a quite significant overpay by some market value standards but ultimately Manchester United believe Mbeumo can help sort out a failing attack after scoring 70 goals and assisting 51 in six seasons at Brentford.",
      "",
      "16) Julian Alvarez – £64m/€75.8m (Manchester City to Atletico Madrid, August 2024)\nThe fee could rise to £80m but eyebrows were raised when Manchester City squeezed quite so much out of Atletico, even for a world champion with 54 goal contributions and six trophies in 103 appearances. A 29-goal debut season in Spain made it seem more as though the Premier League side had been fleeced.",
      "",
      "17) James Rodriguez – £63m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nA proper throwback transfer pretty much solely down to Rodriguez starring at the World Cup, the Colombian won a fair few trinkets at the Bernabeu but never came close to settling or justifying that fee.",
      "",
      "18) Matheus Cunha – £62.5m/€74.2m (Wolves to Man Utd, June 2025)\nIn a welcome sign they are returning to a formerly successful transfer policy, Manchester United chucked a whole load of money at a team below them in the Premier League’s bottom half by virtue of goal difference alone.",
      "",
      "19) Kai Havertz – £62m/€71.7m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nMikel Arteta saw enough in those three mixed years at Stamford Bridge to deem Havertz crucial to his Arsenal process. Almost no-one else thought it was a signing worth making but the vision has become clearer over time, particularly so in the German’s injury-enforced absence.",
      "",
      "20) Mykhaylo Mudryk – £62m/€70m (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, January 2023)\nThe biggest possible fee is the one most often quoted but Chelsea would be absolutely delighted if they end up paying the full £88.5m/€100m for Mudryk, who is embroiled in a drugs test fiasco.",

      "This is the summer of the intra-Premier League transfer but Alexander Isak and others considering future employers closer to home have some way to go to reach this list.",
      "",
      "27) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "26) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "25) Noni Madueke – £48.5m rising to £52m (Chelsea to Arsenal, July 2025)\nA section of the most ‘entitled’ fanbase in the world ought to have been ashamed at how they rallied against Arsenal’s latest signing of a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "While neither the striker Arsenal need nor the Rodrygo-level wide forward they wanted, Madueke will provide the sort of attacking cover which was painfully lacking in their latest failed title charge.",
      "",
      "24) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "23) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "22) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "21) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "20) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "19) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",
      "",
      "18) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "17) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "16) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",
      "",
      "15) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "14) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "13) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "12) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "11) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "9) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – £65m rising to £71m (Brentford to Manchester United, July 2025)\nIn a landmark summer for Premier League clubs overpaying for overperforming forwards within the division, Mbeumo was always likely to lead the pack after six excellent seasons with Brentford culminated in a 20-goal campaign.",
      "Newcastle withdrawing from the race when the Frenchman made his preference to move to Old Trafford clear should theoretically have made a deal easier and perhaps less expensive to strike. But no.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "Tottenham have reportedly ‘begun talks’ with the agents of a star midfielder, after they also held direct contact to discuss a move for Manchester City star Jack Grealish.",
      "A new report has revealed the ‘most realistic solution’ for Manchester City and England star Jack Grealish amid interest from Premier League rivals.",
      "Jack Grealish looks destined to leave Man City this summer but a £300k-a-week wage has made it hard for clubs to take the risk.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League."

Age, performance level and experience are inevitably taken into account but the number of interested teams, general market trends and the reputation and status of the leagues the selling and buying clubs belong to can also heavily dictate that that market value.",

      "But those six Premier League overpays, made by four of the Big Six plus Newcastle, do beg the question as to who has been most royally screwed.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United)",
      "Fee: £65m rising to £71m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £47.7m",
      "It is little wonder an ‘angry’ Manchester United ‘slammed’ Brentford once the deal to sign Mbeumo was finally completed 44 days after their opening bid.",
      "That came in at around £45m plus £10m in add-ons, which the Bees were never going to accept but a testing of the waters was entirely necessary.",
      "Once a second offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons was rejected Ruben Amorim’s side had a choice to make: begrudgingly accept that various taxes from a Manchester United one to a general Premier League levy was going to be applied; or walk away from a deal for their priority target who they had already invested a large amount of the transfer window on pursuing.",
      "There was at one stage an insistence that Manchester United would not be held to ransom but they excel at few things more than baulking at a fee while paying it.",
      "This is their new transfer policy and it costs a pretty penny.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m rising to £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",
      "As the most recent scorer of a Champions League knockout stage goal for Manchester United, Elanga even brings a degree of experience to a stage Newcastle are still adjusting to.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Spurs)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £39m",
      "There is always a quirk in the system and the idea Spurs overpaid for Kudus seems curious.",
      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",
      "Thomas Frank pinpointed Kudus as his main transfer target because of the “unpredictability” the Ghanaian can provide in attack at “almost the perfect age to perform and hit the next level”.",
      "While moving a player with those characteristics across enemy lines was always going to require some intricate negotiations, Spurs pushed it through at a price both parties could sell as a win.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal)",
      "Fee: £48.5m rising to £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £34.7m",
      "If you listen to Arsenal supporters, which is medically inadvisable at the best of times, the Madueke signing is not only an egregious use of club funds but an act so deeply objectionable as to prompt petitions, protests and defaced murals.",
      "That the line for those deeply ‘entitled’ fans is drawn at their favourite football club making what they deem to be an underwhelming signing, rather than the shameful handling of the Thomas Partey debacle, is a cripplingly damning indictment on the modern world.",
      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United)",
      "Fee: £62.5m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £52m",
      "The spotlight which comes with a move to Manchester United cannot have surprised Cunha but being scapegoated by Newcastle for their lack of signings and blamed by Sporting for their valuation of Viktor Gyokeres seemed curious.",
      "It is unknown precisely how far Manchester United would have gone in the bidding if Cunha wasn’t accompanied by a release clause which specified his price tag – or indeed if they would have targeted him at all without one.",
      "A multi-functional 26-year-old Brazilian international forward with 42 goal contributions in 82 Premier League appearances does, after all, come with a premium.",
      "And if all else fails, Manchester United will simply continue Cunha’s career trend of being sold for £18m profit every two years.",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea)",
      "Fee: £55m rising to £60m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £43.3m",
      "From the competition Chelsea faced for Pedro to the remuneration Brighton were due for their work in developing a former club-record £30m signing, the Brazilian was always going to cost a pretty penny.",
      "Throw into the equation the fees Chelsea consistently pay for forwards in particular – and what is effectively the antithesis of a discount at their favourite shop as Brighton are still making them pay for the Moises Caicedo mess – and it could be suggested that the Blues paid over the odds.",
      "But rarely if ever before has a player paid back their fee so quickly and specifically as with Pedro, whose first three Chelsea goals helped win the Club World Cup and earn Enzo Maresca’s side an extra £30m or so.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "A former Arsenal player has backed Noni Madueke to become a starter, while criticising fan reaction and comparing him to Kai Havertz.",
      "According to reports, two key reasons are behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to “really push” Arsenal to sign Noni Madueke from Chelsea for around £52m.",
      "An ex-Arsenal player has questioned Arsenal’s move for Noni Madueke and hints it could signal a deeper issue involving Bukayo Saka’s future.",
      "Leandro Trossard has indicated to Arsenal that he wants to leave this summer after the club’s transfer flurry in recent days, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Premier League giants Arsenal will complete their next summer signing ‘today’ as they close in on four deals."

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Sporting CP have “offered” Viktor Gyokeres to Man Utd again as there is “still no breakthrough” in talks with Arsenal.",
      "The Red Devils are looking to sign new striker this summer after Ruben Amorim’s side could only finish 15th in the Premier League in a disastrous season.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee taking a lot of criticism for their lack of contributions.",
      "Hojlund and Zirkzee scored just seven Premier League goals between them and one of them is likely to be sold or loaned out in the summer transfer window.",
      "Gyokeres is one player Man Utd have had their eye on with The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealing on Tuesday morning that the Red Devils recently enquired about the Sweden international.",
      "And now Romano has claimed that “intermediaries and agents close to Sporting” had again “offered” Gyokeres to Man Utd as the Portuguese club look to get their valuation for the player.",
      "READ: Gyokeres above Sesko in Amorim ranking of top ten Man Utd striker targets",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Something else to tell you on Gyokeres. You remember last week we had a story coming from Portugal on Manchester United potential hijack. The player is showing strong commitment to Arsenal.",
      "“Well, what I wanted to tell you is that in the last 24 hours, let me say especially in the recent hours, overnight, the night between Monday and Tuesday, intermediaries and agents close to Sporting offered again to Manchester United the opportunity to enter in the deal and try to hijack the move.",
      "“So what they did in this kind of case is to tell Man Utd something like: ‘If you want, Arsenal are offering this, but they’ve not closed the deal yet, so if you want you can still enter, at the original agreement with Sporting’.",
      "“So Man Utd have been offered again the opportunity, as well as Saudi clubs, to hijack the original agreement with Sporting, so this happened once again.",
      "“But it’s also very important to say that in the same moment the message from Viktor Gyokeres and his agent to Arsenal has been very clear: ‘I only want to go to Arsenal’.",
      "“The same message also sent to Sporting because Sporting have informed the player of this opportunity. The message Man Utd and Saudi clubs are also receiving is ‘Arsenal’.",
      "“So let’s see what is going to happen there because Arsenal and Sporting keep negotiating on these famous add-ons, keep negotiating on details of the deal. On Monday around lunchtime afternoon, they had new contacts, trying to advance on the structure of these. So continuing in negotiations, still no breakthrough. So Sporting did this move overnight.”",
      "While selling clubs prepare a wedge of Man Utd tax to put on their strikers, we’ve entered the mind of Ruben Amorim to rank their top ten targets.",
      "Arsenal could make a ‘sudden switch’ from interest in Sporting CP’s Viktor Gyokeres to Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak, according to reports.",
      "Sporting CP have turned to Man Utd over a deal for Viktor Gyokeres after Arsenal have gone slightly cold on the deal, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are mucking about over minor details of the most final-piece-in-the-puzzle signing imaginable as the clock ticks louder and louder.",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the truth over Viktor Gyokeres’ future after claims Man Utd are ahead of Arsenal for the signing."

      "We realise this is a hackneyed point, but he doesn’t look like he’s physically up to the rigours of the English top flight and Amorim really needs a striker who’s going to bully defenders rather than shy away from a battle as Nkunku often seems to do.

      "9) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nWe did our best to get Jackson higher up this list and there are few things we would enjoy more than him proving 99 per cent of punters wrong by thriving as a first-choice striker at a big club.",
      "But having defended him for much of the last two seasons, after the performances of Liam Delap and particularly Joao Pedro at the Club World Cup played a significant part in driving Chelsea to that trophy and in the minds of some makes the Blues contenders of sorts for the coming season, we now accept that the very highest level is likely too high for the Senegal striker.",
      "Chelsea would not be a concern for Liverpool and the other title chasers if Jackson was still the starting No.9.",
      "He would massively improve United, but then yer da would, and Amorim will want a striker for the long-term who has a decent chance of becoming world class if they’re not already, and we’ve probably now seen enough of Jackson to know that’s highly unlikely to happen in his case.",
      "",
      "8) Moise Kean (Fiorentina)\nWhile we’re bang up for United being entirely duped by Kean’s 25-goal season and for him to be as disappointing for them as he was for Everton, we actually think he could be really good.",
      "It seems as though the required click to get him into gear after a string of false starts at some very big football clubs happened last season. His first move to the Premier League just came too early and while we wouldn’t advise him to move to Old Trafford as it’s absolutely not the place to move to after a first truly successful goalscoring season, it feels like a smart move for United to tap into potential that’s only just starting to be realised.",
      "",
      "7) Goncalo Ramos (PSG)\nAmorim would snap your hand off for his PSG goal rate of one every 111 minutes and he’s got the sort of profile he’s after – big, strong, runs in behind, links the play well.",
      "The worry will be whether Ramos is capable of replicating that rate as a starting No.9 and while he got close for Benfica in his last season before moving to the Ligue 1 giants, that’s unlikely to ease concerns as that’s Benfica and this is Manchester United.",
      "But the ship has sailed for anti-Big Five European league banalities, United aren’t about to sign a 24-year-old striker who’s scored 20 goals in the Bundesliga or La Liga, because a) there about three of them, and b) they already play for far superior clubs than Manchester United.",
      "",
      "6) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nWe’re all imagining another Casemiro situation where United chase one of these younger strikers for the next few weeks, turn to Watkins as a safe but calloused pair of ageing hands on deadline day and pay roughly £20m over his valuation to ensure they don’t have Rasmus Hojlund leading the line next season.",
      "We’ll all be told by United-leaning pundits and publications that this is actually exactly what United need as Watkins can lead the line and provide Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee breathing space to develop as backups, only for Watkins’ dramatic decline in the space of a season to necessitate one or other of the alternatives to take the reins and prove beyond doubt what we know already – that they’re not good enough for what Manchester United want to be either.",
      "But – and this is a big BUT – Watkins will almost certainly be pretty good for a while, and Amorim may well be thinking about the short-term in regards to his own future at the club. And if he’s not, he should be.",
      "",
      "5) Samu Aghehowa (Porto)\nHe came very close to moving to Chelsea in a sort of swap deal for Conor Gallagher last summer but backed away from talks over an image rights disagreement, instead moving to Porto from Atlético Madrid before scoring 27 goals for the Portuguese side last term.",
      "Aghehowa may be the biggest risk of any striker on this list but also has arguably the highest ceiling.",
      "",
      "4) Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nMateta is far closer to Watkins than Aghehowa in the you-know-what-you’re-gonna-get stakes. He’s a striker whose Premier League career can be split down the middle – it’s astonishing to think he was lumped in with Odsonne Edouard as a pair of interchangeable Crystal Palace strikers before Oliver Glasner arrived to not only reignite his career but take it to another level.",
      "He’s scored 30 goals in 59 games under Glasner, including 13 against the Big Six plus Newcastle and Aston Villa, and we’re guessing him being so good under one coach compared to others may concern Amorim. But if he’s good enough for Liverpool he’s absolutely good enough for United.",
      "",
      "3) Randal Kolo Muani (PSG)\nWe’re guessing most of you wonderful F365 readers are similar to us in that your opinions on Kolo Muani are largely based on his displays for France, particularly him coming on in the World Cup final to entirely change the game against Argentina, in which case you would see this as quite the coup for Manchester United.",
      "He earned a move to PSG on the back of that tournament but barely played, making his six-month loan at Juventus arguably a better barometer for success at Old Trafford along with those displays for his national team. He scored ten goals for the Old Lady, who would be signing him permanently if they had the cash.",
      "",
      "2) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nA striker signing for a Big Six club without European football hasn’t gone well historically, but that’s more something for Sesko to think about than Manchester United, who could provide us with the dream scenario of Arsenal’s top target banging in goals at Old Trafford while the Red Devils’ preferred option flops at the Emirates.",
      "",
      "1) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting)\nWe’ve been treated to some intermediary sh*thousery in the last couple of days, with several Portuguese outlets informed of United coming back in for Gyokeres, which appears to be news to United, Gyokeres, Sporting and anyone else involved in his future, just to give Arsenal the willies.",
      "Like the lead in a coming-of-age high school drama imploring a love interest to ‘want me for being me’, Amorim said back in April that he would only want to sign Gyokeres if he wanted to join Manchester United for Manchester United, independent of Champions League football.",
      "Our guess is that Amorim would actually welcome a kicking and screaming Gyokeres through the Old Trafford doors in the knowledge that the Sweden international is absolutely ideal for his 3-4-3 system having thrived under him at Sporting, and Gyokeres would surely have to put a brave face on things anyway and insist that his father save further tears over a failed Arsenal move for private settings.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly now moving to seal their next two signings this summer after getting a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Sporting CP have “offered” Viktor Gyokeres to Man Utd again as there is “still no breakthrough” in talks with Arsenal.",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed the three strikers Man Utd have held ‘talks’ about after also enquiring over Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Arsenal could make a ‘sudden switch’ from interest in Sporting CP’s Viktor Gyokeres to Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak, according to reports.",
      "Sporting CP have turned to Man Utd over a deal for Viktor Gyokeres after Arsenal have gone slightly cold on the deal, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are mucking about over minor details of the most final-piece-in-the-puzzle signing imaginable as the clock ticks louder and louder."

      "READ: Arsenal face four-word question over Gyokeres as clown car Man Utd circle and Liverpool move quickly",
      "With details on their pursuit of a striker, Ornstein adds: ‘United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "‘Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.’",
      "Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg also brought a similar update minutes after Ornstein with the German giving details of all of Man Utd’s striker targets.",
      "Plettenberg wrote on X: ‘As reported last week, Manchester United were trying to get a chance in the race for Hugo #Ekitike, but Ekitike was already clear at that stage that he wanted Liverpool. Medical today if all goes to plan.",
      "‘Manchester United are still looking for a number 9.

There is still a big chance that Benjamin #Sesko stays at RB Leipzig. #MUFC.’",

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, and they are on course to do so…",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Bayer Leverkusen – £88m\nArmed with money from Liverpool for Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, new coach Erik ten Hag has been busy, with US international Malik Tillman coming in for a club-record fee.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Atletico Madrid – £92.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada and Matteo Ruggeri have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again.",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal – £123.7m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Including two Manchester United outcasts and several Arsenal targets, these are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "And here are the best available strikers. And attacking midfielders.",
      "10) Antony (Manchester United)\nThe Red Devils have managed to offload Marcus Rashford, who drops out of this ranking after agreeing a move to Barcelona. United-bound Bryan Mbeumo has also been removed after Brentford accepted a bid last week.",
      "Tenth place came down to a toss-up between United forwards Antony and Jadon Sancho. The latter was uninspiring during his loan at Chelsea across the 2024/25 campaign, while Antony impressed during a more productive stint at Real Betis. The Spanish club want him permanently, and the Brazilian is keen on the move. They’re a great fit.",
      "",
      "9) Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)\nThe second of United’s wide men on the chopping block, Garnacho is reportedly valued at a staggering £60million — a figure that feels wildly inflated for a player who underperformed last season. But at just 21 years old, he still holds plenty of promise.",
      "Garnacho wasn’t alone in struggling at Old Trafford; very few besides Bruno Fernandes stood out. But unless Sir Jim Ratcliffe lowers his valuation, United might be forced to keep or loan him out, risking a repeat of this summer’s dilemma in 2026.",
      "",
      "8) Maghnes Akliouche (AS Monaco)\nThe 23-year-old had a solid campaign with Monaco, regiestering five goals and 10 assists in Ligue 1. He’s earned six caps for France, which is no small feat, and was recently linked with a move to Arsenal. That interest seems to have cooled after the Gunners picked up Noni Madueke.",
      "Still, Akliouche is available…for a steep £70million. He’s not cheap, but he’s fantastic.",
      "",
      "7) Heung-min Son (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThe South Korea and Spurs captain endured a difficult 2024/25 campaign but still ended up with 11 goals and 12 assists in 46 matches, including 17 goal involvements in 30 Premier League appearances. Those numbers mask what was a disappointing season overall, with it increasingly clear that Son is in sharp decline.",
      "That being said, it could simply have been an off year, and there’s a growing willingness at Spurs to part ways with one of their greatest-ever players. His respectable output last season, combined with elite numbers in years gone by, makes Son an intriguing potential target for clubs abroad.",
      "",
      "6) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Tyler Dibling, while Gabriel Martinelli’s availability is up for debate (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed have been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was so exciting to watch at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "5) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale — meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is underwhelming. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "4) Malick Fofana (Lyon)\nLyon might be safe from relegation, but they’re still resigned to losing Belgian winger Fofana this summer. Saying that, there’s no immediate rush on Fofana’s part to leave.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a bid accepted and sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United for £55million, but Fofana wants Champions League football. Chelsea are an option but have already signed Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro.",
      "What is clear is that, at just 20 years old, he is one of the most intriguing prospects on the market this summer.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nWilliams has signed a new long-term contract at Bilbao, but the release clause still exists. Oh, and by ‘long-term’, we mean 10 f***ing years.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out — they’ve welcomed Gittens, Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer — but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How did they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight?",
      "With Grealish likely off and Jeremy Doku not fully convincing, Man City could come calling too. Liverpool would also make sense if they sell Bayern Munich target Luis Diaz.",
      "Leao’s performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act. Even after signing Madueke from Chelsea, we shouldn’t rule the Gunners out.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, is expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club — and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",

      "Liverpool and Arsenal are keeping close tabs on Rodrygo, with Fabrizio Romano sharing a fresh update on the Real Madrid star’s future.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa know they could cut out the negotiating middle man for many of their targets, who happen to come with tempting release clauses.",
      "Arsenal could deal a double transfer blow to Liverpool as they look to get serious over a potential deal for Real Madrid star Rodrygo, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal have walked away from deals to sign Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Bayern Munich defensive midfielder Joao Palhinha, according to reports.",

      "Textbook Keysey. We love the way he almost makes it sound like a threat with the sheer melodrama of ‘they’ll regret it for ever’. And the binary certainty of Arsenal’s only two possible outcomes – signing Gyokeres and winning the league or not signing Gyokeres and finishing second – is classic Keysey.",
      "Even second doesn’t exactly look nailed on, does it? In the ‘regret it for ever’ scenario? Fantastic that nothing happening at Chelsea or Man City is allowed to enter the tunnel-vision certainty of Keysey Making A Point.",
      "Anyway, having self-indulgently dispatched the wily fish hiding in that particular tweet barrel, let us remember and acknowledge that there really is a very solid point behind all that nonsense.",
      "What, in fact, are Arsenal doing?",
      "We like to think we’re ever so slightly more allowing of subtlety and nuance here, and will allow all manner of caveats about how we obviously know nothing of the behind-the-scenes difficulties that exist in the minutiae of any transfer.",
      "But come on. This is just fannying for fannying’s sake now, surely? This is a transfer that Arsenal can obviously afford, for the most final-piece-in-the-puzzle signing imaginable at any Premier League club, a transfer for which the player himself is overwhelmingly keen and to which now the only major obstacles appear to be Arsenal themselves and clown-car banter club Man United still hanging around and honking their horn as the bumper falls off the car, which despite being small is able to seat an unimaginably large collection of unwanted yet seemingly unsellable bomb squad players.",
      "Clearly, chucking unnecessary money at a transfer is not necessarily wise or the best course. But there also must come a time when stubbornly continuing to argue and haggle over the structure of a few million pounds in payments becomes self-defeating. Even if you get the deal at the price/structure/whatever you initially wanted, is it still the best deal if that player – one so obviously vital to Arsenal’s whole season plan – doesn’t arrive until deep into pre-season?",
      "The campaign is now less than a month away. It is already reason enough to stop counting every penny in a transfer of this importance.",
      "Unlike Keysey we cannot be certain that Gyokeres will prove to be the silver bullet Arsenal have been searching for. There are no certainties in the transfer game, and Gyokeres is undeniably costly for a player unproven in Europe’s top leagues.",
      "But there are more reasons to suppose he is precisely what Arsenal require. Precisely what Arsenal have required for years now. And there can be no suggestion Arsenal haven’t done due diligence. Whatever else Arsenal’s pursuit of that long-awaited and obviously-needed striker could be accused of being, let nobody accuse them of being rushed or hasty.",
      "Comparing one transfer to another is another risky business, because no two deals are the same, but it’s impossible not to notice the alacrity with which Liverpool have moved on to and apparently secured the signing of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt in their own release-clause-adjacent striker pursuit.",
      "Yes, it’s unfair to compare the two very different deals. And we’re not saying Arsenal should have gone for Ekitike either, especially with the Emirates being surely the most unforgiving place a Temu Thierry Henry could attempt to succeed.",
      "But that doesn’t mean it isn’t adding to the frustration for Arsenal fans. They were already playing catch-up and watching Liverpool address what is for them a secondary issue while Arsenal are still doing some sums on their most important bit of business since signing Declan Rice cannot be helping.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Sporting CP have “offered” Viktor Gyokeres to Man Utd again as there is “still no breakthrough” in talks with Arsenal.",
      "While selling clubs prepare a wedge of Man Utd tax to put on their strikers, we’ve entered the mind of Ruben Amorim to rank their top ten targets.",
      "Arsenal could make a ‘sudden switch’ from interest in Sporting CP’s Viktor Gyokeres to Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak, according to reports.",
      "Sporting CP have turned to Man Utd over a deal for Viktor Gyokeres after Arsenal have gone slightly cold on the deal, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success.",

      "The Man Utd forward is expected to undergo a medical and train with his new team-mates this week, yet question marks remain over when, or if, Barcelona will be able to register him.",
      "Rashford’s move is the latest headline in a chaotic summer at Camp Nou. The deal itself is understood to be a 12-month loan with a £26 million option to buy, with Barcelona covering 100 per cent of his reduced wage.",
      "Rashford is desperate to revive his career after falling out of favour at Old Trafford. The academy graduate spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, where he managed four goals and six assists in 17 appearances.",
      "Despite glimpses of form, Utd made it clear he was no longer part of Ruben Amorim’s plans.",
      "In order to make the move possible, Rashford has agreed to a sizeable pay cut. The 27-year-old was earning over £300,000 a week at Old Trafford, but his salary at Barca will reportedly drop to around £8.6 million gross for the season.",

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Cole Palmer – Chelsea to Manchester City\nApparently, Pep Guardiola is ‘determined’ to bring back Palmer at all costs and a £147million offer is on its way to Chelsea. It’s not, though, is it? Next.\n19) Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan are looking into the feasibility of signing Hojlund as they search for a striker and the player’s agent is pushing him back towards Serie A. But United paid Atalanta £72million two years ago and the Rossoneri would struggle to give the Red Devils half of their money back. So this feels like a non-starter.",
      "",
      "18) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nBack here again, are we? Apparently so, according to reports in Portugal. The stories go that United are close to an agreement with Sporting, which sounds very convenient for the Portuguese club, but its is a tactic that has already failed, so we cannot see why they would flog that particular dead horse if there was nothing in it. Gyokeres has made clear his intention to move to Arsenal, but he, like us, must be close to losing hope. If he did go to United now, the Arsenal meltdown would be spectacular.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Conor Gallagher – Atletico Madrid to Tottenham \nThis all sounds very tentative and driven by the players’ representatives seemingly exploring the midfielder’s options should he return to the Premier League amid expectations that he might not get the same playing time this season. Spurs are said to appreciate Gallagher and Newcastle are sniffing too. If anything happens here, it won’t be for a while yet.",
      "",
      "16) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko is back in the 20 after losing out to Gyokeres in Arsenal audition but, apparently, United are ‘serious’ about signing the Slovenian. Maybe they are, and Christ knows they need a striker, but they will have to start selling sharpish if they are to afford what Leipzig are demanding.",

      "15) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "14) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seemed as though Liverpool were taking Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead doused our initial suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak. But it all seemed a bit weird on Saturday when Isak was sent home from Glasgow ‘due to the speculation around him’ and Eddie Howe sounded less convincing that the Swede would remain with Newcastle beyond the end of the window. Maybe this one isn’t done?",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "11) Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags. Man Utd seem to have finally got their mitts on Bryan Mbeumo, which makes it less likely the Bees will entertain interest in Wissa too.",
      "",
      "10) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao but the sales of Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah will allow the Old Lady to sign Sancho too. Agreements are said to be in place with both United and Sancho, who should be thanking his lucky stars even if he’s halving his salary.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nWe all assumed Newcastle would pull their finger out after their initial bid of £27million inclusive of add-ons was rejected last month. Since then, though: nothing. Leaving City to swoop in for the England Under-21 keeper. Reports suggest City are trying to secure a discount on the £40million buy-back clause they hold for their ex-goalkeeper but with the increased noise around Ederson departing, it’s hard to envisage the Citizens allowing Newcastle back into the race.",
      "",
      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement. Lord knows they’ve been discussing it for long enough.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nThis seems to be reaching its inevitable conclusion sooner than we thought. We knew Rashford would go on loan, probably to Barca, but we thoroughly expected United to drag it out. It’s almost to their credit that they haven’t, even if the fact they can’t sell Rashford for actual money is a mess largely of their own making. It seems the only sticking point is how much the buy option would be at the end of a season-long loan. Whatever it becomes, Barca probably can’t afford it. But that isn’t stopping them from covering his entire salary, for which United should be grateful.",
      "",
      "4) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nArsenal have missed Arteta’s deadline for Gyokeres to be on the flight to Singapore and some reports in Portugal suggest the deal could be jeopardy, with add-ons still to be negotiated and solidarity payments to be sorted. Gyokeres’ agents are working their nuts off but they don’t seem to be having much joy. To the contrary: the player’s father is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ while Gyokeres himself is distancing himself from London. We genuinely thought this one was done, but it’s a saga that’s had more fake endings than Lord of the f*cking Rings. For all the good work Arsenal have done this summer, if they screw this up…",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. But with Fabrizio Romano now giving this one the ‘here we go’ treatment it appears only a matter of time before Ekitike joins Liverpool’s big list of summer signings. Certainly, personal terms should pose few problems given the player himself seems unsurprisingly enormously keen.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nThis is done, apparently, with images leaked of the defender in his Arsenal training kit. The paperwork is still being ratified, but the delay between medical and confirmation is a pattern with Arsenal this summer.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nWe have a deal! United have spent weeks haggling, only to pay more than Brentford’s initial asking price. But a medical is set to take place over the weekend before Mbeumo flies off to the United States with his new team-mates. Now for a striker. And some sales."

      "A former Man Utd midfielder has questioned whether the current goalkeeper has the presence needed to lead a side with serious ambitions, while also encouraging the signing of an energetic midfielder.",
      "Gordon Strachan, who also won 50 caps for Scotland, believes Andre Onana is still “at war with himself” and that Man Utd’s midfield lacks the physical profile required at the top level.",
      "“When I’ve been successful anywhere, I’ve had goalkeepers with personality and presence,” he told OLBG. “Whether it’s a physical presence, a personality presence, that is always needed in the team.",
      "“When they walk down the tunnel and they see a goalie in front of them with a physical presence, a personality presence, then you think, thank goodness he’s there.",
      "“The goalkeeper there now, I don’t think he’s got either of them. I don’t think he’s got a physical presence, and I don’t think he’s got this personality presence.",
      "“He looks like he’s constantly at war with himself, worrying about making a mistake, and that he might have to go somewhere else to get that confidence back.”",
      "Strachan compared the situation to when Peter Schmeichel joined the club. “When Peter Schmeichel went to United, it was one of the best things that ever happened to the club. There is a lot of talk about other players, but Schmeichel was huge.”",
      "He also addressed the midfield, where the likes of Casemiro, Eriksen and Bruno Fernandes were regulars last season, and argued that Utd need more than just quality on the ball.",
      "“They don’t need a bit more bite, they need legs—real legs, real closing down,” he said. Conor Gallagher is among the suitable midfielders linked in previous seasons.",
      "“Can Conor Gallagher do that? Yes, he can, he’s definitely got legs, he’s a good teammate.”",
      "Strachan admitted Gallagher may not offer the same creativity as others in the squad, saying, “Gallagher has the legs and energy—but not the Bruno flair,” but said that pairing energy with imagination could be the solution.",
      "“Has he got enough imagination? I don’t know. But if you have people like that with legs in there and have imagination around them, then he’d be a good signing.",
      "“A Christian Eriksen of 10 years ago could have done that in the game that is now as frantic as PSG are now playing with their level of fitness.",
      "“So the days of the luxury player, if you want to be a top side, are gone. Conor Gallagher has definitely got the legs. He’s got the robustness. Has he got goals? Has he got that flair? These players are hard to come by.",

      "“If Man United decide for him to go, Hojlund has to go. Otherwise, if it’s for Hojlund, I’m hearing that the player would be keen on staying at Manchester United and would love to stay at Manchester United.”",

      "Strachan said at the end of May: “There’s a point when you look at a player and think, ‘I really do feel sorry for you’, and that’s how I feel about Rasmus Hojlund at the moment. I went through something similar when I was at Aberdeen – for a year I was absolutely horrendous and it really gets to you, you almost lose your power to run and you feel debilitated.",
      "“There are some clubs in the world like Manchester United where everything is too much for players, and it drains big signings rather than galvanising them. I think Hojlund is in that position right now.",
      "“Do I think a loan move would help him? No – I think what’s best for him as a young man is moving somewhere else permanently. Everything seems to be too much for him and I think he’s in the mindset where he’s letting everyone down, which is a horrible place to be in.",

      "Marcus Rashford has completed a medical at Barcelona ahead of a proposed season-long loan move with an option to buy for £26m; Rashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:36, UK",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams then Liverpool's Luis Diaz but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so do his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "Man Utd have admired Bryan Mbeumo for some time and feel he is a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system; United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday; Brentford are guaranteed £65m in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons; Spurs and Newcastle had showed interest",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:50, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Already linked with Manchester United and West Ham, Parma's Zion Suzuki is one of the great young goalkeeping talents. Adam Bate speaks to those who have worked with the Japan international to find out why clubs are so excited about his potential...",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:19, UK",
      "It seems inevitable that Zion Suzuki will move to the Premier League one day. Already courted by Manchester United and West Ham, it is just a matter of when. The hype is justified. This 22-year-old Japan international is seen as a new breed of goalkeeper.",
      "It is by design. Japan have been throwing resources at football with a specific target in mind. Project 2050. The aim is to win a World Cup by then. Frans Hoek, the legendary goalkeeping coach, has been tasked with identifying the traits of the goalkeeper of the future.",
      "In Suzuki, back when he was sat among the substitutes for Urawa Red Diamonds, Hoek spotted all the ingredients required to do it all. \"I saw him in a camp and said, 'This guy has to go to Europe as soon as possible. It does not matter what league it is. He has to play.'\"",
      "And so, Suzuki embarked on the adventure that has taken him to Belgium with Sint-Truiden, onto Italy with Parma and now linked with some of the richest clubs in Europe. Still only 22, the only question is when to make the leap. Those who know him do not doubt his talent.",
      "\"He is a really quiet guy, a really calm character. That is him off the pitch.\" On the pitch, Suzuki becomes something else entirely. He dominates. \"He is really aggressive because he has massive physical strength.\" He is 6'3\" but looks bigger. \"He is so powerful, so dynamic.\"",
      "That physicality clearly underpins his potential. \"It is like his body is just made of muscles. And I have never seen in my life a goalkeeper who can jump higher. His physical tests were off the charts.\" But it is what this physicality enables him to do that is particularly intriguing.",
      "Rudel enjoys telling the story of one of his first sessions with Suzuki. As the goalkeeper coach, he was setting up a drill. \"I said to him, 'Okay, now show me how far you can throw.' I looked away and then saw this ball flying 20 metres over the halfway line,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I turned around and said to him, 'I told you to throw it not kick it.' He just smiled back at me and replied, 'But I did throw it.' I told him to show me again because I could not believe that someone had that much power in their body that they could throw the ball that far.\"",
      "Rudel rates Suzuki as \"above average\" with his feet but as has been seen with Ederson at Manchester City, the tactical significance of being able to pass short and long has increased. Suzuki ranked third for long passes in Serie A last season and second for throws.",
      "In Belgium, Rudel remembers some stunning saves away to Club Brugge, with one stop in particular becoming his trademark. \"It is those low saves because he is so dynamic and so quick to get down. He has unbelievable reflexes. For me, that is his biggest strength.\"",
      "There have been many examples of that for Parma. One down to his left to keep out Tijjani Reijnders' shot for AC Milan in the San Siro stands out, while the save away to Empoli against Ismael Konate was similar. Denying Como's Marc Kempf a headed goal was even better.",
      "The pick of the lot came against Roma in February when he produced an outrageous double save that defied belief. After keeping out Matias Soule's shot, he somehow scrambled to claw away Anass Salah-Eddine's follow-up. It was the save of the season.",
      "\"With those low power saves, his arms are so strong,\" says Rudel in reference to the technique behind it. \"Sometimes when goalkeepers go down fast and get their fingers to the ball, it still goes backwards. That never happens to him. He has crazy power in his hands.\"",
      "What makes Suzuki so fascinating is that he combines these reflex stops with a commanding presence. Think of the great goalkeepers and they tend to favour one or the other. But Suzuki does more than get down low to make saves, he gets high to snuff out the danger.",
      "He caught 55 crosses for Parma last season, 21 more than his nearest rival in Serie A. Across Europe's five major leagues, only Joan Garcia, snapped up by Barcelona this summer, claimed more crosses. Outside the area, Suzuki ranked second in Serie A for sweeping up.",
      "There are still things to work on, as one might expect of a goalkeeper who is still only 22 years old. He also dropped nine catches - a Serie A high - reflecting the fact that this desire to be proactive comes with risk. But he continues to progress, a theme of his short career.",
      "\"That is another of his strengths and why I am convinced that he can perform in the Premier League,\" says Rudel. \"He went from Japan to Belgium and then Belgium to Italy. Those are big adaptations but he did it really quickly. That is what separates the really good ones.\"",
      "Asked if Suzuki will go to the very top, Rudel has no doubts. \"One hundred per cent.\" The only question is how best to manage the journey. Some advise him to wait and play one more season with Parma. But sooner or later, Zion Suzuki will make a very big move.",

      "After Ruben Amorim's side recorded their worst-scoring Premier League campaign last term with 44 goals, there were little signs of improvement in front of goal despite starting new £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha, who played the first half.",
      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",

      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",

      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team [Wolves]. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",
      "On Diego Leon's debut at left wing-back: \"We have to understand that the kid came from Paraguay. It's his second week at Manchester United. He did really well, he's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.",
      "\"The environment is really good. Of course sometimes we are going to struggle, but what I felt in the first moment is that if we are going to struggle, we will struggle together. That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",
      "\"We need to create that bond between everybody [on the United States tour] - not just between the players butthe staff. All the changes are stopping. We need to leave that as a group.",
      "\"We have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. We need to improve.\"",
      "Manchester United, it's almost like you never left.",
      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",
      "Obi taking the ball off Cunha's toes and Amorim admitting his relationship with Fernandes \"is not there yet\" meant it was a slow start in his new colours.",
      "And Hojlund's display showed more frustration - falling over the ball at one stage in the box and then getting in the way of a late Dorgu strike.",
      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
      "Amad Diallo also looked sharp at wing-back - which is important in the context of Mbeumo coming into the team.",
      "But United need a lot more than the Brentford man to improve this attacking set-up. There's still a need for a new striker, plus more clarity in midfield and out wide.",
      "There's now less than a month to go until United's Premier League opener with Arsenal. An awful lot still needs to change on the pitch if Amorim's project is going to take off.",
      "Leeds manager Daniel Farke has announced that Patrick Bamford is no longer in his plans for next season.",
      "Farke said on Bamford's future: \"I had an honest communication with him.",
      "\"For me, at this stage he needs to be the main man, he needs the backing, the arm around the shoulder after difficult years to rebuild his confidence.",
      "\"After the last two seasons, I wasn't willing to take him on right now as the main man in the Premier League.\"",
