      "Newcastle have lodged an improved bid for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko with their latest offer hitting the £70million mark. The German side had rejected their opening bid, which included add-ons.",
      "The Magpies have identified the Slovenian as their top target in attack with Sesko likely being the replacement for Alexander Isak, who is pushing for a move to Liverpool. Newcastle know that Manchester United too are keen on the Leipzig frontman, but are yet to bid.",
      "It puts Eddie Howe's side in pole position currently to land the striker, who has reportedly told his team-mates in Germany that he will be moving on this summer. Whilst United are interested it is thought that currently they would not pay as much as Newcastle - it comes as United have been slammed for missing out on an Arsenal star after Bruno Fernandes let rip at his team-mates.",
      "Positive talks have been held between Newcastle co-owner Jamie Reuben, Leipzig and the 22-year-old striker, as first reported by the Athletic. Sesko is understood to be open to both projects but Leipzig are adamant that they will not sell until their valuation is met.",
      "The Slovenian is among the brightest young forwards in Europe and the Bundesliga outfit want to ensure they get a fee that reflects that. Leipzig are without Champions League football this term but will not sell their top players on the cheap with some of their other leading lights attracting attention.",
      "Newcastle recently turned down an opening offer of £110m from Liverpool for Isak, who did not feature on the club's recent pre-season tour, citing an injury issue. He was later seen training at former club Real Sociedad.",
      "Isak has now been at St James' Park for three years and has continued to blossom since making a club-record move. He is now among Europe's top strikers but is haggling for a move elsewhere. It is the first time in the Saudi-era at Newcastle that a major name has expressed a desire to push for the exit door, leaving the club with a decision to make.",
      "They value Isak at £150m and are likely to hold out for close to that figure. The Swede has years to run on his contract, meaning Newcastle are not under pressure to sell. They also want to know that they've got a top quality replacement through the door before they consider selling.",
      "Sesko's contract with Leipzig runs through to 2029, but his deal is thought to include a gentleman’s agreement allowing him to leave. He has recorded 39 goals and eight assists in 87 appearances for the German club since moving from RB Salzburg in 2023.",

      "Manchester United have been slammed for not making more astute signings this summer in their bid to turnaround their fortunes under Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League last term and are hoping for a much-improved campaign in 2025/26.",
      "United have already spent in the region of £130million to land Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while Diego Leon arrived this summer after a deal was agreed for the full-back earlier in the year. Former Celtic and Arsenal forward Charlie Nicolas has been left aghast that the team have not tried to work smarter in the transfer window and reckons they should have been in the race for Arsenal signing Christian Norgaard.",
      "Amorim's captain Bruno Fernandes has called on the club's hierarchy to make more signings as the new season approaches. The Portugal star believes more reinforcements are required.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up,\" said Fernandes. \"I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "Nicholas reckons United have missed out on a good opportunity in the form of Norgaard, and have been caught sleeping in regard to Aaron Ramsdale too.",
      "\"There are a lot of players out there, a whole list who I think would be better than what Manchester United currently have,’ Nicolas told Sky Bet. \"I just don’t know where they see themselves going. If I was Manchester United, why didn’t they go in for Christian Norgaard?",
      "\"It looks as if they’ve waited for two high-profile players, but I look at them and I think, why are not adding more players like Norgaard, or players who have played well at Bournemouth and Newcastle – you could disrupt things and see who’s interested.",
      "\"There are so many pillars I just can’t understand – the whole lack of authority defensively and what is the current situation with the goalkeeper?",
      "\"Why don’t they go and get Aaron Ramsdale? He’s qualified, he knows the circuit, he’s English, experienced, and competitive. I know Ramsdale hasn’t won too much, but it’s not far off what United have won.",
      "\"I just don’t see how they see what an upgrade means. I don’t see Manchester United fans showing one bit of excitement as it stands right now, and it’s getting close for them to get aggressive towards the club again.\"",

      "Manchester United have received a boost in their pursuit of Benjamin Sesko after it emerged that the striker's RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda will not be making the move to Sunderland.",
      "United and Newcastle are both interested in signing Sesko, who netted 21 goals in 45 games across all competitions last season. Fellow Leipzig striker Openda had been heavily linked with Sunderland and it is unlikely they would have let two forwards leave in the same window.",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has said the club need to add \"more quality\" in the transfer market this summer.",
      "\"It's improving, but it's not where we want it to be,\" Fernandes said after United drew 2-2 with Everton in pre-season. \"It's a game of football, there's always passion there. Whatever happens, happens. There was nothing spicy there, it's normal, it is part of the game. It's been positive [the US tour] and it's good to create a bond with the players.",

There is no doubt that this football club has a history of making an absolute fortune on transfers and this guy could be the next one to come into the Premier League.",

      "But the Bundesliga club have firmly rejected Newcastle's initial offer of €75 million plus a €5 million bonus, demanding a guaranteed €80 million up front, while Manchester United remain hopeful of usurping the Toon by bringing the Slovenia star to Old Trafford instead.",
      "Sesko was not in Leipzig's matchday squad for their friendly against Serie A side Atalanta on Saturday afternoon with the much coveted striker kept out amid the tug of war between the Premier League giants.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, are in a separate dispute with their current top marksman Alexander Isak looking to pursue a new challenge. Liverpool remain the frontrunner to sign the Sweden international but his asking price remains an issue.",
      "It is unclear how interlinked Isak's future is with their move for Sesko with manager Eddie Howe previously stating his desire to have two high-class options for every position.",
      "United made their first approach for the Slovenian star last week, through intermediaries, who opened up dialogue over a potential deal. Those talks have progressed and will be stepped up this week, once United have returned home from their three-game tour of the US.",
      "Although United are looking to offload several players before the summer transfer window closes, they have scope to sign a striker without selling. Marcus Rashford's season-long loan move to Barcelona cleared £12m off their annual wage bill, with the La Liga club covering his entire salary.",
      "United also raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses including Anthony Elanga’s switch to Newcastle, moves for Alvaro Fernandez and Maxi Oyedele, and the £5m paid by Chelsea to pull out of their deal to sign Jadon Sancho.",
      "In addition, United's failure to qualify for Europe this season – for only the second time in 35 years - means they are not bound by UEFA'S limit of spending no more than 70 per cent of annual income on transfers and wages.",
      "The structure of the deals for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who cost a combined £133.5m, with payments spread over instalments, has given United greater freedom to spend.",

      "The Magpies, who are preparing for a Champions League campaign, currently have limited options up front. First-choice striker Alexander Isak has been the subject of a rejected bid worth up to £120million from Liverpool, while the expiry of Callum Wilson’s contract leaves prospect William Osula as the club’s only other recognised centre-forward.",
      "Newcastle have also been linked with a move for Brentford star Yoane Wissa, who scored 19 league goals last term. However, the club are determined not to allow their pursuit of Leipzig forward Sesko to emulate Manchester United’s earlier transfer strategy.",
      "talkSPORT have reported that Newcastle have informed Leipzig of their desire for clarity in terms of Sesko's next steps by Wednesday. It is said that the club are confident of reaching an agreement with the German side.",
      "Leipzig are thought to value the 22-year-old striker at around £70million. Sesko is also a target for Man United and had been on Arsenal's radar prior to the Gunners signing Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "However, the report also claimed that Newcastle feel they must have a clear idea of Sesko’s intentions before the latter half of the week. It is said that Leipzig have yet to receive any formal offers for Sesko, despite recent reports.",
      "Newcastle’s unwillingness to find themselves in a transfer saga is contrary to Man United’s approach to signing Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Despite the club’s public interest in Mbeumo, Man United had several offers turned down before the striker finally arrived at Old Trafford in a deal worth up to £71m. Newcastle wish to avoid replicating a similar scenario with Sesko.",
      "The Isak situation provides Newcastle with extra motivation to accelerate negotiations for Sesko and any other transfer targets. Aside from potentially losing a star player, Howe will want to ensure any new recruits have time to settle before the start of an important season for the club.",
      "When asked if he thought Isak would report back to the club as the squad prepared to return from their pre-season tour of Asia, Newcastle boss Howe said: \"Of course I'd like him to be (there), but whether he will I don’t know at this moment in time. We have been here with the time difference, preparing for training and for games. Other people have been dealing with that situation back at home.\"",
      "Isak scored 27 goals across all competitions as Newcastle finally ended their long wait for silverware by winning the Carabao Cup and secured a Champions League spot by finishing fifth in the Premier League. He was brought by Newcastle in for around £63m in August 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko scored 21 goals in 45 games for Leipzig, including four goals in the Champions League. The centre-forward is one of the most sought-after strikers in European football, having thrived during his spells in Austria and Germany.",
      "Newcastle have welcomed winger Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for £55m and secured a loan move for goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale so far this summer. In terms of outgoings, the club have recouped some money through the sales of Lloyd Kelly and Sean Longstaff to Juventus and Leeds United, respectively.",

Rashford made his debut for the club in a 3-1 win over Vissel Kobe, where he suffered what is widely considered to be the biggest humiliation in football.",
      "The 27-year-old came off the bench at half-time and featured for 30 minutes before he was substituted himself.

      "Manchester United are hoping for a clean slate this season after their disastrous 2024-25 campaign and it's been a case of so far, so good as far as this pre-season is concerned.",
      "Ruben Amorim has taken his players for a tour of the United States and they are yet to lose a game in pre-season, though the coach will primarily be focusing on the squad's fitness levels and how they are adapting to his tactics.",
      "United have wrapped up the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for big money fees and both players started against Everton on Sunday, though after a 2-2 draw it showed Amorim still has work to do on the best way to accommodate his new stars.",
      "The performance was probably United's worst of pre-season so far but Amorim's side certainly have shown signs of improvement since last season and they still have another friendly to come against Fiorentina before their huge Premier League opener against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "What United need from their captain is to be blunt and tell it like it is and that's exactly what they've got from Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The Portugal star was at risk of leaving after an approach from Saudi club Al-Hilal and fans will be grateful he decided to stay put - because he is exactly the kind of figure this team needs to get back to the level they desire.",
      "Even after a friendly game, Fernandes showed he wasn't happy with the performance and accused his team-mates of being \"lazy\" during the game - even though United ended up winning the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United twice relinquished the lead after Fernandes himself scored from the penalty spot before Mason Mount put the team back ahead in the second half - with Iliman Ndiaye and an Ayden Heaven goal pegging them back.",

      "\"It’s been positive [the US tour] and it’s good to create a bond with the players. We looked a bit lazy today and we need to change that.\"",
      "Fernandes' bold and brutal comments will stand United in good stead for the season to come as it shows he won't stand for any more sloppiness for the team - something they cannot afford if they want to push on as a club.",
      "United only have two new signings so far and most supporters will tell you they needed arrivals from across the board given their woeful season. Despite being unbeaten in pre-season, it's been obvious this summer that United are crying out for more depth.",
      "Starting from the back of the team, it's clear United are lacking a new goalkeeper given Andre Onana's injury and question marks over his back-up Altay Bayindir, who is thought to want more regular game time.",
      "Onana has also come under fire for some high profile errors and United could really do with more competition in between the sticks, while the team could also do with more depth in defence and midfield - not to mention up front after the clear struggles in attack last season.",
      "Fernandes spoke about the need for more signings in his rant after the Everton game and said the team were crying out for more competition to help the players up their game.",
      "\"I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about,\" he said. \"I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko is just one of the players United are interested in and they have already opened talks with Red Bull Leipzig over his signature - but face stiff competition from Newcastle, who can offer him Champions League football.",
      "United lined up with Mbeumo and Cunha in attack against Everton as Amorim took a tactical gamble by playing a 3-4-1-2 formation, but neither player is an out-and-out centre-forward and prefer being out wide.",
      "The team will be deadly if they can get Mbeumo and Cunha either side of a clinical finisher like Sesko, who fired in 21 goals in all competitions last season and 18 in the season before. He is currently rated at £70m.",
      "United still have Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee at their disposal, but the later is currently injured and the former still has a long way to go in showing he is dependable.",
      "Hojlund did score in the 4-1 friendly win over Bournemouth and the fact he has been included in United's travelling group in the United States - and not left behind with \"the bomb squad\" of unwanted players - shows Amorim still has faith in him.",
      "Recent reports have claimed that Amorim believes the arrival of a top class striker like Sesko will bring out the best in Hojlund and force him to take his game to the next level.",
      "Having the two players in the team - alongside Mbeumo and Cunha and existing talent like Amad - can give United a new layer of firepower this season and that might be the difference to push the team up the table.",
      "Amorim has shown that once he falls out with a player, it is difficult to find a way back and it appears the ship has sailed with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho wasn't happy with his manager after he dropped him for the Europa League final and immediately suggested he wanted out of United - with the player subsequently left out of the club's pre-season tour.",
      "He has been strongly linked with a move to Aston Villa or Chelsea in this window and with a move yet to come to fruition, Amorim suggested that any United player who was currently frozen out had a chance of being reintegrated if they didn't find a new club.",
      "But his recent comments on Garnacho suggests there is no going back in their relationship after he claimed their relationship simply didn't work - and he could not put his finger on why.",
      "\"I think Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" Amorim said. \"And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Just like Fernandes, you want your manager to be a no-nonsense coach that pulls no punches and takes no prisoners.",
      "Amorim has raised eyebrows at Old Trafford with his candid statements on the team and brutal assessments about where they are at this moment in time. That's all fine, but those words have to be followed up with action on the pitch.",
      "He's already admitted this is the 'worst Manchester United team in history\" and recently said he knew his team would struggle in games last season, but luckily he is making moves to overhaul the squad to combat their woes.",
      "Amorim has isolated the players who he feels don't gel in his squad and aren't part of his plans - Rashford, Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia - while Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans have left on free transfers.",
      "He's brought in two new signings and is plotting more - and revealed he was happy with the improvement he's seen from the team this summer so far.",
      "But his lengthy recent interview also set out his ambition and long-term plans for United after claiming he wanted to stay at Old Trafford for 20 years and follow in Sir Alex Ferguson's footsteps. It remains to be seen whether he can bring success to the club in the long term, but his attitude and bold steps he's taken certainly gives the team of chance of reaching that.",
      "\"I want to stay, I want to stay 20 [years],\" Amorim said. \"That is my goal and I truly believe in that. Something will happen. It always does. In some moments I will be lucky.",
      "\"I had a lot of luck during my career as a manager and my idea is to stay for many years. But again we know that the results will dictate that. I know that last season I used all the credits but I'm ready to start fresh.\"",

      "Former Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas has slammed Manchester United over their transfer business this summer. The Scotsman believes the likes of new Gunners star Christian Norgaard and Newcastle shot-stopper Aaron Ramsdale should've been pursued.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have added two offensive weapons this window so far in the form of £62.5million Matheus Cunha and £71m Bryan Mbeumo. Teenage left-back Diego Leon has been their only other acquisition.",
      "A move for a striker seems on the cards with Benjamin Sesko, also a target for the Magpies, being priority No. 1 for the Red Devils. Yet Nicholas, who played over 175 times for Arsenal, has lambasted the club for what he believes to be a sub-par recruitment round, questioning why the likes of Ramsdale were not looked at.",
      "\"There are a lot of players out there, a whole list who I think would be better than what Manchester United currently have,\" Nicholas exclaimed to Sky Bet. \"I just don't know where they see themselves going.\"",
      "Nicholas went on to raise questions about two players who have made moves this summer for fees that wouldn't break the bank: Norgaard, who arrived at the Emirates in July for £12m, and Ramsdale, who joined Newcastle on loan from Southampton last week.",
      "\"If I was Manchester United, why didn't they go in for Christian Norgaard? It looks as if they've waited for two high-profile players,\" continued Nicholas.",
      "\"But I look at them and I think, why are not adding more players like Norgaard, or players who have played well at Bournemouth and Newcastle, you could disrupt things and see who's interested.",
      "\"There are so many pillars I just can't understand, the whole lack of authority defensively and what is the current situation with the goalkeeper?",
      "\"Why don't they go and get Aaron Ramsdale? He's qualified, he knows the circuit, he's English, experienced, and competitive. I know Ramsdale hasn't won too much, but it's not far off what United have won.",
      "\"I just don't see how they see what an upgrade means. I don't see Manchester United fans showing one bit of excitement as it stands right now, and it's getting close for them to get aggressive towards the club again.\"",
      "Securing the services of a new star between the sticks is supposedly on the Old Trafford agenda this summer after Andre Onana suffered a substandard campaign last time out.",
      "Aston Villa No. 1 Emi Martinez looks destined to wave goodbye to Villa Park, but a United loan proposal for the Argentine was reportedly rejected last month. Head coach Amorim was asked about the prospect of signing a new goalkeeper before the window closes, and didn't rule the proposition out.",
      "\"To hope is a strong word,\" Amorim responded when asked if he hoped to bring in a new keeper or striker. \"We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.\"",

      "Alan Shearer has pinpointed two key areas Manchester United must address in the transfer market – and it seems the club agree with his verdict. Ruben Amorim's side have completed two high-profile moves but the iconic striker believes the club still need several more new recruits at Old Trafford.",
      "United wasted no time in snapping up Matheus Cunha from Wolves after meeting his £62.5million price tag. Manager Ruben Amorim has since bolstered his forward line further by clinching a deal for ex-Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo, which could reach £71m, with the forward making his first appearance in their draw with Everton on Sunday.",
      "United will be determined to bounce back from their woeful 15th-place finish last term and are eager to secure more signings before the transfer window shuts. However, Shearer has insisted that the club needs to bring in new players in two specific areas.",
      "\"Two good signings...they need at least another three, I would say,\" Shearer said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"They need a top-class centre-forward and goalkeeper.\"",
      "While Shearer commended United's recent acquisitions, Gary Lineker delivered a succinct five-word message to the recruitment team: \"They need a lot more. A lot more.\"",
      "It appears United may agree with Lineker and Shearer's assessments. The club are eyeing a move for RB Leipzig's sought-after striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old is also on Newcastle United's radar, with Leipzig reportedly demanding around £70m for the talented young forward.",
      "United are on the hunt for a new number nine to bolster their attacking options, despite Rasmus Hojlund's determination to keep his spot at Old Trafford. Sesko impressed last season with 21 goals and six assists in 45 appearances across all competitions, though Shearer has admitted that a move for striker would be a gamble.",
      "Shearer also suggested that United need to strengthen their goalkeeping options and it is an area of the team that has been the subject of speculation. The Sun have reported that United are searching for a new deputy to Andre Onana, with Antwerp's Senne Lammens emerging as a potential candidate.",
      "The implications of signing Lammens or another backup would likely impact Altay Bayindir's future at United. The 27-year-old joined the club from Fenerbahce, where he was captain, in 2023, but has since made only 11 appearances.",
      "On the field, United had reason to celebrate after clinching the Premier League Summer Series title following a 2-2 draw with Everton, adding to their victories over West Ham and Bournemouth. Post-match, captain Bruno Fernandes criticised the team for being \"a little bit lazy\", but Amorim had no qualms in supporting his captain's call for higher standards.",
      "\"It's saying that they understand the situation. So it's a good feeling. So tomorrow we are going to travel, one day off and we return to Carrington to work,\" Amorim said when asked about Fernandes' comments.",
      "\"Understanding that in this club everything is ups and downs. We understand that, but I prefer that feeling than the other side.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford is better than Nico Williams according to former Barcelona president, Joan Gaspart. The England international arrived at the Camp Nou on a season-long loan from Manchester United with a £26million option to buy earlier this summer, with his long-term future at Old Trafford far from certain.",
      "At 27 and in the prime of his playing career, Rashford will go down as one of the most impressive Manchester United academy graduates of all time, but that hasn't prevented him from falling out of favour with new boss, Ruben Amorim. Rashford was dropped by the Portuguese head coach midway through last season and subsequently went on loan to Aston Villa in February.",
      "With his future in the north west still up in the air, he has since joined Barcelona for the upcoming season. Rashford's journey to Catalonia was far from smooth sailing, however, with Barcelona seemingly favouring other top talents this summer before opting for the England international.",
      "Not only did Barcelona register an interest in Liverpool's Luis Diaz, only to be told that the Colombian wasn't for sale, but they also neared the completion of a deal for Athletic Club's Williams, which reportedly fell through at the eleventh hour due to a dispute with regards to a release clause and La Liga registration.",
      "Williams instead returned to Bilbao, before signing a 10-year extension which will see him at the Estadio de Sans Mames until 2035, while Barcelona landed Rashford on a temporary basis. And while many fans of the La Liga giants will be disappointed that they didn't sign Spain international Williams, Gaspart believes that Rashford is more talented than the 23-year-old left winger.",
      "Speaking to El 10 de Barca, Gaspart said: \"First of all, for me, Marcus Rashford is better than Nico. From here on, I don’t care what Inaki [Williams, Nico's brother] might say. The player has used us in a good way – he’s gotten a good contract, and I’m happy for him.",
      "\"I don’t understand Athletic’s anger. I’ve signed many players from Bilbao, and always got along with their president. This is in the past. We have to focus on the season and trust the squad and the exceptional coach we have.\"",
      "It comes as Inaki lambasted Barcelona for their handling of Williams' potential transfer, claiming that they orchestrated a \"media campaign\" to lure his younger brother away from Bilbao. He alleged: \"They launched a media campaign they thought would work. Many of the things said were lies. People weren’t fair to my brother this summer.\"",
      "He added: \"The external noise ruined a lot. At Athletic, we go about things quietly. We don’t leak false stories to pressure players,\" as well as: \"My brother had options everywhere. But he stayed. He’ll play with his family, friends, and girlfriend close by. That means more than money or trophies.\"",
      "Rashford made his unofficial debut for Barcelona in a pre-season friendly against Vissel Kobe last month. The Englishman entered the fray as a half-time substitute for Raphinha, but only graced the pitch for 30 minutes before he was substituted off.",
      "While the incident may have looked a little disrespectful from the outside looking in, manager Hansi Flick was quick to clear the air, explaining that it was a tactical decision to monitor the forward's fitness. He said after the 3-1 win: \"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball.",
      "\"He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",

Fernandes scored in a pre-season meeting with Everton, but United's issues were laid bare as David Moyes' side earned a 2-2 draw.",
      "United's skipped argued United were \"lazy\" during the draw in the United States, as an Ayden Heaven own goal ensured the spoils were shared. Fernandes' fellow scorer Mason Mount is still in his team-mate's good books, though, with the captain sharing a photo of the pair on Instagram with the simple caption: \"my guy\".",
      "“It’s improving, but it’s not where we want it to be,” Fernandes said after the game against Everton. “It’s a game of football, there’s always passion there. Whatever happens, happens. There was nothing spicy there, it’s normal, it is part of the game.",
      "“It’s been positive [the US tour] and it’s good to create a bond with the players. We looked a bit lazy today and we need to change that,\" he added, suggesting a couple more new signings are still needed.",

      "The praise for Mount comes ahead of what could be a pivotal season for the England international. Since joining from Chelsea in 2023, he has struggled with a number of injury setbacks but showed towards the end of last season why United were willing to pay big money for him.",
      "In two seasons as a United player, Mount has played less than 2,000 competitive minutes. He's till just 26, though, and has time to turn his Old Trafford career around.",

      "“From day one of pre-season, it's about standards and details within training, on and off the pitch, and really focusing on what we need to do to be better and to perform better,\" the midfielder said. \"We haven't done loads of analysis of last season. We looked at a few areas that we can improve on, but this is a new season, it's like wiping the slate clean.",
      "\"Coming into this season with a different kind of attitude and a feeling about it and we're ready to go. The vibe around the group is very energetic.

United unveiled their plans for a new ground back in March, with the club planning to demolish Old Trafford and build a brand new 100,000 capacity stadium.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe hopes the project, which he has dubbed the 'Wembley of the North', will be completed by 2030 but they are struggling to buy a critical site beside the ground that is currently owned by freight company Freightliner.",

      "\"Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world's greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford,\" Ratcliffe said of the project.",

      "This summer has already been a busy one when it comes to big-money transfers. As has often been the case, the Premier League has led the way, but English clubs might not be done just yet.",
      "Since the transfer window opened, teams in England's top-flight have spent big. We've already seen one move which could end up breaking the Premier League transfer record - Florian Wirtz's move from Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool - and that's just one of countless £50m+ deals across the country.",
      "Among those other deals are Liverpool's swoop for Hugo Ekitike, Arsenal's deal for Viktor Gyokeres and Manchester United's moves for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. We've also seen some notable overseas moves, with Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford among those to leave the Premier League.",
      "Liverpool have already broken the British transfer record once and they could be about to do it again. Isak is unlikely to be available for much less than £150million, but that figure could yet come down in the coming weeks - especially if Newcastle can find a replacement.",
      "Slovenia striker Sesko is one of Newcastle's options but they're not the only ones in the mix. Manchester United also remain keen on the frontman after seeing Viktor Gyokeres opt for Arsenal, and Sesko won't come cheap.",
      "Arsenal have already been busy, adding the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi and Noni Madueke. A move for Eze would wrap up a statement-making summer, while probably paving the way for Leandro Trossard to leave.",
      "Former Premier League star Lookman has thrived at Atalanta but feels his treatment in Bergamo has left plenty to be desired. The 27-year-old is expected to leave if a 'fair' offer arrives, having handed in a transfer request.",
      "In an emotional statement, Son confirmed he plans to leave Tottenham after a decade in North London. He appears to be Major League Soccer-bound, with LAFC ready to part with a club record £20m fee.",
      "Liverpool's summer of spending is also one with a fair few exits. Nunez looks likely to be next, with Al Hilal ready to swoop amid a lack of concrete interest from Europe.",

      "Rivaldo has warned Marcus Rashford he will not take Raphinha's starting spot in the Barcelona line-up this season. After yearning for a move to the La Liga giants all summer, Rashford finally got his dream switch last month, albeit on a season-long loan with a £26million option to buy.",
      "While Rashford will be remembered as one of United's great academy graduates, his tenure at Old Trafford looks all but finished while Ruben Amorim is at the helm. The 27-year-old fell out of favour under the Portuguese tactician midway through last season, subsequently being sent out on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "With it clear that he was still no part of Amorim's plans upon his return earlier this summer, Rashford then began pushing for another move away from the club, with Barcelona ultimately securing his services after missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool's Luis Diaz.",
      "While Rashford will be eager to hit the ground running in Spain, Rivaldo has warned that he will not start ahead of superstar Raphinha. Speaking to Betfair, the 53-year-old, who played for Barcelona between 1997 and 2002, said: \"I think that’s highly unlikely that Rashford will take Raphinha’s spot, especially after the season Raphinha had last year.",
      "\"In my view, Raphinha is currently among the top five players in the world. Right now, he’s an undisputed starter at Barca and already a club icon. Everyone, the players, the coaching staff, the whole club rates him very highly.",
      "\"What he did last season was outstanding, so without a doubt, that position is his. Of course, it’s always good to have top-quality players around you.",
      "\"So yes, there will be competition, but I don’t think Rashford is going to take Raphinha’s place. Other opportunities will arise, and with training, the manager will likely find a way to fit them both into the team. But for me, Raphinha is a nailed-on starter. I don’t see any chance of him being dropped from Barca’s starting line-up.\"",
      "Rivaldo also explained Rashford may have to be patient for his opportunity, and he may find himself starting off the bench as the season gets underway. He added: \"When a player leaves a club in a tough situation, like he did, and joins a team like Barcelona, it’s only natural that the coach will use training sessions and the first few matches to get a better look at him.",
      "\"Barcelona had a great season last year, so it’s normal for him to start off on the bench. I believe that little by little, he’ll find his rhythm, start to understand how the manager wants the team to play, get used to the training routines, and gradually settle in.",
      "\"Over time, he’ll earn his spot. He’s a hugely talented player – he’s already proven that in one of the toughest leagues in the world. He’s also an international. So, I fully expect him to earn a place in Barca’s starting eleven and re-establish himself as a regular in the England squad too.\"",
      "With 34 goals and 25 assists to his name across all competitions last season, Raphinha was instrumental to Barcelona clinching the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey and the Supercopa de España. And under contract until 2028, it is thought that the 28-year-old Brazilian will retain his place in Hansi Flick's starting XI in the fresh campaign.",
      "Rashford made his unofficial Barcelona debut in a pre-season friendly against Vissel Kobe last month, coming on as a substitute for Raphinha at half time. However, he lasted just 30 minutes before he was replaced by Pedro Fernandez Sarmiento.",
      "While the incident came across as somewhat embarrassing for Rashford, Flick was quick to explain that the move was to manage his fitness. After the match, he said: \"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball. He's a week behind the others. He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.\"",
      "Rashford returned to the fray on Thursday for Barcelona's 7-3 drubbing of FC Seoul, once again coming on for the second half as a replacement for Raphinha. However, on that occasion, he lasted the full 45 minutes, even assisting Ferran Torres' 88th-minute strike to cap off the victory.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alan Shearer completely disagrees with Arsenal’s concerns over Manchester United target Benjamin Sesko after the Gunners decided not to pursue the striker. Arsenal finally ended their long search for a star striker last month by signing Viktor Gyokeres for around £64million.",
      "That was despite Mikel Arteta’s long-standing interest in RB Leipzig’s Sesko, having monitored his development in the Bundesliga over the past 12 months. But after holding initial talks with the German side, Arsenal bosses quickly discovered that any move for the 22-year-old would prove too costly for a player still developing his game.",
      "Three notable alarm bells were raised regarding a potential Sesko deal. They were: Leipzig’s asking price, his lofty wage demands, and doubts over his psychological readiness to spearhead Arsenal’s frontline, given his age and the fact he has not played in England previously.",
      "While Arsenal decided Sesko was too much of a gamble, Newcastle and the Red Devils have shown no such doubts in their pursuit of the Slovenian international in recent weeks. Recent reports from Slovenia hinted Sesko was edging towards a Newcastle switch but it appears he's still weighing up his options, with United yet to make a formal offer.",
      "Magpies legend Shearer’s comments back in December, long before Newcastle were linked with Sesko, indicated that the pundit held none of Arsenal’s concerns over the forward. Speaking before Leipzig's Champions League meeting with Aston Villa, Shearer backed Sesko to thrive in the Premier League.",
      "After Sesko was compared to Erling Haaland, Shearer told Amazon Prime: \"He has the same frame. He is as quick as he is. He can certainly travel with the ball like he can. He is very good at scoring goals. He is very good at bringing people into the game, so I get the comparison.",
      "\"I like him a lot. I know he is very young - he is only 21 years of age so he's got a lot of learning to do - but without doubt there is a top-class footballer in there. I think it's only a matter of time before he's playing, maybe even in the Premier League.\"",
      "When asked if he has the skill-set to make it in the Premier League, Shearer added: \"I do, I think it's a matter of who can afford him. There is no doubt that this football club has a history of making an absolute fortune on transfers and this guy could be the next one to come into the Premier League.",
      "\"Either foot - left or right - which is great to see. The work rate, the work off the ball, he's got all them things and he's got very good technique, good balance and I don't think there is a doubt in my mind that and he would look very comfortable in the Premier League. I do think he has a lot to learn, but he can learn no doubt.\"",
      "Newcastle were the first to make a move for the striker, putting forward a bid just shy of £70m, as reported by the Chronicle. That offer was swiftly turned down by Leipzig, who were hoping for a bidding war among the interested clubs.",
      "The Slovenian netted an impressive 22 goals across all competitions last season and is hailed as one of Europe's most promising talents, having been signed from Leipzig’s sister club RB Salzburg in 2023.",
      "Shearer admitted on the latest Rest is Football podcast that he does see Sesko as a 'risk' but insisted he has huge potential and would represent good business for the club if they were able to get him and Yoane Wissa in to replace Alexander Isak.",
      "\"I know Sesko is a lot younger (than Wissa) and it would be more of a gamble on him because you're going to have to pay a decent-sized fee for him,\" he said.",
      "\"I saw him two or three times in the Champions League last season and there's definitely room for improvement. Yes, there's certainly a talent there but there's a lot of improvement that can be made and you're bringing in somebody that's unknown to the Premier League and that's always going to be a bit of a risk.\"",
      "Newcastle will hope to complete a deal for Sesko if they lose their talisman Isak to Liverpool this summer, having already rejected the Premier League champions' £110m bid.",
      "Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim’s Red Devils are also in need of a No. 9 after missing out on several targets this window, with Gyokeres, Liam Delap and Hugo Ekitike opting for moves to Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool respectively.",

      "Hollywood star Sydney Sweeney has been inundated with DMs from Premier League footballers following her recent split. The 27-year-old, dubbed 'the sexiest woman in the world', is now single after parting ways with her former partner, producer Jonathan Davino, earlier this year.",
      "The couple started dating in 2018 and got engaged in 2022 but have now called off the wedding. Sydney, who rose to fame with her role in the hit HBO series Euphoria, has also starred in such films as 'Anyone But You' and 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', and she is reportedly now enjoying the single life stateside post-breakup.",
      "However, she's also caught the attention of some of England's top footballers, who have offered to jet her off to Europe for romantic rendezvous. This comes after she snubbed Conor McGregor at a party.",
      "An insider revealed to The Sun: \"Her Instagram DMs are packed with messages from famous men trying to get in contact with her. It's mostly guys playing for teams like Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal,\" reports the Daily Star.",
      "\"They offer her trips to Europe to see them and take her on a date, but she's not the kind of person who does that. Some of them are very insistent and have even tried to find her address to send her flowers, but she always refuses.",
      "\"I'd say more than 100 people, from celebs to millionaires or very rich people from the Middle East and Asia, contact her every month.\"",
      "Her friends are now reportedly teasing that she's become \"the most wanted woman in America since Madonna.\" Despite the playful tone of some admirers, Sweeney doesn't hesitate to hit back at any overzealous suitors stepping out of line.",
      "The source said: \"The ones who cross the line of respect are quickly blocked. Not long ago, an American actor who had recently divorced approached her to take her on a date.",
      "\"She declined and he started being very rude, so she told him to stop talking to her and to show some respect to her and all women.\"",
      "It was rumoured that Sydney and Jonathan's romance had been on shaky ground for a while before they called it quits.",
      "Sweeney's jam-packed filming diary is said to have played a part in the split, with her taking on both executive producer duties and the lead role in her latest project, The Housemaid.",
      "In May, she opened up about enjoying her newfound single status, saying: \"I'm learning a lot about myself, spending more time with my friends. And I'm loving it.\"",
      "Sweeney has also made waves recently after starring in a campaign for American Eagle. In the advert, she confidently posed sans bra, accompanied by the punchy tagline: \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans\".",

      "Bruno Fernandes has called on Manchester United to make more new signings following the final match of their United States tour. The Red Devils captain called out his side's performance as 'lazy' before making a plea for more new additions.",
      "United have already added Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to Ruben Amorim's frontline this summer, and young defender Diego Leon has also joined the Portuguese coach's squad. But after finishing 15th in the Premier League last season, the 13-times champions need to find a great deal of improvement to transform into a competitive side for 2025/26.",
      "And while Fernandes believes they have started to improve thanks to their preparations, he wants to see more competition for places in the first team. The 30-year-old wants to see one or two more signings to help United on their way.",
      "“It’s been positive [the US tour] and it’s good to create a bond with the players,\" said Fernandes. \"We looked a bit lazy today and we need to change that.",
      "“I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about. I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "The RB Leipzig striker is the focus of attention from Manchester United and Newcastle and will likely cost in excess of £70million. The forward, who scored 13 goals last season, has not indicated his preference though United are said to have the advantage as they first talk to the player before making a bid to the Bundesliga side.",
      "Sesko has long been linked to United and and a new striker remains on the agenda with United willing to let Rasmus Hojlund go for £30m.",
      "Aston Villa's asking price may have put United off making a move for Ollie Watkins for the moment, but the forward has proved of interest. The Midlands club want £60m for the 29-year-old and are reluctant to sell",
      "Watkins would be in keeping with United's transfer tactics this summer: of relying on players who have been successful in Premier League already. It may require United to become more desperate to part ways with a fee that Villa deem acceptable however.",
      "There has been talk of a new goalkeeper on Manchester United's agenda this summer and few additions could be as significant as Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Paris Saint-Germain star's contract is set to expire next year with little sign of an extension.",
      "Reports have indicated the former AC Milan shotstopper would be interested in making the move, but the MEN report there is not a set budget for a new first choice currently. The Italy international could be available for free in less than 12 months.",
      "A more affordable option could be Botafogo goalkeeper John Victor. Last month, it was reported the Red Devils were ready to trigger his release clause.",
      "United have already been linked to a whole host of goalkeepers including Aston Villa 's Emi Martinez, Porto ace Diogo Costa and Cruz Azul number one Kevin Mier. Reports in Brazil claimed United were now ready to move for Victor and told the South American side they were willing to trigger the player's R$44.5 million (£6m) release clause.",
      "A move has yet to be forthcoming however.",
      "Earlier this summer it was reported Christopher Nkunku would be available for £35m if United wanted to make a move. The Frenchman has failed to shine at Chelsea after seeing his time at the club disrupted by injury.",
      "With United looking to sell Alejandro Garnacho, and Chelsea a prime candidate for his signature, there remains the chance Nkunku could be utilised in a makeweight for any deal. The Red Devils will likely prefer a full transfer fee to boost their standing in profit and sustainability rules.",

Rashford signed with the Spanish champions for the 2025/26 campaign, while the deal also includes an option to buy the 27-year-old next year for around £26million.",
      "As per Mundo Deportivo, Rashford is staying in the Hotel Sofia – the same accommodation as team-mates Wojciech Szczęsny and Roony Bardghji – as he awaits permanent housing in Barcelona.",
      "Given the luxurious atmosphere of the five-star hotel, a stone's throw from Camp Nou, the England international is likely to be comfortable staying there as long as is required.",
      "The Hotel Sofia, also known as the Grand Hyatt Barcelona, is situated in one of the city's most exclusive financial areas of Alta. With 465 rooms throughout, the hotel is full of incredible amenities that Rashford will likely use to wind down from training with the La Liga champions ahead of the season opener against RCD Mallorca.",

      "This basic room features two single beds, a private bathroom with a shower, flat-screen TV, seating area and city views.",
      "Rashford – whose whopping net worth was reported last year as being £64m – won't be spending his stay in one of the hotel's standard rooms, though. Barcelona will want him feeling extra comfortable, while they're also covering his entire salary this season, worth £315,000-a-week.",
      "The forward would be much more suited to the most expensive room at the Hotel Sofia, which can cost up to £1,579 per night.

      "Throughout the main lobby of the hotel, spacious seating areas are dotted around with sun loungers situated around the outdoor pool, and high stools placed near the bar that is loaded with every drink imaginable.",
      "While Rashford will likely be using the hotel's amenities sparingly as he trains with Barcelona, there are certainly worse places to be resting your head in the Spanish city.",
      "Speaking about his exciting switch this summer, the 27-year-old said: \"I'm very excited. It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",

      "Manchester United and Newcastle United's hopes of signing Benjamin Sesko were handed a boost, as his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda will not be making a move to Sunderland. The Red Devils and the Magpies have been hot on the heels of Sesko in recent weeks.",
      "Amidst these rumours, it was frequently suggested RB Leipzig's Openda – who has previously been linked with United – was on the Black Cats' radar. As a fellow forward, if Sunderland had managed to secure Openda's services, it would have made the task of signing Sesko even more challenging.",
      "Leipzig would likely be reluctant to let go of both their strikers in August. However, in a positive turn of events for United and Eddie Howe's side, Openda will not be joining Sunderland. The newly promoted side are understood to not be interested in the Belgian.",
      "Newcastle were the first to make a move for the striker, putting forward a bid just shy of £70m, as reported by the Chronicle. This offer was swiftly turned down by Leipzig, who are hoping for a bidding war among interested clubs.",
      "The Slovenian netted an impressive 22 goals across all competitions last season and is hailed as one of Europe's most promising talents. Recent reports from Slovenia hinted Sesko was edging towards a Newcastle switch, but it appears he's still weighing up his options.",
      "United have missed out on several targets this window, with Viktor Gyokeres, Liam Delap and Hugo Ekitike opting for moves to Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool respectively. Despite these setbacks, Ruben Amorim has bolstered his attack by securing the services of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It's widely known that Amorim is on the hunt for a centre-forward to lead United's line. Last term, United's meagre haul of 44 Premier League goals was better only than Everton and the relegated trio of Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton.",
      "On the departure front, United are keen to offload Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, having already loaned out Marcus Rashford to Barcelona. In contrast, United's Rasmus Hojlund is determined to stay put and compete for his place in the squad.",
      "Despite some flashes of brilliance, the Danish forward's performances haven't quite lived up to expectations since his £72m move from Atalanta in the summer of 2023. Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me.",
      "\"I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "\"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "United were held to a 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday in the Premier League Summer Series across the pond in America. Amorim's men took the lead on two separate occasions courtesy of strikes from Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, yet the Merseysiders fought back each time through Iliman Ndiaye and an unfortunate own goal from Ayden Heaven. Their next match is at home to Fiorentina on Saturday.",

      "Here are five talking points from their tour:",
      "Bruno Fernandes, typically, was one of three players to start all three tour games and scored three goals. Fernandes ended the match against Everton in midfield, where he started against Bournemouth in Chicago.",
      "Fernandes will flitter between the No.10 and the No.8 over the course of the season as United have a surfeit of options to play behind the striker. Even when Matheus Cunha operated as the false nine against Everton, Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Mason Mount had stints as one of the 10s.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is another option as Amorim ponders how to enhance a midfield arguably as in urgent need of an upgrade as up front. Whenever Fernandes eventually departs United, they are not going to require a playmaker for a while.",
      "United's intention to loan out Toby Collyer all but confirms a midfield recruit is lined up. Amorim criticised the \"lack of pace\" in the area after the goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm and he hooked Mainoo before the hour mark against Everton.",
      "The bigger issue in the 2-2 draw was Manuel Ugarte, who was stuck against the Toffees. Everton preyed on Ugarte's limitations and he wilted against an aggressive press. Ugarte sought protection from the referee and when he attempted to match Everton's physicality he committed an obvious foul.",
      "Casemiro is undeniably a squad player and not even in the new six-man leadership group, having been a part of it under Erik ten Hag. Collyer's three career starts have come against teams from Romania, Scotland and League One. Amorim has belief in Mainoo but seems caught between two stools as to his role.",
      "Amorim suggested he was \"happy\" that United underperformed against Everton, easily the least accomplished of their performances, as the players would not be lulled into a false sense of security back at Carrington. This has been a buoyant United tour but the midfield has to be improved.",
      "United's second-best player last season was another playmaker and Amad started behind Rasmus Hojlund in Chicago. In the other two games, he was on the right wing and that appears to be the role Amorim has settled on for him.",
      "Amorim had Geovany Quenda to service Viktor Gyokeres in his final months at Sporting and Amad is a similar profile: a young left-footed winger expected to assume defensive responsibilities whilst offering attacking intent down the right-hand side.",
      "With £133.5million worth of new forwards and the totemic Fernandes in the attacking trident against Everton, United had dexterous playmakers to drop deep and spring through Amad, playing on the shoulder of the last defender. It led to a chance for Cunha and the penalty that Fernandes converted.",
      "Amad played on the wing in Amorim's first United match in charge at Ipswich. Four other wingers are in the bomb squad, either unwilling or incapable of meeting Amorim's demands.",
      "Another 'hidden' attacking asset is Leny Yoro, who is literally stepping up and playing more on the front foot.",
      "One of the last kicks from Rasmus Hojlund in the States was his boot against the post. He was appalled that Patrick Dorgu had shot at goal rather than gone across goal.",
      "Dorgu was well within his rights to shoot. Hojlund may have strayed offside, too. We have become accustomed to that reaction from Hojlund and he vented at Diogo Dalot in Stockholm a little over two weeks ago.",
      "It cannot be easy for Hojlund to continue as United's No.9 when they are enquiring about almost any attainable striker. He is in an identical position to Erik ten Hag last year when United asked every Tom, Dick and Harry if they would take over as manager. Ten Hag remained in situ after the head-hunting but was eventually summoned to the guillotine.",
      "Hojlund is digging his heels in amid United's efforts to flog him but it is unsustainable and could jeopardise the squad harmony. Hojlund was socialising with Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as recently as United's penultimate night in Chicago. United need to be transparent with the Dane.",
      "This has been the most upbeat United pre-season since 2017. The quirk of that is United entered that summer having just won the Europa League final.",
      "Denying the 'bomb squad' members a seat on the plane to Chicago has indubitably helped. The players have publicly backed Amorim's handling of players who have caused him and the club problems. United are not treading on eggshells with Marcus Rashford any more after he was whisked away to Barcelona.",
      "Ten Hag had Jadon Sancho foisted onto him for pre-season last year and his working relationship with Rashford was practically irreparable. Senior figures at United want to provide unequivocal backing for Amorim and his authority is yet to be challenged over his handling of a player.",
      "The days when Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba rode roughshod over the manager are thankfully over.",
      "Andre Onana is expected to be match-fit for the Arsenal fixture but if he isn't then a 39-year-old deserves to be between the sticks for United.",
      "This tour was additional evidence that Altay Bayindir is the third-best of United's senior 'keepers. In a summer where United are exploring the possibility of recruiting a new goalie, it is peculiar that they are not actively looking to shift Bayindir, whose reputation hinges on a couple of penalty saves in a cup tie.",
      "Bayindir was utterly unconvincing again in the draw with Everton whereas Tom Heaton kept competently against Bournemouth. Onana has to demonstrate clear evidence that he has honed his technique when he does return and the first-choice goalkeeper position can be parked for a year.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Manchester United defender Leny Yoro has been one of the biggest 'winners' of pre-season this summer.",
      "Yoro has impressed in each of his appearances in Stockholm, New Jersey, Chicago and Atlanta, and supporters are excited about what he could achieve with a clean bill of health this season.",
      "The Frenchman's first 12 months in Manchester were disrupted by injuries - and he still made a strong impression. There were clear signs of Yoro's potential in the midst of a hugely challenging season for United and this summer's evidence suggests he is ready to take further steps forward in 2025/2026.",
      "Yoro, 19, is learning on the job and already has the qualities of a top player, which helps to explain why Real Madrid were interested in signing him before his transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Attracting interest from Real Madrid speaks volumes and they were in the race to sign Yoro. However, United submitted a financial package - €62million (£51.8m), with an additional €8m (£6.6m) in add-ons - that Madrid were not prepared to match, as Yoro was in the final year of his Lille contract.",
      "Some suggested United were foolish for paying a significant fee when Yoro's deal was approaching its expiry, but sitting on their hands would have opened the door for Real Madrid to sign him on a free transfer this summer.",
      "United considered Yoro worth the investment and he could make the £51.8m outlay look like value in the coming years. Yoro has the skillset to become world-class and world-class players command much higher fees.",
      "One of the most promising aspects of Yoro's pre-season performances has been his willingness to play out from the back because his passing range is hugely beneficial to build-up play.",
      "It's something Ruben Amorim wants from Yoro, too. \"The coach asked me to do, so I need to do it. I enjoy doing it, being in front, and If I can bring the ball forward then I will do it,\" he said after the Everton draw.",
      "When Yoro made his United debut against Rangers at Murrayfield in Scotland in pre-season last summer, he executed a few sublime passes, leading to jokes that he was a future Ballon d'Or winner.",
      "Those types of passes aren't easy to execute and they were briefly missing from Yoro's locker when he returned from a metatarsal injury in December, but he gradually grew in confidence.",
      "Yoro now looks completely relaxed as a United player and it's exciting to see him pick out long passes again - defenders who can play such passes are a manager's dream to deal with.",
      "Before picking up an ankle injury against West Ham in May, which almost ended Yoro's hopes of playing in the Europa League final, he was outstanding in the left-sided centre-back role.",
      "Most suspected Yoro would be nailed to start in that position in the back-three at the start of the new season, but Amorim has deployed him on the opposite side this summer.",
      "Yoro played on the right side of the defence against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton in the States, and his performances on that side were just as good as those previously produced on the left.",
      "With that in mind, Yoro deserves praise for delivering strong displays on both sides of the back-three. Possessing the skill to be versatile is another string to his bow as he develops.",
      "Real Madrid would have loved to sign Yoro, but they weren't willing to cough up a decent transfer fee for a player in the final year of his contract. And that caution forced them to miss out on a supremely talented young defender.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Manchester United were crowned winners of the 2025 PL Summer Series overnight after their 2-2 draw with Everton.",
      "And while it is a trophy that pales into scant insignificance to the many major honours United have won in their rich history, Ruben Amorim may look back on this last fortnight as a major milestone in his reign.",
      "It has been far from plain sailing for the Portuguese since he inherited the Old Trafford hotseat in November last year and he has had to endure some turbulence in his opening months as manager.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last term and only managed two Premier League wins in 2025 against teams who weren't relegated to the Championship.",
      "They also missed out on European football this season when they were beaten 1-0 by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao back in May.",
      "United's board have stuck by Amorim, though, and have backed him in the transfer market with the signings of forwards Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "A new centre-forward is on the wishlist, too, as well as a new midfielder. The belief is that the short term pain United have endured will benefit them in the long run - particularly with a full pre-season working under the former Sporting manager.",
      "And the early evidence has been positive. While there was some negativity around the draw with Everton, wins against Bournemouth and West Ham - two teams who turned over United so easily last season - felt significant.",
      "United's players have repeatedly spoken about how they feel they are getting to grips more with Amorim's methods. If that is the case, and United are able to beat the teams they should be beating - something they struggled to do last season - there could be reason to be positive about their prospects this term.",

      "Who needs to win the Europa League when you can win the Premier League Summer Series?",
      "Manchester United lifted a trophy at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Sunday evening after beating West Ham and Bournemouth, and drawing against Everton, during the United States tour.",
      "The 'celebrations' were obviously muted, but the vibes around United at the end of the pre-season tour are undeniably better compared to the mood in the days building up to the trip across the Atlantic.",
      "The signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for an initial £65million, announced a day before the flight to the USA, was the catalyst for a more optimistic outlook. It was important to sign Mbeumo in time to travel to the States, and there have been green shoots elsewhere in the friendlies.",
      "United have looked fitter, well-organised and capable of hurting their opponent in the final third. The players were handed individual fitness regimes during their holiday this summer and it seems to have paid off.",
      "Ruben Amorim's decision to exile players who had fallen below expectations has also seemed to pay off, with the players on the USA tour discussing the improved culture and morale in the dressing room.",
      "Amorim has banished the bad eggs. There is a feeling of harmony within the group and the players have seemed notably upbeat during sessions at the Endeavor Health Performance Centre.",
      "The performances themselves have been better. United cruised to victories against West Ham and Bournemouth, although the draw against Everton in the final game was a reminder that there is further work to do.",
      "For all the positivity on tour, some of the old problems remain, particularly in midfield, which is an area that Amorim needs to strengthen before the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "United struggled with Everton's physicality in midfield and will struggle throughout the campaign if a fresh face is not added. Amorim also needs to sign a striker, potentially Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Speaking during half-time against Everton, Berrada spoke about transfers and promised that club officials are working long hours to ensure Amorim's squad receives additional reinforcements.",
      "“We have to do a lot of multitasking,\" he said. \"We have a team back home led by Jason, the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad. There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it.”",
      "Berrada continued: “The mood has been very good. The culture, the standards, the values, we are trying to ensure that we create a team spirit that allows the players to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We have very high standards, Ruben is very clear about that and so is Jason [Wilcox]. It is something we want to see with the players, with the staff, with everyone, because what we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.",
      "“Of course, adding players helps. We have seen the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon. They have adapted really well.",
      "\"We are going to see Bryan play for the first time, Matheus has already shown his quality and Diego has shown that he is adapting very quickly, having just come from Paraguay, so all of the signs are positive and we are cautiously optimistic. We hope we are going to have a great season.”",
      "Berrada also said the right things during another brief interview to MUTV on the money-spinning post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong in May.",
      "Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha should prove to be tremendous signings, but more high-quality additions are required to get United into a position to challenge for European football.",
      "Amorim said United \"need to return to Europe\" during his captivating chat with journalists on tour. United need to sign a midfielder and a striker to have a chance of achieving that goal this season.",
      "The mood has improved at Old Trafford, but there is still work to do before deadline day.",

      "The Reds are desperate to sign a striker ahead of the September 1 deadline and Sesko, 22, sits top of their wish list. Signing a striker has been their leading priority all summer.",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport has taken a close look at what United should be striving to try and achieve ahead of the window closing in a month's time to complete a dream window.",
      "United are determined to win the race for Slovenia international Sesko. The Leipzig ace, who scored 21 goals last season, is also the subject of interest from Newcastle United, who have already seen an opening bid turned down.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference and believe the addition of a new goalscorer will help them avoid falling into the same trap for the third season running.",
      "Although he is unproven in the Premier League, he has a respectable record in Germany for Leipzig. Furthermore, he has a very high ceiling and plenty of potential.",
      "In addition to wanting to try and sign Sesko, United also remain in the market for a goalkeeper and a midfielder. Although sales remain important to boosting the club's finances, United believe they can fund the addition of Sesko without having to rely on sales first.",
      "However, outgoings are likely to still be required if United are to bring in a 'keeper and a midfielder. They need a shot-stopper who can challenge and compete with Andre Onana for the No.1 spot and a midfielder who can slot straight into the starting XI.",

      "Garnacho is the biggest asset United want to sell before the end of the window and Chelsea are keen. The Reds should be targeting a minimum of £50m for his services.",
      "United should also be striving to sell Altay Bayindir and Joshua Zirkzee before the bell. Despite being open to selling Rasmus Hojlund for £30m, it would make more sense to cash-in on Zirkzee.",
      "The Dutchman demonstrated last season he is not a No.9 and is more useful as a No.10. United have bolstered their options in that position this summer and it is hard to imagine Zirkzee getting regular game time, whereas Hojlund could still have a role to play.",
      "Elsewhere, United should try and ensure youngsters Harry Amass and Toby Collyer leave on loan. The former has not featured in pre-season amid the expectation he will depart on a temporary deal.",
      "Collyer, too, is expected to leave on loan. He is understood to be determined to fight for his place in Amorim's plans, but sources say he \"has to go on loan\" for the benefit of his development.",

      "However, Dortmund's sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, was more forthcoming: “[Jadon] is constantly being linked with us. I understand the desire. We’re thinking about it within our possibilities. The conditions have to be right. We will definitely do something, but we’re limited.”",
      "Dortmund chiefs publicly said they were delighted with Sancho during his six-month loan spell in Germany, but they did not bid for Sancho to sign him permanently again last summer.",
      "Chelsea subsequently deemed Sancho's contribution of five goals and 10 assists during his time at Stamford Bridge last season as not good enough for the wages he wanted during talks.",
      "Sancho was regarded as one of Europe's most exciting players when he arrived in Manchester for £72.9million, but his time at Old Trafford has been disappointing.",

      "Dewsbury-Hall is claimed to be closing in on a move to Everton, Ugochukwu and Broja are both leaning towards newly-promoted Burnley and Chukwuemeka is likely to return to Borussia Dortmund, where he spent the second half of last season on loan.",
      "So these four hurdles may not be in the way much longer for United and Garnacho to get what they desire from the summer window.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly expected to make a formal offer for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The Reds are in desperate need of a prolific goalscoring striker, having scored a mere 44 goals in the Premier League last season - their lowest tally in decades.",
      "Newcastle United also have their eye on the Slovenian, as their main forward, Alexander Isak, considers options away from St James' Park amidst transfer rumours linking him with Liverpool.",
      "The Magpies have moved first for Sesko having offered an initial €75million (£65.5m) with a further €5m (£4.3m) in add-ons for the 22-year-old over the weekend.",
      "A move to M16 would throw Rasmus Hojlund's future at M16 into doubt, though - despite the Denmark international reiterating his desire to stay.",
      "The report adds that Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. It is said that the Bundesliga club have proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Leipzig's managing director for sport, Marcel Schafer, has also recently confirmed that clubs have made approaches for their star forward.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",

      "Rashford moved to the La Liga giants last month after United reached an agreement with Barca for his loan move to the club. As part of the deal, Hansi Flick's side will pay the winger's wages in full which alleviated some pressures on United's finances.",
      "Since arriving at Barcelona, Rashford has spent little time in the city as he was soon whisked off to Asia for the club's pre-season tour. While over there, Barca have been racking up some comfortable victories albeit against teams of lesser opposition.",
      "Rashford has yet to start though and has instead been used as a substitute as he continues his return from an injury suffered last season at Aston Villa. His absence from the starting XI has not stopped him from opening his account for the club on Monday though.",
      "The Wythenshawe forward netted in the second half as he expertly tucked in an Eric Garcia cutback to add a fifth for Barcelona against South Korea's K League 1 strugglers Daegu FC. As Rashford performed a muted celebration, a fan in the crowd wearing a Barca scarf, held aloft a United shirt with the player's name and number on the back.",
      "The No.10 shirt will be synonymous with Rashford at United moving forward but it was stripped from him this summer after he informed the Reds that he wanted to seek a new challenge. Instead, the shirt was given to new signing Matheus Cunha with Rashford taking on the No.14 at his new club.",
      "Picking up the iconic No.10 shirt worn by the likes of Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho in Barcelona was off the cards for Rashford before he arrived as Lamine Yamal inherited the shirt from Ansu Fati. Barca have one further pre-season game back in Spain on Sunday against Como before returning to La Liga on August 16 as they travel to Mallorca.",

      "This setback led head coach Ruben Amorim to use both Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton in goal during their three-match tour of the USA, which wrapped up on Sunday. Despite not being at their sharpest, United managed a 2-2 draw with Everton in Atlanta, Georgia, securing the Premier League Summer Series title.",
      "However, as United gear up for their season opener against Arsenal on Sunday, August 17, Onana may still be absent, although he reports feeling 'great' ahead of their last pre-season match against Fiorentina on Saturday.",

      "Onana also commented on United's prospects for the 2025-26 season. He added: \"If we have a good start against Arsenal, everything is possible.",
      "Last week, Amorim expressed confidence in Onana's upcoming season, downplaying rumours that he's seeking a new goalkeeper to challenge the 29-year-old at United. His recent observations from training suggest there's no urgency for a replacement.",
      "\"I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers,\" he said.",

      "There had been some suggestions that Jadon Sancho could be given yet another chance at Manchester United when he failed to complete negotiations with Chelsea.",
      "Enzo Maresca's inability to reach a compromise on wages with Sancho cost his club £5m in penalty fees but it could yet cost United even more. There is a general understanding that the Reds are needing to sell players in order to buy further reinforcements for the new season.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the clear priority and it seems that United should discover this week if the Slovenian wishes to join them or Newcastle in the summer transfer window. Even if he were to choose the Magpies, United would likely shift their focus to another forward so the ability to sell the likes of Sancho is crucial.",
      "Unfortunately for United, they have been unable to find a club that is willing to splash the £20m, at least, which would convince the Reds to sell and avoid them damaging their Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) position. However, on Monday it appears United's fail safe Sancho option has shown their hand.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sport Deutschland, Dortmund's sporting director Sebastian Kehl revealed that Sancho was a player they are pondering a move for in the summer transfer window. \"[Jadon] is constantly being linked with us,\" he explained.",
      "\"I understand the desire. We’re thinking about it within our possibilities.",
      "\"The conditions have to be right. We will definitely do something, but we’re limited.\"",
      "While their interest in Sancho will be welcomed by United, their words perhaps symbolise the harsh reality of the situation for the Reds. Kehl's comments suggest that a bid which is enough to persuade the club to sell is unlikely to be forthcoming.",
      "Instead, it appears Dortmund will try to sign Sancho on loan, perhaps with another obligation to pay a reduced rate in 2026 when the 25-year-old will be out of contract. That figure would ultimately be a smidge of the fee United are currently demanding but their negotiating position will be weak considering that the winger can walk away for nothing at the end of the forthcoming season.",
      "At the moment, if United are to get Sancho off their books, this appears to be the only option available to them. The harsh reality is, unless a club tries to gazump their rivals in the market, this is the only way of getting the winger to a new club.",

With a striker seemingly next up, Benjamin Sesko, who is also eyed by Newcastle, tops the priority list for the Red Devils.",
      "However, Nicholas, with over 175 appearances for Arsenal under his belt, has condemned United's recruitment strategy, questioning why they didn't consider options like Ramsdale.",
      "\"There are a lot of players out there, a whole list who I think would be better than what Manchester United currently have,\" Nicholas told Sky Bet. \"I just don't know where they see themselves going.\"",
      "Nicholas highlighted two players who have made moves this summer at reasonable prices: Norgaard, who joined Arsenal in July for £12m, and Ramsdale, who moved to Newcastle on loan from Southampton last week, reports the Mirror.",
      "\"If I was Manchester United, why didn't they go in for Christian Norgaard? It looks as if they've waited for two high-profile players,\" Nicholas remarked.",
      "\"But I look at them and I think, why are not adding more players like Norgaard, or players who have played well at Bournemouth and Newcastle, you could disrupt things and see who's interested.",
      "\"There are so many pillars I just can't understand, the whole lack of authority defensively and what is the current situation with the goalkeeper?",
      "\"Why don't they go and get Aaron Ramsdale? He's qualified, he knows the circuit, he's English, experienced, and competitive. I know Ramsdale hasn't won too much, but it's not far off what United have won.",
      "\"I just don't see how they see what an upgrade means. I don't see Manchester United fans showing one bit of excitement as it stands right now, and it's getting close for them to get aggressive towards the club again.\"",
      "Bringing in a fresh face between the sticks seems to be on the Old Trafford agenda this summer following Andre Onana's disappointing performances last season.",
      "Aston Villa's No. 1 Emi Martinez appears set to depart Villa Park, though a United loan bid for the Argentine was supposedly turned down last month, and it is thought interest has dwindled.",
      "Manager Amorim was questioned about the possibility of recruiting a new shot-stopper before the transfer deadline, and refused to dismiss the idea.",
      "\"To hope is a strong word,\" Amorim replied when questioned about his aspirations to recruit a new goalkeeper or forward. \"We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.\"",

      "In this squad with a surfeit of No.10s, another popped up with a goal. Mason Mount's goal evoked memories of his tie-killing strike against Athletic Bilbao in May. That goal and cameo effectively earned Mount a promotion to the starting XI for the Europa League final. He is now even more up against it to regain a starting status.",
      "A commentator familiar to American soccer audiences announced the line-ups as if it were a wrestling event. In case anybody could not hear him, the 360-degree giant screen listed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the same United line-up together for the first time.",
      "United's warm-ups consist of defence-versus-attack drills and their set-up in the magnificent Mercedes-Benz Stadium confirmed Cunha would be the centre forward. He was the only one not to hit his cue in the fifth minute when played in by Amad.",
      "The most striking sequence in the move were Mbeumo's two touches - his first two in a United shirt. It advanced the attack and enabled Bruno Fernandes to accelerate it. Mbeumo's prompt play drew 'ooh's from a starstruck crowd. Then he generated a round of applause following a canny dribble out of defence in the 33rd minute.",
      "Mbeumo was on the right of the two playmakers but popped up on the left wing. His first time through-ball for Amad to win United's penalty was exemplary.",
      "That opening was fashioned by Cunha, Fernandes and Mbeumo all combining from deep. Mbeumo's awareness of teammates' positioning was so natural that it belied the fact that this was his first appearance for United. The trio clicked quickly.",
      "Amorim never entertained the prospect of playing a strikerless system in the final weeks of last season when it was worth trialling amid Hojlund's impotence. He has had a change of heart following £133.5million worth of investment in the attack.",

As starry as Cunha, Mbeumo and Fernandes are, the signing driven by John Murtough remains one of the most integral in Amorim's side. Amad has played wide right and as one of the two 10s and is emerging as a hidden asset with his lung-bursting sprints on the defender's blindside.",

Cunha still rallied to press and embark into a rousing sprint.",
      "The incumbent striker, Rasmus Hojlund, feels he is being forced out at United and emerged to vent again. Hojlund kicked the post after Patrick Dorgu kicked the ball at goal rather than across the goal.",
      "United still have issues further back. Manuel Ugarte went from domineering against West Ham to dominated by Everton. He erred for Iliman Ndiyaye's equaliser by attempting to dribble the ball out of United's third.",
      "Everton sensed Ugarte's vulnerability and they were quicker to press him in the second half. Ugarte pleaded with the referee for extra protection, which merely fuelled Everton whenever he next had the ball. He attempted to match them and fouled Ndiyaye overzealously.",
      "Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro and Toby Collyer is not a midfield quartet that is going to cut it over the course of a season. Even without European football. United intend to loan out Collyer and Casemiro has been omitted from the new six-man leadership group, having been a member of the eight-man team under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Mainoo was replaced by Mount and Fernandes dropped back into midfield. That worked a treat when Fernandes shifted the ball inside for Mount to leather the ball past Jordan Pickford.",
      "You could play Fernandes in goal instead of the errant Altay Bayindir and he would still be the most influential player in the United shirt. He is papering over the cracks in midfield now, though he erred for both of Everton's equalisers. Fernandes was squaring up to Ndiyaye, having kicked out at him, when Amad's attempted clearance deflected in off the luckless Ayden Heaven.",

      "Every summer, the likes of Fabrizio Romano, Florian Plettenberg and Gianluca Di Marzio declare that one transfer could trigger a ‘domino effect’. It never does. And yet, we delude ourselves into thinking it might.",
      "But…this summer, it just might.",
      "The potential domino effect doesn’t simply surround signing replacements, but also raising the funds to go out and sign a top target. That’s a strong factor this summer, anyway.",
      "With everything taken into account, we’ve predicted what will happen in the striker market before the 2025 summer transfer window closes. Here are ten different dominos set to fall this month.",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko to Newcastle United\nThere’s only one deal that can truly get the ball rolling, and that’s Sesko to Newcastle United.",
      "The RB Leipzig and Slovenia striker was under consideration at Arsenal before they swerved toward the Viktor Gyokeres lane, going all in on signing him after deeming Leipzig’s demands for Sesko too steep.",
      "It’s reported that the Bundesliga club want a guaranteed £65million, some add-ons, and a percentage of a future sale.",
      "Newcastle thought they’d have an opening bid worth £65m + £4m in add-ons accepted, but David Ornstein says it has been deemed ‘insufficient’ over in Germany. The add-ons weren’t enough, or maybe it was the lack of a future fee guarantee – we’re not entirely sure.",
      "Either way, the Magpies need to return with another offer, or Manchester United could swoop in. They have no intention of selling Alexander Isak before having a replacement sorted, so unless Liverpool cough up £150m over the next few days, we can’t see that transfer being the one that triggers the domino.",
      "The Red Devils are still in the picture but haven’t made a bid for Sesko…yet. If they get an indication that the 22-year-old prefers them to Newcastle, they’ll probably sign him. They need to sell but could get Sesko and work that out later, with Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho all available for transfer.",
      "In an ideal world for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, they’ll bring in around £100m and significantly reduce the wage bill in the process.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak to Liverpool\nAssuming Sesko to Newcastle is the first domino to fall, the door will be firmly open for Isak to complete a dream move to Anfield.",
      "The Premier League champions remain in a strong financial position despite already spending £263m. They’ve been sensible enough in the transfer market over the years to enable such an expensive outlay, and recently sold Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich for £65m and Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.",
      "Newcastle signing Sesko doesn’t completely force their hand when it comes to selling Isak either; they’ve always wanted to sign another striker this summer and are still working on a deal to sign Brentford’s Yoane Wissa.",
      "Isak didn’t travel to Asia for the Magpies’ pre-season tour and has burned some bridges with the club’s fanbase through his attempts to force a move to Liverpool. Many don’t want to see him don the black and white stripes again, while others accept the situation and would do anything for their elite centre-forward to stay ahead of a Champions League campaign.",
      "That’s extremely unlikely, and Isak’s move to Liverpool feels like a case of when, not if.",
      "MORE ON ISAK TO LIVERPOOL\n👉 Liverpool ‘have played a blinder’ over Isak to ‘gazump’ Newcastle ‘no matter what’\n👉 £150m Alexander Isak would *actually* be the ninth most expensive Premier League player ever\n👉 Liverpool swap for Isak worth a ‘bash’ thanks to Eddie Howe and Newcastle failsafe",
      "",
      "8) Darwin Nunez to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool want to sell Nunez no matter what. Clubs in Italy have been strongly linked throughout the summer, but it looks like Captain Chaos is off to the Middle East.",
      "You can put this transfer second or third on this ranking. If he’s sold before Isak is signed, then the Reds are even more equipped to pay a British record fee. If Isak is signed first, the Reds’ stance on Nunez doesn’t change: he’s still set for the exit door.",
      "We’ll miss Nunez and his unpredictable nature, but a summer transfer is the right thing for everyone. It remains to be seen if he’s fully on board with a switch to Saudi, but he knows there’s no place for him in Arne Slot’s squad anymore – especially if Isak joins.",
      "",
      "7) Ollie Watkins to Manchester United\nUnited have narrowed down their striker shortlist to two completely different players: Watkins and Sesko. The former loves getting in behind and does most of his business in and around the 18-yard box, while Sesko drops deep and takes long-range shots.",
      "Is that what United need? Not really. Is that what United have prioritised over the experienced Watkins? Of course it is.",
      "If Sesko joins Newcastle, United – assuming Ruben Amorim has any say in striker recruitment – will surely turn their attention to Watkins. And at 29, there are reservations over Watkins’ resale value. United really shouldn’t care about that. When was the last time they sold someone for a profit? Not counting academy players, it was Alvaro Carreras, and they still managed to mess that up spectacularly.",
      "Just forget about that and get an outstanding centre-forward through the bloody door.",
      "Missing out on Sesko will surely reignite United’s interest in the Aston Villa star, and despite being reluctant to lose him, Unai Emery’s side should sanction a sale for £40-50m. And if he joins the Red Devils, they’ll be even more desperate to offload their unwanted players.",
      "",
      "6) Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea\nOne of those unwanted players is Garnacho, who Chelsea want to sign because Chelsea want to sign all of the players.",
      "Does paying £50m for the 21-year-old make sense when Tyrique George is Right There? And £50m has already been spent on Jamie Gittens this summer? Oh, and Mykhaylo Mudryk exists even without a shirt number. He’s suspended but is still there and could return tomorrow, in two months, or four years. Nobody knows.",
      "Simply put, Chelsea don’t need Garnacho.",
      "The overriding point is that Chelsea will always be Chelsea, and their unrelenting desire to sign players means they’re convinced Garnacho can become one of the best wingers in the world. Just as they were with Mudryk, Noni Madueke, Estevao and Angelo. They are deluded, but integral to the transfer domino, with interest in Garnacho completely separate from their Xavi Simons pursuit.",
      "",
      "5) Christopher Nkunku to Manchester United\nThe Blues’ transfer addiction means players who don’t do very, very well are on the chopping block. It’s a revolving door at Stamford Bridge. Their next signing will be their 50th over the last four years. Manchester United, who are chronically addicted to trying to make things right in the transfer window, bought Ander Herrera 49 signings ago.",
      "Nkunku has been expected to leave Chelsea for a while, but he’s still at the club and still played in this summer’s Club World Cup, scoring once. Efforts to offload the Frenchman will ramp up when Simons or Garnacho are signed, and we can see him following Watkins to Old Trafford.",
      "Swap deals almost never happen, and PSR means they’re a bad idea, so the Garnacho and Nkunku deals will be separate. And the latter’s move to United will open the door for another Old Trafford exit…",
      "",
      "4) Rasmus Hojlund to Juventus\n“I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay at Manchester United. I want to fight for my spot whatever happens,” said Hojlund last week. But the transfer domino effect has spoken.",
      "Leipzig are interested in making Hojlund part of the Sesko deal, and the Dane is also an option for AC Milan, while Juventus have been linked and want a striker as well.",
      "Having done well for Atalanta in Serie A, Hojlund could open the door for a return, and it doesn’t come much bigger than Juve in Italy.",
      "",
      "3) Dusan Vlahovic to AC Milan\nAnd if Juventus sign Hojlund, there’s no doubt that Vlahovic will move on. The Old Lady are reportedly keen to offload the former Arsenal target and are also working on a deal for Randal Kolo Muani, who is tangentially involved in the domino.",
      "But Hojlund’s move, coupled with Nunez going to Al-Hilal, means Milan’s striker shortlist will be down to Stade Rennais’ Arnaud Kalimuendo and Vlahovic. For pure convenience, we’re saying the Juve man makes the move to San Siro.",
      "",
      "2) Arnaud Kalimuendo to Brentford\nIt’s awfully convenient, as it opens the door for Brentford to sign Kalimuendo from Rennes.",
      "The Bees have been linked with the Frenchman and Arsenal’s Leandro Trossard, but the former is a natural centre-forward and exactly what they need as Wissa does everything in his power to leave.",
      "Wissa is refusing to train and will leave Brentford under acrimonious circumstances, having been promised a £26m transfer this summer after pledging his future to the club last year. After losing Man United signing Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford’s stance changed, and Wissa is very, very upset.",
      "Clearly having some level of understanding and sympathy for a player who scored 19 Premier League goals last season, Brentford aren’t sitting still and have identified Kalimuendo as a potential signing. He won’t come cheap, but Keith Andrews needs some real quality in his team after selling Mbeumo and Christian Nørgaard.",
      "",
      "1) Yoane Wissa to Newcastle\nThe transfer domino starts and finishes at St James’ Park, as Wissa finally finds his way to the northeast after Brentford sign Milan target Kalimuendo from Rennes.",
      "Poor Aston Villa are left in the dust without a Watkins replacement because ten is the magic number. An honourable mention for Kolo Muani here will suffice.",
      "As mentioned before, the plan has always been for Eddie Howe to receive a new striker to play with Isak, and that could happen with Wissa or Sesko joining and their star player staying, or with Wissa playing alongside Sesko in 2025/26.",
      "Despite all the aggro surrounding Wissa’s situation, we think he’ll get his Magpies move. Whether it comes after these nine deals remains to be seen, but the timeline is absolutely spot on. Bring it on, we say.",
      "READ NEXT: Yoane Wissa deserves our sympathy…but not as much as poor Brentford fans",
      "Alexander Isak will ‘cheat’ with Liverpool like any other ‘greedy’ player unless Newcastle stop being ‘cringey’ and fight back with a World Cup argument.",
      "Newcastle are ‘pushing’ to reach an agreement with RB Leipzig ‘tonight’ for Benjamin Sesko after the striker told them he’s ‘willing to sign for the club’.",
      "Newcastle have given Benjamin Sesko a deadline to make his decision and Manchester United will not be making a bid in the meantime.",
      "Newcastle United are back in the race to sign Liverpool transfer target Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace this summer, according to reports.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has utilised an interesting play for his next transfer as he has reportedly told two interested sides, Manchester United and Newcastle, that he ‘only wants ...",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed that Newcastle now “understand a deal might have to be done” with Liverpool for Alexander Isak this summer."

      "That is supported by the Bild report, but it states they are ‘expected’ to make the offer only when Sesko rejects Newcastle and ‘commits’ to the Red Devils.",
      "But Sesko needs United to guarantee that they can financially support the deal, which is not guaranteed, because they still need to sell players in order to do so.",
      "Leipzig, meanwhile, want things settled soon so they can sign a replacement if they need to do so, with Romulo Cardoso and Fabio Silva named as potential successors.",

      "It’s been reported that United want to make a ‘monumental offer’ for Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr, which would see them allocate ‘their entire summer budget’ to the signing of the superstar winger.",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to RB Leipzig\nThere have been murmurs of a swap deal involving Hojlund and Sesko, but the former really doesn’t want to leave United. The Premier League club signing Sesko seems contingent on player sales, whether it’s before they bid or after, so sending Hojlund to Germany works well for them. It’s all too good to be true, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Jeremy Jacquet – Rennes to Arsenal\nAnother defender, Mikel? That’s insane. Arsenal’s interest in Jacquet will only be accelarated should Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior leave. The latter is attracting interest from all over Europe, but Arteta wants to keep him. Arsenal even rejected an offer from Portugal earlier this summer for the Pole, who’s destined for a place on this rumour ranking very, very soon.",

      "18) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in the agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",
      "",

      "",
      "15) 🆕 John Victor – Botafogo to West Ham\nThe Hammers have made an opening bid for the Manchester United-linked goalkeeper, who starred for Botafogo at this summer’s Club World Cup. If you were given the choice to be second-choice at Old Trafford or *potentially* first-choice at the London Stadium, what would you choose?",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Let’s see who blinks first…",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are back in for the England defender after a failed pursuit last summer. Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £50m and expected to move due to his lack of desire to sign an extension. Guehi has also been linked with Liverpool, who could continue their assault on the Magpies by hijacking the deal…",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThere are no negotiations between United and Chelsea but Romano says the winger is giving his ‘full priority’ to the Club World Cup winners. The Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Poor Tyrique George knows he doesn’t stand a chance and has asked to leave. This club, man…",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow. Until it isn’t. United are now behind their league rivals in the race for Sesko.",
      "F365 SAYS: Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin recently in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "7) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. The deal is dropping down our power ranking, but we’re refusing to rule it out completely…",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "6) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nNewcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters but a Magpies bid is in. Let’s see whether or not Leipzig reject it and if the Red Devils react…",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool rejected an offer of around £70m from Al-Hilal for Nunez in January and will not delude themselves into thinking a summer sale could generate nearly as much. But another piece in their Isak puzzle could fall into place thanks to the Magpies’ owners. PIF want to give the Saudi Pro League runners-up a shiny new centre-forward and Nunez has been earmarked as that man, with the Uruguayan described as ‘receptive’ to that interest ahead of bidding.",
      "",
      "3) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "2) 🆕 Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – Chelsea to Everton\nWell, that was an underwhelming year for Dewsbury-Hall…on a personal level, anyway. He barely played for Chelsea in the Premier League and is now set for a switch to the Hill Dickinson. This is a top move for the player and both clubs.",
      "",
      "1) 🆕 Armando Broja – Chelsea to Burnley\nA ‘Here we go’ out of nowhere was delivered on Friday night. It will be a permanent move for Broja."

      "Manchester United are said to be ‘engaged’ with their interest in a Brazilian goalkeeper, who has already been approached by two other Premier League sides.",
      "United have improved a few areas of their side this summer. After their attack struggled to make inroads last season, they have added Premier League forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They have also added young left-back Diego Leon to their squad, in the hopes the 18-year-old can progress into being a star.",
      "But the goalkeeper position is one which it’s felt needs to be improved. Andre Onana made a lot of mistakes last season and it’s been suggested he’s lost the faith of some of the coaches.",
      "It looks unlikely that he’ll leave the club, as he’d prefer to fight and show he’s worthy of a place, but United have been on the hunt for a new goalkeeper for some time.",
      "Caught Offside reports United are ‘engaged’ in the chase for Botafogo goalkeeper John Victor, and ‘remain very much in the race’ for him.",
      "It was already reported that they are ready to meet Victor’s release clause, and though they are keen on bringing in an experienced, affordable and reliable option, they are yet to make a bid for him.",
      "What’s more, the report suggests interest from other clubs ‘complicates’ United’s pursuit.",
      "Premier League rivals West Ham are said to have lodged an €8million (£6.9m) bid for Victor, while Everton have opened talks with the goalkeeper’s representatives.",
      "There are then sides who have not yet actively made moves, but who are interested in his services.",
      "It’s said Galatasaray, Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid are all interested in the keeper. Like United, no formal bids have been made by any of those sides, though they are ‘keeping tabs on the situation should opportunities arise later in the window’.",
      "For the Red Devils, not landing Victor would not be the end of the world, as there are other keepers on their radar.",
      "Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens has featured heavily in reporting around United’s goalkeeper search, and it was said recently that they had made contact over a deal for the 23-year-old.",
      "There has not been a lot of movement on that deal of late, though. In any case, he and Victor are not the only goalkeepers linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer."

      "“Sesko’s strengths are certainly his physicality and speed – he’s great at making dangerous runs in behind defences, but he’s also a very clinical and instinctive finisher, especially when the ball drops to him in the area. His work rate is good and he’s a willing runner off the ball as well.",
      "“His hold-up play is quite strong, but I think his link-up play is a side of his game that he can still improve. It’s not that he’s bad at that side of the game, but compared to someone like Kai Havertz, he’s not at that level. In particular, his passing will need to get a lot better.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has stated “more competition” is important for Manchester United after a “lazy” performance, and “one or two” signings could help.",
      "United have had a decent time of it in pre-season. Their American tour ended with wins over West Ham and Bournemouth – 2-1 and 4-1 respectively – and a 2-2 draw with Everton.",
      "Fernandes suggested the draw, in which United were twice in front, was not an ideal finish to the summer.",

      "“But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "“Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "In response, manager Ruben Amorim said: “I think I’m happy for the players to have that feeling. It’s saying that they understand the situation. So, it’s a good feeling.",
      "“One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I’m really happy with the squad.”",
      "After winning the Premier League Summer Series in America, despite the draw against Everton, United will play one more pre-season game, against Fiorentina at Old Trafford, on August 9, before they kick off the Premier League season against Arsenal on August 17.",

      "People paid to write about Manchester United are acting like Bruno Fernandes in central midfield is a ‘tactical tweak’. Keep up…",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",

      "We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: if you must deploy a central club crest, you simply must also centralise the maker’s mark. It’s a basic question of balance.

It’s a motif whose association with United goes all the way back to that belting early ’90s away kit, and a design adidas have since leant on for United with even more enthusiasm than they have Arsenal and the lightning bolt. They even did it last season and have gone back to the well again.",

      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",

The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",

Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",

Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",

      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves.

You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",

      "9) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",

      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",

      "7) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

But better to wait for a nice one than confirm a sh*t one, as we always say.",
      "Inevitably, the combination of red-and-white stripes plus hummel leads us down a vaguely Southampton route here, but while ‘is it obviously a Team X kit’ is one of our core criteria we are going to cut some slack here because we simply don’t think there’s any way around that particular puzzle without abandoning hummel altogether, and we’re very much in baby-with-the-bathwater territory there.",
      "Lovely simple kit, this, so much so that we don’t even mind the centred badge because everything is at least balanced. Collar is 10/10, the chevrons look as magnificent as ever, and quite simply hummel have done it again, as they nearly always do. Great bunch of lads.",

Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd are now “ready to bid” as soon as Benjamin Sesko “decides to join them”.",
      "The Red Devils have have already made three signings this summer with Mathueus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arriving from Premier League clubs Wolves and Brentford respectively, while Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon has joined from Cerro Porteno.",
      "Widespread reports indicate that Man Utd are looking to sign three more players before the end of the transfer window with Ruben Amorim wanting a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper.",
      "Man Utd look to have settled on RB Leipzig’s Sesko as their top centre-forward target after reported interest in Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins.",
      "However, the Red Devils face serious competition from Newcastle for Sesko with Newcastle having a bid worth €80m rejected by RB Leipzig on Saturday.",
      "Despite meeting the Bundesliga side’s valuation of Sesko, former CBS Sports journalist Ben Jacobs revealed that the ‘overall package’ was ‘not deemed acceptable’.",
      "READ: Twenty most valuable footballers in the world: Yamal, Mbappe rank high as Arsenal duo included",
      "Jacobs wrote on X: ‘Leipzig have rejected Newcastle’s €75m+€5m bid for Benjamin Sesko. €75m fixed fee met their quoted valuation, but overall package not deemed acceptable in terms of both total and structure.",
      "‘Leipzig not yet dropping their demands from when Arsenal were working on the transfer before Viktor Gyökeres. Manchester United yet to bid, but remain in the race having held club-to-club and player talks. Leipzig hoping, and some sources say waiting, for an #MUFC offer to create competitive tension.",
      "‘Sesko has still not, as of Saturday afternoon, indicated to either club which one he prefers to join despite reports from Slovenia he has already picked Newcastle. Prior to Newcastle’s bid, there were some fears within the club that Sesko was holding out for Manchester United.’",
      "And now Romano has claimed that it’s a “very open” race between Man Utd and Newcastle with the Red Devils waiting on a green light from Sesko before bidding.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Newcastle have sent a bid and there is an ongoing negotiation with Red Bull Leipzig.",
      "“Newcastle are ready to pay what it takes if Sesko decides to join them. Man Utd are ready to bid and start negotiations if Sesko decides to join them.",
      "“So everything depends on Sesko. At the moment Sesko has still not decided between Newcastle and Man Utd.",
      "“The agent of Sesko is now in Leipzig so we are entering decision time. Man Utd made clear to Leipzig on Saturday that they will send a bid for Sesko if the player will open doors to join them.",
      "“The deal is very open between the two clubs.”",
      "An August striker domino effect across Europe will begin when Benjamin Sesko joins Newcastle, with Alexander Isak and Ollie Watkins also involved.",
      "Newcastle are ‘pushing’ to reach an agreement with RB Leipzig ‘tonight’ for Benjamin Sesko after the striker told them he’s ‘willing to sign for the club’.",
      "Newcastle have given Benjamin Sesko a deadline to make his decision and Manchester United will not be making a bid in the meantime.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has utilised an interesting play for his next transfer as he has reportedly told two interested sides, Manchester United and Newcastle, that he ‘only wants ...",
      "Man Utd are ready to blow their entire summer transfer budget on Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are willing to match Newcastle’s offer for Benjamin Sesko with both clubs keen to wrap up a deal for the RB Leipzig striker, according to reports."

      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",

      "\"You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.",
      "\"The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.",
      "\"It's not only the winning mentality that we need but it is other things too that the club are trying to improve like the facilities, the team, the staff and a lot of other things.",
      "\"A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.",
      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
      "\"I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.",
      "\"We are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].\"",
      "Reflecting on Mbeumo's debut, Amorim added: \"He played well. He needs to understand the position, the movement but the first touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in the perfect condition physically but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team so everything I was expecting, he delivered.\"",
