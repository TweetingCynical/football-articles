      "Jorgen Strand Larsen completed a last-gasp move to Crystal Palace(Image: @CPFC/X)",
      "The winter transfer window is over, at least when it comes to Premier League clubs making new signings. There is still a chance for players to be offloaded to certain leagues such as the Dutch Eredivisie, Turkish Super Lig and Major League Soccer in the United States but the lion's share of the business has been done.",
      "It was a relatively quiet deadline day, too - not that the winter window has been hugely busy in recent years. Premier League clubs confirmed seven deals on Monday night, as well as one notable signing which will go through in the summer.",
      "All in all, just shy of £400million has been spent by Premier League sides in January. More than £70million of that total was spent on deadline day itself, when we also saw a handful of last-minute loan deals.",
      "This never looked like being an especially busy window for Arsenal but they'll be wary of how thin the squad was left by injuries around this time last year. This time, the only notable bits of business saw Oleksandr Zinchenko leave for Ajax after already having been out on loan and Ethan Nwaneri agree a temporary switch to Marseille.",
      "A deadline day swoop for Sandro Tonali never looked especially realistic, while Mikel Merino's foot injury is unfortunate, but the Gunners will hope they're well covered. Essentially it's as you were for the Gunners, which makes sense for a team whose summer recruits have helped them climb to the summit.",
      "January was huge for Villa last season, with Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio in particular almost helping drag Unai Emery's team to a top-four finish. This winter has been busy as well, albeit with movement in both directions.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Tammy Abraham and Douglas Luiz can have as big an impact as in previous Villa Park spells, while new winger Alysson may well be more for the future than for the present. Donyell Malen's goals will need replacing, while Leon Bailey's return counter-balances Evann Guessand's departure, while the big question mark concerns an apparent failure to resolve the Harvey Elliott conundrum.",
      "Even before the window started, the big one for Bournemouth appeared to be how they'd replace Antoine Semenyo rather than whether they'd be able to keep the Ghanaian. They appear to have chosen the method of trying to improve in a few areas, something which has served them well in the past.",
      "Rayan, Alex Toth and Christos Mandas will have varying roles to play in the coming months and the former in particular arrives with high hopes. Making up for Semenyo's exit won't be easy but Andoni Iraola's side have already earned some impressive results without him.",
      "Teenage forward Kaye Furo is the kind of pick-up we've become accustomed to from Brentford of late. A highly-rated youngster who the Bees will hope one day can attract comments about how they managed to beat more illustrious clubs to his signature.",
      "That's about it for Keith Andrews' side, though. A few exits, be they loans or permanent deals, point to a broad satisfaction with what they have,",
      "For those disappointed to see Matt O'Riley leave on loan towards the end of the summer, the good news is the Danish international is back. Fans of homecomings may be even more delighted to see Pascal Gross back on the south coast, with the German midfielder the only permanent arrival in the winter.",
      "Pascal Gross has returned to Brighton(Image: Offside via Getty Images)",
      "We've also seen some loan wheelings and dealings at the Amex Stadium, including a return for Igor and a handful of exits. After picking up just one win in their last 11 games, though, Fabian Hurzeler will hope recent form was a blip rather than anything more worrying.",
      "Even before Monday's defeat at Sunderland, Burnley's survival hopes were looking slim. A quiet window, headlined by a loan move for James Ward-Prowse, is unlikely to change that.",
      "Scott Parker's side may well pick up some more decent results in the second half of the season but the quiet window points to a recognition that the gap might be too big. They're winless since October but they may take some encouragement from recent draws with Liverpool, Manchester United and Spurs.",
      "It might feel longer ago than that to some but Chelsea's managerial change came during the winter window. Results have been impressive under Liam Rosenior but transfer business has been kept to a minumum.",
      "Facundo Buonanotte is now at Leeds after achieving little during his loan spell at Stamford Bridge. The positives have largely come in the form of offloading players with little hope of first-team minutes, with Raheem Sterling agreeing to a mutual termination of his contract and both Tyrique George and Axel Disasi leaving on loan on deadline day.",
      "Palace's window could have been a lot worse, but could have been a great deal better. The negatives are obvious, with Marc Guehi leaving for Manchester City and manager Oliver Glasner confirming he will leave in the summer.",
      "There was a moment where Glasner looked like he could leave sooner, though, while Jean-Philippe Mateta is still a Palace player - albeit one who looks set to miss an extended period through injury. The Eagles will have to hope Welsh forward Brennan Johnson, loanee Evann Guessand and new record signing Jorgen Strand Larsen can replace Mateta's goals between now and May.",
      "Everton's biggest blow in January wasn't transfer-related. Jack Grealish's promising start has been derailed by injury and the England international's season could well be over.",
      "Jack Harrison has joined Fiorentina on loan(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Loan addition Tyrique George will hopefully offer something for David Moyes' side, while Harrison Armstrong is back at Hill Dickinson Stadium after impressing on loan at Preston. Beyond that, there isn't a great deal to report besides the collapse of a last-minute exit for Dwight McNeil.",
      "One of the biggest tests for Fulham was coming through the Africa Cup of Nations with points on the board. Not only did they manage that, but they've now also made one of January's biggest signings.",
      "They'll hope Oscar Bobb's arrival can bring the best out of summer arrival Kevin, who scored a stunning goal at Old Trafford on Sunday. There was also an exit for out-of-favour Adama Traore, along with the boost of Harry Wilson sticking around - at least until the summer.",
      "The bulk of Leeds' important business was done in the summer and that has ensured they're in good shape to stay up. They're not over the line yet, though, and time will tell whether they'll be left ruing a quiet January.",
      "It's been a tale of two loans, with Facundo Buonanotte in and Jack Harrison out. That suggests continuity is the order of the day at Elland Road.",
      "It's hard to know how to rule on a signing that won't go through until the summer. However, Jeremy Jacquet looks like an important pick-up for Liverpool regardless of what happens with Ibrahima Konate's future..",
      "Away from the young French defender, it's mostly been about loans for the Reds. A change of scenery for Lewis Koumas has already borne fruit, with the Welsh forward scoring Hull's winner at Blackburn on his debut for the Championship high-flyers.",
      "Antoine Semenyo has made a fast start at Manchester City(Image: Getty Images)",
      "City will surely consider themselves to be the winners of the window. They have signed two players with proven Premier League quality and haven't needed to spend nearly as much as this time last year.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side have a net spend of less than £60m for the window, balancing the books by selling Oscar Bobb after signing both Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi. It might not be enough for the title, but it gives them a real shot.",
      "We know by now that Sir Jim Ratcliffe isn't a fan of spending big in January - or, in this instance, spending at all. There has been an important change at Old Trafford, though, with Ruben Amorim making way as manager.",
      "It's hard not to be results-oriented after Michael Carrick's fast start. However, it's also worth recognising the lack of business for a squad which doesn't quite have the right balance and which will lose in-form Casemiro in the summer.",
      "Newcastle have ended the window some seven points outside the top four and with no guarantee that fifth place will be good enough for Champions League football this time around. With that in mind, some fans will look at the lack of incomings and wonder why more wasn't done.",
      "There's an argument that Yoane Wissa will - as the old cliche goes - feel like a new signing after only making his debut in December. The positive comes from Sandro Tonali staying, though it's hard to determine whether there was ever any realistic chance of the Italian moving on.",
      "Forest's most important act of January was winning at fellow strugglers West Ham, but there's also something to be said for their transfer dealings. They'll hope Lorenzo Lucca can provide goals, while Luca Netz and Stefan Ortega also joined late in the window.",
      "Lorenzo Lucca at his Nottingham Forest unveiling(Image: Nottingham Forest FC via Getty I)",
      "They also appear to have cut their losses on Arnaud Kalimuendo, with Eintracht Frankfurt holding an option to sign the forward permanently if he succeeds on loan. They look to be in healthy enough shape to survive, though, so now it's all about making sure.",
      "Like fellow new boys Leeds, Sunderland went big in the summer and have been reaping the rewards. Regis Le Bris' side didn't feel they needed to do much in January (and early February), but they haven't been silent.",
      "Nilson Angulo has been the big new signing, costing around £17.5m from Anderlecht, while fringe players have been sold and loaned out. One of those exits was left until the last minute, with summer signing Simon Adingra loaned to Monaco after falling down the pecking order.",
      "Thomas Frank and Spurs knew they needed to spend in January. The question is whether the investment came in the right areas.",
      "Conor Gallagher has slotted straight in at Spurs(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Beating Arsenal to Scottish youngster James Wilson will no doubt please plenty, while Conor Gallagher has gone straight into the first team, and a decent fee was recouped for Brennan Johnson. Returns from injuries could prove more important than any signings, though, with Dominic Solanke thriving over the weekend and a real hope Dejan Kulusevski can find form when he eventually comes back from a serious knee injury.",
      "West Ham's £47m striker pairing of Taty Castellanos and Pablo Felipe have yet to score in the league, but their arrival appears to have helped with an uptick in form. Nuno's side secured back-to-back wins for just the second time all season in January, but still have work to do if they want to stay up.",
      "It was one in and one out at the back, with Axel Disasi arriving and Igor returning to Brighton. The big question concerns how badly they'll miss Lucas Paqueta, but getting £36.5m from the Brazilian league can't be sniffed at.",
      "It's difficult to judge a window for a team in Wolves' position, with relegation all but confirmed long before the turn of the year. However, Rob Edwards' side look to have set themselves up reasonably well for both now and next season.",
      "Bringing in £48m for Jorgen Strand Larsen has to be considered a good move given his return of just one league goal all season. Adam Armstrong arrives with calibre in the second tier - perhaps signed with a hope he can lead a promotion charge next term if there's no miracle between now and May - while Angel Gomes' arrival on loan looks intriguing at the very least.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jacob Devaney has been captaining Man Utd's U21s",
      "Manchester United's U21 captain Jacob Devaney believes he's \"proven himself\" at that level and now needs to play senior football after securing a switch to St Mirren for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "The 18-year-old has come through the ranks at Old Trafford and is playing above his age in a leadership role, but headed north of the border until the summer in a bid to further his development.",
      "St Mirren pounced on deadline day and United were willing to let the U21 skipper leave for Paisley with Devaney himself seeing it as the ideal landing spot to push on as he stakes his claim for first-team football.",
      "His parent club were very much in favour of him heading out as Devaney added: \"They said use it as an opportunity to improve, play men's football, learn the game and come back a better player in the summer. Theres definitely a pathway at United, it is known for bringing through academy players and this is a good stepping stone for myself.\"",
      "Devaney has been a key figure in United's U21 set-up this season, playing in every game under two different coaches - first Travis Binnion and then Tom Curtis. He has impressed in a number of positions including central defence, right-back and in central midfield in a United side have spent the majority of the season at the top of the Premier League 2 table.",
      "St Mirren claimed the Scottish League Cup earlier this season, beating Celtic in the final at Hampden Park. Since that triumph their league form has suffered and they languish down in tenth, but they believe Devaney can give them a fresh injection.",
      "The teenager will play out the season with St Mirren(Image: St Mirren)",
      "Manager Stephen Robinson claimed: \"Jacob gives us something that we haven't got. We haven't really replaced Caolan Boyd-Munce and with Keanu [Baccus] being injured we haven't had that link between defence and midfield in recent weeks.",
      "\"He's a really highly thought of young player at Manchester United so we're looking forward to getting him involved. He's been playing U21 football for Manchester United on a regular basis and with our injuries he could get thrown in at the deep end, but we believe he's got a mentality to handle that and is someone we feel can make an impact.\"",

The 19-year-old goalkeeper was a highly-rated prospect at Scottish club Queen's Park and was reportedly attracting interest from Arsenal and United.",
      "However, it was the Cherries who won him over, following a Zoom call with members of the club's football team. McKenna left his decision to depart Scotland until the last minute but made certain to visit Manchester United a day before declining their offer on deadline day.",
      "After completing his move to the Vitality Stadium, he explained his reasons for rejecting United. He told Bournemouth's official matchday programme in 2024: \"A 15-minute Zoom call with (assistant technical director) Simon Francis and (head of goalkeeping) Neil Moss.",
      "\"I travelled to Manchester and met the people from Manchester United the day before deadline day. That night, I had the Zoom call and was invested in coming here. The following morning, the guys from United came to take me to the training ground and I told them it wasn't what I wanted.",

      "Manchester United could've had a much more productive transfer window(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United opted against strengthening their squad during the January transfer window following heavy spending last summer. The club have seen a considerable turnaround under Michael Carrick's leadership, securing victories in all three matches against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's dramatic late winner on Sunday clinched all three points and lifted the team back into fourth place in the Premier League standings. With only 14 fixtures remaining in the league campaign, the club's decision-makers will now hold off until the summer before naming a permanent boss and backing him with fresh signings.",
      "However, the situation might have looked vastly different had Carrick been granted control of transfers throughout January.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Marcus Rashford has been on loan at Barcelona since the start of the campaign and has rediscovered his best form in Spain. The England international has made a significant impact for his temporary club with 20 goal contributions, particularly in Europe.",
      "Barcelona currently possess a £26million option to make the forward's move permanent in the summer. Given how well the 28-year-old has settled, supporters anticipate this clause will be activated when the summer window opens.",
      "Rashford departed United on a temporary basis during Ruben Amorim's time at the helm, with tensions between the forward and his manager playing a significant part. At one stage, Amorim suggested he'd rather field his goalkeeping coach than a player not putting in full effort during training sessions.",
      "Soon afterwards, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan and is now playing his football in Spain. However, with Amorim no longer at the club and former team-mate Carrick potentially taking charge permanently, there's speculation the academy product could be persuaded to make a comeback to Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford could've come back to Manchester(Image: Angel Martinez/Getty Images)",
      "According to The Telegraph, if Carrick remains beyond the summer, he would be eager to bring Rashford back to Manchester. While it might have required some persuasion, reuniting with the club he's been part of since childhood under Carrick's management could have proved a significant advantage for United in the winter transfer window.",
      "United's midfielders have been delivering outstanding performances since Carrick took control. Skipper Bruno Fernandes and outgoing star Casemiro have contributed to four goals across three matches, with the Portuguese maestro reaching his 200th goal contribution against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo hasn't been particularly prolific in finding the net, but his cool head in the middle of the park has earned him considerable praise since his return to the squad.",
      "However, maintaining this level of performance is challenging, and Carrick may have been enticed to invest heavily in reinforcements during January.",
      "Adam Wharton could've become a United player(Image: George Wood/Getty Images)",
      "Adam Wharton emerged as a top target for United, with Liverpool, City and Newcastle also circling. Crystal Palace have slapped a hefty price tag on the 21-year-old, especially given his contract doesn't expire until 2029.",
      "Initial reports suggest a starting figure of around £65m, though this could balloon to over £80m given the fierce competition for the midfielder's signature. United are well aware of rival interest and may have considered lodging a substantial bid to frighten off other potential buyers.",
      "With Oliver Glasner departing in the summer and Palace favourite Marc Guehi already making the switch to City, the club's decision-makers might have tested the Eagles' determination with an £80m offer that would have put them ahead of the pack.",
      "As noted earlier, Mainoo has become the heartbeat of Carrick's midfield. He's featured from the start in all three matches under the former United captain, a stark contrast to his minimal playing time under Amorim.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo may have left United if he hadn't begun starting for the club(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "However, the arrival of another midfielder could have thrown his future into serious question. Mainoo had already been drawing attention during the transfer window and was said to be considering a temporary switch to guarantee regular first-team football.",
      "The 2026 World Cup was also a key consideration for the 20-year-old's move as he battles to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel's England squad this summer. Had he remained as an infrequently used substitute under the former Middlesbrough boss, Mainoo would likely have pushed for a move away from United.",
      "With genuine interest from Napoli, Chelsea, and Barcelona earlier in the window, the prospect of United losing another academy graduate wasn't beyond the realms of possibility.",

      "Cole Palmer of Chelsea has been linked with Manchester United(Image: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Offside via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have been told why Bruno Fernandes being in their squad next season is unlikely if they pursue a deal for Cole Palmer. United have been linked with the signing for the Chelsea talent in recent weeks, whilst Fernandes' prospects at Old Trafford have also been mentioned on the rumour mill.",
      "Palmer left Manchester City in 2023 to join Chelsea, but was a United supporter in his youth, which has sparked rumours that a switch to the Red Devils might materialise this summer.",
      "Fernandes was strongly linked with a transfer to the Saudi Pro League last summer, but chose to stay at United for another campaign, and the rumours of a possible exit in future persist.",
      "The Portugal international has a deal at United running until summer 2027, with the Red Devils holding the option to extend the contract by an additional 12 months.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“I think it all depends on what happens with Bruno Fernandes,” Pennant stated, speaking on behalf of BetSelect.co.uk.",
      "“He's obviously not getting any younger. If the Saudi clubs come back in for a whopping £100 million plus, I think they may potentially think, 'Okay, thank you and bring in Cole [Palmer]'.",
      "“But I don't see why they'd bring in Cole and then have Bruno as well, both kind of the same position. Unless they're looking to drop Bruno a bit deeper.",
      "Cole Palmer was linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: Photo by Giuseppe Maffia/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "“But if you've got a player of that calibre saying, ‘I'm unhappy and I want to come to your club or come back home’, the alarm bells are going to start ringing and maybe having questions about it because he's a fantastic player.",
      "“I would be surprised [if Palmer left] because I think Chelsea have kind of built a project, a lot of young players, for the past two seasons, been evolved around Cole Palmer.",
      "“You would say that, obviously not in the league position at the minute, but maybe they're in a better place at present. So yeah, it would be a shock to see him leave to go to Man United.”",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo 'liked' Jose Mourinho's comments about him and Lionel Messi(Image: Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has liked an Instagram post of Jose Mourinho arguing in favour of the Manchester United legend over Lionel Messi. Since breaking through as two of the world’s most exhilarating talents in the mid-noughties, the football world has been divided into those who prefer Messi and those who believe Ronaldo to be better.",
      "Their rivalry was at its peak after Ronaldo left United for Real Madrid in 2009 and Messi still played for Barcelona. The pair were the standout stars of their respective clubs and regularly competed against each other for La Liga titles, golden boot awards and Ballon d’Or prizes, with the Portuguese claiming five while his Argentine rival Messi clinched a record eight.",
      "Today, they are considered well past their primes but Ronaldo, aged 40, is on his way to 1,000 career goals at Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, though he is currently on strike. Meanwhile, Messi, 38, won the MLS Cup last year with Inter Miami.",
      "Even so, their respective fan bases still continue the eternal debate over which is actually football’s ‘greatest player of all time’. While Messi usually steers clear of such comparisons, Ronaldo appears more determined to cement his own legacy with his comments in interviews.",
      "The Portuguese forward has seemingly now sought to do so once more by liking an old video on social media of his compatriot Mourinho championing him at the expense of the Barcelona legend, while he still managed Ronaldo at Real Madrid. In the clip from 2012, Mourinho explains why it is more difficult to be Ronaldo.",
      "He says: \"I still say that it is more difficult to be Cristiano than Messi. Messi grew up in the team he plays for, with the team-mates he plays with. Cristiano arrived in England at a giant team in crisis, which was only losing. He had to grow over the last two years with this team under construction.",
      "\"Messi plays as a number 9 in about 50 square meters, closer to the goal and with less defensive work. Cristiano, on the other hand, is a winger. How can a winger score the same number of goals as a centre forward?",
      "Mourinho coached and defended Ronaldo at Real Madrid(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"A winger who defends, who ends a game in the 94th minute running after Pedro in a goal-scoring situation. A winger who, in set pieces, reaches his own area 20 times because he is very important to the defence. A player who is not protected by anything or anyone... It is much, much harder to be Cristiano, let's stop joking.\"",
      "Despite his obvious stance at the time, which may have stemmed from a certain amount of bias given his club and international affiliations, Mourinho has more recently refused to compare the two global superstars.",
      "In fact, in a move that would likely frustrate the ultra-competitive Ronaldo, he claimed in 2025 that neither player at their peak matched the skill and pure ability of the Brazilian Ronaldo, who played for both Barcelona and Madrid beforehand.",
      "Lionel Messi has more Ballon d'Or wins to his name(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Mourinho said: \"Ronaldo, El Fenomeno. Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi have had longer careers, they have remained at the top every day for 15 years.",
      "\"However, if we are talking strictly about talent and skill, nobody surpasses Ronaldo. Injuries killed a career that could have been even more incredible, but the talent that that 19-year-old boy had was something incredible.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Al-Nassr captain doubled down last year in his interview with Piers Morgan that he is a better footballer than Messi. He said: \"Is Messi better than me? I disagree. I don't want to be humble.\"",

      "Football matches are being won in deserved but dramatic fashion. Supporters are off their seats, including those sat in the posh ones in the directors box.",
      "Fergie himself couldn't keep the smile off his face, when he watched United produce a win over Fulham that was from his very own vintage. Conceding an equaliser in stoppage time. Only to charge down the opposite end and snatch a winner.",
      "For Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud Van Nistelrooy, read Benjamin Sesko. For the second time in a week, United won a game instead of settling for a point.",
      "Carrick has shown in his substitutions he is proactive instead of reactive. He sent on Sesko with his side 2-0 up. It's the sort of attitude Fergie himself used to have.",
      "It sums up the parody of a place United has become, that an afternoon which started with a huge protest against the club's owners, ended in thrilling jubilation.",
      "While Sir Jim Ratcliffe & Co were getting hammered with dog's abuse, Carrick's name was being serenaded.",

      "Manchester United manager Michael Carrick celebrates with Benjamin Sesko after his Fulham winner(Image: 2026 Visionhaus)",
      "Carrick is not one to get carried away, while the ownership issues are not his concern. But three straight victories since taking charge have left him in serious danger of getting the job permanently in the summer. And anyone who can get Sesko scoring world class winning goals, has to be some sort of managerial genius.",
      "There is still a long way to go, of course. This is Manchester United we're talking about. A bloody nose is never that far away.",

      "Tyrell Malacia will remain at Manchester United(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "Tyrell Malacia is thought to be fuming with Manchester United after Jason Wilcox blocked a deadline day move away from Old Trafford. The 26-year-old has been overlooked with the Red Devils this season, with just one Premier League appearance to his name for 2025/26.",
      "As a result, speculation has been rife this month that the left-back could be on the move in the winter transfer window. While it is thought that Malacia was set to make his way to Turkey on Monday for a medical, insiders claim that he received a call from Wilcox just before boarding his flight to tell him that he would remain with his current club.",
      "The Dutch defender could also find himself a part of Michael Carrick's plans for the rest of the season, given United's stance on deploying him may have changed as a result of Patrick Dorgu's recent injury. Dorgu picked up an issue during United's 3-2 win over Arsenal last month, with reports suggesting he could be out of action for up to 10 weeks.",
      "While Carrick was recently unable to put a timeline on Dorgu's recovery, the interim head coach has conceded that he faces a spell away from playing. He said in a press conference: \"Pat, unfortunately, is going to be out for a period of time. We are still working through how long that is going to be.\"",
      "Retaining Malacia could be a move which proves problematic in a matter of months, given his current deal with the club expires this summer. As a result, he will be able to leave on a free should relationships fail to be mended.",
      "It comes as Malacia was included in a five-man 'bomb-squad' under Ruben Amorim prior to his sacking in January, alongside Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho. He was also the only player who failed to secure a move away from the club last summer.",
      "Jason Wilcox is reported to have blocked a deal for Tyrell Malacia(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Rashford is currently thriving on a season-long loan spell with Barcelona, while Sancho is enjoying a similar scenario with Aston Villa. Garnacho, meanwhile, secured a permanent transfer to Chelsea to the tune of £40million, while Antony joined Real Betis for up to £21.65m.",
      "It seems as though Carrick is happy to put his faith in his current crop of players for the second-half of 2025/26, with very little in terms of activity in the current transfer window - which slams shut at 7pm. The 44-year-old has been a breath of fresh air in his first three games at the helm of the Red Devils - overseeing a 2-0 win over Manchester City, a 3-2 win over Arsenal, and a 3-2 win over Fulham.",
      "However, speculation regarding his future at Old Trafford beyond 2025/26 remains. Given he is only on an interim deal until the summer, United have no obligation to keep him on, regardless of his performances this term.",

      "Instead, they could opt to put their faith in a more seasoned head coach when they reassess their options in a matter of months, with Oliver Glasner, Roberto De Zerbi and Thomas Tuchel seeing their names brought up in conversation as of late.",

      "Manchester United's improvement under Michael Carrick has meant a quiet January transfer window(Image: Neal Simpson/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are sending James Scanlon on loan to Swindon Town for the remainder of the season. United have already secured multiple exits for youngsters in an otherwise quiet January transfer window and Scanlon is set to be the next player to leave.",
      "The 19-year-old winger has got the green light to join Swindon’s push for promotion from League Two under manager Ian Holloway. Town sit sixth in the table, three points off the automatic promotion positions, and are keen to add attacking threat.",
      "Scanlon already has 20 caps and two goals for Gibraltar to his name and is ready for senior football, having been a regular for United’s academy sides. The winger has eight goals and five assists in 47 games for the under-21s, having been prolific for the under-18s after joining from Derby County in 2021.",
      "United’s connection to the academy has been strengthened in the past month following the departure of Ruben Amorim. Michael Carrick has been appointed as interim boss until the end of the campaign, with under-21s boss Travis Binnion among his coaching staff.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Scanlon is yet to make an appearance for the United first team and is behind the likes of Shea Lacey in the pecking order. The winger’s brother, Luca Scanlon, is a midfielder and was also previously in the United academy before leaving for Burnley last year.",
      "United have had a quiet January transfer window, having splashed over £200million to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in the summer. The departure of Amorim – and the immediate improvement under Carrick – has prompted the hierarchy to hold fire on deals until the summer, when a long-term managerial appointment will be made.",
      "Instead, the club has prioritised exits of young players. Toby Collyer has been sent on loan to Hull City and Harry Amass to Norwich following previous loans at West Brom and Sheffield Wednesday respectively.",
      "James Scanlon is leaving Manchester United on loan(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Meanwhile, Rhys Bennett was sold to Fleetwood Town, Joe Hugill departed permanently for Kilmarnock and Sam Mather terminated his contract in order to join Turkish side Kayserispor on a free transfer.",
      "Carrick had left the door open for further deals when asked ahead of the 3-2 win over Fulham on Sunday. “Never say never. A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up,” he said. “Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes not. I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team.”",
      "He was also asked about the future of captain Bruno Fernandes. “We all want to win things. We all want to get better. We want to improve as a team,” Carrick added. “We want to be successful and that's something we've got to work towards together, but Bruno's been fantastic since I've been here. He was fantastic when I was here before, so I've got nothing but good things to say about him.",
      "“That's not to get too far ahead, you know. That's [his future] on the agenda a little bit, but my main agenda is getting through the game on Sunday with Fulham. Bruno's fully committed. There's absolutely no issues at all with that. Things further down the line [will be] addressed towards the end of the season or whatever. But now everything's positive at the moment.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jeremy Jacquet is closing in on a transfer to Liverpool(Image: Jean Catuffe, Getty Images)",
      "Liverpool transfer target Jeremy Jacquet has demonstrated the mentality that Anfield chiefs will be acquiring should they seal a deadline-day swoop for the defender. The Rennes star is edging closer to a late switch to Merseyside, with the Reds aiming to finalise a deal before the 7pm cut-off point before sending him back to the French top-flight outfit on loan for the rest of the campaign.",
      "The club have fended off interest from rivals including Chelsea and Manchester United and struck an initial £55million agreement with Rennes plus £5million in performance-related bonuses. Jacquet is understood to have been won over by the vision presented by Liverpool, with reports suggesting that he believes he will secure more opportunities at Anfield.",
      "If accurate, this wouldn't be the first occasion in his fledgling career that Jacquet has made playing time his priority. The youngster stepped down a division to join Ligue 2 outfit Clemert on loan in January 2024.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe, via Ligue 1 last year, Jacquet discussed that choice. \"It was either stay at Rennes with little playing time or go and discover something new,\" he said.",
      "\"I chose minutes on the pitch - and it paid off.\"",
      "He was brought back in February last year, having racked up 24 appearances for the club. The 20-year-old has subsequently cemented himself as a first-team regular at Rennes, ahead of his anticipated deadline day transfer to Liverpool.",
      "\"When you're young, the most important thing is to play,\" he added regarding his loan decision. \"That came from me and my family. I didn't hesitate.",
      "\"It shows I'm confident in myself and ready to make sacrifices to reach my goals.\"",

      "He attributes his success so far to the values instilled in him by his family. \"I inherited respect and humility from them,\" he said.",
      "\"With that, it's impossible for me to act like someone who doesn't want to work.\"",
      "Jacquet has also given Liverpool fans a taste of what they can expect from him on the pitch. \"I'm calm on the ball, maybe I can look a bit nonchalant - but I'm focused,\" he explained.",
      "\"What defines me is playing out well, breaking lines with the right pass.\"",
      "He further added: \"The coach asks me to communicate more, to lead, to add a bit more aggression. I'm working on finding the right balance.\"",
      "If the transfer goes through, it will bolster Arne Slot's defensive choices for the latter half of the season. Currently, Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are the only fit first team centre-backs available.",

      "Liverpool broke a transfer record in the January window for a former Manchester United target(Image: Liverpool FC, Liverpool FC via Getty Images)",
      "For Liverpool supporters, there are few sweeter moments than getting the better of Manchester United. Throughout the last decade, the pendulum in English football's fiercest rivalry has swung decisively in Liverpool's favour, with Virgil van Dijk's towering influence playing a major role.",
      "The Dutch centre-back joined from Southampton in January 2018 for a club-record £75million - then a world-record sum for a defender - and proceeded to revolutionise the team's defence. Yet astonishingly, he had come close to moving to Old Trafford just months before.",
      "His former Southampton colleague Charlie Austin revealed that Van Dijk was in serious discussions with United during the summer of 2017. However, the Red Devils opted for Victor Lindelof instead, a choice that allowed Liverpool to swoop in.",
      "FOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Recalling a conversation with Van Dijk during his days at Southampton, Austin told talkSPORT in 2022: \"I remember at the back end of his Southampton career, we were sitting on the bench together at Chelsea away. I said to him, 'Come on Virgil, what's going on, surely Manchester United must have been in for you? They're a massive club in England.'",
      "\"He said, 'Do you know what Chaz, in the summer it was between me and Lindelof - and they went for Lindelof.' Nobody knows that. He told me on the bench and I couldn't believe it. I was gobsmacked.\"",
      "It is a decision that has tormented United in ways the club could barely have envisioned. Not only has Van Dijk flourished spectacularly on Merseyside but he is considered one of the greatest defenders of his era.",
      "Lindelof, in contrast, never quite fulfilled his potential during his eight-year stint at Old Trafford. The Sweden international was consistent but didn't deliver the same commanding presence and defensive solidity as Van Dijk has for Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United opted to sign Victor Lindelof in 2017(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Following their regret of not splashing out on Van Dijk, United proceeded to smash the transfer record for a defender by signing Harry Maguire from Leicester City in 2019. Yet Maguire also failed to match the Liverpool skipper for consistency.",
      "His performances swung dramatically, oscillating from reliable to catastrophic and being branded an expensive transfer mistake. Still at the club, the England international has since rediscovered his footing and partly restored a previously damaged reputation, though he is not held in the same esteem as his Liverpool counterpart.",
      "Van Dijk captained Liverpool to the Premier League title last season(Image: PAUL ELLIS, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Van Dijk, meanwhile, has solidly cemented himself as one of Liverpool's finest ever players. He was instrumental in the club's 2018/19 Champions League and 2019/20 Premier League victories and became just the third defender in history to be crowned PFA Player of the Year in 2019.",
      "He also came second in the Ballon d'Or in 2019 and has clocked up well over 300 appearances for the club. He was named club captain in 2023 after Jordan Henderson's departure, guiding the club to a second Premier League title last term.",

The forward also featured for just ten minutes in United's victory over Arsenal after coming on for the injured Patrick Dorgu.",

      "Manchester United made a last-ditch attempt to hijack Jeremy Jacquet's transfer to Liverpool. News emerged late on Sunday night that the Reds had agreed a deal with Rennes to sign the centre-back this summer.",
      "The reigning Premier League champions have negotiated a pre-agreement worth an initial £55million plus £5m in add-ons for the 20-year-old, having held talks with the French side over the weekend. But according to journalist Florian Plettenberg, United tried to hijack the transfer on Sunday evening but were unsuccessful, as the defender already had an agreement in place with Liverpool.",
      "Chelsea had approached Stade Rennais earlier in January about a deal for Jacquet, but the French club were reluctant to sanction a departure midway through the campaign. That meant that Jacquet had a choice between Chelsea and Liverpool for whom he wanted to join in the summer, and he opted for the latter because he believes there is a better chance of regular first-team football at Anfield.",
      "Jacquet's move to Liverpool comes amid uncertainty around the future of Ibrahima Konate. The Frenchman is out of contract in the summer and is being linked with a move to Real Madrid.",
      "United, meanwhile, are set for a quiet end to the January transfer window, with their deadline day activity set to focus on securing exits for some of their academy graduates. Providing an update on Friday, Michael Carrick said: \"To be honest, I think we're just working through it. Never say never, of course, because a lot can happen and situations can be thrown up.",

Goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha had put United 2-0 up before Raul Jimenez and Kevin restored parity.",
      "But just moments later, United were celebrating again as substitute Sesko rifled the ball beyond Bernd Leno. Speaking after the game, Carrick said: \"There's a lot that went on today in the game. I was well aware of what a good team Fulham are going into the game.",

      "There are just over four months until the Premier League window opens, and United's priority is already clear. They went into January aware that midfield was a potential area of weakness, but only tried to sign a winger.",
      "That failed move for Antoine Semenyo in December was true to United's approach this month of only going for long-term targets. With Michael Carrick lifting the gloom, Kobbie Mainoo back in favour and key players returning from injury, there was no need to panic.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "With no European football this season, United are treading a tighter line on financial fair play controls, and their quiet January should help boost the coffers for the summer. If Carrick can secure Champions League football, then that will help as well.",
      "United spent more than £215million in the summer and a similar outlay could be expected in 2026. Midfield will be the main focus. Casemiro's departure will save more than £18million a season if United are back in the Champions League, but replacing him will be difficult.",
      "The 33-year-old has rolled back the years recently and is such an all-rounder that finding someone to do everything he can might be impossible. He is a world-class defensive midfielder with a stunning range of passing and an aerial threat in both boxes. Good luck to the player trying to inherit that position.",
      "United admire Elliott Anderson of Nottingham Forest, although they will face competition from Manchester City for the England international. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba of Brighton are also on the shortlist and it is likely they will make a move for one of them, but they will target two new midfielders as part of an overhaul in that area of the pitch.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Manuel Ugarte was the subject of interest from European clubs this winter, and although United wanted to keep the squad together to enhance their Champions League push, the Uruguayan is likely to leave in the summer, so he will need to be replaced.",
      "Attacking reinforcements could also be on the agenda. Roma wanted to sign Joshua Zirkzee on loan in January and although he has also stayed at the club, an exit in the summer could be on the cards. There is also a shortage of left-wingers, with Jadon Sancho set to leave when his contract expires, and Marcus Rashford also set to depart.",
      "Semenyo would have filled that position and Carrick's return to a 4-2-3-1 shape has created a vacancy for a left-winger. Patrick Dorgu has impressed in that role and Matheus Cunha played there against Fulham, but it's a position United could return to.",
      "There could also be changes at the back. A centre-back will be targeted if Harry Maguire leaves when his contract expires and his experience and leadership would create a void that needs filling.",
      "Senne Lammens has nailed down the No. 1 spot in goal, but with Altay Bayindir likely to pursue a move to play first-team football, a backup goalkeeper might be required as well.",
      "Plans for that window will be led by director of football Jason Wilcox, with Carrick having some input on ideas even though his contract only currently runs until the end of the season. The 44-year-old knows what it takes to play in midfield for United, and getting those deals are going to be absolutely key in what is going to be a big window.",

Semenyo ticked a lot of boxes at United and would have been a great addition, but the club did not react by turning to alternatives that weren't quite right.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The message from United sources after missing out on Semenyo was consistent: United were unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets were not expected to be available in the winter window. That's not what fans have wanted to hear, though.",
      "Semenyo has scored four goals in five games for City. He is one of the most in-form forwards in the Premier League and would have provided a huge boost in the pursuit of Champions League football.",
      "Carrick has made a dream start to his interim role, winning three games on the bounce, a run that has seen United climb to fourth. The Reds are just 12 points adrift of Arsenal, despite the possibility of being dragged into the bottom half being touted in the final weeks of Ruben Amorim's tenure.",
      "Amorim's sacking did not change much regarding transfers in the window. United had a plan and they have stuck by it. They have not acted because long-term targets were not available.",
      "Semenyo was on the losing side at Old Trafford two weeks ago.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "Carrick revealed at a press conference that he would be consulted on summer plans, though. When asked whether his opinion would be sought on a new midfield signing to replace Casemiro, Carrick said: \"I'm certainly in this position to do that. And as I said, I think, making decisions for the club moving forward, whatever that may be, I'm fully committed to that.",
      "\"Naturally, as a midfielder, then there's a big tendency towards that anyway, but taking that away from it and now being where I am in the position I am, certainly would be part of those conversations and moving forward because it's important when we get the next steps right in terms of moving forward as a team and there's a squad and putting the right things in place. So yeah, I'll be part of that in the right way.\"",
      "Casemiro announcing that he would leave at the end of the season has been one of the biggest headlines. The Brazilian wanted to avoid speculation about his future during the remainder of the season, and his representatives can engage with potential suitors now that confirmation is out.",
      "The announcement was classy, befitting of a player who has enjoyed a magnificent career, and Casemiro will try to bow out by steering the club back into the Champions League.",
      "United splashed £215million in the summer window and were not in a position to sign a Casemiro replacement, who could cost in the region of £100million, in the winter window.",
      "Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are all admired by United, but they will not be prised away cheaply from their respective clubs. It will be fascinating to see how the summer window unfolds.",
      "Although Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee were marked down for possible loan exits, they will continue to contribute at United for the remainder of the season. Mainoo's situation has improved since Carrick's appointment. The youngster was hopeful of leaving on loan before Amorim was sacked.",
      "Roma were interested in signing Zirkzee, but United did not seriously entertain their enquiry. \"United said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago, and they have not changed their minds,\" said Roma's football director.",
      "Tyrell Malacia was ready to travel to Turkey on deadline day, but the plug was pulled on his move to the Super Lig by Jason Wilcox, who decided Malacia was needed at United after Patrick Dorgu's injury.",
      "Wilcox told Malacia on Monday morning that he would be needed as part of the first-team squad for the rest of the season. The Dutchman will be frustrated at missing out on a move away again.",
      "Casemiro scored against Fulham on Sunday.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "The MEN were the first to report Rhys Bennett's move to Fleetwood Town, while Joe Hugill is the only other academy export to have left the club on a permanent transfer in the window.",
      "United have banked nominal fees for Mather, Bennett and Hugill, but the club have started to insist on inserting sell-on clauses to benefit from future success. The challenge for Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is to start obtaining higher transfer fees for youngsters when they leave.",
      "Torpey has overseen the club's loan deals since Jonny Evans stepped back from his role as head of loans and pathways in December. Sources with knowledge of the situation indicated the pace of the role was too slow for Evans.",
      "There were loan departures confirmed on deadline day. Ethan Wheatley's move to Bradford City was formally announced, while James Scanlon and Jacob Devaney joined Swindon Town and St. Mirren respectively for their first taste of senior football.",
      "There is no rush to confirm Sekou Kone's move to Lausanne-Sport because the Swiss transfer window shuts on February 15 - the expectation is that Kone will stay with Lausanne-Sport for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Academy transfer activity was as exciting as it got in the final hours of the window.",

      "Maguire embraces Casemiro.(Image: 2026 Visionhaus)",
      "The winter window has closed, so what next? Manchester United already had an eye on the summer, but they have an obvious decision to make before the end of the campaign.",
      "Harry Maguire is out of contract in June and deserves a new deal. Negotiations have been ongoing, and United should make an effort to sort out Maguire's future now that the window has passed.",
      "Maguire has played a crucial role in Michael Carrick's success since his appointment as interim head coach, starting in each of the wins against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham. The 32-year-old was particularly impressive against City and Arsenal. Mikel Arteta's side are known for their threat from set-pieces, and Maguire's aerial ability was key to securing victory at the Emirates.",
      "Maguire's quality in the air alone is almost enough to warrant a new deal. There has been a shift in the Premier League over the last few seasons, with an already physical league becoming even more so, and Maguire's ability to deal with balls in the air makes him a valuable option.",
      "The England international's partnership with Lisandro Martinez has also been important. In the Manchester derby, Maguire and Martinez started together in a back four for the first time since September 2024, but you wouldn't have known. They played as if they had been starting games together regularly.",
      "Asked about the timing of Maguire's resurgence in a World Cup year, Carrick said: \"Yeah, I haven't given the World Cup much thought yet to be honest. We have got some really good centre-backs at the club and obviously a couple of young ones on the bench that have got big, big futures at this club hopefully.",
      "Maguire and Martinez have been superb.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "\"We just felt at the time we come in, the experience was important. The other two (Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven) will have a lot of games and a lot of performances in their career here, because they have got bright futures. Harry has come in after not playing a lot of football and done ever so well.",
      "\"He is what he is. A big presence, been there, seen there, done it as well. I think that helps within the group when we have got so many young players who are learning.",
      "\"I think he has had a big influence with that, and just that composure to understand the moments and not be fazed by it. He has been a big presence with him and Licha. At the back, they have given us the foundation to build on.\"",
      "Heaven performed well in the final weeks of Ruben Amorim's tenure, but Maguire has made a noticeable difference since being brought back into the team by Carrick. Maguire will celebrate his 33rd birthday next month and a two-year contract would be a logical compromise. United would have to invest millions in the transfer market to find a replacement of similar quality. And what Maguire contributes goes beyond the pitch, he is a leader and an example.",
      "Some believe Maguire has become a better leader at Carrington since he was stripped of the armband. He showed remarkable mental resilience to emerge from a difficult period in his career.",
      "Maguire's recent performances will certainly not damage his bargaining power in negotiations, and there is an argument that he is still United's best defender.",
      "The only negative about Maguire's last two years in Manchester has been a handful of muscle injuries. Still, the pros of offering him a new contract heavily outweigh the cons.",
      "Maguire's form deserves a recall to the England squad in the March international break. He has been a stalwart for England, and Thomas Tuchel would regret not taking him to the World Cup in the summer.",
      "United chiefs would also regret not keeping Maguire beyond this season.",

Malacia was ready to fly to Istanbul on Monday morning to seal a switch away from Old Trafford, having made his desire to leave the club five months before his contract expires clear.",
      "The 26-year-old was hoping a deal could be agreed between a club showing interest from Turkey's Super Lig and United, with a loan move or a permanent switch believed to be on the table. He was ready to travel should that be the case.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "But United didn't agree any deal and director of football Jason Wilcox told Malacia he would be staying at the club for the remainder of the season.

      "The decision has left Malacia disappointed, with the Netherlands international desperate to play first-team football to get his career back on track. He has played just two minutes for United this season and has been an unused substitute on 14 occasions.",
      "Malacia returned from a 517-day absence from two serious knee injuries in November 2024 and then spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven, where he started six times and made 12 appearances in total.",

He has featured for the Under-18s this season but has dropped out of the reckoning recently.",

      "With seven minutes to go at Old Trafford, it looked like being a walk in the park for Manchester United. They hadn't had it all their own way against an impressive Fulham side, but they had defended well, attacked with some verve and looked set for a run-of-the-mill 2-0 win.",
      "A little under 20 minutes later, the roar that greeted the final whistle was one of ecstasy mixed with relief. United did their best to throw away a routine win, but having rescued themselves with Benjamin Sesko's 94th-minute winner, it arguably made for a more enjoyable afternoon.",
      "Certainly, the United fans leaving the ground will remember the day more than they would have done had the contest finished 2-0, or even 2-1, after Raul Jimenez scored an 85th-minute penalty that set the mayhem in motion.",

      "That was a point made by Michael Carrick after the match, when his smile lit up his post-match press conference. The 44-year-old has been calm and unflustered in his media dealings, as he has been on the sidelines so far, but for the first time there was a sense of emotion on show.",
      "\"It's the best feeling, I have to say. Some of the best moments here that I've been lucky enough to be a part of are when you get a moment of elation and excitement like that,\" he said of Sesko's dramatic winner, which came after Fulham had equalised in the first minute of injury time.",
      "\"There's no better place, in front of the Stretford End, and it ends up meaning a bit more. I think people leave here with more than just, you know, United win today, and it kind of puts layers on top of that and the connection and the feeling, the emotion, it’s why we all love it so much and especially the supporters, so it goes a long way.",
      "\"The excitement that's part of this club, it's not always the easiest way, but certainly when they come along, it's pretty special.\"",
      "Carrick was part of plenty of wins that fit this narrative during his 464 games for the club, but it's very different doing it as a player than as a manager.",
      "When Sesko's goal hit the back of the net, the substitutes tore down the touchline to join in with the celebrations, while Senne Lammens raced from his goal into the Fulham half before retreating.",
      "But Carrick remained calm and after a brief chat with assistant Steve Holland, he tried to call back Leny Yoro from the celebrations to come on. He explained the differences between doing it as a player and a manager afterwards, revealing he always felt his team would get a chance to win the game.",
      "\"Yeah, slightly different,\" he said. \"I think when you're in the thick of it as a player, you're right in the moment and you obviously don't always see the bigger picture. You're a little bit different in terms of the attachment to the game. I was pretty calm all the way through.",
      "\"We were disappointed obviously with the second goal, but I was aware there was still eight minutes to go at that point when they scored. If anything, I was thinking there's a long time to go and we still had the players on the pitch at that point that could really make the difference for us. I was still really positive that I thought we'd find a moment.",
      "\"Listen, it's hard to hold your emotions together when the goal goes in like that, so I think we all celebrated when that went in. But, yeah, I did feel we'd have a moment. We tend to, in them type of games, you always have a moment, it's just whether you can take it, and Ben certainly did that from Bruno's great work down the right.\"",
      "It has been noticeable in Carrick's three-game reign so far that he is determined to project calm to his players. He rarely shows emotion on the sidelines, but admits it is about getting the balance right of when to let some emotion out.",
      "\"Certainly, that composure and that calmness for the players to be able to think clearly,\" said Carrick. \"It's getting the balance, and I think we've got the balance pretty well over the last three games of playing with that bit of fire and a bit of hunger, but making good decisions as well.",
      "\"I'm not sure we all made good decisions when that goal went in in terms of how we celebrated, but that's what you strive for, that's why we all love the game for moments like that, so when they do come, you're going to make the most of them.\"",

      "Ex-Liverpool and Arsenal ace Jermaine Pennant said:",
      "“I think it all depends on what happens with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“He's obviously not getting any younger. If the Saudi clubs come back in for a whopping £100 million plus, I think they may potentially think, 'Okay, thank you and bring in Cole [Palmer]'.",
      "“But I don't see why they'd bring in Cole and then have Bruno as well, both kind of the same position. Unless they're looking to drop Bruno a bit deeper.",
      "“But if you've got a player of that calibre saying, ‘I'm unhappy and I want to come to your club or come back home’, the alarm bells are going to start ringing and maybe having questions about it because he's a fantastic player.",
      "Still no confirmation for Jacob Devaney's move to St Mirren. Clubs in Scotland do have until 11pm, however, so it could be a while yet.",
      "Manchester United have one last chance to bring Cristiano Ronaldo back to Old Trafford if the rumour mill rings true, but they'll have to be incredibly quick to do so.",
      "The Portuguese great has reportedly gone on strike with Al-Nassr, leading to speculation that he could secure a last-minute move in the January window.",
      "Full story.",
      "United have also announced Gabriele Biancheri has agreed his first loan move away, and joined Rotherham.",
      "United confirmed James Scanlon's move to Swindon Town at 18.59 on the website, sneaking it in before the deadline. There's no suggestion it was rushed in, with a deal in the offing throughout the day.",
      "But always nice to be done on time.",
      "You can't accuse Manchester United of not being true to their word. For a couple of weeks, we've been told not to expect anything major to happen at Old Trafford, and that proved to be an accurate summary of events.",
      "The most exciting thing to happen in this window came in December, with the attempt to sign Antoine Semenyo in December. United stuck that £65million back in the safe when he opted for Manchester City and it hasn't been seen since. Semenyo fit United's January plan of only moving for a player who was a long-term target.",
      "Some might see the failure to secure a higher-quality backup for Casemiro as a risk, but the schedule isn't that demanding, and hopefully, the 33-year-old can continue to roll back the years. He will take some replacing in the summer.",
      "All eyes now turn to that window. Casemiro is going, Tyrell Malacia is going, Harry Maguire could go, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee are likely to go. It will be a busy summer at Old Trafford, but it was certainly a quiet January.",
      "10 exits for United this month and you can see them all here.",
      "Instead, the drama at Old Trafford came in the dugout, with Ruben Amorim sacked at the start of the month and initially replaced by Darren Fletcher for a two-game spell, before Michael Carrick was named head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Ethan Wheatley is 'buzzing' to get started with Bradford after completing a loan until the end of the season",
      "“I am buzzing. We have been in discussions for quite a while, and I am excited to get the deal done and hopefully help the lads for the rest of the season.",
      "\"I hope I can add to the side after the strong start they have made and score goals. The last couple of months at Northampton, I grew as a player, and I want to continue doing that here.\"",
      "No more transfers for the next 6 months. But let's keep an eye for those deal sheets first.",
      "Deal sheets and photographers at the ready, everyone!",
      "You're bound to have questions, so make sure you're primed to send them to Tyrone!",
      "Good news! Another #mufc mailbag is on the way this week. Get your questions in using the link below. Anything on the transfer window that was, the summer transfer window that will be and anything else on your mindhttps://t.co/hek0HlVrVR pic.twitter.com/BMgr9R5GZx",
      "Not too many enticing prospects for Michael Carrick this month but perhaps there are some experienced heads who can offer some mentorship.",
      "We look at 10 options available for free.",
      "Teenage Manchester United midfielder Edward Ibrovic-Fletcher is set to leave the club and sign a permanent deal with Leeds on transfer deadline day. The 17-year-old signed scholarship terms at Old Trafford last year and joined the club from Sheffield United.",
      "Full story.",
      "Fax machines and mobiles will no doubt be going haywire right now! Can United get any final deals over the line, even if it's just further loans?",
      "With Ethan Wheatley joining Bradford City on loan, Under-21s striker Gabriele Biancheri is reportedly close to signing for League One side Rotherham United.",
      "According to Pete O'Rourke, the forward was the subject of interest from La Liga side Real Betis.",
      "Striker Ethan Wheatley has completed his loan move to League One side Bradford City.",
      "He will spend the remainder of the season at the club after returning from his brief spell at Northampton Town.",
      "̶G̶r̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶M̶c̶C̶a̶n̶n̶ ̶i̶s̶ We are delighted to announce the loan signing of Manchester United’s Ethan Wheatley for the remainder of the season. Welcome to the Bantams, Ethan! #BCAFC",
      "United have been keen to keep hold of Zirkzee and Carrick insisted he was happy to have him in the squad again following an injury. TalkSPORT understands the Dutchman is also keen to stay at Old Trafford now having been enthused by the turnaround under the interim head coach. He is believed to be keen to fight for his place in the squad.",
      "League One Rotherham have agreed a loan deal for United youngster Gabriele Biancheri, according to journalist Pete O'Rourke. The 19-year-old joined from Cardiff City in 2023. Biancheri has scored eight goals in 21 appearances for United's academy so far this season.",
      "According to Sky Sport Italia, Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta has failed his medical with AC Milan in Paris this afternoon. As such, the move to the San Siro is off. United have been linked with the Frenchman previously but it was not expected they would move for him in the January transfer window.",
      "With United welcoming back plenty of defenders recently, it was expected Tyler Fredricson would be sent out on loan to gain more exposure to senior football. However, an injury has scuppered all hopes of that. BBC Sport understands Celtic, Aberdeen and Huddersfield Town were all linked with signing the centre-back. The 20-year-old has made four senior appearances for the Reds and has not yet had a loan spell away from the club."

      "Manchester United celebrate as they beat Fulham 3-2 at Old Trafford(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United picked up one of their trademark 'Fergie Time' three points on Sunday thanks to a dramatic late strike from Benjamin Sesko in front of the Stretford End. It is arguably the best way to win a game but, in truth, it should never have come to that vs Fulham.",
      "Casemiro's header and Matheus Cunha's strike either side of half time had put United in a strong position going into the final stages of the game. But as the game entered the final 10 minutes, the Old Trafford faithful went on a rollercoaster of emotions.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has rewatched that crazy final 20 minutes back and taken a look at seven things which happened that turned United's players from heroes to zeroes and back again.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The warning signs of what was to come were there as we entered the final 10 minutes of normal time. United were dropping deeper looking to defend the lead they had managed to build in the previous 79 minutes by playing on the front foot. This change in style meant a new role for Bryan Mbeumo who dropped into the defensive line as Fulham looked to break United down.",
      "When United did finally get the ball back, they were lacking a focal point at the top end of the pitch. In a bid to search for the ball, Sesko was dropping deeper for the Reds. This prevented Michael Carrick's side having an outlet and allowed Fulham to restart their attacks from the back. It was relentless and was only going to end one way.",
      "Harry Maguire's challenge on Raul Jimenez was desperate as he launched himself in front of the ball to try and block the Mexican international from shooting. However, the Reds were caught out too easily moments before.",
      "Manuel Ugarte stepped out to try and win possession but did not do nearly enough and from there United were on the back foot. As the pass came through to Jimenez, Maguire could do little but chuck his body on the line to try and block the shot.",
      "Harry Maguire concedes a penalty during Manchester United's victory over Fulham",
      "With Fulham grabbing a goal back, there was plenty of tension inside Old Trafford and United did little to ease the fans' concerns. Bruno Fernandes was attempting to lead a more positive, out-of-possession tactic by pressing Fulham's defence in their own half.",
      "However, his pleas to his teammates to step up fell on deaf ears with United dropping deeper in on themselves to try and hold on. This also meant a return to a familiar formation...",
      "In United's attempt to hold onto the three points, Carrick's side moved to a back three. There were differences to the system which was ultimately Ruben Amorim's downfall though. Noussair Mazraoui replaced Diogo Dalot to play right wing-back, Maguire moved to right centre-back instead of playing down the middle and Mbeumo settled into the left wing-back role.",
      "Nine minutes were added on at the end of the second half thanks to a lengthy VAR check but Fulham needed just one of those to level things up. Unfortunately for the Reds, there were a trio of errors which led to Kevin's wonder goal.",
      "Amad and Mazraoui did not cover themselves in glory as Kevin easily jinked past the former before playing a one-two with Ryan Sessegnon which should have been cut out by the Moroccan. Then, Ugarte did not sense the danger and was too slow to close down Sessegnon as he laid it off for the winger to curl home.",
      "Kevin strikes for Fulham as they equalise vs Manchester United",
      "There was nothing Senne Lammens could do to stop the shot but plenty the three players in front of him could have.",
      "With parity restored, a switch flipped in the United side and suddenly the hosts played with the intensity which gave them the two-goal lead in the first place. It was noticeable how much further forward Kobbie Mainoo and Ugarte were as United searched for a quick response.",
      "That being said, it was still a moment of magic from Fernandes who produced a brilliant dummy to deceive Calvin Bassey and lay the ball across for Sesko to fire home the winner.",
      "The overwhelming feeling was relief but the performance in the last 20 minutes will be a warning for Carrick. The Reds cannot afford to rest on their laurels, sit in and hope to see out the game. Next time, United may not be so lucky.",

      "They had thrown away a commanding position in the final five minutes, and players slumped to the turf. But an afternoon to forget for VAR had led to nine added minutes, and for United at their best, that is always more than enough time.

      "Travis Binnion put Sesko and the other substitutes through their paces under the lights inside an almost-empty stadium. A few remaining and a smattering of stewards were the only audience they had.",
      "The scene was a comedown for Sesko, who sent tens of thousands of supporters into delirium after scoring the 94th-minute winner. However, it is a demonstration of the player's commitment and a reminder of his lack of playing time under Michael Carrick.",
      "Sesko started six consecutive matches and scored three goals in his two games for Darren Fletcher before being an unused substitute throughout the Manchester derby. The striker also played just ten minutes in United's win over Arsenal after replacing the injured Patrick Dorgu.",
      "That lack of game time has also coincided with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo becoming available again after returning from the Africa Cup of Nations. Sesko, however, has again staked a claim to start after Mbeumo misfired up front.",

      "Sesko also spoke about Carrick telling the team to play with freedom. He said: \"It's true, he has said these things many times to the team.",
      "\"That's exactly what we are doing. But it's not just that, you can see how much we work hard for each other without the ball, and that also contributes to good results in the end.",

      "However, the 27-year-old was nowhere to be seen when the matchday squad was announced for Sunday's match against Fulham. Shea Lacey is on the bench in his place, with Patrick Dorgu also out with an injury.",

      "Brooks pointed to the spot in the 16th minute after he felt Jorge Cuenca fouled Matheus Cunha inside the area. Replays, however, showed that Cuenca got the ball before making contact with the United forward.",
      "Then, following a VAR check, Brooks informed supporters inside the stadium that a free-kick, positioned just outside the right side of the area, was going to be awarded instead of a penalty. This came after it was viewed that Cuenca had a hold of Cunha's shirt and fouled him before the two players made their way into the box.",
      "United ended up scoring from the resulting free-kick as Bruno Fernandes crossed in a ball for Casemiro to meet and head beyond Bernd Leno, who stood little chance.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking post-match, Silva fumed that Brooks gave a spot-kick in the first place for Cuenca's challenge on Cunha. \"Top performance from ourselves,\" the Fulham boss started.",
      "\"Second half, our team was better. The way we played and controlled the ball, they wanted to press us high but we never let them. They scored when we switched off but we kept going and scored a goal that was disallowed. It is what it is. Difficult but we have to accept it.",
      "\"The story of the game started with a horrendous terrible decision from John Brooks with the penalty he gave. Horrendous decision from that moment, big, big mistake.

      "Manchester United were initially given a penalty for a foul on Matheus Cunha(Image: Getty Images)",

      "Silva was then asked if decisions went against Fulham, after his side were then denied a goal in the 65th minute for an offside in the build-up to a close-range finish from Jorge Cuenca.",
      "\"I feel my players, I feel our fans but we have to respect and the people in charge,\" Silva said. \"I know why the penalty was given. VAR went in a completely different direction to find something to find a free-kick that was not the reason why the penalty was given.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko ended up proving to be the match-winner for United after Fulham had come from 2-0 down to pull it back to 2-2 in stoppage-time. But United snatched it in the 94th minute with Sesko firing home from inside the box after Bruno Fernandes had pulled the ball into his path.",

Indeed, just moments after Fulham had made it 2-2 through Kevin, Bruno Fernandes set up Sesko to hammer the ball into the top corner and snatch all three points.",
      "And as Sesko wheeled away to celebrate in the South-West corner, Zirkzee, who had been warming up, was the first United player to run across to the forward to celebrate with him, grabbing him and showing how delighted he was. That came as a surprise to some United fans as Sesko and Zirkzee have been battling for first-team minutes throughout most of the season.",
      "But in that moment, Zirkzee displayed his class and character by congratulating Sesko and grabbing his shoulder before the rest of his United teammates made their way to him. Even after the full-time whistle was blown, Sesko and Zirkzee had another moment together and were both locked side-by-side.",

      "The Premier League have explained why VAR made the decision to rule a Fulham goal out against Manchester United on Sunday. Marco Silva's side thought they had pulled one back in the 65th minute when Jorge Cuenca tapped home from close range after Samuel Chukwueze's shot was blocked.",
      "The ball had fallen to Chukwueze inside the box after Raul Jimenez's free-kick hit the wall, and the former's snapshot was blocked by Lisandro Martinez before Cuenca was there to prod into the back of the net. However, following a long check, VAR decided to rule out the goal as it was viewed that Chukwueze was offside in the build-up.",
      "Replays showed that Chukwueze's shoulder strayed beyond the last man - Amad Diallo - and therefore VAR stepped in and ruled the goal out, despite a delay of around four minutes.",
      "Shortly after referee John Brooks informed the Old Trafford crowd that the goal wasn't going to stand, the Premier League released a statement to explain the decision.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Alongside a video showing Chukwueze's shoulder in an offside position, the Premier League's Match Centre account said on X: \"#MUNFUL – 65’ VAR OVERTURN VAR checked the referee’s call of goal – and established that Chukwueze was in an offside position and recommended that the goal was disallowed.\"",
      "With United leading 2-0 thanks to goals either side of half-time from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha, Fulham did eventually pull one back in the 85th minute and it came from the penalty spot. After Harry Maguire fouled Jimenez inside the area, the Mexican pulled himself back up to score from 12 yards.",
      "Fulham then had the momentum and the Whites thought they had nicked an unlikely point in stoppage-time as Kevin made it 2-2 with a terrific strike from the edge of the box.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "Ronaldo had his contract mutually terminated as he snubbed interest from across Europe to sign for Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr in a mammoth pay day.",
      "There were rumours of Ronaldo being unhappy at Al-Nassr in the summer after finishing third in the Saudi Pro League and losing in the AFC Champions League semi-finals.",
      "However, Ronaldo then signed a new contract until June 2027 in a deal that is worth a minimum £492m over the duration of his two-year stay at Al-Nassr.",
      "There have been more complications in recent days too with Ronaldo frustrated that the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) are providing other clubs in Saudi Arabia with more funds than Al-Nassr.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Arsenal, West Ham, Ekitike, Glasner, Carrick, Newcastle",
      "Ronaldo has now reportedly gone on strike at Al-Nassr and was absent from their Saudi Pro League match against Al-Riyadh on Monday.",

      "The report adds: ‘Manchester United believe the striker’s traumatic departure a couple of seasons ago was a personal conflict focused solely on Erik ten Hag. Now that this technical phase is over, the board is keen to regain the leadership and goalscoring prowess that only a professional of his calibre can provide.",
      "‘Talks between Cristiano Ronaldo’s representatives and Manchester United’s management are ongoing and progressing towards an agreement that prioritises sporting considerations over financial ones. To facilitate his return, the Portuguese forward is willing to make a historic financial sacrifice, accepting a drastic reduction in his current salary in the Middle East.’",
      "Ronaldo’s ‘willingness to force a move greatly facilitates the work of the British negotiators’ and Man Utd have made a ‘decision to offer him a short but intense contract’.",
      "It is understood that Man Utd ‘is awaiting the end of the Saudi Arabian season to finalise the paperwork and officially announce the most anticipated return in the last decade of world football’.",

      "Jeremy Jacquet is not the only centre-half confirmed to be joining Liverpool this summer, with ‘the next Mane’ also headed to Anfield in January 2028.",
      "The 2026 January transfer window was busy enough, but teams are using the opportunity to pre-arrange transfers years in advance now to steal a march on their rivals too.",
      "Chelsea are chief among them but plenty of other sides are indulging in the practice. These are the upcoming transfers sorted for future windows involving Premier League clubs.",
      "",
      "Manchester United were not thrilled to see an obvious target move elsewhere, Ruben Amorim and one of his roaming Sporting wing-backs having been linked for months with a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",
      "",
      "The cousin of Arsenal centre-half Gabriel, attacking left-back Denner will join him in London some time after his 18th birthday next February.",
      "Chelsea swooped in despite the Brazil youth international star having not yet made his senior debut for Corinthians.",
      "Of course there is a seven-year contract, add-ons and a sell-on clause.",
      "",
      "There is an inevitable shroud of mystery surrounding Chelsea basically poaching their sister club’s best player and captain, down to the uncertainty as to how much they are even paying for 22-year-old forward Emegha.",
      "Strasbourg fans are inevitably furious, dissatisfied with president Marc Keller’s explanation that promising Emegha a move if he led them into Europe with the armband in one more season was “the only way to keep him”.",
      "The Dutchman has struggled with injury throughout his final season however, scoring four goals in just seven Ligue Un games.",
      "",
      "Perhaps fearful of yet another hijack in their infernal transfer war with Chelsea, Liverpool arranged the arrival of their shiny, brand new Jacquet a few months early.",
      "A centre-half who was playing in Ligue 2 for most of 2024/25 was always likely to line up in the Premier League in 2026/27, but Liverpool’s defensive desperation and willingness to allow Jacquet to finish his only full season as a Rennes regular pushed them over the line first.",
      "They will not mind one bit if the final deal reaches a value of £60m when performance-related add-ons are triggered.",
      "",
      "It is a fee which could rise exponentially with various bonuses and even a sell-on clause, even if it does already represent a record for the most money ever paid to sign an U18 player in Austria.",
      "That is a slightly caveated bar to raise but it underlines how much Liverpool believe in the hype surrounding 6ft 6ins teenage centre-half Ndukwe, who has been earning rave reviews for some time now.",
      "Arsene Wenger is thought to be among his admirers, considering Ndukwe to be among the best defenders he has ever seen at that age. It doesn’t feel like sitting under the Virgil van Dijk learning tree could do much harm.",
      "",
      "The latest in a lengthening line of young defenders signed from across Europe, teenage centre-half Cisse will spend one more season in Austria before joining up with Villa ahead of next season.",
      "“This marks a major step in my career, but I know the real work starts now,” Cisse said. “The Premier League is a dream – not every player gets this opportunity.”",
      "Playing alongside John McGinn remains a tantalising prospect for most professionals.",
      "",
      "It is a record sale for the Kazakh Premier League and a relatively modest five-year deal with a 12-month option at the end. But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",
      "",
      "Arsenal were linked with Mason Melia as part of their drive to become a landing spot for Ireland’s best young talents. They lost out in that race to Spurs in January but managed to secure a pre-contract deal with Ohzianvuna.",
      "Club Brugge offered an immediate exit and path to the first team while Arsenal cannot bring the versatile midfielder in until after he turns 18 in January 2027, but all parties felt another year or so developing in Ireland before moving would be beneficial.",
      "Ozhianvuna will join on a four-and-a-half-year contract with add-ons which could double the initial fee and a sell-on clause, having caught Arsenal’s eye during a 2023 summer tournament staged at the club’s academy, while impressing in some LOI cameos and even the Conference League.",
      "",
      "“I can’t even believe you will be playing at sort of that level with pressure on you at 15,” said Gary Neville, who also implored the world to “definitely just let him breathe, let him enjoy himself” and not “put too much pressure on him”.",
      "Sullivan signed the richest homegrown contract in MLS history at just 14, contained within which is a clause tying him to a pre-arranged transfer to Manchester City when he turns a positively ancient 18.",
      "The midfielder has built quite the reputation on the youth scene at club and international level, attracting interest from Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.",
      "But Sullivan himself cited the lure of signing for Union, with whom he has familial ties, with an in-built pathway to Europe when he has been given time and patience to develop.",
      "",
      "While Rio Ngumoha is all the rage now, the 17-year-old will be practically over the hill and retired soon enough and there is a perennial need to source the next prodigy.",
      "Ndiaye is over a year younger and recently caught the eye at the U17 AFCON, featuring in every game for a Senegal side knocked out on penalties in the quarters.",
      "Liverpool quickly moved to secure the future of a boy predictably dubbed ‘the next Mane’, who spent time training with the club this summer and even made a couple of impressive appearances for the U18s.",
      "A forward who can play on either side, Ndiaye is ineligible to join until after his 18th birthday. That is, ludicrously enough, not for another two years and four months.",
      "",
      "It has not been revealed either how much Chelsea will pay for Ordonez, nor the precise length of the presumably ludicrous long-term contract he will sign, but the 16-year-old’s arranged marriage to the Blues has been confirmed.",
      "The centre-half will have to wait until the first transfer window after he turns 18 to make his move to the Premier League.",
      "Liverpool were said to be interested and the Daily Mail even referenced youth scouts calling Ordonez ‘the best player of his age-group in the whole of South America’.",
      "But Chelsea won the race for the latest player coming off the same product line as Moises Caicedo, Kendry Paez, Piero Hincapie and Willian Pacho.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may yet follow that path. If/when that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "But a couple of wins have eased the pressure on Nuno – a couple of wins really is all it takes to transform this market currently – and  even a grim point at Burnley is enough to save Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there, despite an absurd and very Spurs draw against Man City.",
      "And it now looks like Arne Slot rather than Frank or Nuno will be the latest ‘winner’ here as Liverpool’s fraudulent unbeaten run finally came to an end at Bournemouth, who like West Ham, have been rejuvenated by Frank and Dr Tottenham.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 15 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "A sticky run has brought that talk to an end. There’s obviously no shame in not managing to stick around as unlikely title challengers for longer, but some frustration at the manner in which their charge has been halted. Home defeats to Everton and Brentford, given the fortress Villa Park had become, is a bit of a limp end to a game old fight.",
      "But they’re still very much on course for another crack at the Champions League and they’ve also qualified unfussily for the last 16 of a very winnable Europa League. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season and Villa now sorted out home, away and in the Carabao, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "That Brentford now sit cosily in Europe-adjacent upper mid-table, seven points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures, is quite something.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Seven wins and two draws in 13 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between about seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool and victory at Wolves.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation a distant memory after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin; getting slapped silly a second time by Arsenal suggests maybe not.",
      "February is a huge month for Leeds and Farke in the league; a proper blood-and-thunder six-pointer against Nottingham Forest and then three of the current top five.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa had Howe once again under fire before a tame surrender at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford has given Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy.",
      "",
      "It was quite a 2025 for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, for neither the first nor last time, Tottenham have come to the rescue. The momentum from a job-saving win at Spurs was parlayed into an even more impressive win over Sunderland and, despite the horrific late gut-punch, there was enough about the defeat at Chelsea to suggest the Hammers can at least drag some of the other stupid teams into the equation.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other Big Six team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down. Palace are currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They are without a win in 11 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth, although an impressive win over Newcastle has been enough to knock Slot off top spot.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It is West Ham’s (admittedly Spurs-assisted) resurgence and with it the very real danger of relegation that might finally get the Spurs board to see what has been alarmingly obvious to the fans for many weeks now.",
      "The fact a draw at Burnley appears to be enough to keep him in place for another week is damning. And if that got him a week, it seems only fair that another draw against Man City gets him the rest of the season.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "You won’t see a bigger Game of Two Halves, which seems to be a theme for Thomas Frank’s Spurs. Sunday’s 2-2 draw with Man City was completely bizarre.",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank is doing everything to block two January exits despite uncertainty around his job, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have decided on a ‘clear boundary’ that would ‘force’ them to part ways with under-fire head coach Thomas Frank.",

      "One point from three games against what are now Spurs’ relegation rivals has Thomas Frank on the thinnest of ice. Who could replace him?"

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "Mikel Arteta is level-headed enough to let that infernal battle play out away from the Emirates. While the pundits deliver their latest hot takes and rivals line up to set up Arsenal for the ultimate fall, his reframing of this run-in as “fun” and something to “enjoy” after the nervousness which encapsulated the loss to Manchester United was wise.",
      "They will drop points again and there will be panic. But Arsenal responding to all three of their Premier League defeats so far with victory in their very next game is telling.",
      "Their closest rivals drew with a bottom-half side decimated by injury and lost at home to 10 men. The reaction to Manchester City and Aston Villa’s slips generated a fraction of the fume and mockery that met Arsenal’s recent wobble (of one defeat in nine games).

      "“It’s a football situation where he tells me to do one thing and I tell him the substitution wasn’t bad, but I’d do it with someone else,” the West Ham assistant said of his touchline tiff with Nuno Espirito Santo, who sought to close out a win over Sunderland by reaching for his Max Kilman-shaped comfort blanket.",
      "It was the second consecutive win in which Kilman had been brought on in stoppage time to shore things up. While the Hammers held on in both games, half an hour with a slender lead away at a resurgent Chelsea felt like a sub-optimal time to introduce the goal concession magnet.",
      "There was no specific individual blame to hand out for either of Chelsea’s goals thereafter, but trying to soak up pressure for that long, against that team, in that stadium and those circumstances, was certainly a choice.",
      "It would have been risky for a manager who had orchestrated at least one solitary clean sheet since April 1. That Nuno has failed to do so in his last 32 games in charge of West Ham and Nottingham Forest could well prove terminal to their survival hopes.",
      "No club has dropped more points from winning positions this season than West Ham. Add just one third of the 18 they have squandered and the Hammers would be level with Forest and Leeds. Either the coach or the players need to learn how to manage a game properly.",

      "There it is.",
      "Oliver Glasner “would prefer not to be talking the day before the deadline about transfers”. His wish was “that everything had been sorted two weeks ago, so we could train and focus on development”. His belief is that Crystal Palace “are starting again from two years ago, having to teach them how we want to play and how we want to attack”.",
      "The Nottingham Forest draw was a difficult lesson in that regard: 45 chastening minutes being out-played by the side in 17th with 10 men cannot be entirely blamed on having to wait one entire day of January before spending £35m on Brennan Johnson.",
      "It just isn’t going to work. The resentment he still carries against a hierarchy identifying potential signings to both appease a coach who is leaving in a matter of months and to suit his successor is clear, and having an obvious impact on the pitch.",
      "Glasner feels they are “taking a step backwards” by recruiting players in mid-season and having to indoctrinate them in his ways while in the weeds of a 12-game winless run.",
      "But his rudimentary inability to coach against low blocks feels like a bigger problem: since the start of last season, Palace have had more than 50 per cent possession in 14 Premier League games, and won only three of them (with 55 per cent v Ipswich, with 53 per cent v Spurs and with 52 per cent v Wolves).",
      "With 67 per cent on the ball against Nottingham Forest, their issues – albeit without progressive ball players the calibre of Adam Wharton and Daichi Kamada – were laid painfully bare.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe can pretend all he likes that “PSR is controlling what we’re able to do, and you’ll understand that gives us limited room to manoeuvre – to try to bring a player in who is good enough to elevate the group and to have a long-term future at the football club, with the finances we have available, is very difficult”.",
      "But it rings hollow when your bench at Anfield is occupied by two centre-forwards signed in the summer for a combined £120m, watching three wide forwards buzz around in an eternal 4-3-3.",
      "Howe has to find another way of coping, especially against this calibre of opposition. Newcastle have won a single game out of eight against the current top six; the only clubs with fewer points from matches against Arsenal, Manchester City, Aston Villa, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool this season than the Magpies (five) are the bottom three.",
      "This was meant to be the season Newcastle properly challenged the foundations of the elite, armed with a trophy, Champions League qualification and a record level of investment. Between last summer and this season, the sheer depths of that gap have only been emphasised.",
      "",
      "It feels like this is precisely what Unai Emery meant when he told everyone to shut up about the title and said Aston Villa “are still not being contenders” for the top five as “there are other teams with more potential than us”.",
      "One home defeat to 10-man Brentford with Tammy Abraham leading the line and two substitutions being made while chasing the game later, and Jamie Redknapp need no longer performatively pretend not to understand the point.",

      "It was an important test for Carrick but also an important lesson. Chelsea and Liam Rosenior learned that resting your best players is dangerous, and Carrick learned that taking them off, even at 2-0, is also pretty dangerous.",
      "Casemiro, Ruben Amorim’s biggest success story, continues to impress and staked a claim for the club to extend his contract beyond this summer with a goal and an assist. However, the control United had was lost when he came off. The Brazilian has come a long way from that night at Selhurst Park, becoming an indispensable player who apparently can’t miss any minutes whatsoever.",
      "His goal was an outstanding back-post header from a Bruno Fernandes free-kick following a Jorge Cuenca shirt-pull on Matheus Cunha, which United initially thought was going to be a penalty after Cuenca’s sliding tackle on Cunha. The replays suggested a goal kick was more likely, and we’re sure Marco Silva will have something very interesting to say.",
      "Goal contributions aside, it was a commanding midfield performance from Casemiro. He and Mainoo provide a lovely balance in the middle of the park, and with Bruno Fernandes in front of them? Chef’s kiss.",
      "For Carrick, it has genuinely been a case of playing your best players in their best positions and standing in the technical area with your hands behind your back as a well-functioning XI do their thing. And from now on, he will play his best players for even longer. Amazingly, that is a better idea than bringing on Manuel Ugarte.",
      "While it was a scare for United and could have prompted a very different reaction from us, Carrick’s perfect start continued. It was comfortable for the most part against weaker opposition in good form, which tells us more about Carrick and United’s credentials than wins against the Premier League’s top two, especially when these were the fixtures the previous manager struggled with most.",
      "It’s two wins from two at Old Trafford and an away win against the league leaders, who hadn’t lost at home all season before United’s brilliant 3-2 victory. That also happened to be the first time Arsenal and their rock-solid defence have conceded three goals in a match since December 2023.",
      "Two whole calendar years without conceding three goals in a game is quite something. For all the talk of Arsenal capitulating, Carrick deserves huge credit for that victory, not just the brilliant start he has made.",
      "Aston Villa might want to look over their shoulder as Carrick’s United soar. The players look confident and settled. Everyone is contributing. The partnerships are working well all over the pitch. For once, it actually looks like a football team enjoying themselves and a group of players who genuinely like each other.",

It was criminal that Slot dropped him as soon as Isak was fit; that decision also coincided with our horrendous down turn in form but I suspect that correlation rather than causation. If he were to do so again then I think fans would riot. Hugo has earned that spot right now and it should be his to keep; everyone else in this team needs to find a place around him in my opinion.",
      "The Mo drop off is so sad to watch and so hard to understand. He was through and clear on goal and forgot to curve his run to bring him closer to goal. In the end Trippier just took it off him. Is he fully devoid of confidence or just downing tools until Slot is gone? His lack of output combined with Gakpo is probably why we have struggled so much this season. Today Gakpo had these flashes driving into space but then had zero output or clue of what to do every time. He seems so out of sync with the team; once he raced into the box and then to the byline and crossed it at chest level for a defender to clear when he could’ve rolled it on the floor two touches earlier into feet for a finish.",

      "Man Utd won't U-turn on the decision to allow Casemiro to leave when his contract expires in June despite improved Premier League form under Michael Carrick; the club are forward planning and expected to chase a number of midfield targets in the summer, with Elliot Anderson top of list",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is in his richest vein of form since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth £70m in 2022. So why would the club let him go now?",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday, heading in the opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a sublime no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro has started all three games under Carrick, but made his impending departure official last month while Ruben Amorim was still in charge. United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",
      "\"Manchester United are determined not to have a short-term approach to signings and managers. That's what has got them into trouble in the past. It's left a lot of big-name players on big wages who are not part of the plans.",
      "\"Casemiro is flying right now. Player of the match against Fulham. I can understand why a lot of fans are saying: 'we're trying to find a midfielder but willing to let Casemiro go?'",
      "\"He turns 34 later this month, he's one of the biggest earners at the club, £325k a week, and Man Utd know that can't go on forever. He's playing out of his skin right now but they have to have a longer-term plan.",
      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "Tuesday 3 February 2026 08:47, UK",
      "Going into the window, the feeling was Arsenal were going to be quiet. And so it proved.",
      "They did their business in the summer - and were only likely to dip into the market if a long-term target or unique market opportunity presented itself.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta maintained they would be alive and alert.",
      "However, he also called for the numbers in a matchday squad to be increased in line with Europe. He is begging for 23 in total - and 20 outfield players. The reason? He is having to disappoint two or three players every game.",
      "With that in mind, the chance of a new signing was always going to be slim.",
      "A serious injury to Mikel Merino gave Arsenal food for thought - and they tentatively explored a potential deal. However, that's as far as it got and Arsenal will continue their fight on all four fronts with the squad they have.",
      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",

      "Benjamin Sesko came off the bench to score a 94th-minute winner as Manchester United survived a Fulham fightback to make it three wins in a row under Michael Carrick and move into the top four.",
      "Fulham substitute Kevin followed up Raul Jimenez's late penalty with a super strike to level things up in added time but, in another classic under the new boss, Sesko struck as Carrick matched Ruben Amorim's longest Premier League winning streak at Man Utd in dramatic fashion.",

      "After impressively beating Arsenal and Manchester City, Carrick's United passed another test that had its fair share of refereeing controversy.",
      "The first incident came in the build-up to Man Utd's opener as they were initially awarded a penalty after Matheus Cunha was judged to have been brought down by Jorge Cuenca. However, after a VAR check, the decision was overturned, with Cuenca clearly winning the ball, although the hosts were given a free-kick for a shirt pull instead - much to Marco Silva's fury.",
      "Manchester United were awarded a penalty for a trip by Jorge Cuenca on Matheus Cunha. However, a VAR review showed Cuenca won the ball - but a free-kick was given for the defender pulling Cunha's shirt outside the box.",
      "In that case, the VAR could intervene by declaring the decision a factual error and award a free-kick instead.",
      "From the resulting free-kick, Casemiro headed home a Bruno Fernandes delivery for his fifth of the campaign. After announcing his departure at the end of the season, the midfielder is enjoying a farewell tour.",
      "Cunha, who made a return to the starting line-up in the only change to the side in place of the injured Patrick Dorgu, thundered in to double Man Utd's advantage in the second half.",
      "Fulham thought they had pulled one back when Cuenca tapped in a deflected Samuel Chukwueze shot that fell kindly into his path. However, after a VAR check that lasted around four minutes, the goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.",
      "But after being brought down by Harry Maguire in the area, Jimenez scored from the spot, before Kevin's stunning equaliser looked like it had rescued a point for Marco Silva's side.",
      "But Sesko, set up by Fernandes, had different ideas, thumping in his fifth goal of the season. A resurgent Man Utd are now five points off third place in the Premier League. Fulham drop to eighth.",

      "Sunday 1 February 2026 17:54, UK",
      "Marco Silva claims VAR overturned Manchester United's penalty in their 3-2 victory over Fulham for a different foul because the original decision by referee John Brooks was \"so bad\".",
      "Brooks awarded United a first-half penalty at Old Trafford after Matheus Cunha went down in the area under a sliding tackle from Jorge Cuenca, but replays showed the Fulham centre-back had won the ball.",

      "The Premier League Match Centre said Cuenca's holding offence had ended before entering the box, which is why the decision was overturned, but Silva says he was told Brooks awarded the penalty for the tackle.",

      "Silva added: \"The main thing from VAR is to correct things and make it right. Definitely not to over-referee the game or go in a different direction. They are there to help the referees make good decisions.",
      "\"The offside goal is by a [small] margin. It happened with us already this season, where goals were disallowed by [small] margins. The idea of automated offside is to be quicker than it was, but sometimes it's not easy. We have to accept it. We cannot control it.",
      "\"The first one is much more difficult to accept because of the feedback we got. All of the people in the stadium felt the penalty was given because of the tackle.\"",

      "It was easy street for Man City in the first half. They didn't need to get out of first gear at Spurs. The problem was they stayed there for the rest of the game.",
      "There's been a common theme regarding Pep Guardiola's teams and that is slow second halves after being 2-0 up.",
      "Against Wolves, Joao Gomes and Jorgen Strand Larsen should have pulled a goal back for the league's bottom side but missed chances. Victor Osimhen should have scored once or twice for Galatasaray in midweek. This dip at Spurs was one too many - and it felt similar to the two second-half goals conceded in the Manchester derby",
      "Guardiola said his City team suffered emotionally after the injustice of Dominic Solanke's first goal standing due to the Marc Guehi collision. Duels were missed, particularly out wide with the full-backs, he said - and it was seen in the equaliser as Nico O'Reilly and Nico Gonzalez got mixed up.",
      "And then the excuses from Guardiola start to come. Blaming the Guehi-Solanke incident follows similar complaints about not getting a penalty against Wolves and Diogo Dalot staying on the pitch in the Manchester derby. The reality is City have been struggling in the most important parts of matches.",
      "Is it a physical issue, with injuries catching up on them? Is it too many new players over the last 12 months? It all acts as a reminder that this is not a Manchester City of years gone by. How many times in the past would a Guardiola team kill a game off early and sit on a lead, maybe push for more?",
      "They need a fix to this second-half issue quickly, as it's Liverpool up next in the Premier League. The gap to Arsenal cannot afford to get bigger.Sam Blitz",

      "In his pre-match press conference ahead of the game against Manchester City, Thomas Frank said Xavi Simons needed to translate his Champions League performances domestically. He certainly did that.",
      "The Dutchman was the biggest beneficiary of the 3-4-3 system that was forced to turn to due to the injuries that have plagued the squad. With the wide wing-backs pushing up, it gave Simons ample space inside to operate in areas he is dangerous in.",
      "More often than not, he was the go-to for Spurs as they transitioned from defence into attack. His neat footwork was at times a joy and his weight of pass was more often than not, exemplary.",
      "Having said that, the most impressive thing was his tenacity. He never gave up a fight for possession. He showed the grit needed in tough and physical Premier League games, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "This was somewhat of a coming our performance for Simons, whose quality was never questioned, but was a case of if it was suited to English football.",
      "In perhaps one of the most difficult games Spurs will have this season with regards to the pressure they are under and the opposition they found themselves against, an unsung hero stepped up and epitomised what Spurs' comeback was all about.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White was named man of the match as 10-man Nottingham Forest held Crystal Palace to a draw but Elliot Anderson was an equally deserving candidate.",
      "The 23-year-old showed all sides of his game in a complete performance which underlined, again, his status as one of the Premier League's top central midfielders.",
      "His best work came in possession in the first half as he demonstrated his technical ability and passing range, sending Forest forward on the attack repeatedly.",
      "He continued to show his on-ball value even after Neco Williams' sending-off. No Forest player had more touches or made more passes over the course of the 90 minutes. Anderson even completed all five of his attempted dribbles.",
      "But he was just as influential defensively after the break. Anderson snapped into challenges and played a crucial role in frustrating Palace, working tirelessly, cajoling and instructing team-mates.",
      "In total, he won possession 10 times, the highest total by any player on either side. He was also successful in 12 of his 14 duels. An outstanding all-round performance from a player getting better all the time.Nick Wright",
      "The draw against Nottingham Forest extended Crystal Palace's winless run to nine in the Premier League and 12 in all competitions. Shelbourne were the last team they beat, all the way back on December 11.",
      "But while that is miserable, arguably more concerning is their struggles in front of goal.",
      "Across those last 12, they have scored nine, with three scored from the penalty spot. That equates to a goal from open play every other game.",
      "Even with the absence of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was left out of the squad owing to the speculation around his future - Palace should probably have put more than an Ismaila Sarr penalty past Matz Sels - and half-time replacement Angus Gunn. Their hosts were reduced to 10 after a mindless handball from Neco Williams.",
      "But despite having 74 per cent of the possession after the break, they just couldn't. In fact, in the second half, they recorded only 0.22 xG and did not even muster a single shot on target.",
      "Right now, Mateta's future remains up in the air ahead of Deadline Day, but Palace have had a bid for Jorgen Strand Larsen totalling £48m accepted by Wolves. Providing that deal goes through without a hitch, they will need him to be firing from the off.Dan Long",
      "Aston Villa welcomed Douglas Luiz and Tammy Abraham back to the club this week and the duo went straight into the starting line-up against Brentford.",
      "This wasn't a nod to their talents, although both looked bright in flashes. It was evidence of the strain Unai Emery's squad is currently under.",
      "Captain John McGinn and top goalscorer Ollie Watkins both watched on from the stands due to injury, with Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans joining them on the sidelines.",
      "Club-record singing Amadou Onana also wasn't fit enough to feature, despite being named on the bench.",
      "The injury crisis continues to sweep the club and faltering against the 10 men of Brentford highlighted that lack of depth.",
      "Arsenal know more than anyone how injuries can impact a team pushing at the top of the table.",
      "A seven-point gap to Liverpool in sixth remains after this defeat but moving forward, Villa might need to pay closer attention to those behind them rather than Arsenal at the top.Patrick Rowe",

      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."

      "Michael Carrick will go for a third consecutive win as Man Utd head coach against Fulham on Super Sunday and goalkeeper Senne Lammens has a big role to play; The Radar column also reveals the passing stats that set Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa apart",
      "Sunday 1 February 2026 07:04, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Lammens brings calm to Man Utd💪 Konsa's passing under pressure🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United beat Arsenal last Sunday with the help of two moments of brilliance from Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu. But their goalkeeper played his part too, albeit in typically understated style. Senne Lammens continues to impress.",
      "The 23-year-old, an £18m signing from Royal Antwerp, has looked good value ever since his debut in October, when he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford, instantly bringing a level of calm Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana lacked.",
      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",
