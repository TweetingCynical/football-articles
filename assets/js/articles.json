      "Manchester United have been warned that Rayan Cherki will need a tough love approach from Ruben Amorim next season if they win the race for his signature. United are one of five Premier League sides interested in signing the Lyon star this summer – and Thierry Henry has given them some advice on how to get the best out of him.",
      "Cherki is poised to leave Lyon in the summer transfer window after catching the eye of many scouts by contributing 12 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances. He is understood to have a €22.5million (£19m) release clause in his contract and Lyon know they are powerless to resist the widespread interest.",
      "Henry has coached Cherki in his old role with France Under-21s and the Olympic team and knows what makes him tick. The Arsenal legend says that, while his talent is not in doubt, Cherki has to be encouraged to contribute defensively.",
      "\"We didn't give him anything, he got through it, and that too is the strength of a great player,\" Henry told L'Equipe. \"Everyone knows what he can do. And this season, he has shown that he also knows how to do what is expected of him without the ball, that is to say, adapt to a system.",
      "\"His problem was that he had never been able to play a string of matches to show what an extraordinary player he is. But to play a string of matches, he had to do things, defensively, throughout the duration of a match.",
      "“This season, he did it, so he played a string of matches. I appreciate this kid so much... It's just that at certain times, you had to be tough, like a father with his son.",
      "“For me, we're talking about a guy who should have been battling with the others, at the very top, for a long time to see who is the best. He fell behind because it took him a while to understand... But now, he's understood.”",
      "The statistics certainly back up Henry’s assessment. Cherki has scored 13 goals in 23 games for France Under-21s and is now expected to be called up to the senior Les Bleus squad this summer.",
      "But for now he is focused on securing a transfer, having dropped a strong hint after Lyon’s 2-0 win over Angers in their final league game of the season. He said: \"Thanks to OL, the coach, the staff, the president, my teammates and all people at the club.\""

The journalist assessed the full Spurs squad after Ange Postecoglou's men beat dismal Manchester United 1-0 at San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain.",
      "Mr Gold praised Tottenham's defending in the tie as they kept a rare clean sheet. Conceding 61 goals in the Premier League this season, Spurs's defence has been the subject of criticism. However, stoic performances by Porro, van de Ven and Udogie helped keep United at bay. A goal late in the first half was the difference and so Tottenham will play Champions League football next season.",
      "In the Football.London piece, Mr Gold gave each Spurs player a score of at least seven out of ten, except Archie Gray and Djed Spence who he said were non applicable after coming on so late as substitutes.",
      "In relation to Porro, the reporter wrote: \"Defended superbly at the back with remarkable energy throughout the contest. What a season he's had, always there for the team and now on the biggest stage.\" The pundit then added the following:",
      "\" Cristian Romero - A battling leader at the back. He took the knocks and constantly frustrated United. Was given the man of the match award.",
      "\" Micky van de Ven - Defended well throughout and then came up with a brilliant acrobatic goal line clearance to stop Hojland's header looping into the net. What a night for the young defender.\"",
      "\" Destiny Udogie - Struggled with Diallo's pace in the first half but grew into the game enormously and became an attacking force in the second period. Made a great challenge in the Spurs box before racing up the pitch with Solanke who couldn't control his pass on the run in a two vs one situation. Came off late after taking a couple of knocks on barnstorming runs.",
      "\" Yves Bissouma - Postecoglou told him he would need him at the end of the season and he certainly did. The midfielder was superb.\"",
      "Spurs ended their 17-year wait for a trophy and 41-year wait for a European triumph. It comes after a disappointing domestic season as, with one game to go, the north London club lie 17th in the Premier League.",
      "But they now return to Champions League football for the first time since the 2022/23 campaign. Speaking after the triumph, Postecoglou said: \"What ever happens, happens. We're still building this team, it's still a young team and we need to add some experience to it. We're in the Champions League. My thought process and what I've been doing is trying to build a team that can be successful for four, five years or six years.\""

      "For the entire duration of a nerve-addled Europa League final, Ruben Amorim barely stood still.",
      "He probably covered more ground than Casemiro. And he did not know whether to have his hands in his pockets or out. In fact, Amorim’s anxiety was a tone-setter for a match that barely featured a confident passage of play from either side.",
      "Amorim always cuts an obsessed figure in and around the technical area but this was different level. And quite frankly, his uncertainty, his change of game-plan - leaving Alejandro Garnacho on the bench - was one of the key factors in this excruciating defeat for Manchester United.",
      "Amorim has been afforded considerable benefit of the doubt since his appointment at Old Trafford but this cannot be dressed as anything other than a failure on his part. Let’s put it this way, if Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s brains trust does not have a thorough inquiry into this loss against a very average Spurs side, it is not doing its job.",
      "Of course, Amorim needs better players - as do Spurs - and this match was glaring evidence of that. As far as the atmosphere inside a wonderful stadium goes, this occasion lived up to the pre-match billing.",
      "As far as the standard of football expected from two teams who have lost a combined THIRTY-NINE Premier League matches this season, this occasion also lived down to its billing. The 40 minutes that preceded a suitably ugly opening goal were not bad, they were spectacularly bad.",
      "Nerves? Perhaps. But as well as being a reflection of their standing in the English game right now, it was a luminous illustration of the challenges that lie ahead for both clubs. In terms of truly elite football, they have fallen off a cliff and scaling their way back towards the top is a seriously arduous task.",
      "It really is hard to describe how poor the first half of this match was. It was a litany of misplaced passes, clumsy fouls, shanked crosses, bad decisions and thoughtless attacking. It was dire. It probably did not help that both managers had been a little conservative in their team selections and set-ups but even so, the failure to be able to do the basics correctly was startling.",
      "And most of us knew how poor these teams were. In United’s case, this was indeed further evidence that the level of squad overhaul needed is extremely high. But one player who will be a big asset going forward is Amad Diallo.",
      "For good portions of this match, he was the only player worth watching, a player with both the attitude and technique that can make things happen. To be fair to Spurs, they were missing a couple of players who have that same mindset but they were still surprisingly afraid to commit men forward.",
      "And that fear was only heightened by Brennan Johnson’s goal. With a nod to Ange Postecoglou’s famous soundbite, it certainly wasn’t who they are, mate. To sit so deep was a risk but, apart from one dramatic Micky van de Ven clearance, they rarely looked in truly serious danger of conceding a goal that would have taken the final into extra-time.",

      "There was a fairly frantic feel to the opening proceedings in Bilbao, where the do-or-die nature of the game - a match which would serve as a season-saver for the winner, and condemn the loser to one of their worst campaigns in living memory - was leading the sides 16th and 17th in the Premier League toward a somewhat manic approach.",
      "Johnson was denied by Andre Onana from a tight angle, before the Welshman's team-mate Richarlison had a shot blocked.",
      "At the other end Guglielmo Vicario flapped at a Bruno Fernandes corner, with Amad Diallo picking up the loose ball and flashing a fierce drive across the face of goal and beyond the United attackers.",
      "That early promise then largely disappeared from the game though, and it became bogged down in a deep lack of quality full of errors on both sides. Hopes for a goal centred on either a piece of inspiration or a mistake, and three minutes before half-time the latter arrived.",
      "Fernandes gave the ball away to Pape Sarr, and after the Senegalese briefly loaned it to Richarlison and Rodrigo Bentancur he swung in a cross towards the darting Johnson, who swiped and flailed at it just enough to discomfort Shaw.",
      "The ball struck the United defender's arm and dropped towards goal, seemingly via the faintest touch from Johnson, with Onana unable to claw it away. Goal. Not the prettiest one you've ever seen in a European final, but Spurs didn't care.",
      "They had something to hold on to now, but while they would have perhaps expected an onslaught at the start of the second half one never really arrived. Attempts to progress the ball ended up being stifled by the hard-working Spurs midfield and wide players, and the game remained scrappy beyond the hour mark.",
      "United weren't creating anything, and indeed their most dangerous outlet was proving to be Vicario. The Spurs goalkeeper got in a muddle with Dominic Solanke from a Fernandes free-kick, but Hojlund's goalbound header was acrobatically and brilliantly cleared off the line by Van de Ven.",
      "Ruben Amorim eventually turned to his bench to introduce Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho, and suddenly there was a greater threat going forward. Fernandes headed just wide and you knew more chances were coming.",
      "Garnacho brought a sharp stop from Vicario but it was all so poor from United, and as Harry Maguire moved into the centre-forward position as an act of desperation, Vicario saved well late on from Luke Shaw.",
      "Spurs eventually emerged as winners of the slugfest, and will quickly forget just how they did it."

      "\"I always say the defender the furthest away is your talker and your eyes and ears. He has to signal the other players. He has to shout, scream, push, whatever, and let them know players are running across them, and he didn't do that and they got punished.\"",
      "\"It is scrappy. It comes off Luke Shaw, does he get a touch? It doesn't matter.\" Meanwhile, former Spurs goalkeeper Paul Robinson highlighted Andre Onana's role in the goal. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It was a wonderful ball in from the left and the United defence couldn't deal with it. Johnson got there in front of his marker, Onana dived fumbled it with his left, fumbled it with his right and couldn't keep it out.\"",
      "The importance and value of the Europa League final has been underlined for weeks. Tottenham want to end a trophy drought that dates back to 2008 but the winner will also land themselves a spot in the Champions League and all the riches it offers."

      "Romero did eventually get back to his feet, but clearly Maguire felt that the Tottenham man was making more of the incident than was necessary.",

      "Bale had just been named the PFA Player of the Year for the second time with a number of the world's biggest clubs circling. Those in Manchester looked to land the forward, but they were soon in the midst of searching for a new manager after Ferguson confirmed he was calling it a day.",
      "Had the Scot remained at the helm then Bale admits he'd have had more of a decision to make, but his departure meant that Real were always frontrunners in his mind.",
      "The Welshman also concedes that United's squad was ageing and he feared for what the future would hold and his decision to head to Spain was quickly justified as he claimed the Champions League in his first season.",
      "He told talkSPORT: “It was a couple of times I was close to joining but it never quite materialised. I think the closest was when I actually joined Madrid. It was between United and Real, and at the time Fergie had left, so it didn’t quite have that aura.",
      "“I think the team was ageing a little bit so I felt like I’d always had my heart set on Madrid anyway. I feel like I made the right decision in the end, not to be horrible to Man Utd fans, I feel I made the right choice.",

      "But Garnacho was the last to emerge, joining the rest of the subs a good 10 minutes after they had started their warm-up. He also posted an Instagram picture seven hours before kick-off, which featured snaps of him scoring against Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final triumph.",

      "Manchester United have endured similar struggles in the league, and now don't even have a trophy at the end of it all.",
      "Gareth Bale was impressed by Spurs' performance, not least because of how Ange Postecoglou was able to do things differently.",
      "There have been times the Australian has adopted what some feel is too open an approach, allowing opponents to take advantage too easily.",
      "However, as former Spurs star Bale pointed out, tonight showed he does have another way of approaching a big game - and it's one that worked perfectly.",
      "Brennan Johnson is Spurs' match-winner, and said he's expecting a mic drop moment when Ange Postecoglou speaks to the media.",
      "The boss said he wins in his second season and so it proved.",
      "It's a win for Spurs, but will it be enough for their manager to stick around?",
      "Speaking before the game, Jamie Carragher and Roy Keane suggested Ange Postecoglou would leave in the summer, win or lose.",
      "There's one more league game to go, and after that we'll know what's next for the Australian.",
      "\"I don't think they've done enough to deserve it,\" Rio Ferdinand says of his former club Manchester United.",
      "\"Both teams were more scared to lose the game.",
      "\"The [Spurs] keeper I think made one save in the whole game and you can't expect to win a trophy like that\"",

      "Which feels fitting, considering what remains at stake for both clubs.",
      "Both managers are becoming increasingly animated on the sidelines.",
      "United remain on top, largely because Spurs have no outlet when they get the ball.",
      "Ange Postecoglou had decided to bunker down and hope for the best, basically.",
      "The board has gone up, and we'll have at least seven more minutes.",
      "Still time for United to find a goal, but Spurs know how long they have left.",

      "Ruben Amorim has turned to his bench with 20 minutes to go.",
      "It's time for Alejandro Garnacho, as some predicted, with Joshua Zirkzee also coming on.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Mason Mount are the players withdrawn.",
      "So close to an equaliser!",
      "Micky van de Ven has to be at his acrobatic best to clear Rasmus Hojlund's header off the line!",
      "It's another let-off for Vicario, who came for a high ball in the box but couldn't clear the danger. Still 1-0.",
      "United are pushing now, but they're leaving themselves open on the counter.",
      "They were almost punished, too, and a better first touch from Dominic Solanke might have had Spurs doubling their lead.",
      "It might be a cliche, but the next goal here will be huge.",
      "Bruno Fernandes swings in a free-kick from the right, and Leny Yoro gets to it before Guglielmo Vicario.",
      "The Spurs keeper was certainly second to the ball, but got his body in the way of Yoro's toed effort to keep the ball out.",
      "That could have gone very differently.",
      "Loud chants of 'Oh when the Spurs go marching in' can be heard in San Mames.",
      "Still a long way to go, but United haven't looked massively close to pulling level since they fell behind.",
      "The winner of tonight's final will earn just shy of £11m, with £5.9m in prize money going the way of the losers.",
      "That's on top of the millions United and Spurs got for their group stage achievements.",
      "And it's before we get on to the significant sums the winner will secure for next season due to Champions League qualification.",
      "Both managers are waiting to make their first changes of the game.",
      "We'll have to wait for Garnacho, Son and anyone else.",
      "Back underway in Bilbao.",
      "Some members of the Tottenham media and social media team are sat next to me in the Bilbao press seats.",
      "They've just had a little pow wow at the start of half time.",
      "A few fist bumps and all smiles.",
      "Still a long way to go, of course, but safe to say spirits high in the Spurs camp following that first half.",
      "Manchester United came desperately close to winning this competition back in 2021.",
      "They overcame Real Sociedad along the way that time, just as they have in 2025, before overcoming AC Milan, Granada and Roma.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side came up short in the final, though, with Villarreal claiming a dramatic penalty-shootout win as David de Gea failed from the spot.",
      "Did you experience buffering on your stream of the match during the first half?",
      "You weren't the only ones, with fans complaining on social media."

      "The banner in the Manchester United end read, 'We've seen it all'. They have won nothing at all. They have got the season they deserved.",
      "This is factually and undeniably the worst Manchester United team in 51 years. A team so bad they have lost four times to Tottenham in a single season. The United end emptied quickly at full-time.",
      "Players stood, dumbfounded. Amad sank to the turf and was motionless. All the bravado about United's trophy-winning pedigree counted for nought.",
      "In a season where relegation was never a tangible threat, it does not get more humiliating for United to be the wreckage above those three sunken ships in the table and losing to Tottenham in a final. The worst Tottenham team in living memory.",
      "United's followers belted out their Ruben Amorim chant louder than ever in the first half. Bonnie Tyler was played in Bilbao bars and at the stadium. If she was performing live she might have been outsung by the 14,700 red phalanx.",
      "Come the second half, it did not get a single airing. Glory was within touching distance, with the Europa League trophy pitchside at kick-off. If the glory days are to return under the incumbent United manager, it will not be until 2026. United players stayed to watch Spurs lift silver.",
      "There will be no European football at Old Trafford next season. For the first time since they re-entered the European Cup in 1993, it will be two years without Champions League football.",
      "The team that invested £108.5million on two strikers in successive summers sent Harry Maguire up front again. This time, lumping it up for the big man did not come off.",
      "This is what United get for not having the nerve to sack one manager, yielding to fickle fans, backing him in another Dutch-centric transfer window, only to replace him a third of the way into the season with a manager so far removed from his predecessor that he forecast a \"storm\". The gales are howling.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo also emerged in the last knockings, almost as if Amorim attempted to summon the spirit of Lyon. Joshua Zirkzee attempted to rally his teammates. Seven minutes were added on, much to the dismay of those in Lilywhite. They may have turned white when Guglielmo Vicario palmed away a header.",
      "After the late afternoon arrival time on Tuesday and the japes at the pre-match press conference, United's preparation looks casual in retrospect. Spurs touched down in Bilbao on Monday, their coach relished the siege mentality he cultivated and made good on his word. Ange Postecoglou can walk down the Seven Sisters Road with a winner's medal.",
      "United have not scored in 16 games this season and this was the first time they fired blanks in the Europa League. Three of those have come against Spurs, below them in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim, a stickler for pragmatism with the worst United squad since they were relegated, remained loyal to his instincts. There was one change from the team that started at Chelsea on Friday, which felt at the time like a dress rehearsal. Amorim did not dress it up.",
      "He will have to abandon that pragmatism next season. The ends have not justified the means. United are not only not good, they are not good to watch.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first couple of minutes than Mason Mount did in his 71 minutes. Garnacho, benched for the second match running for the first time since January at Stamford Bridge, did not take his final snub well. He passive-aggressively posted images of his FA Cup final goal last year hours before the team news was announced.",
      "When the United line-up was confirmed an hour and 15 minutes before kick-off, Garnacho was their only player out on the pitch, in conversation with former teammate Sergio Reguilon. The injured Matthijs de Ligt was the only other United player who strolled around the turf in their Paul Smith suit. Garnacho, one of a handful of fan favourites, was serenaded when he warmed up.",
      "Garnacho, Zirkzee, Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot were the first five substitutes to pull on their bibs and limber up at 0-0. They hurtled down the touchline again as soon as the second half restarted, put through their paces by the fitness coach Paulo Barreira. United supporters were roused by Garnacho's and Zirkzee's belated introductions in the 71st minute.",
      "Mount, picked ahead of Garnacho on account of his familiarity in the 3-4-2-1 system and experience of starting five finals for Chelsea, did not justify his selection. Rasmus Hojlund barely got a kick but did get his head to the ball from Vicario's clanger, only for Micky van de Ven to acrobatically volley the ball off the line.",
      "Come the 54th minute, Andre Onana's order to wait to take a free kick inside the United third got some fans' backs up. They will have remembered that Spurs went 1-0 up against United in both league games and kept clean sheets. A minute later, Onana was ushering Leny Yoro forward with the ball.",
      "Amorim railed against United's fast-and-loose approach, berating Casemiro after Spurs almost came a Dominic Solanke first touch away from a chance to make it 2-0. The contest doubled for a tennis match with a sudden back-and-forth rally and Amorim welcomed the stoppage for Richarlison's injury to offer Harry Maguire some advice.",
      "There was some kidology pre-match, with United selecting a larger-than-normal travelling squad and Postecoglou electing Son Heung-min to attend a pre-match press conference only to bench him. It extended to the coin toss, with United instructed to kick towards their supporters in the first half.",
      "Fernandes alerted teammates, already primed for a huddle, to the switch. Tottenham's players then walked back into the half they originally occupied to form their own huddle in front of their lilywhite-clad followers.",
      "For a contest between the fourth and fifth-worst teams in the Premier League, this was not a spectacle. The only polished piece of play in the first half ended scruffily with an own goal.",
      "Of all the contentious calls, Luke Shaw did not fall into that category. A starter in four games in 14 months before Wednesday night, he was not just undeserving of selection but undercooked. Brennan Johnson capitalised on Shaw's sluggishness with the most rudimentary of near-post runs.",
      "Shaw glared at Patrick Dorgu, also blindsided and culpable. But Shaw started the game lethargically and ended it so. Amorim got what he deserved.",
      "United got the season they deserved."

In the future, we will have time to assess everything.",
      "\"There were some times that we didn’t create situations, now is not that time, we are creating situations. If you look at the opportunities we have, it’s different players. It’s not the problem of one guy. We are not scoring goals, the goalkeeper did a great job.",
      "\"Of course, I am confident in my players, it’s my job to improve my players and to arrive in January (transfer window) to make a lot of changes was not possible because of all the problems we have to deal with. And then I had to assess the team. The problem it not just one player.\""

      "Ruben Amorim confirmed Manchester United drafted two plans for the summer transfer window before they lost the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "The 1-0 loss to Spurs in Bilbao confirmed United will have no European football for only the second season in the last 35 years and will not be in the Champions League for two successive seasons for the first time since they re-entered the competition in 1993.",
      "United are confident of signing Wolves playmaker Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and are interested in Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap, who will be available for £30m due to a release clause.",
      "\"We have two plans even for the market,\" Amorim confirmed, \"and we need to understand that is tough for a club like us not to be in the Champions League.",
      "\"But we have to use the other side. So if we have more time, we have more time to think during the week and be better in the Premier League, that will be our focus.\"",
      "United have won six out of 26 Premier League games since Amorim took over on November 11. Tottenham eliminated them from the League Cup in the quarter-finals and Fulham knocked United out of the FA Cup in the fifth round on a penalty shootout to leave their season dependent on the Europa League.",
      "Since the domestic season resumed after the March internationals, United have not won a single league game and they are winless in eight. They have slid down to 16th but Amorim genuinely believes there have been signs of improvement.",
      "\"I think I was always really honest with you guys, we didn’t perform perfect today,\" Amorim added. \"We were better than the opponent. In the second half, we tried everything with central defenders, with players wide, crosses, going inside the box.",
      "\"I’m really honest with you, there are some days where I said we were really poor, today was not the day, we were not perfect, we have a lot to improve but I'm always honest with you guys.\"",
      "\"We had some bad results, I think we improved in certain areas, we were competitive in more games we didn't score, sometimes in a small detail we lost some games. I remember a lot of games: Nottingham, Wolves, we create more chances against City at our home, we didn’t score and we lost some games.",
      "\"It’s a different way of playing, I try to put it on the players the best I can, try to help them, was really hard on the players. But I also understand I’m a young guy but I understand the chances we have in the second half (against Tottenham), if we score one, the game will be different and our press conference should be different.",
      "\"I have nothing to show to our fans, I am really honest with that. But again, I will continue to do things the way I know.\""

      "Manchester United's dismal season reached a new nadir as they were beaten 1-0 by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side turned in a woeful performance at San Mames in what was their biggest game of the season and never threatened to get back in the contest after Brennan Johnson's scrappy opener at the end of the first-half.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund came closest to equalising when his header was spectacularly cleared off the line by Micky van de Ven but United lacked quality and creativity yet again and were beaten by Spurs for the fourth time this season.",
      "It means their woeful campaign can't be saved by a trophy and Champions League qualification, and the curtain will come down on their worst season in more than 50 years at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Fernandes runs out of fuel",
      "This was Bruno Fernandes' 199th game for club and country in the past three seasons, so any criticism of his performance should be tempered by an understanding of his ludicrous workload, not to mention the fact that he has bailed out this team so often.",
      "If anything, the fact they rely so heavily on their captain and talisman only adds to the pressure. Almost every time, Fernandes rises to the occasion, but in Bilbao he just ran out of steam.",
      "His passing was wayward, including for the goal, and too often he got balls wrong as United tried to build some pressure. Maybe he was trying too hard, but this was a day when relatively simple passes went astray. With Fernandes, it is usually the ambitious, defence-splitting passes that don't always come off.",
      "Given the lack of goals in this time, it is Fernandes who normally needs to deliver. He had one half-chance, from Noussair Mazraoui's cross with 20 minutes to go, but couldn't steer a difficult header on target when he might have been better going for a volley.",
      "With the 30-year-old having an off day, it significantly reduced United's chances of winning this final. Amad was the only other game-changing, match-winning player in the starting XI and although he had a better game than Fernandes, he couldn't find the moment of magic.",
      "It was further evidence that United need more players capable of breaking a lock in this team. They controlled territory and possession in the second half, but it was predictable and didn't produce enough chances. It's why the pursuit of a maverick such as Matheus Cunha makes sense.",
      "Casemiro drifts out of it",
      "The pre-match pageantry inside San Mames, the noise from both sets of fans, the scenes on the way to the ground would have rammed home the message to players that this wasn't just another match. There was no escaping from the reality that this was win or bust for both teams.",
      "Two relatively young squads could have been forgiven for feeling the nerves and just wanting the football to start, so it was vital the experienced heads tried to set the tone early. In the United squad, they don't get much more experienced than Casemiro.",
      "This was the Brazilian's first Europa League final, but he is a five-time Champions League winner with 83 appearances to his name in that competition and he stamped his class on this contest early on, with some crisp tackles, good interceptions and forward passing.",
      "But he struggled to maintain those levels and was on the end of a fierce rollicking from Amorim around the hour mark as the game got ragged.",
      "A goal fitting for this final",
      "After a manic opening the game had settled into what you would expect between the two Premier League teams who had hovered about the trapdoor marked 'Championship' this season. It was low on quality and got a goal that was fitting of its status.",
      "Fernandes gave the ball away in midfield and United didn't do enough to stop the cross coming in and it got worse from there. On initial viewing, Luke Shaw looked most culpable, but the replays show he was marking the attacker in front of him, who was Dominic Solanke.",
      "Shaw does spot the danger that Brennan Johnson possesses and points to Patrick Dorgu to mark him. Dorgu has nobody else to worry about and steps towards Johnson, but when the winger makes a run on to Shaw's shoulder he doesn't respond and doesn't try to block him.",
      "Shaw, who had a poor first half, could have reacted quicker, and Johnson still manages to miss his shot, with the ball bouncing up to hit the United defender on the arm. It was soft, sloppy and befitting of the game.",
      "Garnacho's lonely walk",
      "The first clue that Alejandro Garnacho might find himself on the bench in Bilbao came around six hours before kick-off, when he posted pictures on his Instagram story of him scoring and celebrating in last season's FA Cup final.",
      "That might not have been designed to get everyone in the mood, but as a reminder of the crucial role he played at Wembley to the head coach who had just dropped him, despite starting all six knockout round ties until this point.",
      "Garnacho will have been disappointed by the decision, and his walk onto the pitch not long after the squad arrived was another glimpse into his own mindset. The only other United player out there was the injured Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "Even after De Ligt had gone back inside, along with coaches Andreas Georgson and Darren Fletcher, Garnacho remained on the pitch, chatting to former United loanee Sergio Reguilon.",
      "Ratcliffe and Glazers are cordial",
      "Not long after the United squad had arrived at San Mames there was the sight of the lesser-spotted Glazers on the touchline. Avram and Joel were in town for a big game and they were stood chatting to Sir Jim Ratcliffe near the tunnel.",
      "Imagine being able to ear-wig that conversation. Ratcliffe has previously said that the Glazers pretty much give Ineos free rein to run the club and they are absent landlords at Old Trafford.",
      "They do have a habit of crawling out of the woodwork for big games however and had been spotted in the team hotel on Tuesday. Sure enough, they were next to Ratcliffe here."

However, Ferdinand wants United to continue backing Amorim, insisting he needs this summer's transfer window, a full pre-season and time on the training ground to start turning things around.",

      "\"Now, not winning this after putting all your eggs in this basket, this is a disaster as well in that sense. I think rather than being emotional about it, and there will be a lot of people out there that are, and they are entitled to be, but in the cold light of day, I think he needs some time and some of those things that I have said before.\""

However, United's absence from all European competitions next season may put that deal in some doubt with Chelsea also linked.",
      "Despite United's struggles this season. Amorim shared his belief in April that United are having no trouble attracting potential transfer targets.",

      "Varane subsequently moved to Italian Serie A team Como at the end of last term, but injuries ultimately overcame him, resulting in his retirement from professional football in September.",
      "The ex-United centre-back has sent a message of support to his former teammates on X, having made the trip to watch the final. Varane posted a picture of himself at the San Mames Stadium alongside the caption: \"Come on @ManUtd!!!\" followed by two red emojis.",
      "The Frenchman was a mainstay in defence when United won the League Cup in 2023 and FA Cup in 2024, but was not offered a new deal by then Reds boss Erik ten Hag and left as a free agent earlier this summer.",
      "Sending a farewell message to supporters earlier this year, the 31-year-old said: \"To you guys, supporters of Manchester United, it has been an amazing few years to play for this special club and wear that shirt.",
      "\"The first time I went to Old Trafford as a Man United player was insane. The atmosphere was amazing. I fell in love with the club, with the fans. You have to play for Manchester United to understand what that represents. For my kids, it's home here. It is going to be a special place for me for life.",
      "\"When the fans go to Wembley it's something they remember for life,\" he added, ahead of our latest trip to the national stadium on 25 May, to face Manchester City in the Emirates FA Cup final. To share that moment with them [winning the Carabao Cup last season] was absolutely amazing.",
      "\"Despite the fact we have had a difficult season, I am very positive for the future. The new owners are coming with a clear plan and a great strategy. I will see you at Old Trafford to say goodbye in the last home game this season. And it's going to be a very emotional day for me, for sure.\""

      "In the build-up to the fixture, the significance of the final has focused solely on what it means for both clubs next season. Whichever side is victorious will qualify automatically for next season's Champions League, despite both teams set to finish just above the Premier League relegation zone.",
      "This prize is worth the most to both clubs, especially as the alternative is to be without European football next season. However, there is also the matter of winners medals and the trophy that will be handed out tonight.",
      "One of the big questions surrounding the awarding of medals is whether the likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony who both left the club part way through the season shall receive one. MEN Sport has taken a closer look at the rules and what the likely scenario is for the duo.",
      "According to UEFA, both the winners and runners-up of the Europa League will receive 50 medals for their teams. These medals can be handed out to whoever the club deems fit to receive one and shall be shared between the players and coaching staff.",
      "In the current United squad, 25 players have appeared in the Europa League prior to the final, so each one of them will receive a medal. It will then be up to United how many of the backroom staff receive a medal.",
      "When Ruben Amorim arrived, he brought five of his own coaches in from Sporting so, including himself, that would see 31 medals accounted for. Having made six and four appearances in the Europa League respectively, Rashford and Antony will probably receive a medal for their efforts this season but that is by no means a guarantee.",
      "The trophy that either United or Spurs will lift in Bilbao tonight will not be the same one that the club will be allowed to keep. This trophy is the official property of UEFA and shall be returned to the footballing body after the presentation.",

      "United's season will not be rescued by winning the second-tier European trophy but when we look back on this season in ten year's time, the result of this final will be remembered, not the torment of the Premier League. A spot in the next edition of the Champions League will be a huge achievement for Ruben Amorim considering the struggles he has had to navigate in just a short space of time.",
      "The main issue has been the squad he has inherited. This team was underperforming in the system it was built for - it was only going to get worse with an unfamiliar new tactic.",
      "Despite that, this squad has managed to rally on numerous occasions in the Europa League and it now stands on the edge of glory. Throughout this European campaign, it is fair to suggest that United have benefited from the element of surprise.",
      "Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad were not ready for the onslaught they received at the hands of United while the Lyon outcome remains a mystery to all those who witnessed it. Against Spurs, that surprise factor is mostly eradicated.",
      "This will be the fourth meeting between these two clubs this campaign and Tottenham have had United's number in all of the three previous fixtures. But while Spurs may feel they know what to expect from the Reds, Amorim is able to call on a secret weapon that nobody expected to be available to him - Joshua Zirkzee.",

      "He scored against Real Sociedad and Lyon in the Europa League and has improved enormously now he is utilised in the No.10 role. Zirkzee's injury away at Newcastle looked to have ended his campaign altogether and yet, a miraculous recovery has made him an option for Amorim tonight.",
      "If he was to pop up with an important goal to cap off the season, it would be the perfect turnaround for the Dutchman and should provide him with huge confidence heading into the 2025/26 campaign. On December 30 he was at his lowest ebb after being jeered off the pitch.",

Bale previously contributed to TNT Sport's Champions League coverage earlier this season and will be back behind the microphone this Wednesday evening.",
      "Bale retired at the age of 33 in 2023, leaving behind an illustrious career that saw him become one of the most decorated players of his generation and, in the eyes of many, the greatest British player ever, boasting 18 major trophies.",
      "Internationally, he earned 111 caps for Wales, netting a record 41 goals and guiding them to three significant tournaments - including their first World Cup appearance in 64 years in 2022.",
      "On the club front, Bale began his career at Southampton before rising to prominence at Spurs and securing a then-record £85 million transfer to Real Madrid in 2013. His stint in Spain yielded five Champions League titles and three La Liga crowns, before he concluded his playing days with an MLS Cup victory with Los Angeles FC, reports Wales Online.",
      "Even in retirement, Bale continues to dazzle with his superstar status, regularly sharing snapshots of dream holidays, glam showbiz events, and teeing off at the world's premium golf courses on social media.",
      "Here's a glimpse into the Welshman's luxe post-career lifestyle, complete with a dramatic physical transformation over time and life with his long-term love and wife.",
      "Two years after hanging up his boots, Bale's financial stature remains immense.",
      "At Real Madrid, the striker's salary was a staggering £600,000 per week, but he's not resting on those laurels – savvy business ventures ensure a steady income stream in his retired days.",
      "Bale launched 'Elevens', his own bar, in Cardiff back in 2017, followed by a mini-golf themed watering hole named Par 59, also in Cardiff, expanding the brand with an outpost in Bristol half a decade later.",
      "Despite being teetotal, the ex-athlete has made \"significant investment\" in Penderyn Distillery, taking a slice of ownership, alongside backing Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy's TGL golf league.",
      "Additionally, Bale's coffers have swollen thanks to lucrative endorsement contracts inked with titans such as Adidas, Playstation, and BMW over the span of his career.",
      "Estimating Bale's net worth is tricky, with reports pegging it around the £115 million mark.",
      "Nevertheless, the most recent Sunday Times Rich List did not include Bale in its '40 Under 40' lineup, indicating that his actual wealth might be less than £100 million.",
      "Gareth Bale wed his childhood love and former hairdresser, Emma Rhys-Jones, in 2019. The couple had already embraced three children—Alba, Nava, and Axel—by the time they exchanged vows, and they welcomed a fourth child, Xander, in 2021.",
      "The family is regularly seen jet-setting to opulent locations worldwide, with Bale sharing snaps of their holidays to Abu Dhabi, Lapland, and the United States of late.",
      "Their romance began at Whitchurch High School in Cardiff, and they became engaged in July 2016 while celebrating Bale's birthday weekend, later marrying in the summer of 2019 on the secluded Spanish isle of Tagomago. Only around 60 guests were privy to the highly confidential ceremony, and it's said they were only informed of the exact venue a day prior and had to surrender their mobiles to former SAS security personnel.",
      "The union occurred following the reported postponement of their nuptials due to \"family turmoil\" involving Emma's relatives, which included her father being imprisoned and the death of her brother-in-law. Emma's sister, Katie, is married to Welsh rugby hero Taulupe Faletau, hence Bale's relation by marriage.",
      "Body transformation-wise, Bale has undergone an astonishing metamorphosis from the young Southampton debutant nearly 20 years ago to how he appears now at 35.",
      "While he was initially \"skinny and shy\" at the start of his career on the South coast, he quickly grew in both stature and confidence, reaching his physical prime after moving to Madrid. Photos of his muscular thighs and bulging biceps soon became a sensation on social media.",
      "Even in retirement, he has maintained his impressive physique, as evidenced by photos of him flaunting his toned torso and six-pack on an Abu Dhabi beach last year.",
      "However, it's not just Bale's physique that has evolved over the years; reportedly, he also underwent a procedure to pin back his ears. After enduring childhood teasing for his protruding ears, the Mirror reported in 2013 that the Welshman had \"discreetly\" visited a top plastic surgeon's clinic during the summer to have his ears pinned back.",
      "His hairstyle has also seen changes, with his once-famous top-knot now replaced by a more trimmed look compared to his playing days.",
      "After a career spanning the Championship, Premier League, La Liga and Major League Soccer, Bale has owned properties worldwide. Last year, reports emerged that his former Madrid mansion had been sold to global superstar Kylian Mbappe for a hefty £11 million.",
      "Gareth Bale's stunning £4 million abode in the Vale of Glamorgan can't be overshadowed, boasting not just six bedrooms, a dressing room and study but also featuring a bespoke three-hole golf course in its grounds.",
      "The custom-built course in his garden replicates some iconic holes; these include the 17th at Sawgrass, Royal Troon's 8th known as the 'postage stamp', and the famed 12th at Augusta National.",
      "Bale, whose affinity for golf is no secret, often graced the greens even during the peak of his footballing days, working his way to an impressive handicap of two.",
      "Since hanging up his boots, he's been able to spend even more time on his passion, playing rounds with none other than Masters champion Rory McIlroy, who has praised Bale's natural ability.",
      "\"He has the potential to get to scratch [a handicap of zero], the way he hits the ball he could be a scratch player, but he's only played for the last few years,\" McIlroy remarked following their game at a tournament last year.",
      "McIlroy noted the difference between simply striking the ball well and navigating the course adeptly: \"There is a difference between being able to hit the golf ball well and getting yourself around the golf course and managing your game – that's the part he's learning now.\"",
      "In addition to perfecting his game, Bale took on the role of ambassador for the Underrated Golf European Tour, established by NBA star Steph Curry, and has partnered with Adidas to produce golf-related content."

The victor of Wednesday night's match could become the lowest-ranked team ever to win a European trophy, a record currently held by West Ham, who finished 14th the year they secured the Europa Conference League."

      "Spurs should not be blamed for reconsidering the future of Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United really ought to give Ruben Amorim another think.",
      "",
      "1) If history truly is written by the victors, the history of the Tottenham has been a second-hand account for too long.",
      "In the words of the scorer of the goal which salvaged from a wreckage of a season the club’s first silverware in 17 years: “We get battered for not winning a trophy, so we had to get the first one in a while today.”",
      "It didn’t feel particularly Spursy to take the lead in such a ridiculously critical final and defend it so diligently. It seemed like the conclusive appointment for Dr. Tottenham to treat an unimaginably ill patient back to miraculous health through unthinkable incompetence. The world was waiting for a moment of ultimate schadenfreude which never came.",
      "The team which finished third in a two-horse race. The Put The Pressure On merchants. The Europa League winners. Warra trophy indeed. The end-of-season DVD might be entirely unwatchable for the first few chapters but the final scenes were more euphoric than anyone dared to dream.",
      "",
      "2) It is ludicrous that from the embers of what should have been one manager’s stunning mic drop, another has delivered perhaps the single most vindicating middle finger in recorded history.",
      "“If they don’t want me, then I go somewhere else to win trophies because that is what I do,” said Erik ten Hag after inspiring Manchester United to a victory at Wembley which paved this absurd path to the Europa League final almost exactly a year later.",
      "That directly influenced Manchester United to bottle the decision to sack the manager, the ramifications for which have been severe, obvious and not yet fully realised; it remains to be seen whether this grants Ange Postecoglou the time and patience he believes is needed “to build a team that can be successful for four, five years”.",
      "“I don’t feel I’ve completed the job here,” he added. And there is a substantial difference between Manchester United collecting trophies under different coaches even in these directionless post-Ferguson years, and Spurs ending a drought which has crippled them for almost two decades. The manager who achieved that was always going to be hailed as an icon and a legend. It is almost impossible to remove emotion from that equation and until the final whistle blew in Bilbao it was difficult to compute or appreciate how much this would change the mood, the complexion, everything.",
      "This muddies the decision over Postecoglou’s future considerably and there honestly doesn’t feel like a clear answer exists any more in the same way it absolutely did at Old Trafford 12 months ago. Spurs would be completely forgiven for basing the call on one game in a way Manchester United never should have. As far as counter-arguments to finishing 17th go, few can ever be as compelling.",
      "",
      "3) Postecoglou will, either way, always have his “I always win things in my second year” conversation-ender. It has a slightly more positive ring to it than Jose Mourinho’s third-season syndrome, and thankfully overshadowed most of the talk about what Spurs should do next.",
      "The 59-year-old deserved his moment away from the idle speculation which has followed and taunted him for months. There are legitimate criticisms to be levied over a great many aspects of this Spurs season, and questions worth asking as to whether this suddenly eradicates those problems heading into next season, but far too much commentary has crossed over into something more personal against Postecoglou, whose infrequent tirades have been understandable.",
      "This is a career-defining success more than 40 years in the making. He is the first coach from outside of Europe or Argentina to ever win a European trophy, and it is almost impossible to fathom the farcical amount of barriers he has faced from the beginning of his journey to this incredible peak.",
      "“The strategy was to bring in a trophy manager and we did it twice. You have to learn from the mistakes,” said Daniel Levy in September 2023. Spurs broke Mourinho and Antonio Conte, but not Postecoglou.",
      "",
      "4) A couple of months after that revealing statement from Levy came the quote which, until now, had encapsulated Postecoglou’s Spurs reign.",
      "“It’s just who we are, mate. It’s just who we are. It’s who we’re gonna be for as long as I’m here.”",
      "Premier League leaders Spurs, down to nine men after less than an hour, had continued to deploy a high line, kept attacking Chelsea whenever possible and fell on their swords in an eventual 4-1 defeat. It was a stirring performance and message but one which summed up a naive stubbornness they could not possibly use as solid foundations upon which to build.",
      "It has not been especially relevant for some time, particularly in this tournament. Spurs have kept as many clean sheets in the Europa League this season as they have in the Premier League despite playing 23 more games in the latter, having shown a willingness to compromise and evolve.",
      "This was a continuation of the quarter and semi-final second legs: a sacrifice of principles to focus on resolute, organised and compact defending to consolidate a position of strength. It might have felt a little early for some when Postecoglou substituted his goalscorer to form a five-man backline in the 79th minute but it paid off handsomely.",
      "Spurs had the fewest shots, possession share and completed passes of any major European finalist on record. And they won. It’s just who they are now, mate.",
      "",
      "5) That makes for an uncomfortable contrast with Ruben Amorim, who might well have overseen his worst Manchester United game at the least opportune time.",
      "An ineffective set-up was compounded by a lethargic approach and a bizarre reluctance to change anything which played into Tottenham’s hands. The first substitutions came about 20 minutes too late and it is remarkably damning that the one concession Amorim seems willing to consider at the expense of his system is to stick Harry Maguire up front for the final five minutes and get it into the mixer.",
      "That worked against Porto and Lyon in this competition and Leicester in the Carabao, but even at their worst Spurs were fully prepared for the best Manchester United had to throw at them.",
      "Even after the game Amorim said he “will not change” how he operates and if that remains his stance after abdicating their Premier League responsibilities for six months in the name of a final they didn’t bother to show up for, it is worth wondering whether Manchester United should simply cut their losses again.",
      "It seems unlikely but when the £21.4m it cost to install Amorim is added to the £4.1m paid to hire and fire Dan Ashworth, the millions lost in prize money and the spiralling expenses required to rebuild this mess in the transfer window, it is increasingly difficult to envisage the manager surviving any vaguely efficient end-of-season review without the hierarchy contorting itself to justify their apparent foolishness.",
      "Of course, this is Sunk-Cost Fallacy Football Club we are talking about here, and they will plough on for at least a few more months after things become clearly untenable.",
      "",
      "6) It might be simplistic but the differences in how these two teams approached the final in the build-up alone were stark.",
      "The Manchester United pre-match press conference featured Amorim, Maguire and Bruno Fernandes all cracking jokes, while the Spurs equivalent was headlined by Postecoglou admonishing a journalist for suggesting he could be labelled a “clown”.",
      "The Australian has defended his players to a fault, with Amorim desperate to publicly immolate both himself and his squad.",
      "He also said winning the Europa League “will not change anything in our problems” and openly wondered whether not qualifying for the Champions League would be more beneficial in the long run; Postecoglou showed no shame in underlining how it meant everything to him, the players and the club itself to win it and “change things”, from their trajectory to how they are perceived.",
      "Even the starting line-ups were diametrically opposed. Spurs made ten changes with Pape Matar Sarr the only survivor, and Manchester United made one with Victor Lindelof the sole casualty. The former favoured rest while the latter opted for rhythm, but long before a ball was kicked it was resoundingly apparent who this meant more to.",
      "",
      "7) The last disparity came just before kick-off. The Manchester United starting line-up gathered in a huddle near the centre circle, oblivious to the Spurs players who walked past them to applaud and appreciate the fans rocking in the end they would be attacking.",
      "They formed their congregation in front of that riotous travelling support in a show of unity between the players and the fans. It was a small but meaningful gesture which had no bearing on the result but it summed up the fractious nature of Manchester United in 2025 that they didn’t think to do the same.",
      "",
      "8) The first 20 minutes or so were characterised by high pressing, manic defending and nervous goalkeeping from both sides.",
      "The plan for Manchester United seemed entirely contingent on getting the ball to Amad; with Spurs it was a little less obvious beyond testing Andre Onana with quick deliveries into the box.",
      "Postecoglou’s side had 13 crosses to Manchester United’s 12 in the first half. In the second half it was zero to 20 as Spurs turned their best form of attack into an obdurate defence. Cristian Romero reached such a flow state that he started a war with Maguire just to keep himself busy.",
      "",
      "9) On that note, here is a passable impression of Sean Dyche on co-commentary a minute before Crystal Palace scored in the FA Cup final:",
      "‘Against a Man United side who don’t generally require a great deal of breaking down and offer frequent gifts, the presence of Spurs’ first-choice backline may be of far greater significance than any absences further forward.",
      "‘Most obviously, Man United’s back three is vulnerable specifically to wide players ghosting in at the far post to score from crosses. They have conceded almost the exact same goal five times in their last three Premier League games – twice against West Ham, twice against Brentford and against Chelsea.",
      "‘It is a goal Spurs score frequently, with Brennan Johnson’s Temu Raheem Sterling act a genuine potential gamebreaker here.’",
      "What a shame it was a front-post Johnson ghosting which ultimately decided the game. Tickers, you fraud.",
      "",
      "10) But what a worthy goalscorer, even if UEFA’s insistence that Luke Shaw did not administer the final touch feels slightly hollow.",
      "It was Johnson’s goal in spirit either way, his run which caused communicative ripples in the opposition defence, his presence which proved such a nuisance as to render Manchester United’s eight-to-three numerical advantage in the box from Sarr’s cross wholly moot.",
      "For a player who was compelled to deactivate his social media accounts due to fan abuse in September, and who felt uneasy enough in his relationship with those supporters not to celebrate the goals he scored soon after, it was a stunning moment.",
      "Johnson’s movements off the ball might genuinely be among the best in the Premier League and this was further reward for his work. If Nottingham Forest qualify for the Champions League this weekend there might finally be competition for Dan Burn in the What A Week For stakes.",
      "",
      "11) The ball came off Shaw but there were arguably three teammates more culpable for the goal. The cross could even have been cut out at source really but a clever Rodrigo Bentancur run did stretch the play well.",
      "Maguire seemed to choose not to get a touch when he could have cleared it. Onana’s reaction time was pitiful and perhaps even specifically designed to try and make the save which never came look better. But Patrick Dorgu can shoulder most of the blame.",
      "Shaw, monitoring Dominic Solanke, pointed to Johnson on multiple occasions to prompt his teammate to mark the Welshman more tightly. Dorgu was already a step or two behind when the ball came in, and Shaw only realised when Johnson emerged over his shoulder. The way it was bundled into the net was unfortunate from Manchester United’s standpoint, but the amateurishness of what came before made it possible.",
      "A few minutes earlier in the first half, a cross reached Dorgu at the back post with no Spurs player in the vicinity, but he chested the ball out for a corner to Onana’s frustration. It is unknown whether he received the call from a teammate to take his time or simply ignored it, but for a similar situation to unfold soon after is inept at this level.",
      "",
      "12) From that point Spurs were largely content to defend, as was their right. The unheralded key to success on that front was how they consistently broke up the play.",
      "They committed 22 fouls, at least three more than in any other game under Postecoglou, with the honours split evenly across the team and Pedro Porro the only starting outfielder not to pitch in.",
      "It prevented Manchester United from establishing any momentum and reached a glorious crescendo around the hour mark, when Richarlison forced about five different stoppages in the space of a few seconds. He was a fitting leader of the sh*thousing charge.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester United never really did identify a coherent solution and much of that was down to the performance of Fernandes. So often their stimulus, the captain became a burden.",
      "It was his passes which were intercepted in the build-up to the Spurs goal, he who missed a huge chance with an unmarked header from Noussair Mazraoui’s ball in, he who caused so many attacks to break down with poor decisions executed imperfectly.",
      "His teammates should not escape censure for failing to step up and share the burden, but there was a tangible sense that this particular glare was too much for Fernandes to handle. Postecoglou did say he planned to “overwhelm” the Portuguese but the occasion and pressure seemed to do that too.",

      "",
      "14) Might he have switched places with Mason Mount to exert more influence? The England international was anonymous on the left, with all attacks filtered down the other side through Amad.",
      "The one chance which fell to Rasmus Hojlund did so through the fingers of Guglielmo Vicario when the Spurs keeper let a cross slip away, but Micky van de Ven did wonderfully to hook the Dane’s header away.",
      "Mount and Hojlund were substituted in the 71st minute as Amorim finally looked towards his bench for solutions, and while Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho did spark an improvement it was not enough.",
      "The change Manchester United needed to make throughout the second half finally arrived in the 90th minute with Kobbie Mainoo replacing Dorgu. They needed a ball-carrier, a disruptor, a change in approach from the surfeit of crosses Spurs were happily heading away.",
      "Amorim keeping five defenders on the pitch for so long when the opponent had shown no attacking intent since around the hour mark was baffling and it cost them. There was enough quality on that bench to make an impact but it was used sub-optimally.",
      "",
      "15) Postecoglou ultimately nailed his decisions in a way Amorim categorically did not. That started with one of the biggest calls of all: to leave out Heung-min Son.",
      "There were echoes of the 2019 Champions League final, when a blatantly unfit Harry Kane was given the nod by Mauricio Pochettino to start and he was predictably ineffective. Son had played the previous two Spurs games on his return from injury but could not have argued when Richarlison was named in his place.",
      "Son has been more patient and understanding than Spurs have had any right to expect over the years, but Postecoglou was right to overlook sentimentality and make a choice which benefitted the team. Richarlison justified it completely, as did Son’s shaky start when he came off the bench.",
      "When the captain did settle into the motion of the game he did his bit to help Spurs see it through. Perhaps no-one has done more over the years to earn that trophy.",
      "How apropos that Spurs and Kane ended their long waits in the same season; by staying to complete the journey Son might have overtaken the legacy of his former teammate as the best player in the club’s modern history.",
      "",
      "16) Lads, it’s Manchester United.",

      "Ange Postecoglou has hit back at a claim that he will be regarded as a “clown” if Tottenham fail to beat Man Utd in the Europa League final.",
      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final."

      "Rasmus Hojlund\nAfter half an hour he had touched the ball three times. One of those touches saw him commit a foul while he lost possession after another. The ‘not getting the service’ excuse has gone past tired to the point where even his most effusive supporters have accepted that United have spent £64m on a willing runner. They’ll be very fortunate if any club offers even half that much for him now.",
      "Liam Delap has been heavily linked and discussions as to whether he’s the best option are one thing, but there can be little doubt he’ll improve United as we’ve seen him do things like control and pass the ball on a semi-regular basis.",
      "",
      "Luke Shaw\nThere will definitely be Serie A clubs looking to do their absolute favourite of saving the career of a downtrodden Premier League star and if United can palm a guy off on one of them whose fifth start this season showed just how far off his best he now is then they surely should.",
      "Rio Ferdinand blamed the goal entirely on Patrick Dorgu, but Shaw pointing at Brennan Johnson at least twice in the few second before he nipped in ahead of him to score was pretty damning evidence that he knew he was there despite the pundit’s claim to the contrary.",
      "As was the case all night, Shaw appeared to be working at a speed somehow slower than his slovenly teammates.",
      "",
      "Guglielmo Vicario\nHe’s given plenty of opportunity at Spurs to make your pretty saves – no Premier League team has a higher PSxG outside the relegated three this season – and made a couple here, including that one in the last minute to deny Luke Shaw, but his lily-livered attempts to come for crosses make him an absolute liability.",
      "It’s a weakness that’s been targeted by opposition teams to good effect for at least the last year, and his bid to catch what looked like a very simple high ball ahead of Micky van de Ven’s extraordinary goal-line clearance from Rasmus Hojlund’s header showed that presumed work on the training ground has not made the required difference to remedy a flaw that will continue to be earmarked as a means to hurt and score against Spurs.",

      "",
      "Andre Onana\nWe were staunch defenders of him for a long time but the blunders against Lyon in the first leg of their bonkers quarter-final which appeared to be the point that Ruben Amorim and United decided he wasn’t for them was also the point we backed down. That said, let’s not pretend he was at fault for the goal.",

      "Casemiro\nThe five-time Champions League winner claimed this has been “one of the most successful seasons of my career”. An absurdly bold statement in isolation but less so when paired with his “for turning things around” explanation.",
      "He has indeed been key to United reaching the final, scoring in both legs of the semi against Athletic Club and claiming two assists in a Man of the Match display in the mad 5-4 second leg win over Lyon, and if United had won here we’re sure the Leader narrative would have seen Red Devils fans welcome the continued £350,000 per week outlay, but not now.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero\nRomero is a very good footballer but we’ve never been convinced he’s a very good defender and with his head and heart already in Spain over the last few months he’s largely  given up on that aspect of the game that he deems beneath him at the best of times.",

      "Spurs’ £50m asking price represents a significant markup, even from the £33m they paid Sporting in 2023, and quite the coup if they can get it for a footballer who has retained his value after a standout first season at the club through an inauspicious second campaign in which his quality on the ball has been good in the main but his defending has been found wanting on multiple occasions.",
      "That wasn’t the case here, with Mason Mount getting little-to-no change out of him and Garnacho’s introduction not as significant as it first looked as though it might be. His departure wouldn’t be an axing but a means to bring in some cash to put to far greater use to the team if reinvested elsewhere, with Djed Spence proving himself perfectly capable of taking Porro’s spot in the team moving forward.",

      "Manchester United have got “a real baller” on their hands in Joshua Zirkzee, who’s been tipped to become a “superstar” under Ruben Amorim by a former Red Devil despite being ‘up for sale’.",
      "Zirkzee joined United from Bologna for £36.5m last summer and has managed just seven goals and three assists in a debut season which featured him being jeered off by his own fans during a defeat to Newcastle in December.",
      "His performances before suffering injury in mid-April were more positive though, certainly better than those of fellow striker Rasmus Hojlund, and Lee Sharpe reckons with a consistent run in the side the “real baller” can become a “superstar” at Old Trafford.",
      "“I like Zirkzee – he was unfortunate to get injured when he did, but he’s a real baller and I think he can be a superstar for Manchester United if he can get games under his belt,” Sharpe told Metro via Coin Poker.",
      "“He needs a regular run. I don’t think he’s had a 10-game stint where he has actually played week in, week out.",
      "“There were reports that he wasn’t quite fit when he signed, so it took him a bit of time to get up to speed. I think he was just finding his feet when he got injured but I think he’s going to prove a real key player next season.”",
      "Zirkzee made a shock return to training this week but the Europa League final clash with Spurs may have come too early for the Dutchman.",
      "Football Insider claim United have put both Zirkzee and Hojlund are ‘up for sale’ ahead of the summer transfer window in order ‘to make way for top striker target Liam Delap’.",
      "The report states that the Ipswich striker is ‘set to arrive at Old Trafford in a £30million deal with United in pole position to secure his signature ahead of Chelsea and Everton’.",
      "It is understood that at least one of Zirkzee or Hojlund will need to be sold ‘to free up space in the squad and raise funds for further summer business’.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s arrival at Old Trafford in a £62.5m transfer from Wolves looks to have been sewn up and Sharpe believes both he and Delap will be good additions to Amorim’s squad.",
      "“I think both players look like good acquisitions,” Sharpe added.",
      "“I’ve seen Delap a few times this season and he’s a good, big strong typical number nine. He holds the balls up well, which is what you need in any team but he also knows where the goal is and puts defenders under pressure.",
      "“He’s still young enough to improve and for the position United are in – not quite challenging for the league but looking towards that top six – and I think he would be an ideal signing.",
      "“Cunha speaks for himself. In a team like Wolves, which have struggled at points this season, he’s been the standout player.",
      "“He’s a little bit like Kobbie Mainoo in that he can beat players, create a chance and score a goal. I’d like him to calm his temperament down at times – you don’t want him getting sent off and costing his team games just because he’s losing his rag – but ability-wise I think he’s really good and a great addition to the squad.”",

      "The former Liverpool target’s second season at Stamford Bridge has been far stronger than his first and he’s one of the few huge Todd Boehly-era signings to pay off. He’s not quite justified the £100m player tag yet, but he’s getting there. He is Chelsea’s player of a poor season.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "The Red Devils have a lot of work to do during this summer’s transfer window as they look to make wholesale changes to their squad.",
      "This is required with Man Utd’s current squad not fully suited to Ruben Amorim‘s preferred 3-4-3 formation, while most of their players have not done enough to justify sticking around beyond this summer.",
      "Results in the Premier League have been abysmal this season as they could finish 17th, but they could still salvage something from this campaign as they face Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "A trophy, Champions League football and a huge injection of cash are up for grabs in the Europa League final, so a victory should set Man Utd or Spurs up for a significant upturn heading into next season.",
      "READ: Man Utd and Spurs so stupid they’ve broken the supercomputers ahead of Europa final",
      "Man Utd are currently miles away from challenging for the Premier League title, with upgrades required in most positions.",
      "It has been widely reported that United’s priority is to strengthen in forward positions this summer, with Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap among their preferred targets.",
      "Now, a report from The Times claims Man Utd ‘will have £100m to spend even if Spurs win the final’, though club chiefs believe this budget could reach £200m via selling Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "The report deems this viewpoint a ‘tad optimisic’, with Chelsea and Aston Villa not guaranteed to sign Sancho and Rashford permanently. Regarding Sancho, it’s noted that Chelsea ‘could prefer to pay a £5million penalty’ instead of investing £25m to make his deal permanent.",
      "Cunha is said to be Man Utd’s ‘primary’ target, with Man Utd ‘confident that Amorim can tame his temper’.",
      "Delap is another named target, while United are planning three more signings.",
      "‘The striker Liam Delap, who is available for £30million after Ipswich Town’s relegation, is a target while the wingback positions need strengthening and Bayindir is likely to be sold to make way for another goalkeeper to rival Onana for the No1 jersey.’",
      "It is also revealed that Man Utd’s summer transfer window ‘will be led by the technical director Jason Wilcox’, with INEOS ‘happy with his work so there are no plans to recruit a director of football’.",
      "Man Utd could also raise funds by sanctioning pure profit exits for Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, but they ‘will only leave if a club makes a substantial bid for either’. While the latter is ‘most likely to depart’, the Red Devils ‘would like to keep both players’.",
      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",
      "Emiliano Martinez has established himself as one of the world’s best. The bravado that made him so might not work at Man Utd if he replaces Andre Onana…",
      "Man Utd and Chelsea could face fresh competition for the signature of Liam Delap from a fellow Premier League club, according to reports.",

      "Amorim replaced former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag towards the end of 2024 and has endured a turbulent few months at the Premier League giants.",
      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss was initially keen to wait until this summer to make the move, but he decided to join early after being given an ultimatum by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and United‘s board.",
      "The 40-year-old has struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation as Man Utd’s current squad is not suited to this set-up and performances in the Premier League have been shambolic.",

      "READ: Man Utd losing Europa League will lead to ‘relegation and even bankruptcy’",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd’s best performances have come in the Europa League as they have reached the final.",
      "The Red Devils face Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Wednesday night and this is a massive game, with a trophy, Champions League football and much-needed prize money at stake.",
      "A loss would be disastrous for either side, but a report from The Times claims ‘the noises coming out of United are that Amorim will be in charge next season, regardless of the result of the Europa League final against Tottenham’.",
      "This is partly to do with Amorim’s strong relationship with Ratcliffe, as the co-owner ‘would try to talk him out of walking’ if it came to it ‘because he rates him so highly’.",
      "The report has also lifted the lid on Amorim’s relationship with Ratcliffe, who ‘speak every week by phone’.",
      "It is also noted that they ‘occasionally communicate in a WhatsApp group that contains other senior figures’, with ‘Amorim sharing his thoughts on games in a mini-match report and data is fed into the group too’.",
      "One such message was about Casemiro, who Amorim praised for ‘running 10.5km in the first leg of the semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao, more than any other player’.",
      "Amorim’s ‘man-mangement skills’ are ‘admired’ by United’s hierarchy, with Casemiro going from being an outcast to being ‘close’ to the head coach.",
      "The report also reveals Man Utd’s ‘main reason’ for standing by Amorim. They explain:",
      "‘The main reason why Ineos have so far refused to pull the trigger on Amorim’s reign is because they truly believe that with a full pre-season under their belts, and a revamp of the squad, he will have the tools he needs to start making United successful again.\nManchester United player in team uniform.",
      "‘There is an acceptance that he has had to spend much of the season placing square pegs in round holes. Noussair Mazraoui, for example, spent most of his career playing as an orthodox right back, but there is a chance the Moroccan will be asked to continue at wingback against Spurs, although Diogo Dalot — along with Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee — returned to training on the eve of the final.’",
      "Spurs should not be blamed for reconsidering the future of Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United really ought to give Ruben Amorim another think.",
      "Ruben Amorim says he will leave “without conversation or compensation” if Man Utd want to sack him after losing the Europa League final.",
      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a shock boost ahead of their Europa League final with Spurs, as some key players were pictured in training on Tuesday.",
      "One Man Utd player is getting frustrated that INEOS and Ruben Amorim are not playing him in order to get him to leave the club, according to reports.",
      "A report reveals how Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim was ‘talked out’ of handing in his resignation after a 3-1 home defeat to Brighton in January."

There has been talk from BBC suits of the need for the show to feature ‘more chat’ and Mediawatch finds itself in broad agreement with McEvoy’s central thrust that this would be a bad idea, that people want to watch the highlights and a bit of analysis and not just the analysis. But also not just the action. There are plenty of other options for those who want those things. As McEvoy puts it, Match of the Day should be…",

But, of course, the fine we will accept. If you give a red card for this, you have to ban a lot of coaches during the games because in an emotional situation of the game it will happen that you make a step on the pitch. Of course we are role models and we have to act like this. But I think sometimes you also should bring out your emotions. In this case it was to protect Joao Pedro because it was a hard tackle on him. If I don’t show emotions there, me as a player, I would say, ‘the coach isn’t interested in me’, so that’s why I try to show emotions in some part of the games,” he said.",

When it continues like this, you see it every weekend the blocking goalkeeper – if the Premier League doesn’t find a clear rule it will end in a different sport. In a normal game when a player is blocked when the ball is not near from him, it’s always a foul, so I don’t understand why it’s not a foul, they have to find an answer. It can be part of the game, but it should be a clear rule as to what is allowed and what isn’t. When it happens during the game you always get a foul in the midfield if you’re blocked, so why not blocked on a set-piece?” he said.",

There was a VAR review for two minutes and I thought, maybe the only thing that could happen is he looks back at the foul, or maybe it’s offside. Of course then, after 10 minutes you hear there fans cheering and you [realise] it’s not offside. It is an emotional sport and sometimes individuals with emotions make the wrong decisions.

What in us all made us tie our hearts to football clubs, what about us makes us fall head over heels into such peripheral yet essential relationships, in which the object of our adoration doesn’t really know we exist? We should be above this. We should be able to enjoy life, our days, our weekends, regardless of the actions of a dozen or so people we will never know.",

      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Ollie Watkins and Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Your guess is as good as ours.",
      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Liam Delap (Ipswich Town)\nEvery Premier League club – except Arsenal – is chasing Liam Delap, hopefully resulting in an exciting transfer saga that ends at the right time instead of dragging on and on and on.",
      "Despite attracting interest from several competent football clubs, it’s reportedly Manchester United (or Chelsea… or United again) leading the race. Delap is open to the move, which should be enough of a red flag for everyone else to back off and let United crack on.",
      "Twelve goals in 36 matches in a debut Premier League season is a very solid return for the 22-year-old. Not long ago it was 12 in 30, which looked even better and explains the hype.",
      "Ipswich’s relegation and his loss of form won’t stop the vultures circling, and £30million still feels like a bargain. Especially for a striker who is, by all accounts, a slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "8) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that. As could Florian Wirtz, Alejandro Grimaldo, Jonathan Tah, Piero Hincapie and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. Chelsea seem very keen – him and Delap fit their ‘project signing’ blueprint. This is why Arsenal prefer Gyokeres, who is more of a ready-made title winner.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Liverpool, though Man United and Arsenal are obviously in the picture.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",

      "Of the many areas Manchester United need to strengthen this summer, goalkeeper is the position they will most resent having to address.",
      "Andre Onana should have been United’s No. 1 for a decade; that was the plan when the Red Devils spent £43.7million on the Cameroonian in 2023 to replace David De Gea and, to be fair to the recruitment ‘brains trust’ at Old Trafford at the time, there was very little dissent over their pick.",
      "Onana was viewed as a safe set of hands with two feet that would help United play the Ten Hag way, a concept that remains a mystery. The ex-Ajax keeper had just helped Inter Milan get to the Champions League final and the decision to give him De Gea’s gloves was overwhelmingly well-received by everyone bar De Gea.",
      "The recent revisionism around De Gea highlights how far short Onana has come to matching those early expectations. Despite the Spaniard’s success at Fiorentina – after a season’s sabbatical – the decision to replace De Gea was absolutely correct. Their choice of replacement – in glorious hindsight – was not.",
      "We’ll give him a pass on the fact he hasn’t improved United in possession. Sometimes, a goalkeeper building out from the back is only as good as the players he’s passing to. As we know, many of his team-mates just aren’t up to receiving the ball under pressure, from either high-pressing opponents or the millions scrutinising them across the globe.",
      "That doesn’t excuse some of Onana’s clumsiness, especially when playing longer. But his real failings are rooted in the more traditional expectation of an elite goalkeeper: be hard to beat. Save the shots you’re expected to save, and some that you’re not.",
      "His two seasons in the United goal have been riddled with mistakes. Not just basic handling errors, but some inexplicable decision-making and highly-questionable techniques. One example: his approach to one-on-ones – stay deep, sit down – can’t be one that any of the Carrington goalkeeping coaches and analysts endorse. And, assuming they have identified it, they haven’t corrected his habit of parrying into poor areas.",
      "The fact that United are in Bilbao right now, hoping to rescue a generationally-bad season with a trophy and a route into the Champions League via the back door, is in spite of Onana’s performances.",
      "As is the case with many of their failing players that need upgrading, getting Onana out of Old Trafford won’t be easy for United without almost giving him away. Really, they need to hope a sheikh in Saudi is blinded by his profile enough to ignore his flaws.",
      "With that comes another attempt at finding a goalkeeper capable, composed and confident enough to keep United’s goal.",
      "Recent days have seen the Red Devils linked with Emiliano Martinez. At first sight, it appears to be a solid match.",
      "Martinez, not long ago viewed by some as the best on the planet largely because of his role in making Argentina kings of the world, appears to possess the requisite confidence. Outwardly at least, he presents as a character big enough to handle the pressure of defending even United’s goal.",
      "But perhaps we shouldn’t be fooled by his bravado. It is entirely likely that Martinez is more sensitive and self-aware than Onana. The Argentina No.1 has spoken about how he has worked on portraying an image of infallibility; much of the arrogance is an act. Which is absolutely fine – goalkeepers do need to fake it if they aren’t feeling it. But we ought not to believe that Martinez is the outstanding candidate based purely on the character he plays.",
      "But you could argue that type of personality is not what United need at this stage of whatever trauma it is they are currently going through. An attention-seeking egomaniac impatient with others’ imperfections would not lead a happy existence behind Ruben’s reds right now.",
      "MORE ON THE EUROPA LEAGUE FINAL FROM F365\n👉 Tottenham vs Man Utd prediction, expected line-ups, how to watch and stats\n👉 Big Midweek: Europa League final, Heung-min Son, FA Cup winners Crystal Palace, Pep Guardiola\n👉 Man Utd fans fear defeat to ‘serial chokers and jokers’ if Hojlund starts",
      "The game doesn’t produce many goalkeepers with those traits anymore. Modern keepers tend to carry a calmer authority, more in the mould of Alisson than Schmeichel or Kahn.",
      "Plenty still skirt close to the edge, but the likes of Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale have worked hard to train their chimp rather than allow it to fling faeces while swinging from the goalposts.",
      "Martinez too has tweaked his mindset and persona on the way to becoming one of the Premier League’s best, channelling the frustration of being overlooked at Arsenal towards oozing the confidence that helped Argentina to a third star. It worked for him then. But that doesn’t mean it will work at Old Trafford.",
      "He doesn’t have to act the d*ck now. The chip on his shoulder from being binned by Arsenal ought to have been smoothed by a World Cup winner’s medal and various individual honours thrusted from his groin that vindicate him from whatever doubts plagued him. It’s a matter of opinion whether Martinez is the best in the Premier League/Europe/world, but he’s rightly in all those conversations. That should be enough to facilitate the evolution from manufactured arrogance to supreme and justified confidence.",
      "United need much more of the latter than the former. Of course, Villa will have plenty to say about Martinez’s next steps. Shipping to Saudi is a very different prospect to selling to a domestic rival, if United can still be labelled that. Without making it worth their while, there is certainly more in a move for United than Villa.",
      "Which leads us to believe it perhaps won’t happen, especially if United are turned over by Tottenham in the Battle of the Banter Clubs. Regardless of the outcome in Bilbao, persisting with Onana is not an option for a serious club if United are hoping to be viewed as one again in the near future. The Cameroonian must be replaced, by an experienced, proven stopper. And Martinez ticks most of their boxes.",
      "Manchester United have been told why they need to “look beyond their rift” with Liverpool and sign £64m flop Darwin Nunez this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "Man Utd’s Andre Onana features twice, but one Brighton player has a hat-trick of shame in this ranking of the worst performances in this season’s Premier League.",
      "It’s probably Matz Sels on the eye test, but the stats say that Ederson has been tested more than Alisson and come out well on top.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly made an offer for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez after Unai Emery offered no assurances over his future at the club.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been consistent in his message that not even winning the Europa League can save Manchester United’s season.",
      "Maybe he’s right. The fact they sit 16th in the league, with scope to slump further, remains a mind-melter when you actually stop and think about it. This is, after all, Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And unlike with Spurs, whose own league efforts are somehow even worse, there is not the same sense at United that a trophy – any trophy – makes everything worth it. United don’t need another season where the cracks of wretched league form are papered over with a trophy. They had one of those last season, and have spent this season paying for it.",
      "But what beating Tottenham in Bilbao might do for Man United is far more significant than the outcome of a single season. This, really, feels like where the divergence exists between these two finalists who sit next to each other so miserably back at home.",
      "Both can point to a vast discrepancy between their Premier League and Europa League form. Both have, correctly and inevitably, prioritised this competition at further cost to already ruined domestic campaigns.",
      "Both have made it abundantly clear where their priorities have been for months now.",
      "But with Spurs this feels like an opportunistic chance for catharsis, to cast off a banter albatross at long, long last and move on with their lives. On its own, the Europa League final perhaps means more for them, but as part of a wider plan it is United who face the bigger sliding doors moment in Bilbao.",
      "Win or lose, Spurs will reset and relaunch yet again under a new manager, who will be given some of the signings he needs yet by no means all. They will spend a year or two in transition, lose their nerve, and start the whole process again. It is the history of the Tottenham.",
      "United’s case is slightly different. They are in the early stages of one of their own frequent post-Fergie resets, one that involved bringing in a manager whose style of play is almost entirely at odds with the squad that’s been left at his disposal.",
      "While Ange Postecoglou will surely leave Spurs win or lose, Amorim surely stays. What alters with victory here is the potential speed and scope of the rebuild he badly needs this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s move to Old Trafford is welcome, and shows that even in their current reduced and sorry state United remain a draw for players with what are, on paper, better choices.",
      "But there is no doubt that the financial and footballing benefits of being able to offer Champions League football will make United’s other wooing missions this summer that bit easier.",
      "Bluntly, even as wretched as they are now, United in the gutter are still looking at the stars. Given the right tools and opportunity, Amorim remains a manager capable of restoring them to something like their rightful place in English football even after his unnecessarily chaotic and poorly-timed arrival.",
      "For Spurs, Wednesday night in Bilbao is a destination in itself. A release of emotion and frustration akin to that we’ve already seen this season for Newcastle and Crystal Palace.",
      "For United, though, it represents more of a stepping stone. They’ll enjoy the night if it goes their way, of course, but it won’t even be the first time they’ve won this trophy in the post-Fergie wilderness years.",
      "The flipside, of course, is that defeat comes with dread consequences and further erosion of an already significantly depleted aura.",
      "While victory represents a potentially transformative springboard for Amorim and the club, defeat will leave them as not only the Manchester United team that finished 16th – or maybe even worse – in the Premier League but also the one that handed a trophy to Tottenham.",
      "This one game comes to early in Amorim’s reign to definitively make or break him right now, but it still feels like when his United career comes to be judged, the result of this one game will be a pivotal moment in setting its overall course."

      "Nine Man Utd players who should leave this summer\nFollowing the season United have had, where it’s honestly been such a drag watching some games, it makes you think how United have somehow gone from 8th place last year in the league with Ten Hag at the helm (which was deemed as disastrous), to 16th in the league this year. It proves some players are just rubbish and there for the paycheck. There isn’t really an excuse for it to be finishing not only in the lower half of the table, but to be finishing below 15th place, is brutally shite.",
      "I have no idea how the team are somehow the only unbeaten side in Europe this season, but it looks like Amorim does have a few tricks up his sleeve in European competition, but has to improve drastically in the Premier League next season otherwise he will probably get sacked. Truth be told, I wish the whole board would just get sacked, with former United players and those who understand the standards of the club to take their place, but Ratcliffe and the Glazers are the ones in charge and it doesn’t look like that will change any time soon…",
      "If the owners actually had some sense of responsibility and courage, and the manager must communicate this as well, they need to have a serious conversation with some of the players at the club and insist on putting them on the transfer list. And if United can’t sell them due to the ridiculous salaries they are on, at least loan them and agree a deal with another club to pay for 40-50% of their wage. The players who need to leave are the following.",
      "Luke Shaw: This player is honestly so lucky to have been at United for the last 11 years. Yes its unfortunate how his leg injury ruined his potential and his fitness, but United should have gotten rid of Shaw years ago. Not reliable or good enough and did have a few good years, but it’s time to go.",
      "Jonny Evans: Did we seriously just sign him to keep Tom Heaton some company? Pointless signing.",
      "Victor Lindelof: Actually rate him quite a lot as a defender and player, and built a somewhat solid partnership with Maguire over the years, but should try and head back to somewhere like Benfica or a mid-table club in Italy/Spain.",
      "Diogo Dalot: I think he had a great year last season, but very big downfall this year. If United can get 35-40 million for him, sell him as he isn’t good enough defensively, has headless chicken vibes.",
      "Christian Eriksen: I thought he was excellent in his first year at United and was just as good as Casemiro in that first year under Ten Hag, but time for him to leave on a free and enjoy last few years at another club.",
      "Jadon Sancho: No explanation needed, came for money and incredibly overrated. Loan him again if necessary.",
      "Marcus Rashford: Looks like he needs a new start, and if United can sell him for a reasonable amount of money, they should sell him and it’s a big salary amount off the books too.",
      "Antony: Has proven that United really were the problem, need to convince Real Betis to sign him for around 30 million and looks to suit La Liga much more than the Premier League.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund: I do think the criticism of him has been somewhat unfair, but is he good enough to score 15-20 goals a season? He just looks so uncomfortable up front and should head back to Italy where the game seemed to suit him more. Would make a big loss on him given the price paid for, but should cash in and sign another striker.",
      "I would arguably include Mason Mount as part of this list due to his injury issues, but only came in two seasons ago. Knowing United, they won’t even sell half of the players listed here, and it will be the same vicious circle of an ‘Average’ summer of transfers. 8-9 players must be sold/loaned out this summer, a large chunk of players need to leave the club before bringing in new blood. If the owners don’t realise that, then Amorim will eventually pay the price and the same thing will happen to United where they bring in a manager for 2 years max and change it up when the owners feel like it/are bored.",

This goes for both teams, and the fact Spurs have got the better of us thrice this season makes me incredibly nervous (albeit the two under RA were close affairs). Which United will turn up – Ruby’s Euro diamonds or Ruben’s relegation-hunting rejects?",
      "The league season was a write-off a good couple of months ago, so I can understand some sluggish league performances. We haven’t won since March but, Newcastle aside, most matches have been fairly evenly contested. But this doesn’t make it acceptable, and Ruben has said as much.",
      "Of course the manager has to take some flak, that comes with the territory, but we have known for some time that the squad isn’t good enough regardless of what system is being played – this doesn’t necessarily mean they are all “bad” players individually, just as a collective it hasn’t worked, and changes were and are needed.",
      "I like Hojlund, but he isn’t ready to lead the line for us every week and is still learning the game and how to deal with the pressure of being at one of the world’s biggest clubs – he needs to be a 1 in 2 striker, and it remains to be seen if he can hit those numbers.",
      "Garnacho will be a fine player, but he isn’t a wingback or a #10, so doesn’t suit the system; he has improved but, again, is not ready to play there week in week out. I don’t want us to sell him but might be necessary.",
      "Our wingbacks, key positions in this system, have not delivered consistently – injuries explain some of this but, regardless, we need players there who can defend, attack and stay fit! Dorgu looks a good buy but is still raw, not sure Amass will make it with us but we’ll see. Malacia who? Dalot gives 100% but isn’t consistent in attack, he should stick to the edge of the box cutbacks as they are his most effective deliveries, and Mazraoui looks more at home as the right CB. Most of our quality in MF is aging and our GK loves a mistake. So other than that, it’s all good.",
      "It’s not all doom and gloom, Maguire continues to look good in a 3, Yoro looks a player, Diallo has come back as sharp, Zirkzee has shown some flashes and Bruno is Bruno. Mount has even stayed fit for longer than 3 matches. We will add to the squad in the summer (Cunha would be perfect, would love Mbeumo but can’t see it), there are some promising youth players to come through and the players we keep will have more of an idea of what is expected of them.",
      "The point being, talk of getting rid of Amorim at this stage is madness. He will know that next season brings less patience, and his methods have to be seen to be working in the league as that is our bread and butter.

      "The interesting thing about Frimpong is, if he is signed, it’d obviously provide competition for Connor Bradley, but given his attacking output, it’d not be out of the question for both to play on the right hand side. Frimpong strikes me as another potential Riise, who can play on the wing or as full back.",
      "And to that end, Salah has rightly earned a new contract, but this season has indicated a degree of burnout by April. If a season is 50+ games long, with minutes available at right wing and right back, then 40+ starts for Frimpong across both roles, and 20 + sub appearances for Connor at full back is still good squad management, and that’s discounting injuries. I’m likely mis-remembering but I recall Arsenal playing Eboue as a winger, and didn’t Saka start out as a full back before moving forward? I’m sure it’s been done before, it’s just my memory is failing me.",

      "I can empathise with the argument F365 are making about saving your transfer kitty till you know if a target is available.

      "If LFC kept their powder dry, then Newcastle could argue they want the whole fee for Isaak up front. If LFC bring in two fullbacks relatively quickly, they could make the case to Newcastle that they’d be ‘happy’ adding extra onto the fee, but need to defer the installments across 18 months or longer etc – basically negotiating. (notwithstanding that i don’t think Isaak will move this window, just using him as an example as you did).",
      "I’d hope that with the sales of Darwin, Chiesa, Tsimikas, Kellegher, and Jota, and the departure of Trent, and the rumours of an exit for Endo and Elliot, that the club would have budget and wage bill capacity to do what they need to. If the signing of an ‘extra’ full back negates that, then as much as I really can’t be arsed with the manic fringe of the FSG-out brigade, some questions would realistically need to be asked as to where the money is. And Frimpong looks a decent buy if the club can get it sorted.\nTom",

      "On Joel Ward. Or why Palace are 12th\nYes, I’m still overwhelmed by the FA Cup Final. Details keep coming back to me, like seeing Paddy McCarthy from the 2010 survival side squaring up to one of Manchester City’s medical team, or the fact that victory was secured with two important players (Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton) requiring substitution due to head injuries.",
      "However, the dominant memory at the moment is what happened immediately before the cup presentation. Last week it was announced that Joel Ward, the longest-serving member of the current Crystal Palace squad, would be leaving the club when he contract expires in the summer.",
      "Clearly we all missed a memo because we didn’t plaster Selhurst with posters calling him a Judas, forcing him to pick “loyalty or lolly”, sending death threats to him and his family on social media and demanding the Joel Ward mural be painted over – that’s what you’re supposed to do when a long-serving right-back announces they’re leaving at the end of their contract, isn’t it?",
      "Ward joined the club from Portsmouth in 2012, leaving a side that had been relegated from the Championship for one that had finished 17th, for a fee of £400,000. The following season he made 25 appearances as Palace were promoted to the Premier League, and prior to this campaign made that many or more appearances in nine out of eleven seasons. Arguably the dictionary definition of a reliable if unspectacular full back, there is no denying that he has been one of the best value for money signings of the past 15 years – particularly as his arrival, with Palace just a year or so out of administration, meant they had to sell players in order to fund his acquisition.",
      "In a way, he’s a good example of why Palace finish roughly 12th every year. A more ruthless club would have cut Ward loose a long time ago, replaced him with someone younger, cheaper and with personal ambition in abundance that can be translated into ambition for the team. And yet, he’s still here, because as Steve Parish has said in interviews about other players, he wants to do right by the person behind the player; he knows that Ward, like Paddy McCarthy or Damien Delaney before him, still has leadership and experience to contribute to the group and its younger members even if he isn’t playing every week.",
      "Some clubs, or at least the very online people among their supporters, will see this as excessive sentimentality that holds Palace back, but it isn’t, it’s just humans being considerate to each other.",
      "And then we get to Saturday, when Ward and Guehi get to lift the FA Cup together, the first people to ever do that in Crystal Palace colours. It was a fantastic moment and something so richly deserved for someone who has done so much for the club for so long. Not being someone to actively seek the spotlight made it all the better that he got to be front and centre at the greatest moment in the club’s history – the greatest moment in the club’s history so far. Go well, Wardy.\nEd Quoththeraven",
      "",
      "Giving the promoted clubs a chance\nSimple solution, currently Premier League teams can only loan two Premier League players, what if say newly promoted sides were allowed up to 6 (then 4 in their second season and back to the default 2 in their third)? On the face of it wouldn’t it be a win-win? Newly promoted clubs get access to more Premier League level talent without the cost of transfer fees or locking in long-term expensive contracts, bigger clubs have more scope to give league minutes to players who need them (so currently all the promoted teams can only lend 6 between them, under this system you’d open up 24 more slots).",
      "You’d be less likely to end up with scenarios where players who desperately need the minutes, like Evan Ferguson end up going on loan to clubs who are taking them on as a spare rather than as a core part of their starting line up. I also would have an option for special appeal, wherein a club could make a case for exception circumstance on going over the set limit, this would leave the door open to late window options that turn up (like say a scenario where a player gets dramatically left out of the squad after a huge falling out and has nowhere to go).",
      "I’m aware that the sight of a team taking the field with majority players they don’t ‘own’ might be weird at first (and of course they don’t have to fill all their slots either), but surely it’d be preferable to the predictable churn of promoted sides in giving them a better fighting chance, and with more league teams in Europe than ever before and so needing deeper squads i can see how something like this could serve as a halfway house for players on the verge of the first team of higher tier sides to bridge the gap.",
      "Thanks.\nSeanán",
      "Ps. Have a lovely Summer and please be a bit nicer to Arteta."

      "Manchester United will reportedly ‘accelerate to try to sign’ Arsenal-linked Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres after Wednesday’s Europa League final.",
      "Gyokeres has been strongly linked with a transfer to Arsenal this summer, but could be tempted by a move to Man United, where his former Sporting boss, Ruben Amorim, is now in charge.",
      "There were links to a move to Old Trafford in January, but the Red Devils were unable to afford the Swedish international, having made wing-back Patrick Dorgu their priority at the time.",
      "Amorim’s side face Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday, with a place in next season’s Champions League and around £100million on the line.",
      "That income would help United rebuild their squad to suit Amorim’s style of play, with defeat expected to hit them hard and possibly result in the exit of one or two young stars such as Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "F365 SAYS: Gyokeres too old, too big, too striker-ish for Arsenal? The nonsense debunked",
      "United downed tools in the Premier League some time ago and currently sit 16th, so their season will essentially end on Wednesday night in Bilbao, with summer transfer business immediately taking centre stage.",
      "According to French outlet L’Equipe, the Manchester giants have ‘a clear idea of the avenues to explore for each targeted position’ in the summer window and ‘have already completed the signing of’ Matheus Cunha. Reports suggest the Wolves forward will cost United £67million.",
      "Another attacker is expected to join Amorim’s ranks and ‘the trail leading to Viktor Gyokeres remains very active’.",
      "The report claims that United will ‘accelerate to try to sign the Swedish striker’ after Wednesday’s final, as Amorim ‘knows the player perfectly having coached him at Sporting’.",
      "French champions Paris Saint-Germain have previously been linked with Gyokeres, but the report says they ‘no longer seem to be in the race’. Luis Enrique apparently does not want to sign a new striker, ‘and even less so an expensive player’, it’s said.",
      "Arsenal get a mention but barely, as L’Equipe refer to ‘the English press mentioning an offensive’ by Mikel Arteta’s side.",

      "Despite apparent interest from United, the Londoners remain in pole position for the 26-year-old’s signature, and transfer journalist Graeme Bailey has discussed their interest this week.",
      "Bailey says Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak is an unrealistic target and that Gyokeres “is getting all the attention at the Emirates now”.",
      "“In terms of Alexander Isak, I’m told that if he leaves Newcastle, Liverpool are leading the race for him — I think Arsenal have been fairly accepting of that for the last few months,” he said (quotes via Now Arsenal).",

      "Bailey adds that RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is also someone Arsenal ‘have done a lot of work on’, though there is also interest from London rivals Chelsea.",

      "Spurs won the Europa League thanks to a 1-0 win over Man Utd in Bilbao; Ruben Amorim's side dominated possession but Ange Postecoglou was rewarded for adapting his 'Angeball' style to something more pragmatic in order to guide them to glory",
      "Wednesday 21 May 2025 23:20, UK",
      "As the final whistle went and Spurs players sprinted in all directions, unsure where to go or what to do, Ange Postecoglou kept his cool, embracing his staff, walking over to shake Ruben Amorim's hand, then quietly joining the celebrations.",
      "He had seen it all coming, after all. \"I always win things in my second year,\" he said after a 1-0 loss to Arsenal in September. It is a comment which has hung over him during a dire Premier League campaign but the Europa League always offered hope.",
      "He was adamant Spurs could still do something special, even as the losses mounted to club-record-breaking levels domestically, and now they have. It was not pretty but what does that matter? A 17-year trophy wait is over. A place in the Champions League is theirs.",
      "It is a triumph built on pragmatism. Postecoglou's devotion to his way of playing bordered on the ridiculous earlier in his tenure. \"It's just who we are, mate,\" he said after a 4-1 loss to Chelsea in which his side continued to hold a high line even with nine players.",
      "But Postecoglou adapted for their Europa League campaign, navigating the knockout stages with a dramatically different style. Less possession, more of an emphasis on physicality. It helped them past AZ Alkmaar, Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt. In the end, it helped them past Manchester United too.",
      "\"In knockout games you've got to have a real clear gameplan,\" he said in his press conference afterwards. \"Big games come down to moments. You've got to limit the moments of the opposition. You've got to change your approach. The players embraced that.\"",
      "At half-time in Bilbao, Spurs had had just 37 per cent of the possession. By full-time, that number had dropped to 27 per cent. Brennan Johnson's goal was one of only three Spurs shots. Yet from the moment he scored it, they never looked like losing.",
      "The goal only strengthened their resolve. Soon, every clearance, every tackle was being loudly cheered by their fans. A Guglielmo Vicario catch was roared as if it was a goal shortly before half-time and Spurs continued in the same vein in the second half.",
      "Of course, Postecoglou's approach was partly down to circumstance on this occasion, with James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall, their three best players technically, all unavailable due to injury. But his pre-match comments were revealing.",
      "\"It's disappointing losing guys likes Madders, Lucas and Deki because they're very creative,\" he said ahead of kick-off. \"But I think we'll need running power tonight.\"",
      "This was never going to be a game for free-wheeling creativity. It was a battle to be won. Postecoglou picked his team accordingly, including Richarlison over Heung-Min Son on the left, and Pape Sarr with Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma in midfield.",
      "Manchester United looked lightweight by comparison. Bruno Fernandes, outstanding on their run to the final, was shut out of the game. Amad Diallo shone in the first half but suffered the same fate in the second, with Destiny Udogie recovering his poise.",
      "Postecoglou had talked up the importance of the collective over individuals before the game and clearly the message landed with his players, who had displayed a united front in their comments to the press before the game and did the same on the pitch.",
      "Their togetherness could be seen in how Richarlison and Johnson tracked back. When Vicario spilled a cross early in the second half, it was striker Dominic Solanke who cleared the loose ball from his own six-yard box.",
      "Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero worked together to dominate their battle with Rasmus Hojlund - if it even qualified as one, such was its one-sidedness. Udogie's second-half recovery, meanwhile, owed a lot to Richarlison, who was so tired he could barely walk when he was substituted, an epic shift behind him.",
      "Johnson, whose scrappy goal summed up the contest, was similarly industrious on the other flank, where Mason Mount could not get into the game and Alejandro Garnacho did not fare much better. Postecoglou even got the same defensive diligence out of Son, who picked up where Richarlison left off, effectively playing as an auxilary left-back during the closing stages.",
      "Postecoglou had chosen to rotate for the Premier League, in contrast to Amorim, who fielded something close to his strongest side in recent games, and the approach paid off. They went the distance. Manchester United barely got going.",
      "Spurs were battling history as well as a Manchester United side with a strong record in finals. They had not even scored in their last three final appearances, never mind won them. But Postecoglou's players looked unincumbered by the past.",
      "Instead, there was a steely focus on the task at hand. Spurs kept their shape and kept their heads, managing the game smartly as they broke up Manchester United's flow in the second half.",
      "Clear chances were few and far between for Amorim's side, their 16 shots worth a meagre 0.85 expected goals as Spurs defended their box diligently, time and again pushing Manchester United into areas where they could not hurt them.",
      "The final whistle prompted delirious celebrations from Tottenham's players and fans. But the outcome already felt inevitable by that point. Maybe it was inevitable to Postecoglou all along."

      "Tottenham beat Manchester United 1-0 in the Europa League final thanks to Brennan Johnson's winner; Cristian Romero was a rock at the back for Ange Postecoglou's side while Micky van de Ven saved Spurs in second half; Bruno Fernandes, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund had nights to forget",
      "Thursday 22 May 2025 01:18, UK",
      "Tottenham are Europa League champions, ending their 17-year wait for a trophy by beating Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao.",
      "Brennan Johnson's winner late in the first half was enough for the north Londoners to book a spot in the Champions League next season - and increased the pressure on Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, who will be subjected to their lowest-ever Premier League finish and nothing more.",
      "Got away with it, then became a hero. An early stumble but Rasmus Hojlund could not take advantage, and he then gifted a chance to the same United striker, only to be saved by Micky van de Ven's acrobatic heroics. Produced two good saves to deny Alejandro Garnacho and Luke Shaw late on to redeem himself. At least one goalkeeper turned up…",
      "Two excellent halves for different reasons. The first half saw him use his wand of a right boot to create some good openings, then he had to be defensively secure in the second period.",
      "He's never lost a final and you can see why. The Argentina defender showed excellent awareness throughout as he marshalled his side's low block brilliantly, making more clearances than any other Spurs player. He even got into Harry Maguire's head when the United centre-back started to threaten in the box. Spurs have to keep him to develop - but will he stay?",
      "That clearance. That athleticism. The Dutchman was just as solid as Romero but his acrobatic heroics to deny Hojlund that leveller will be remembered just as much as Johnson's goal. What a way to make yourself a hero.",
      "Looked nervous early on, swiping at a Man Utd corner and getting turned by Amad Diallo too many times. But he then grew into it and shut down the United winger in the second half. His game was summed up by a great tackle in the box to deny Amad a decent opening, before breaking to set up Dominic Solanke's big chance for 2-0. He did so much running, it is no wonder he had to come off late on.",
      "Solid. Won the second-most duels out of any Spurs player on the pitch - behind Romero - and the second-most tackles behind Udogie. Will be one of the more underrated players from this success.",
      "Like Bissouma, a good water carrier, doing a lot of the dirty work without being spectacular. All three of Spurs' midfielders kept Bruno Fernandes very quiet, giving the Manchester United danger man next to no space.",
      "Superb cross for Spurs' opener - exactly what was needed after his side lost James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski to injury for this big game. Did not hold the ball well enough but that did not really matter in the end. It was not punished.",
      "Caused all sorts of problems early doors for Luke Shaw and you could see his opener coming. That trademark run from back post to front under Ange Postecoglou's tactics is destined in Spurs' folklore for generations. Did his work in the other direction too.",
      "You felt for the Spurs forward - he did so much running off the ball without getting many touches. Should have done better with a chance on the break for 2-0 but set up a decent chance on the break for Heung-Min Son at the same time. An important moment.",
      "A shock inclusion over captain Son - but you can see why he got the call up. Less of an attacking presence and did not do much in the air against Noussair Mazraoui, but his defensive performance and selfless display was excellent. He was taken off with an injury, which showed how much he committed.",
      "Actually, you could see why the Spurs captain did not start. He came on and even then he struggled, being beaten in a race by Patrick Dorgu despite playing an hour less football than his counterpart. Has he lost his legs?",
      "Brought on to shore up the backline as another centre-back and helped with the low block, including one huge clearance from an Amad cross. Had half a chance from a free-kick but did not take it.",
      "Nervy, shaky, unconvincing in his decision-making. Onana's frequent reluctance to come out and claim crosses or back passes created nervousness in defence for United - and gave Spurs an invitation to cross. He was not totally at fault for Spurs' opener but the indecision took its toll. More cons than pros this season by quite a way - time for United to move on?",
      "Not great but not bad. Nearly caught out by the Spurs press in the first half but not helped out by more Onana indecision. He could have scored in the second half but it is harsh to criticise the second-youngest player to feature in a European final for Man Utd.",
      "The centre-back was player of the half for United in the first period - until the opener. Solid in defence, put his body on the line and caused issues in the other penalty box. But he then fell asleep towards the end of the half, letting too many balls bounce, including for Spurs' opener. He was rattled by Romero - no goalscoring heroics this time.",
      "Beaten easily by Johnson a couple of times early on so it was no real surprise to see him overcome by the same player for the goal. Not good enough with the ball either going forwards. A sharper Shaw may have fared better but United miss Lisandro Martinez in that position.",
      "Like Yoro, he cannot be blamed too much. Good in the air against Richarlison, including a good, well-timed header to deny the Brazilian early on at the back post. He won 12 duels overall and got forward well, setting up that glorious Bruno Fernandes chance. Harshly taken off but can understand the need to bring attack-minded Diogo Dalot on.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder had some flashpoints with some big tackles, which showed he could still deliver in a big game, but that is where his influence was limited to. You cannot help but think how he has gone from Champions League finals with Real Madrid to this.",
      "Anonymous throughout as the Man Utd captain struggled against Spurs' flat midfield three. His frustration was summed up by lashing out at Udogie to concede a free-kick and having a simple pass cut out by Johnson, which led to a Spurs counter attack. He then missed that big chance to level. It was just not a captain's performance.",
      "Not bad going forwards and got into good areas, but spent a lot of time tracking back to help Shaw out. The youngster did not communicate enough for Johnson's goal - he wil learn.",
      "United's bright spark. The young wide man caused Udogie a lot of problems and provided United's only two shots in the first half, plus the cross for Hojlund's decent chance just after the break. A light in a dismal Ruben Amorim era.",
      "From light to dark. Mount was given a chance and did not take it. Mount actually got in the way of his United team-mates a couple of times in the first half, while he lacked the final ball throughout. Rightly taken off as United's need for a goal became more urgent - and Alejandro Garnacho did more in four minutes than Mount did in 70. Matheus Cunha will take his slot next season, no doubt.",
      "The young forward's hold-up play was actually not bad. But United lacked a penalty box presence needed from a striker in a cup final. Needed to take that second-half chance from Amad's cross and unlucky to be denied by Van de Ven's stunning clearance. But Man Utd need better. Ten Premier League games without a shot, as well.",
      "Brought on for Hojlund and got as many yellow cards as he had shots. Just six touches of the ball in around 20 minutes. He's just not a striker, is he? But if Fernandes, Cunha and Amad are the No 10 options then where does it leave the Dutchman?",
      "Probably should have started given Mount's performance and kept out by Vicario well. But if he and Kobbie Mainoo are not trusted for a European final, where does it leave them in Ruben Amorim's plans, especially as they are both available to be sold for pure profit?"

      "A bullish Ange Postecoglou said he will \"never be a clown\" and insisted his work at Spurs is not done - even if they beat Manchester United in Wednesday's Europa League final.",
      "In an explosive press conference ahead of the game in Bilbao, the 59-year-old hit out at a newspaper headline which described him as \"teetering between hero and clown\" amid speculation over his future as the club's head coach.",
      "Spurs' poor Premier League campaign, which has seen them slump to 17th place on 38 points, having lost a club-record 21 games, has led to suggestions that he could leave even if he guides them to their first trophy in 17 years in the Europa League.",
      "But Postecoglou insisted his future is not a distraction and urged his team to seize their chance to make history by winning a trophy which would also earn Spurs a Champions League spot.",
      "\"I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and I never will be, mate,\" he told a reporter in reference to the article relating to his Spurs legacy.",
      "\"I'm really disappointed you'd use such terminology about a person who, for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he's leading out a club in a European major competition.",
      "\"For you to suggest that, somehow, us not being successful means that I'm a clown... I'm not really sure how to answer that question.\"",
      "Postecoglou has faced repeated questions relating to his future in recent months but insisted his sole focus is on ensuring his players are ready to take their opportunity to win silverware.",
      "\"Does it matter, really?\" he said when asked about his future. \"It doesn't matter because the reality of it is the opportunity is the same for me and, more importantly, for the club.",
      "Postecoglou said the injured Lucas Bergvall is not available to play against Manchester United despite having travelled with the squad to Bilbao. Pape Sarr is fit, however, despite having been taken off with back pain during Friday's 2-0 loss to Aston Villa.\n\n\nJames Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also missing due to injury but like Bergvall, have travelled with the squad to Bilbao to support their team-mates.",
      "\"I've said before, whatever happens beyond tomorrow is kind of irrelevant when you think about the opportunity that exists right now and that is to provide something special for this football club, for the supporters, for everyone who's worked so hard, not just this year, but for the last 15, 16 years since we last won a trophy and 41 years since a European trophy.",
      "\"If I were worried about my tenure at this football club, it's fair to say we wouldn't be in this position as I would've been distracted long ago. I'm pretty good at making sure all my focus is on giving this football club the best opportunity to do something special.",
      "\"Whatever happens after that, I'm very comfortable that I'll continue on trying to win trophies wherever I am.\"",
      "The Spurs boss insisted he has not spoken to his players about his future ahead of the final, adding: \"Again, that would not really be helpful in what is before us right now.",
      "\"I've said to the lads from day one, nothing is guaranteed in life, nothing is guaranteed in sport, so you've got to make sure you take every opportunity before you.",
      "\"That's what I've done my whole career. I've been in this position before where the big game was the last game I managed, so it's not unusual territory for me and I've always navigated that pretty well.",
      "\"For me, nothing is more important than my responsibility at this football club and to its fans tomorrow. Me and the players' minds are on one thing and that's trying to create something special.\"",
      "Pressed again on his future, Postecoglou insisted: \"I wouldn't be the first person who changes jobs. We all change jobs.",
      "\"My future's assured. I've got a beautiful family, I've got a great life, I'll keep on winning trophies until I finish, wherever that is, so don't worry about my future.",
      "\"My future is not entwined with anything. Provided, God willing, my health remains and my beautiful family and friends are beside me... there's nothing wrong with my future.",
      "\"Don't stress. Sleep easy at night. I'll be OK.",
      "\"I don't think my job is done here. I really feel like we're building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.",
      "\"I still think there's a lot of work to be done, that's quite obvious with the challenges we've had this year, which are well chronicled. There's some reasoning in the context of that, but also there's been some growth that I'd like to see through.",
      "\"Whether that happens or not is not that important right now. I don't think this job's finished and I certainly feel like there's some growth there that we can take this club to where it needs to be.\"",
      "Spurs captain Heung-Min Son insisted he is ready to make history by winning his first trophy at the club after admitting he was affected by nerves in the 2019 Champions League final loss to Liverpool.",
      "\"It would be very special,\" he said. \"It would be a historic moment, I stayed here 10 years. I just want to win the trophy, which nobody has done in 10 years.",
      "\"Tomorrow is going to be a massive day for the club and for the boys, and for me as well. It has been such a tough season but we have always been together and that's why we are here.\"",
      "Son, who also revealed he had chatted to Bundesliga winner Harry Kane ahead of Wednesday's game, continued: \"Six years ago I played my first final. It was a very nervous moment.",
      "\"It was exciting but I was very nervous. I couldn't believe I was in the Champions League final.",
      "\"Six years later I'm a grown man, I'm experienced and just want to prepare in my way, calm.",
      "\"So many players have changed, also my role has changed. I'm captain of this club and leader of the boys and I want to help lift the trophy together.",
      "\"That is my dream. Tomorrow, I hope we can make a historic day that I can never forget.\"",
      "Son only recently returned from injury but insisted he feels physically prepared for the challenge ahead as Spurs aim to change their history of falling short.",
      "\"If we win the trophy, we can change the mentality and the history of the club. Then hopefully we can compete for other trophies.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim reiterated his stance that winning the Europa League would not solve the club's issues but admitted it would help him build their future.",
      "Amorim's side sit only a point ahead of Postecoglou's in 16th place in the Premier League after a similarly difficult campaign but while the Spurs boss has preached optimism, Amorim has favoured brutal realism.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident, but we already know the problems,\" he said.",
      "Manchester United have been given a boost with Diogo Dalot, Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro all available to feature having recovered from injury.\n\n\n\"They recovered quite well,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we respect the feelings of the players, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to part of the team and that is a very good sign.\n\n\n\"They are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club; the way we do everything in the week at Carrington, the recruitment, the academy. I think we need to improve.",
      "\"It's hard to point at one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow will be important for us, for our fans. That feeling of winning can help us have strength to do every job we have to do.",
      "\"But nothing is going to change our season. We have a lot to do at our club, not just winning tomorrow. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build the future.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire insisted Manchester United have shown their quality in the Europa League, despite their domestic struggles.",
      "\"When you play for this club, you want to win every football match and this season we've been far too inconsistent, we haven't won enough in the Premier League. It's not been good enough, we know that.",
      "\"The Europa League has been different. We've performed at a high level and we have proven again this season we can beat anybody.",
      "\"I'm sure, next season, we will improve an awful amount, with a full pre-season and, as players, we're all looking forward to that, but we've got a big game tomorrow night, first and foremost.",
      "\"It's a special night, a special occasion. We've prepared well and it's one we're looking forward to.\"",
      "Maguire has earned plaudits for some of his attacking contributions during United's run to the final, including scoring the winner in their comeback win over Lyon in the quarters, but hopes he won't be needed up front on Wednesday night.",
      "\"The manager has me dribbling every day in training, running up and down the wing,\" he joked.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao, managed to put a good cross in and Casemiro scored the goal.",
      "\"I've gone up front in the later minutes of games; hopefully tomorrow night I'm not going up front.",
      "\"I don't want to go up front chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "\"I'm always there to help, always there to do my best, but I'm more than happy playing in my favoured position.\""

      "\"Every game has its history…\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said these words when asked about the prospect of playing Tottenham in the Europa League final - a team that has beaten the Red Devils three times already this season.",
      "But the question is, will their recent history matter when it comes to who wins the trophy - and that crucial Champions League place?",
      "Perhaps the performance Spurs will take the most encouragement from is their first of the season against United, an utterly dominant 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September to put even more pressure on United's former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The game is evidence of why Ange Postecoglou is wrapping Micky van de Ven in cotton wool ahead of the final.",
      "Van de Ven was not just defensively impressive in this game, as he typically is, he also carried the ball over half the length of the Old Trafford pitch to set up Brennan Johnson for their opening goal in the third minute.",
      "The game then was seemingly over at the end of the first half when Bruno Fernandes was sent off - a red card that was later overturned through appeal.",
      "But this is a different United side. Although you cannot suggest their position in the Premier League of 16th is evidence they have moved forward under Ruben Amorim, they do look better defensively, they concede fewer chances, and have shown in these big European nights that they can be a threat going forward, more so anyway, then under Ten Hag.",
      "The second time these two sides met was in the Carabao Cup quarter finals in December - a fun encounter that Postecoglou's Spurs won once again, this time 4-3, with Amorim having taken over from Ten Hag.",
      "But when you look at lessons both sides could take to the final, it is challenging when you consider the context around it.",
      "First of all you look at the make-up of both sides. Spurs had Archie Gray and Radu Dragusin making up their centre-back partnership, with Fraser Forster in goal. Spurs' main three at the back of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario and defenders Van de Ven and Cristian Romero were all injured.",
      "For United, again, a side that will be much changed for the final with Altay Bayindir starting in goal, Lisandro Martinez, who is out for the remainder of the season, as well as Antony, who is now starring for Real Betis in Spain, also featured.",
      "On this occasion, although Spurs were injury-hit and did well to progress, Amorim also took a calculated risk to heavily rotate many of his first-team players. It did not work out as they lost their next three games in the Premier League as well.",
      "February was the last time these two sides met and Spurs won 1-0 but I don't think Amorim will look back at this game too closely.",
      "That's partly because the goal United conceded was a poor one. Andre Onana should have done much better to palm away a Lucas Bergvall shot, which ended up leaving James Maddison with a comfortable finish right in front of goal.",
      "Amorim had very limited opportunities to change the game when you look at the squad he had to pick from at that moment. It was an injury-ravaged United side. Victor Lindelof was the only substitute who had any sort of Premier League experience.",
      "Spurs had injuries too, with Kevin Danso and Ben Davies their centre-back pairing, two players who again are not likely to start in the final, while Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski also started but will play no part on Wednesday due to injury.",
      "Not much, really!",
      "Spurs will take confidence despite the circumstances. When they have taken on Untied this season, they have been able to pull out performances and perhaps more importantly, results.",
      "Dominic Solanke has three goals in three meetings against United too, which may give him that extra edge against their opponents in the final.",
      "Asked about facing a side who have beaten United three times, Amorim said: \"If you look at the odds, we are closer to winning than losing. Both teams will play like all or nothing.\"",
      "Those last three words perfectly describe Manchester United in Europe this season: all or nothing.",
      "United looked like they'd be out of the competition when they were 4-2 down at Old Trafford against Lyon in the quarter-finals but they miraculously came back.",
      "In the semi-finals, as I travelled to Bilbao for their tie against Athletic Club, most pundits and fans alike would have thought a draw away to a team who had lost just once in LaLiga since August at home would have been sufficient",
      "Man Utd won 3-0 in San Mames and 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "We also have to consider the tactical tweaks Amorim has made since the two sides last met in February.",
      "In the most important games, he has now settled on a midfield duo of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Brazilian especially has become revitalised under Amorim in recent months.",
      "Amorim told me this has been mainly down to Casemiro working on his own fitness as well as the United boss tweaking the way they press, more so with their wing-backs going high, enabling Casemiro to stay in front of the defence and not be caught out on transition.",
      "Amorim and the players have spoken about how the physicality levels of European opponents are more suited to the players, which does pose the question of how they will deal with a physical Spurs side who will look to impose themselves as they have done in this season's previous meetings.",
      "But United have been illogical and unpredictable when it comes to the Europa League this season. When you consider all of the circumstances of their previous meetings with Spurs, it is clear that they won't have much relevance.",
      "Wednesday's game is a different proposition for both sides."

      "Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is set to join Man Utd at the end of the season; United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract; despite interest from other clubs, Cunha wants to play for United and SSN has been told the deal is almost agreed",
      "Monday 19 May 2025 22:18, UK",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to join Manchester United after the season ends this weekend.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11; Value is found in the fouls market where history suggests Europa League finals are foul frenzies; Follow the final via our live match blog from Bilbao on Wednesday",
      "Wednesday 21 May 2025 20:30, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows previews the Europa League final and outlines where the value lies as Spurs and Manchester United look to save their seasons.",
      "This is a beautifully grotesque final. Both teams are balancing on the highwire with no safety net below them.",
      "We can get carried away with overdramatising the outcomes of football matches but this one truly is huge, especially for Tottenham, who have one game to decide whether it's been their best or worst season for many years. It's a ridiculous situation, really.",
      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11. The 90-minute odds have United at 7/4 and Spurs at 29/20.",
      "It's a 50-50 spin of the Roulette wheel. White or red. Heads or tails.",
      "I'm very confused about this game from a betting perspective.",
      "These two teams have been completely different in the Europa League compared to their Premier League form. And usually you'd put more weight in the domestic form to gauge a true ability of a team, especially in this spot as this is an all-Premier League final. But I'm very torn.",
      "United can't score in the Premier League, averaging just 1.14 goals per 90 minutes and have scored just five goals in their last eight games. But look at their Europa League form.",
      "They have averaged 2.5 goals per game this season, scoring a whopping 19 goals in their six games with Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Club in the knockouts.",
      "And then we have Spurs, who are equally as confusing to analyse. As they are a completely different team to their overall form of this Premier League season when their first-choice back five plays under Ange Postecoglou. The difference is simply huge.",
      "When Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie all play under Postecoglou, they have won 18 of those 30 games, losing just six times.",
      "If you were converting that to points per game - that's two per game. If you translate that over the course of a Premier League season of 38 games, you get 76 points, which would be enough to finish a clear second in the Premier League this season. There is a really good side lurking there.",
      "It's a game where backing teams both not to win is actually quite attractive, so the draw in 90 minutes at 23/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play the outright market.",
      "Three of the last four Europa League finals have ended in a stalemate. It's a result which is always a runner in finals of this nature where two big clubs meet with lots on the line.",
      "Much better opportunities are found in the props market for Wednesday's clash in Bilbao, notably in the fouls markets.",
      "The Europa League final has a rich tradition of being a foul-heavy occasion - it makes sense with such riches on the line.",
      "The last 15 Europa League finals have averaged 31.2 fouls per 90 minutes.",
      "That's a huge number.",
      "For context, Premier League matches have averaged 22.5 fouls per 90 this season, so the added jeopardy of a final using those numbers, there could be almost 10 more fouls in this type of game that a run-of-the-mill Premier League game. And when you throw in so much being on the line for these clubs and how evenly matched they are in the betting, I think this game could be very foul-heavy and potentially go way above the number the market is expecting.",
      "Sky Bet has the line set at 24+ match fouls at 5/6 which looks a great starting point for those looking to exploit these total fouls angles. I'd advise laddering the prices on offer with Sky Bet right up to the 10/1 on offer for 32+ match fouls, which has a chance of landing based on the historic averages.",
      "And it's worth noting that Spurs are a foul-heavy team under Postecoglou - he likes to play expansive and man-for-man which creates lots of one-on-one situations in space that therefore lend itself to fouls being made. Since he was appointed, no team in the Premier League has seen more fouls in their matches than Tottenham - that average is 24.5 fouls per 90 over a 75-game sample size in the Premier League.",
      "On the biggest stage, with so much on the line, I'd expect this Spurs game to hit those foul averages so those odds look very generous to me."
