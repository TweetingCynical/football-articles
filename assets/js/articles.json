      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Morten Hjulmand this summer, with the Sporting captain being considered as a potential alternative to Carlos Baleba. However, Hjulmand grew up as a fan of rivals Arsenal and even has the club's badge tattooed on his left arm.",
      "United have spent big on attacking reinforcements so far, bringing in Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while Brighton star Baleba emerged as Ruben Amorim's top midfield target.",
      "However, the Seagulls want more than £100million for Baleba and United are said to have cooled their interest as a result. That has led to them considering a move for Hjulmand, who Amorim knows well from his time in charge of Sporting.",
      "This is despite his love for Arsenal, with Hjulmand telling Portuguese outlet Record last year: \"My dad supported Arsenal and we watched games together when we were younger.\"",
      "It was Amorim who signed Hjulmand for Sporting back in 2023 and the Denmark international has hailed the impact he had on his career. Speaking after Amorim left Sporting for United, Hjulmand said: \"It was also difficult for me to hear.",
      "\"I was sad that Ruben is leaving me and leaving Sporting. It is a great opportunity. I hope that Ruben is proud of himself for getting an offer like this.",
      "\"Of course, Ruben was one of the reasons why I came to Sporting. When you work with Ruben you see a clear picture. That was important when I joined Sporting – first to understand how he plays.",
      "\"The way that he manages the team inside the pitch and outside the pitch as well is not like I anything I have seen in my short career. I think Manchester [United] are in good hands with Ruben.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether Hjulmand will reunite with Amorim at Old Trafford and the United boss has previously insisted that he is happy with his existing midfield options. \"I'm really happy with our players,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"They are working really well, we have different players for that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players. Maybe Mason Mount is a player that I think can play in that position if we want something different.",
      "\"But then we are going to find out [during] the season. We have players to cope to win games in the Premier League.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Arsenal burst back into life in the transfer window to agree a deal for Eberechi Eze and overtake Spurs in the race for the Crystal Palace star's signature. The England international would add another blockbuster arrival for Mikel Arteta's squad.",
      "Eze will join the likes of Martin Zubimendi, Noni Madueke and Victor Gyokeres as the Gunners look to finally earn a Premier League title under their Spanish coach. The midfielder's arrival could be timely after Kai Havertz's latest injury.",
      "It is Eze's arrival that will dominate headlines in the coming days, but where will Arsenal move next? Departures may be required.",
      "Kieran Tierney and Jorginho have left for free already but the likes of Oleksandr ZInchenko, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Jukub Kiwior could yet bring in finances. It is that area that is said to have been a priority late in the window.",
      "Arsenal have placed Lyon forward Malick Fofana onto the shortlist according to reports from France. The 20-year-old remains a key player for the French side but has piqued interest from the Gunners ahead of the end of the transfer window, per L’Équipe.",
      "Lyon are already said to have seen an over from Everton, and Fofana has also been linked with Manchester United. The Ligue 1 giants are still in financial strife and require €40m (£34.6m) to be raised by the end of the month — the valuation of Fofana.",
      "Arsenal are not alone in putting Fofana into their consideration however. Bayern Munich are also reported to be considering a move in the final days of the transfer window.",
      "Werder Bremen are closing in on the signing of Arsenal goalkeeper Karl Hein, per Kicker, via Sport Witness. The Bundesliga side were debating the deal as they also considered Alexander Schwolow but have opted for the Gunners shotstopper.",
      "A deal is now said to be imminent between the sides. Per Mertesacker, Arsenal's head of youth development, is reported to have been involved in negotiations. The north London side are expected to bring in a fee of less than €1m (£0.87m).",
      "Eberechi Eze is expected to have his medical on Friday. The midfield star has already agreed personal terms with Arsenal ahead of a switch to the Emirates with only formalities remaining to get a deal over the line.",
      "It would see a tight schedule for the 27-year-old to meet the deadline required to feature this weekend however. Arsenal face Leeds on Saturday evening.",
      "The Crystal Palace time needs to be registered with his new club by 12pm to be eligible to feature. That could see Arsenal's prospective signing come against Liverpool the following week.",

      "Manchester United have less than two weeks to wrap up their transfer business, having already spent big to strengthen their attack with the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "United have also signed teenage left-back Diego Leon, while Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy and Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof have both departed after their contracts expired.",
      "However, plenty more incomings and outgoings are expected before the transfer window slams shut. Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia are all likely to leave, while Rasmus Hojlund could also depart.",
      "Manchester United's attempts to sell Rasmus Hojlund have suffered a blow after it emerged that AC Milan are prioritising a move for Victor Boniface.",
      "Milan are keen to sign a new striker this summer and sporting director Igli Tare had confirmed that Hojlund was on their radar. \"Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen,\" he told Mediaset.",
      "However, BBC Sport are now reporting that Boniface is on the verge of joining Milan on loan from Bayer Leverkusen. The report states that a deal for Hojlund stalled because the 'structure being negotiated did not include an obligation to buy'.",
      "Manchester United have been heavily linked with a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, but a clause in his contract could complicate things.",
      "Brighton value Baleba at more than £100m and it appears as though a deal is unlikely to be struck this summer, with United willing to wait until next year. However, reports have claimed that there is a sell-on clause which means 15 percent of any fee Brighton receive will go to Lille.",
      "And that means Brighton will likely still demand a huge fee for Baleba next summer as a £100m sale would see them lose £15m to Lille. Baleba joined Brighton from the French club back in 2023 for a fee of around £26m.",
      "Roma are among the clubs that have been linked with Jadon Sancho this summer, but reports from Italy claim that they are considering two potential alternatives.",
      "Tottenham are said to have offered both Manor Solomon and Bryan Gil to Roma and, although Sancho remains their top target, the report states that it is 'not a given' that the 25-year-old will join.",

      "Maguire is highly thought of by the United hierarchy and Ruben Amorim triggered a one-year contract extension option because his squad was “starved of leaders.” Maguire is determined to carry on playing, ideally wants another two years at Old Trafford and United blocked approaches this summer because they wanted to keep the loyal defender.",

      "The winger committed his future to United earlier in the summer, with the club’s technical director Jason Wilcox playing a role in those discussions. That is unusual for an academy player so young and underlines the excitement surrounding him.",
      "Amorim was informed of his progress earlier in the summer and was shown video clips of Gabriel during United’s pre-season tour of the United States. He has reportedly taken a keen interest in his development and has now met Gabriel for himself.",
      "BBC Sport says Amorim has met Gabriel at Carrington and the youngster watched the opening Premier League match of the season against Arsenal from the directors’ box at Old Trafford on Sunday. He has now been told he will be given the opportunity to train with the first team on occasions this season.",

      "He made his Premier League Under-18 debut by starting Saturday's 1-0 win at Everton, but won’t be able to feature in their FA Youth Cup campaign because he is still too young.",
      "Gabriel has been on the radar of United fans after scoring twice for the Under-18s in a 13-1 hammering of Leeds in April. That match saw him become the youngest ever player to feature for United’s U18s and the team’s manager, Darren Fletcher, is in charge of his development.",
      "“It’s important we let them develop,” Fletcher told club media recently when speaking about the development of players such as Gabriel and Kai Rooney – the 15-year-old son of club legend Wayne Rooney.",
      "“They’ve got loads of development to do, but they’re sponges. They want to learn. They’re young boys who just enjoy football. They take on the information, we’re trying to give them a platform on which to express themselves.",
      "“And we have to recognise their age as well. We don’t want them to grow up too quickly. Let them just develop. It’s difficult when they’re on TV, but that’s part of the game and the modern world.",
      "“We don’t want to hold anybody back. If you’re performing, you’re going to get rewards for it. They’ve played because they deserve it, and they’ve shown they can compete and fight at this level. We believe in a variety of experiences, so it’s important they play at their own age group, and it’s important they get tested [at this level] and they find things tough.”",

      "During a quarter-final clash with Barcelona last year, the La Liga giants secured a 3-2 advantage over PSG to take into the return leg at the Camp Nou, with two of those strikes stemming from Donnarumma errors. He was unable to gather a ball whipped into his penalty area, allowing Raphinha to open the scoring.",
      "He said at the time: \"Highlight the goalkeeper here. In the first half, the goalkeeper makes two mistakes from crosses. I think in his head he's said, 'I'm going to stay on my line no matter what now,' and let the responsibility then fall on the defenders to defend this set piece.",
      "\"That's in his six-yard box. He's 6'7\" or so. That's a crime almost, not coming in your six-yard box and claiming that. It wasn't a ball that was too high. It was there to be attacked, but the impact of the first half mistakes lead to that. That's a player at the top of his game that is having to adjust his approach to a certain set piece because of performance.\"",
      "Despite this previous criticism, Ferdinand has also recently praised Donnarumma ahead of his potential Premier League move. On his YouTube channel, the former United defender hailed the keeper as one of Europe's finest, suggesting PSG's desire to part ways with him is due to the changing nature of goalkeeping in football.",
      "Ferdinand said: \"Did you see the stuff about Donnarumma? Wow. One of arguably the best goalkeepers in Europe last year, wins a treble. What I'll do is I'll give you the quote from Enrique, which was brutal right?",
      "\"But I kind of like that. You know where you stand, but I don't think Donnarumma would've loved it. But let's do these quotes anyway. 'Donnarumma is out of the squad as it's my own decision. I am 100 per cent responsible.'",
      "\"He said, 'I want a different type of goalkeeper, and I made this decision.' Wow. Donnarumma is one of the best goalkeepers in the whole world. Just that little caveat to cap it off. One of the best keepers, but just not my type. Now, we would have never seen this 10 years ago.",
      "\"If you are the best goalkeeper in the world, the top club who's winning everything at the time never sells you because you're the best goalkeeper in the world. He might be the best goalkeeper in the world in terms of saving the ball and stuff to stop the ball going into the net, but is he good enough with his feet?",
      "\"I think that is the question, and this is just the ever-evolving kind of identity of a goalkeeper now is very different. I played with so many goalkeepers that could barely reach the halfway line. Couldn't pick anyone out really on a consistent basis.",
      "\"Some could kick it far, but couldn't really have the direction to pick people out. Nowadays, you've got to have like pinpoint accuracy, short and long, over varying distances to be able to understand how to play through the press. If it's two people, three people, or one player pressing, like what's going on behind that press?",
      "\"The goalkeepers now have got to see so much, they're part of the 11 now. It used to be 10 players and the keeper; it's very different now. So Donnarumma is living in a different world of goalkeepers, and I bet people like [Gianluigi] Buffon, Edwin van der Sar, [Peter] Schmeichel, the top goalkeepers of yesteryear are sitting there going, 'Wow, not in my day, that would have never have happened.'\"",

      "Michael Owen believes Manchester United should be pulling out all the stops to sign Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian goalkeeper has impressed with Paris Saint-Germain over the last four years, but it appears as though his stint in the French capital is drawing to a close.",
      "Donnarumma has entered the final year of his contract at the Parc des Princes and is on the hunt for a new club after Les Parisiens enlisted the help of Lucas Chevalier and deemed him surplus to requirements. Ruben Amorim has had a largely successful maiden summer transfer window with the Red Devils, bringing in the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"I mean, he is unbelievable. He's literally one of, if not the best goalkeeper in the world. I mean, he would be the obvious one, but whether they can get him or not is another matter.\"",
      "At present, United have been forced to deploy Altay Bayindir between the sticks as a result of first-choice keeper, Andre Onana, recovering from injury and lacking match sharpness. However, many fans will believe that the club need to replace Onana permanently if they hope to improve on last season's dismal 15th-place Premier League finish.",
      "The Cameroonian has failed to live up to his £47.2million price tag since arriving at Old Trafford from Inter Milan two years ago, and has been lambasted for making a number of high-profile mistakes. While Donnarumma is a viable option at present, given that PSG are reportedly only asking for £40m for the 26-year-old, United will face stiff competition in getting a deal over the line.",
      "Local rivals Manchester City are currently at risk of losing Ederson to Galatasaray, and despite snapping up James Trafford in a £27m move earlier this summer, the youngster may need a little more time to develop before he is a solidified starter.",
      "As a result, the Cityzens are said to be interested in bringing Donnarumma to the Etihad Stadium ahead of deadline day, and talks are said to have commenced with the European champions. However, a reluctance to pay PSG's asking price could leave the door open to a hijacking of the keeper by their neighbours.",
      "With a quartet of Ligue 1 titles, five domestic cups and a Champions League to his name in the French capital, Donnarumma would likely walk straight into the starting XI under Pep Guardiola or Amorim. He also conceded just 25 goals in the league last season and kept five clean sheets.",
      "However, Owen has also highlighted other areas in which United would be wise to focus on improving should they have any hopes of working their way back to dominance in the Premier League. He added: \"Well, I mean, there are areas where they could strengthen.",
      "\"If they want to go and be a top team again and challenge for the league, then there's loads of areas. But just to get back into that sort of European places, then they've probably got a strong enough squad.",
      "\"The goalkeeper looks quite an obvious one that they might need to change at some point. They've not done much surgery to their team apart from right up at the top of the field. So, you know, they've got one or two ageing players in midfield that are going to need changing in time.",
      "\"They've got a lot of defenders at the moment, whether they've got many great ones is a question mark. But I think over time they're going to need to change a fair few players, but just to get them back up in fifth, sixth place type of thing this season, I think they've got more than enough to do that.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Brandon Williams has insisted he has \"learned from his mistakes\" following his suspended jail sentence for a car crash at 99mph as he looks to rebuild his once promising career at Hull City.",
      "Williams was involved in the collision in August 2023 and was charged with dangerous driving and driving without insurance, pleading guilty to both charges.",
      "He was disqualified from driving last year and handed a 14-month jail term earlier this summer, which was suspended for two years.",
      "Williams, now 24, has not played since December 2023 during a loan spell with Ipswich Town and was released by boyhood club United last year.",
      "But now Hull have given Williams a chance to bounce back by giving him a one-year deal and he is eager to make amends - admitting he was \"not in a good place\".",
      "\"It was in the moment I was in, I wasn't in a good place,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside. \"It's a big regret and I've learned from my mistakes. I was still a young boy and I'm grown up now. My focus is back on football and that's all I want to do now.",
      "\"I took action to step away from the game but I feel like I managed it well. I was working in silence. Everyone was questioning what I was doing but I was working the whole time. I was keeping fit and making sure I was ready to step back into football. It was always the aim.\"",
      "Williams said he had \"honest\" meetings with Hull boss Sergej Jakirovic about what it would take to get him back to full fitness after so long out of the game as he opened up on his struggles away while taking a break from football.",
      "\"I had a couple of very honest meetings with the manager,\" he added. \"We know it's going to be a process to get fully back up to speed, having that time out. I appreciated the manager's honesty. Now, it's down to me to work hard and get as many games as I can.",
      "\"It was very difficult (taking a break from football) – mentally and physically. It's been a long road back, but probably something I needed. Now, I'm back here a different person.",
      "\"I've grown up a lot and I'm ready to just focus on the football. I've missed it. I'm hungry, I'm fiery. I know what quality I can bring to the team. As soon as I get back to that, I'm sure I'll be an asset to the team.",
      "\"Now, I've got to show it to the fans and my teammates to prove I'm here to work hard and help the team get results.\"",
      "Williams joined United as a seven-year-old and went on to play 51 times for the Red Devils and was initially loaned to Norwich - where he played 26 times in the Premier League in 2021-22. But he had less success with Ipswich in the Championship in 2022 before his legal troubles began.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe could find himself in a position where he needs to sell his stake in Manchester United and be able to do nothing about it. That is after a clause in the deal that saw him invest in the Red Devils became active little over a week ago.",
      "The INEOS chief paid £1.3billion for 25 per cent of United in February 2024 and has since set about overhauling the setup. Ratcliffe has overseen redundancies, a change in the club's sporting hierarchy and attempted to set a platform for success even as the team finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "But as of August 13, a 'drag-along right' became active, per Mail+. And that means if the Glazers ever want to sell up at Old Trafford, that could see Ratcliffe join them with INEOS having little say in the matter.",
      "Such clauses exist to enable a company to be sold, by preventing circumstances where a minority shareholder can block a deal, when the majority want it to pass. In this instance, the clause came into effect 18 months after Ratcliffe made his investment and ensured that the Glazers are somewhat in control of the billionaire's stake too.",
      "It is something Ratcliffe is keenly aware of, and even appeared to allude to upon the announcement of his investment. \"I don't think we're going to be taking the legal agreements out of the bottom drawer,\" he said.",
      "\"I just hope they gather dust and we never see them. Which it should be. It should be on the basis of a relationship.\"",
      "For the moment, there appears to be little intention of cashing in on the club. The parties would seem to have a good relationship and there is said to be an acknowledgement from the majority owners that INEOS have carried out the dirty work in restructuring the club and taken some of the heat off of the Glazers, while also taking charge of footballing matters.",
      "For his part, Ratcliffe has spoken highly of his partners. In March he said: \"To be fair to the Glazers, they’re really good on the commercial side.",
      "\"The people who advise me say the fans don’t want to hear it. So I’ve got to be cautious. I get a lot of criticism if I support the Glazers, but the fact is they’re really decent people.",
      "\"They’re East Coast, you know — that old East Coast America, they’re very polite, they’re very civilized, they’re the nicest people on the planet. I mean, there isn’t a bad bone in Joel Glazer’s body.\"",
      "Instead he directed criticism at previous club chiefs, and said: \"I wouldn’t have tolerated Ed Woodward, or Richard Arnold.\"",
      "For now, it appears the most likely prospective buyer is not interested in taking advantage of the Glazer's clause coming into play. Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani attempted to buy the club before Ratcliffe's bid for a stake was successful.",
      "Sheikh Jassim the 92 Foundation are said to have 'zero interest' in returning at the moment, despite being aware of the situation.",

      "Curiously, former United boss Erik ten Hag has played a part. Milan are closing in on Nigerian striker Victor Boniface, who has spent the last two years at a Bayer Leverkusen side who now have Ten Hag in the dugout.",
      "According to BBC Sport, Milan are set to bring in the 24-year-old on loan, with an option to make the move permanent. Reports elsewhere put the option at around £26m - significantly less than United's asking price for Hojlund.",
      "Boniface scored 21 times in all competitions in the 2023-24 season as he helped Leverkusen win a league and cup double under Xabi Alonso. He got fewer minutes last season, but still found the net 11 times.",

However, last season top scorer Patrick Schick will continue to lead the line, while Martin Terrier is expected to return to action in the autumn after a serious achilles injury.",

      "Carlos Baleba's contract is believed to contain a sell-on clause that could potentially sting Manchester United. The Red Devils have made their interest in the Brighton and Hove Albion star known this summer.",
      "That's despite the Seagulls' insistence that their gifted midfielder isn't available, while they've also attached whacked a hefty price tag on him of around £100million. As a result, United bosses have reportedly conceded that a move before September 1 is now highly unlikely, and they already have an eye on next year.",
      "However, future attempts to secure the Cameroonian at Old Trafford could be hampered by a sell-on clause, as reported by Fabrizio Romano. It's claimed that Baleba's current deal includes a provision that 15 per cent of any sale from Brighton will go to Lille.",
      "Brighton were said to have agreed the clause with the Ligue 1 team when the two clubs negotiated a deal worth around £26m two years ago. This could shed light on Brighton's steep valuation of Baleba and their firm position in discussions about a sale.",
      "The Seagulls have a specific amount in mind they want to receive to let the young player leave the Amex Stadium, considering a portion of it will go to his former club. Theoretically, without the contract clause, United might have been looking at an £85m asking price for Baleba, as Brighton wouldn't be losing £15m of their £100m valuation to Lille in that scenario.",
      "Selling players would certainly ease the PSR pressure on the Red Devils. And while there's still hope that a deal can be struck to offload Alejandro Garnacho, with Chelsea reportedly closing in on the winger, other surplus players like Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony seem to be stuck in limbo.",
      "United have managed to cut around £12million from their wage bill after Marcus Rashford agreed to a year-long loan to Barcelona with an option to buy, although the club were hopeful of finding a permanent home for the academy graduate, who has fallen out of favour with Amorim.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund's future is uncertain following the arrival of Sesko from RB Leipzig in a £73.7m deal earlier this month. Despite being linked with loan moves to Napoli and AC Milan, the Dane is determined to stay in the north west and fight for his place in the new season.",
      "Amorim struggled last season with his ageing midfield, including Casemiro and Christian Eriksen, but it's not just the middle of the pitch that needs bolstering before the transfer deadline.",
      "Andre Onana, who cost a hefty £47.2m from Inter Milan in 2023, has failed to justify his price tag, making several costly errors in the Premier League despite being touted as one of the world's top goalkeepers.",
      "The Cameroonian has only just returned from a hamstring injury, leading to Altay Bayindir stepping in as Amorim's chosen keeper for United's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday. After United's 1-0 defeat, it remains to be seen whether they will make a last-minute bid for a new No. 1 before the transfer window closes.",

      "Alexander Isak is seemingly happy to burn bridges left, right and centre in an effort to force his Newcastle exit. His latest shot came in the form of a statement, accusing Newcastle of broken promises.",
      "The Swede is currently refusing to train or play for the Magpies, making it known he's played his final game for them. All of that whilst his employers maintain he is not for sale despite Liverpool's well publicised interest.",
      "Isak has claimed that \"promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time.\" His downing of tools has come as a huge shock given his status as a hero on Tyneside, his role in Newcastle's recent rise and the way he's come across so far during his time in England.",
      "Alan Shearer admits he \"didn't think Isak had this in him\" as the player pulls out all the stops to get his way, despite having three years left on his deal. Reconciliation appears a long way away, perhaps even something that can no longer be achieved.",
      "Whilst the transfer market is open and Isak can get a way out, he'll continue to push, but if he's still at the club come September he may have to try and make amends. Especially with a World Cup to come this summer.",
      "Coming back from such depths may seem lightyears away now, but it has been achieved. Just ask some of the Premier League's greatest ever forwards. Isak isn't the first, and won't be the last, major name to decide he's had enough. Only to realise playing for the club he was desperate to leave is his only hope.",
      "Some regard Luis Suarez's efforts in 2013/14 as the best single season by a player in Premier League history. He scored 31 times in 33 games as he almost hauled Liverpool to their first title in decades. He picked up numerous individual accolades whilst doing so.",
      "But that summer it looked as if his time at Anfield was over as he publicly called out the club, demanding they sell him so that he could play in the Champions League. Liverpool had missed out on the top four and the Uruguayan seemingly didn't want to stick around with Arsenal circling.",
      "He said: \"I gave absolutely everything last season. Now all I want is for Liverpool to honour our agreement.\" Suarez went on to say: \"I am 26, I need to be playing in the Champions League. I feel I have done enough to be playing in the Champions League at this stage of my career.\"",
      "Four months later and, in the midst of an astonishing individual season, he signed a new long-term deal to become a top earner at Liverpool. Yes he would leave for Barcelona soon after, but his performances would win back over the red folk on Merseyside.",
      "Another man who won over those wearing red was one Wayne Rooney. He took on Sir Alex Ferguson, having been frustrated by the lack of ambition being shown by Manchester United in the transfer market. He wanted to know who was going to be signed and when.",
      "Rooney had seen Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo leave and was left firmly as the main man at Old Trafford. He spoke with major individuals at the club but they \"did not give me any of the assurances I was seeking about the future squad\" as Rooney made it clear he wouldn't sign a new deal back in 2010.",
      "Ferguson was frustrated by the matter and the Evertonian had to sit out whilst the initial anger came, which only amplified with talk of a move to Manchester City.",
      "48 hours later though and all was well. Rooney signed a new deal and vowed to do whatever he could to get the fans back onside. He said: \"Some fans may not take to me again very quickly. It may take time. But I will give everything. I will give 100 per cent and try to build that relationship back.\"",
      "That February Rooney would score a stunning overhead kick to down United's Manchester rivals - a goal that Ferguson would declare as the greatest he'd ever seen in his time at the club. The forward would spend another seven years at Old Trafford en route to becoming their all-time leading goalscorer.",
      "Another man heavily linked with City was Harry Kane, this back in the summer of 2021. Fresh from his efforts with England in the Euros, the Tottenham striker knew a rebuild was on the cards in north London. He was at the peak of his powers and still without a trophy.",
      "The champions were in the market for a new striker and wanted the England captain. He left Tottenham fans furious when in an interview with Gary Neville he put his own valuation on his head and suggested that him leaving would suit him and his club - which the latter clearly didn't agree with.",
      "Tottenham stood firm and refused to sell Kane, who had to sit out of the opening games as the noise around his future continued. In a similar situation to Isak, Kane felt an agreement was in place to let him leave and frustration mounted when he wasn't allowed to depart.",
      "Kane would cop boos from some Tottenham fans as he reintegrated himself into the team, albeit his performances were not always at the desired level. The striker is often referred to as \"one of our own\" in a song sung by the home crowd in Tottenham and he would enjoy his moment in the sun soon enough.",
      "He scored a brace to down City on his first meeting against them following his transfer saga. The following season and a winning goal against the same Manchester outfit would officially see him become the club's all-time record goalscorer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Eberechi Eze will get his move Arsenal in the coming days after the Gunners stole a march to land the winger ahead of north London rivals Tottenham.",
      "Eze always preferred a move to Arsenal and the Gunners will stump up the £68million needed to sign him which is a major boost for Mikel Arteta, but a great frustration for Thomas Frank who has missed out on another attacking target.",

      "The England international has been heavily linked with a move to Liverpool and has just a year left on his contract. But Glasner issued a defiant response to speculation, saying he has to stay until at least the end of next week and their Conference League qualifier second leg with Fredrikstad.",
      "\"We have to, especially for the second leg,\" Glasner told Channel 5 when asked if Palace would hold onto Guehi. \"No injured player will come back and we cannot register anyone so we have to keep him.",
      "\"There is no other choice than keeping Marc for these games. He knows it, everybody knows it. If we want to compete in all of these competitions we need players, that is pretty clear.\"",
      "Palace chairman Steve Parish has a more realistic approach though. He said: “If Marc wants to sign a new contract then he can stay! It’s a difficult situation. Everyone has to sell players to comply with the rules. That’s a situation that we will have to look at in the next 11 days.”",

      "But the Lions will demand a far greater fee in order to sanction a sale to a divisional rival and talks have been held over a financial package which would be closer to the south Londoner's valuation of the player, which is significant.",
      "A departure would send Millwall into the market for defensive reinforcements ahead of the September 1 transfer deadline and they have been monitoring targets in that area in recent months given the interest in Tanganga.",

      "\"I don't think [so], because [that would mean] I would be unhappy with the squad and I am happy with the squad we are having,\" he said.",
      "\"I say two players for each position is ideal but sometimes less is more so you are not disappointing players. I am happy with the squad but if we think there is a player who can really make us better then this club has always shown they can bring them in.",

      "The Magpies have already failed in attempts to sign Hugo Ekitike, Liam Delap and Benjamin Sesko this summer, while their bid to sign Brentford's Yoane Wissa have reached no conclusion.",
      "But now the Express and Star are reporting that Eddie Howe's side are pushing to sign Wolves forward Jorgen Strand Larsen - though they would need around £60m to pull off any deal. The 25-year-old scored an impressive 14 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "The first step of the transfer has already been completed, the report says, with Newcastle already agreeing personal terms for the Norwegian.",
      "Jamie Vardy is still on the lookout for a new club after leaving Leicester City this summer.",
      "The former Premier League winner proved he can still deliver at the highest level after scoring 10 goals for the Foxes last season in the top flight and former Wrexham boss Dean Saunders believes the Racecourse Ground would be a good fit.",
      "Speaking to OLBG, he said: \"Jamie Vardy, he's 38, but he's still quick. You never lose your eye for a goal, ever. Even now I can't play, but my football brain's still there, I just can't run anymore. Well Vardy can still run and his football brain is still the same.",
      "\"To score as many goals as he scored, you've got to anticipate before everybody else where the ball's going to go. And he does. So I'd like to see Wrexham sign Jamie Vardy if they could.",
      "\"Obviously I think his last wages was probably £150,000 a week, so they're about £130,000 short. But you never know at his age, you might just want to be part of it for two years, to get him to 39. I still think he's a good player. I still think he'd do a job in the Championship.\"",
      "This one has been in the works for some time. Leverkusen have snapped up the signing of Manchester City star Echeverri on loan for the remainder of the season, which will come as a huge boost to manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Echeverri can play as an attacking midfielder or winger and gives his manager options after losing Florian Wirtz to Liverpool for a British record of £116.5m.",
      "Echeverri is still only 19 and still has plenty of time to make a name for himself after joining Pep Guardiola's side last year.",
      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire has revealed he had interest in him this summer but opted to stay after admitting it would have been \"silly\" to leave Ruben Amorim's project.",
      "United activated an extension in his contract at the start of the year and Maguire has insisted he wasn't interested in clubs who made approaches for him in this window.",
      "“Last year was the clause in their hands so there was no option for me there,” he said. “There was no talking. It was just they activated it and it got extended.",
      "“This year, obviously I’m up at the end of the year. I’m pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can’t leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract. Yes. I think there was a couple of clubs who maybe enquired or spoke with them and I think they got a quick response.",
      "“We’re in a good place, positive as a club and I feel like the hierarchy has come in and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the manager, I feel like they’re taking it in the right direction.\"",
      "Fabian Hurzeler kept his cards close to his chest when asked about Julio Enciso's impending move to Strasbourg.",
      "“There are some rumours, there are some talks, but nothing is done yet so we can’t comment on that,” the Brighton boss told reporters.",
      "“I wouldn’t say it didn’t work. Some players perform better in some environments. Some players struggle with some cultural things. But overall I wouldn’t say it was a bad time if he were to leave.\"",
      "Maghnes Akliouche has emerged as a target for Tottenham after their recent transfer blows.",

      "Chelsea have already passed up on an opportunity to sign the former Dortmund star, paying United to get out of an obligation to buy after an up-and-down loan spell.",
      "Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis claims he wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres in the summer of 2024 but was hamstrung by a promise made to Antonio Conte that he would keep Khvicha Kvaratskhelia rather than selling the Georgian to raise funds.",
      "\"PSG had offered over 200m for the Kvara and Osimhen package,\" De Laurentiis told Italian media.",
      "“However, I had promised Conte I would keep, and I didn’t feel like going back on my word. With those funds, the idea was to buy Gyokeres.”",
      "Kvaratskhelia only ended up staying until January, when he did complete that PSG move. Conte ended up signing Romelu Lukaku rather than Gyokeres, and his 14 goals helped Napoli pip Inter Milan to the title.",

      "Harry Maguire will discuss his future with Manchester United ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Maguire has entered the final year of his contract at Old Trafford, which means he will be free to talk to overseas clubs when the January window opens.",
      "United triggered the one-year extension in Maguire's contract last season. After a turbulent time at the club, the 32-year-old defender has enjoyed an Old Trafford renaissance in the last 18 months.",
      "Maguire overcame his confidence crisis and is regarded as a key player in Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "However, Maguire started on the bench against Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday, with Matthijs de Ligt picked ahead of him for the central role in Amorim's back-three.",
      "United will decide whether to offer Maguire a new contract this season and the England international discussed his future with journalists at an event at Stretford High School.",
      "\"Last year, the clause was in their hands, so there was no option for me there,\" he said. \"There was no talking. It was just that they activated it, and it got extended. This year, obviously I'm up at the end of the year.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can't leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract.",
      "\"I'm sure over the next few months they'll sit down and we'll have to have a conversation about where we want to go and if they want to extend, or obviously the transfer window will open again in January.",
      "\"Obviously, I have something in my mind about what I want to do and what I want to be. I don't want to put it out there to everybody, but it's an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.\"",
      "Maguire was asked to clarify whether United said he was not leaving this summer, and he responded: \"Yes, I think there were a couple of clubs who maybe enquired or spoke with them and I think they got a quick response.",
      "\"Like I said, we're in a good place, positive as a club and I feel like the hierarchy has come in and Jason [Wilcox] and the manager, I feel like they're taking it in the right direction.",
      "\"I think it's been, since I started six years ago to where it is now, it's in a completely different place in terms of the structure behind the management staff.\"",
      "Maguire continued: \"I feel in a good place. It's been a couple of years now where I feel like I've played really well for this club again. I only had six months really where I had a bad dip of form. The previous two years was excellent. I've been a lot better in the last two-and-a-half years.",
      "\"Now I'm in a good place. I'm in a good place with the club and the fans. I've got a real good bond with them and it's a real special place to play. It's a huge privilege and honour to play for this club and it's something that I'll always be forever grateful for.\"",
      "Maguire attended a Manchester United Foundation event at Stretford High School to meet children between eight and 14 years old at a multi-sports holiday camp.",
      "The initiative is aimed at children in areas of social deprivation and low-income households, offering a range of sports throughout the day and a free lunch for the attendees.",

      "Harry Maguire feels comfortable in his own skin again following a turbulent chapter of his career at Manchester United.",
      "Maguire was once booed by 'United fans' during a pre-season friendly at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Now his name is sung loudly by the Stretford End when he emerges to warm up on the touchline.",
      "The 32-year-old's redemption arc has put him on the path to cult hero status in Manchester and children at Stretford High School were delighted to see him at an event on Wednesday.",
      "Maguire visited a multi-sports holiday camp, aimed at children in areas of social deprivation and low-income households, to kick a ball with young fans and inspire the next generation.",
      "By the time of Maguire's appearance, the dust had settled on the Arsenal defeat and he said: \"It's disappointment in the end because this club demands winning football matches. And when you play for this club, you should never get the feeling of being happy after a game if you don't win.",
      "\"The first feeling, especially a couple of days after, is disappointment because we're sat at the table with zero points and we know it should be more. However, you can look at the pluses: the performance was a lot better, a lot more intensity and we actually deserved to get something from the game. There are two sides of it, but like I said, the gut feeling inside is disappointment.\"",
      "United were unfortunate to lose against Arsenal and the performance boded well for 2025/2026. \"I think last year we just weren't as big a threat going forward as we should have been for this club,\" said Maguire.",
      "\"This club demands players who create chances, score goals and that's what it's done throughout its history. So, I think Brian [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha] coming in, Sesko coming off the bench, these are players who have proven that they're going to score goals and create chances.",
      "\"I think last year there was some good performance against Tottenham and I remember going to Arsenal in the cup and playing with 10 men throughout it all, and we were very comfortable in the game. Going forward in that game, again, we just didn't create as much as we'd like. So, hopefully that's the things to come this season, should I say, in terms of that we're creating and scoring a lot more goals.\"",
      "Maguire discussed United's new signings, adding: \"Like I said, first and foremost, they're going to be a threat. I think when you play against them as an opposition defender, you're not going to have an easy afternoon.",
      "\"You're always going to be aware because you know that in one moment Matheus can score from anywhere or he can produce that little bit of magic, or Bryan can, like I say, he can score at the back post or he can curl one in.",
      "\"And then Benjamin [Sesko] is just a huge... He's obviously got great physical attributes and he's quick and he's strong and he's tall. He's very good in the air, attacking crosses and his movement in the box is really good. I think they're going to create and score goals, and that's what this club demands.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim appointed a new six-man leadership group this summer, consisting of Maguire, Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Noussair Mazraoui and Tom Heaton.",
      "Amorim feels strongly about having a group of players who have an influence on the dressing room, and the group should also reduce the workload on Fernandes' shoulders.",
      "\"I think the manager obviously wanted a group of players that he can speak to instead of piling it all on Bruno all the time,\" said Maguire. \"Maybe taking a little bit of weight off his shoulders as well in terms of he can lean on us for decisions and things.",
      "\"The manager likes a group of players, he's picked his group and it doesn't mean that anyone outside of that group of players isn't important to the manager or isn't seen as a leader because there are numerous leaders who aren't in that leadership group. It's just a small group.",
      "\"But if I'm being honest, Bruno is still the captain of the club. He's in charge of the players, but we'll give him a big support, which to be honest, we did and I did before that. So, I think it's probably getting made out a little bit more than what it actually is.",
      "\"It's just a group where we can feed things through to the staff and the management and look after the club in general and give Bruno a little bit of weight off his shoulders.\"",
      "Maguire continued: \"I think instead of everyone always going to Bruno and giving Bruno the problems and then he has to feed them through, I think he can lead off the other six players as well.",
      "\"Also, the six who he's chosen have got to obviously drive the standards in training day in, day out. It's an experienced group of people, but like I said, I think it is probably getting looked into a little bit too much.",
      "\"I think as a squad of 25, we've all got to be leaders in there. To play for this club, you've got to be a big personality and you've got to be your own leader in your own way. So, yes, it's a group, but like I say, it doesn't make anyone more important than others.\"",
      "Maguire was named on the bench against Arsenal last weekend and Matthijs de Ligt started in the centre of the back-three. Maguire agreed that reacting professionally to selection decisions is part of his role.",
      "\"I think I've always done that throughout my career,\" he said. \"It's not something just because I'm in this leadership group that I'll start to do now. I'm sure there's going to be many games I play this season and I'm going to be playing a lot of games from the start. I know that.",
      "\"The manager has got a lot of tough choices now. I think the squad is really competitive, really good competition, good high-level players in each position. Yes, me and Matthijs have been playing that central role, but also we can play either side in the back three as well. I've proven that.",
      "\"I've done that for England and Matthijs has done that numerous times for the Netherlands as well. No, there's competition for places all over the pitch and I think that's healthy in the squad.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Amorim has banished the 'bomb squad'. The dressing room mood has improved and sources have admitted Amorim has created a feeling of 'us against them' by excluding some big names.",
      "Maguire said: \"It's a great feeling in the dressing room. I think it was nice, if I'm being honest, to just feel like it was a bit of a fresh start after last season. Last season was so tough to play in there.",
      "\"The situation that we were in, February, March time, we've got nothing to play for. It was a real tough, apart from the Europa League obviously and everyone was focusing on that.",
      "\"But then when you get beat in the Premier League, it still piles down on you. It was a tough situation for the manager to come into and all his staff because he was really preparing for the Europa League and we never had a settled team in the Premier League.",
      "\"I think this season you're going to see a lot more competitiveness from us in the Premier League. But listen, the camp is always positive going into a season when you play for this club.",
      "\"The results determine how it goes, and that's what we need to drive and maintain and make sure that it stays positive throughout because we want to get good results and good performances.\"",
      "Maguire has entered the autumn of his career and is well-positioned to offer advice. United received intense criticism last season and Maguire would advise his younger colleagues to ignore social media.",
      "\"I'm sure they'd have been getting slaughtered left, right and centre, if I'm being honest,\" responded Maguire when asked about social media abuse last season. \"I hope they don't go on and read the comments when they've had a bad game, or read the direct messages on Instagram.",
      "\"I hope the players stay away and they learn that they don't need to be told by other people whether they're doing right or wrong. As a footballer, you know if you're playing well and you know if you're doing things right and if you make a mistake, you know if you've made a mistake.",
      "\"So, you don't need to go on and get clarification from other people. We know where social media is. It's a tough place sometimes, but then also it does have its positives that you can connect in a positive way and see day-to-day things. It can be good and it can be bad.\"",
      "Did Maguire ever come to a point where he had to switch off completely? \"No, not really,\" he replied. \"I've always been quite good at handling criticism or whatever. It doesn't really get to me or bother me too much.",
      "\"I've been mentally strong throughout it all, but I'm only speaking advice now I'm 32. I'm giving these younger lads experience that they are going to go through sticky times at this club, no matter how good it is.",
      "\"I'm sure the likes of David Beckham and Wayne Rooney went through it, and they are world-class players. Wayne's one of the best players to play for England and this club, and he had so much abuse.",
      "\"You're going to get it. You've just got to find the best way of dealing with it. There's a lot of club and support around them now and rightly so.\"",
      "In a recent interview with Rio Ferdinand, Maguire said that some social media abuse is dished out by people who just want to see United fail. \"Yes, I do believe that a lot of the social media laughing and joking and the memes and things like that obviously are rival fans,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not saying it's just Manchester United players who get it because there will be other players who get it. It's other top clubs as well. It's part and parcel of playing for this club. It's one of the best clubs in the world and you get a lot of spotlight on you, and you've got to learn to deal with it.\"",
      "Maguire showed remarkable mental strength to overcome a difficult period. In his own words, he is in a \"better place\" now. His relationship with supporters has been salvaged and he is keen to savour fan events, like at Stretford High School, as he enters the final year of his contract.",
      "\"When I joined this club, I noticed straight away that you have a huge responsibility on the pitch, but you also have a massive responsibility off the pitch and this club has a worldwide fan base,\" he said.",
      "\"It's incredible. You don't realise it until you're actually in it, the fan base, when you go on tours, when you go to Malaysia and India and when you come to places like this, there's so many kids out there, they're all in Man United kits. After the season we had last year as well, our fans just stick with us.",
      "\"We lost the Europa League final against Spurs, awful season for ourselves and then we go and play Villa at home against Old Trafford and it was packed out, the atmosphere was unbelievable.",
      "\"We got clapped off the pitch at the end of the game. It just doesn't happen at other clubs and the fans at this club have been incredible with us and now I feel like we're on a bit of a start of a journey with everything in place to take this club back to where it should be and it's one that I'm looking forward to be part of.\"",
      "Maguire continued: \"It's amazing to be here with the kids. When you turn up and you see them chanting your name and just putting a big smile on their face, the energy is infectious.",
      "\"And I take some of this energy and take it back to the training ground. It’s nice in terms of that because when you come here, like I say, they're having fun, but they're working hard and they're out in the fresh air.",
      "\"It's really good for them physically, mentally, playing with their friends, socialising. So, it's great to see them all playing with a big smile on their face.\"",
      "Maguire has been playing with a smile on his own face again in the last 18 months.",

      "In June, it was confirmed that Cox was to leave the academy after nine years of service to become technical director at Everton. During his time in charge, Cox has played a pivotal role in United's academy's renaissance, securing top youth signings and overseeing an FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Friday, August 22.",
      "United are back in Premier League action this weekend as they face their first away game of the season. Ruben Amorim takes his side to Craven Cottage on Sunday afternoon (4.30pm kick-off) as the team look to bounce back from a narrow 1-0 defeat against Arsenal in the first game.",
      "That match at Old Trafford saw new signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all make their debuts for the club. While action on the pitch may have started, there is still work going on behind the scenes in the final days of the transfer window.",
      "United continue to be linked with possible incomings. With the club seemingly moving on from Brighton's Carlos Baleba, a midfield signing seems to be the priority with several names linked.",
      "Meanwhile, outgoings remain a key focus. Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Højlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia are all expected to leave the club before the window closes.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Rasmus Hojlund still remain at Manchester United.",
      "Garnacho, Sancho, Antony and Malacia have all trained alone at Carrington since communicating their desire to leave. Marcus Rashford is the only member of the 'bomb squad' to have sealed a departure.",
      "Chelsea are the front runners to sign Garnacho, but United are determined not to allow the youngster to leave for a fee below his market value in the final weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Read more here",
      "Michael Owen believes Manchester United should be doing everything possible to secure Gianluigi Donnarumma's signature.",
      "The Italian shot-stopper has excelled in his four-year spell with Paris Saint-Germain, though it seems his time in the French capital is nearing its end. Donnarumma has reached the final 12 months of his deal at the Parc des Princes and is searching for fresh opportunities after Les Parisiens brought in Lucas Chevalier as a replacement.",
      "Ruben Amorim has enjoyed a predominantly positive first summer in the transfer market with the Red Devils, securing talents like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, Owen thinks he ought to be considering bolstering the club's choices between the sticks, particularly given that Donnarumma is looking for a move.",

Fast forward to today and only Rashford has left the club. Unfortunately for United, Malacia, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony remain on the books and moves away don't seem to be close. Garnacho has recently reportedly rejected a move to Bayern Munich in favour of Chelsea, though that is no closer to being finalised than before, while Antony continues to be heavily linked with returning to Real Betis.",

      "Could the Glazer family really kick Sir Jim Ratcliffe out of Manchester United? The answer is yes.",
      "However, it's highly unlikely, so here is an explainer of the headlines you may have seen.",
      "When Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake at Old Trafford in February 2024, a clause was inserted into the deal which essentially stipulated the Glazers would have the ability to force all shareholders - including Ineos - to sell their shares after 18 months of the investment being signed off.",
      "The ‘drag-along clause’ means the Glazer family have the right to sell to a third party, and to force Ratcliffe to sell his shares; however, Ratcliffe has the right to match any such offer.",
      "Drag-alongs are commonplace in the business world. They make it easier for a company to be sold, as they prevent the possibility of a minority shareholder blocking a deal that the majority want to take place.",
      "For Ratcliffe to be 'kicked out', the board, which includes Ineos-appointed representatives, would have to vote in favour of a sale. And the Glazers must receive an offer that Ratcliffe was not prepared to match.",
      "The Glazers could only force Ratcliffe into a sale if the offer was a minimum of $33 per share because that's how much Ratcliffe paid to acquire an initial 27.7 per cent of the club.",
      "Ratcliffe's ownership increased to 28.94 per cent in December after he injected a further £79.3m.",
      "In 2023, Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe were in talks with The Raine Group, who oversaw the sale of the club on behalf of the Glazers, and both camps briefed confidence throughout the process.",
      "However, Ratcliffe won the battle and acquired a minority stake. Sheikh Jassim made an offer of around £5.5billion to gain full control of the club, but the Qatari failed to provide proof of funds during talks.",
      "Sheikh Jassim's offer included a promise to clear all of United's debt and included a separate fund directed solely for the club and the surrounding community, but his legitimacy was doubtful throughout the process.",
      "Regardless of the red flags with Sheikh Jassim, there is no suggestion that he could return to the table. And crucially, there is no suggestion that the Glazers are looking to sell.",
      "The American family get along with Ratcliffe and Avram Glazer has sat alongside the British billionaire at matches.",
      "Earlier this year, Ratcliffe spoke to The Times and said: \"To be fair to the Glazers, they're really good on the commercial side. The people who advise me say the fans don't want to hear it. So I've got to be cautious. I get a lot of criticism if I support the Glazers, but the fact is they're really decent people.",
      "\"They're East Coast, you know - that old East Coast America, they're very polite, they're very civilized, they're the nicest people on the planet. There isn't a bad bone in Joel Glazer's body. Part of the problem is there isn't a bad bone in his body.",
      "\"We have a very professional partnership with the Glazer family. They're really honest and straightforward, not what you expect when you read about them in the press. And they're both [Avram and Joel - the most involved in the club] passionate about Manchester United.",
      "\"I like them as people - to be honest, they could have given us a bloody hard time, couldn't they, after we cocked up with Dan Ashworth and Erik ten Hag? Could have, but didn't.\"",
      "The Glazers are believed to be pleased with Ratcliffe's investment since gaining control of football operations.",
      "The 72-year-old has put in $300m (£223) of his own money, which has paid for the £50m upgrade to Carrington, and has outlined an ambition to win the Premier League again by 2028.",
      "“Manchester United are the biggest football club in the world,” said Ratcliffe at the unveiling of Carrington's makeover. “I can testify to that because I travel a lot and everywhere I go, however remote, I always meet Manchester United fans.",
      "“Everyone in the world knows the Manchester United brand, so with those two things the club has to compete at the highest level, that’s appropriate to the brand and the size and the history of the club.",
      "“While a world-class facility won’t take us to that place alone, I think it is one of the key ingredients in the modern world. I think here now we have a world-class training facility.",
      "“When we first arrived, two years ago, I came to Carrington and we had a nice presentation here. It’s an excellent facility and I’m sure it was in the year 2000 but 25 years later it wasn’t quite what it needed to be for the top four or five teams in Europe.",
      "“It was pretty much the first big decision we made when we arrived, in the first quarter of 2024, to invest in this training facility.",
      "“There were lots of naysayers around, who said you’re not going to do that within 12 months, it’s going to be a mess, but I’m quite pleased to say that it’s come in on budget, on time and we’ve managed to operate all the teams here in reduced facilities but we made it work in that 12-month period.”",
      "It would not be within the Glazers' interest to show Ratcliffe the door at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Amorim's straight talking demeanour is one of the qualities that most struck co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who revealed the pair share a 'blunt' but 'really good' relationship.",
      "\"I really, really like Ruben,\" Ratcliffe said back in March.",
      "\"He’s a very thoughtful guy. Every time I go to the training ground, I speak to Ruben.",
      "\"I sit down and have a cup of coffee with him and tell him where it’s going wrong, and he tells me to f*** off. I like him.\"",
      "And that refreshing approach has made him a much more quotable manager in press conferences, as evidenced when United last visited Sunday's opponents Fulham at Craven Cottage in January.",
      "A deflected Lisandro Martinez goal earned a United a hard fought 1-0 win in west London but the post-match questions surrounded the continued absence of Marcus Rashford, who had not made an appearance for United in over a month.",
      "Amorim had not been impressed by Rashford on the training ground and stunned reporters with his brutal explanation of why he was not planning to recall the England international to his squad.",
      "\"It’s the same, it’s always the same reason. The reason is the training, the way I see what footballers should do in training, in life, it’s every day, every detail.",
      "\"So if things don’t change, I will not change. It’s the same situation for every player. If you do the maximum, if you do the right things, we can use every player.",
      "\"And you can see it today on the bench, we miss a little bit of pace to go and change the game, move some pieces. But I prefer it like that. I will put [Jorge] Vital [United's 63-year-old goalkeeping coach] on before I put a player on that don’t give the maximum every day.",
      "\"So I will not change in that department.\"",
      "That honesty was appreciated by supporters. Less so by Rashford, who was shipped off on loan to Aston Villa just days later.",
      "United reiterated the observation was applicable to all players and not just Rashford, and now United have a number of players in their 'bomb squad' they are looking to offload.",
      "United have welcomed five new senior signings since Amorim's appointment. Patrick Dorgu joined in January, while Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Benjamin Sesko have joined this summer.",
      "While all those players bring obvious qualities, Amorim has spoken highly about their character away from the pitch, too.",
      "\"It is a key point in our way to do things now,\" Amorim said when discussing why United signed Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "\"It's not just how they play, it's really important of course, but the character is really important.",
      "\"We took a lot of time to know the players, to talk with everybody before we bring a player to our group. That is going to be massive in our decision to bring players.\"",
      "Despite defeat on the opening weekend to Arsenal, United looked much stronger than they did last season. Cunha and Mbeumo were not only threatening in forward areas but led the press expertly, too.",
      "Wins are the most important currency, though, and they must find that elusive first one of the season at Craven Cottage.",
      "Seven months on from one of Amorim's most famous press conference quotes, he will want his words to be vindicated by the actions of his new-look team built in his image.",

      "Further updates have emerged about Rasmus Hojlund's future amid rumours of a potential exit from Manchester United.",
      "Hojlund's future has been the subject of intense speculation all summer as the United striker looks increasingly likely to leave the club. The Denmark international has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford after the club signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig in a £74million deal, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo also arriving this summer.",
      "As a result, United have been open to letting Hojlund leave the club this summer on a permanent deal. The Reds are believed to be seeking around £30million for the striker's signature, and a return to Italy is seemingly on the cards.",
      "Sky Italy are reporting that Napoli are exploring a deal to sign Hojlund and are willing to give the striker the demands that he wants. It has been claimed that Hojlund would like a loan deal with an obligation to buy, something which Napoli are apparently ready to offer.",
      "The report does not state what fee Napoli would be willing to pay to sign Hojlund on a permanent deal following a loan spell, which would last for the entirety of the season. Hojlund was not part of the United squad that faced Arsenal at Old Trafford in their Premier League opener on Sunday.",
      "It remains to be seen whether United would sanction a deal for Hojlund to join Napoli on loan, even if it does include an obligation to make the move permanent. Chelsea had the same clause in the loan deal for Jadon Sancho 12 months ago, but instead chose to pay a penalty fee that saw the striker return to Old Trafford.",

      "Parma goalkeeper Zion Suzuki has opened up on his future after transfer links with Manchester United. Previous reports from talkSPORT claimed that the Reds were stepping up their scouting of the £40million valued keeper.",
      "The Japanese international shone for a side battling relegation in Italy's Serie A last season. The 22-year-old made 37 appearances across all competitions for Parma and played a key role in their survival campaign.",
      "United agreed a fee with Urawa Red Diamonds to sign Suzuki on a permanent transfer in the summer of 2023. However, he rejected the move and joined Belgian side Sint-Truiden on loan.",
      "And the shot-stopper has now had his say on previous 'rumours' amid United's goalkeeping struggles with Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir having struggled badly at Old Trafford.",
      "“I know there were a lot of rumours about me, but I’m totally focused on Parma and preparing to start the season well,\" he told Tuttomercatoweb.",
      "\"Parma made me a fantastic offer, so I immediately decided to accept and join this club. Last year was an opportunity to grow, and I’m really happy with my choice.”",
      "Referring to his first season in Italy, he added: “In the end, we achieved our goal, which was to stay in Serie A. I’ve grown a lot, and it was a good season.",
      "\"It taught me the importance of preparation, because only if you train well and in a certain way can you perform well. First of all, I want to reduce the number of goals conceded, because last season we conceded a lot.",
      "\"That’s my first personal goal, then as a team, we want to raise the bar and not just fight for survival.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Brandon Williams has opened up on a 'difficult' period in his life after signing for Hull City on a free transfer.",
      "Williams came through the United youth set-up and made 51 appearances for the first team. The former England under-21 international spent loan spells away from Old Trafford with Norwich City and Ipswich Town but his career was turned upside down two years ago.",
      "Williams was involved in a high-speed car crash. Thankfully there were no fatalities or serious injuries caused by the incident.",
      "The 24-year-old was handed a 14-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, a three-year driving ban, and a significant amount of community service in May at Chester Crown Court.",
      "After being released by United last summer, Williams last played a competitive match back in December 2023 and his career was in jeopardy.",
      "He has been handed a lifeline by the Tigers after impressing on trial, signing an initial one-year contract at the MKM Stadium with the option of a further year.",
      "And after being given a second chance in football, Williams is determined to pay back the people he has 'let down' as he reflected on the mistakes he has made in the past.",
      "\"It was just a learning process. Things did happen, but like I said, I've learned from them now,\" Williams told Hull Live.",
      "\"I'm growing up now, I'm not a young player no more. I'm becoming one of the senior players in the squad as well, so it's important for me to help the young players as well because I know how difficult it is.",
      "\"It was difficult because everyone kind of forgot what I actually achieved; people don't understand that. I didn't even understand at the time what I've actually achieved (playing for Manchester United at such a young age).",
      "\"There are a lot of people in the world who would wish that for their child or something like that. It was upsetting that I've let a lot of people down; it's for me to get things right now. Like, I've always said as well, I don't want any sympathy from anyone.",
      "\"It was my actions; I took responsibility for them. I've apologised, and all I can do now is just focus on my football and get things right on the pitch, and I'm sure that people will appreciate that.\"",
      "Williams is in line to make his Hull debut this weekend when they take on Blackburn Rovers in the Championship.",

      "United have addressed their blunt attack, they have good options in defence, they are looking to strengthen their midfield, and yet it will all count for nothing if they don't have a selection of dependable goalkeepers.",
      "Tom Heaton did no harm to his chances of adding to his three competitive appearances for United in pre-season. The veteran shot-stopper looked solid against Bournemouth in the US and was impressive in the second half of United's draw with Leeds in Stockholm. And yet, with Andre Onana absent, Altay Bayindir was the man between the sticks on the opening day against Arsenal.",
      "Amorim bristled at the suggestion Heaton could have played ahead of Bayindir after his mistake in the defeat to Mikel Arteta's side.",
      "The Turkey international flapped at an early corner, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to head home from close range. Not for the first time in his United career Bayindir failed to take command of his area and United were made to pay the price.",
      "Onana is set to return for the trip to Fulham on Sunday. The Cameroon international has endured two error-strewn seasons at Old Trafford, and yet with Amorim clearly set to stick with Bayindir as his second-choice goalkeeper, a lack of credible competition for a player who has failed to convince in his time at Old Trafford is a huge issue moving forward.",
      "United can't be faulted for focusing their attention on an addition in midfield before deadline day on September 1. Manuel Ugarte has shown very few signs that he is ready to anchor the midfield alongside Bruno Fernandes, and 33-year-old Casemiro no longer has what it takes to dominate games, even with a reduced workload in the absence of European football.",
      "That being said, with just under a fortnight to go until the transfer window closes, there is still time for United to strengthen their goalkeeping department as well as their midfield.",
      "If Amorim is happy with the options available to him, there seems little chance a new goalkeeper will be signed before September 1.",

      "Former Tottenham midfielder Mason is hopeful of leading West Brom back to the topflight.",
      "Collyer is expected to play a key role for West Brom this season, and Mason spoke glowingly about the 21-year-old's potential following his debut cameo against Wrexham last weekend.",
      "\"Toby's a young player, but we know we're going to need him and he's going to help us,\" Mason told reporters. \"I've wanted Toby for a few weeks now. He's someone that I really believe in, which is important and I have that belief in all of my players.",

      "If there was a literal market for clubs to sell their players, the Manchester United stall would struggle for footfall.",
      "United have still not sold a player this summer. They trumpeted the season-long loan of Marcus Rashford, his salary covered entirely by Barcelona, as it would save them around £14million over a 12-month period.",
      "Rashford's transfer came surprisingly early in late July as Nico Williams had signed a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool rejected Barca's offer for Luis Diaz. Rashford was Plan C.",
      "Incomings have taken precedence at United and they have invested more than £200m in a new front three. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, signed in time for the pre-season tour, impressed on debut against Arsenal. Cunha was voted the club's man of the match.",
      "United now have a bloated ten forwards on their books and want to jettison four of them before the September 1 transfer deadline. Rasmus Hojlund, omitted from the squad against Arsenal, may as well join the bomb squad of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia to make up a five-a-side team.",
      "United have sold poorly for several years, stretching back to Sir Alex Ferguson's time. Last year's sales topped hit £109.18m and appeared to signal a corner turned. Instead, United are being backed into a corner by clubs prepared to chance their arm.",
      "The salary structure that United are intent on reining in is one issue. Casemiro will see out an excessive four-year contract primarily due to the high wages of £350,000-a-week that United offered him in 2022. United have instructed four different intermediaries to try and sell Casemiro, to no avail.",
      "It is the same issue with Jadon Sancho, who joined the club a year before Casemiro. Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold each signed off those deals at curious times in their tenures. Woodward had already tendered his resignation after his role in the aborted Super League breakaway and had form for appeasement buys dating back to the club-record addition of Juan Mata in January 2014.",
      "Arnold was into his first summer as chief executive and had travelled to Barcelona to try and force through a deal for Frenkie de Jong. United lost their first two games of the season, the second at Brentford a generational nadir, and the panic-buy button was hit. Casemiro and Antony came in.",
      "Sancho is a particularly unique case. Chelsea paid £5m not to buy him after a subdued season-long loan. He has not played in the Premier League for United in nearly two years and he was effectively banished from the squad for a year.",
      "He took periods of leave in each of his first two seasons at United, too. The second for a lengthy three months, albeit one that coincided with the 2022 World Cup.",
      "There has been so much written and said about Sancho that some clubs flagged to United pieces where they felt the club had briefed against the player, effectively accusing United of penning hatchet jobs about Sancho.",
      "If that is deniable, what is undeniable is that the United co-owner effectively lamented the Sancho deal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe named Sancho, Casemiro, Antony, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana as players United had \"inherited\" or \"overpaid\" for in March. In an ideal world, United would have sold the quintet this summer.",
      "Industry sources believe Amorim's bullish approach has cost United money. Hojlund is the latest player to be cut loose after publicly addressing his position in the team and there was no route back for Rashford after he arranged an interview to state he was \"ready for a new challenge\". Garnacho burned his bridges by questioning his demotion for the Europa League final.",
      "Hojlund has been cast aside since he outlined his intention to stay minutes after Amorim refused to say if he would in the wake of the Dane's two-goal performance against Bournemouth in Chicago. Hojlund's resale value is harmed more by his form than his vocalizing but Chelsea are waiting it out with Garnacho to drive down the price.",
      "Some of it is beyond United's control. Tyrell Malacia, a frugal buy on the strength of how he performed against Ajax for Feyenoord, did not play a club game for 550 days due to knee problems and was substituted in four of his five starts under Amorim.",
      "The 26-year-old started five times on loan at PSV Eindhoven and is out of contract next year. There is little incentive to part with cash for a left back who has started ten games in two years and was overestimated by Erik ten Hag.",
      "Antony would have been sold had United not paid nearly double the amount Ajax were initially seeking for him in 2022. The winger excelled in La Liga and is back in the Brazil squad but United require £32.58m to avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. Realistically, no suitable and interested club will be coughing that up so a compromise is required.",
      "Chelsea are the only bidders at the stall for Garnacho after three clubs passed on him, having conducted due diligence. Garnacho is Premier League-proven and Chelsea had no pre-season schedule following their Club World Cup commitments, so there was never an urgent need to push through a move.",
      "They are not going to have their feet suddenly trampled on at the stall.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Meanwhile, Garnacho fell out of favour with the Portuguese boss long before pre-season began, after criticising Amorim's substitutions during their Europa League final defeat against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Hojlund has trained with the squad and took part in the preparations for the 2025/26 Premier League campaign – but with Benjamin Sesko now in the building, the Danish striker could have graced Old Trafford for the final time.",
      "These revelations will disappoint club captain Fernandes, who opened up about his desire not to win the Player of the Season award in May and instead hand it over to one of his younger team-mates.",
      "Speaking to CBS back in May, the 30-year-old said: \"The main thing I want… and I was even joking with Josh [Zirkzee] the other day, we were talking about the awards and they were saying like, ‘Oh, who’s gonna win the award of Player of the Season?’ They were kind of putting a joke.",
      "\"I said that I hope next year I am not even involved in the name – and do the same season as I did this year, and not be involved in the name of winning that trophy.",
      "\"Because that will mean you step up, Amad will step up, Garnacho will step up, Rasmus will step up… if they start scoring goals, start doing assists, start running backwards and tackling, they will be the ones having attention and not me, and I will be the most happy person in the world.",
      "\"I’m there to help my team-mates get the best out of them, and that’s all I want to do because I know as soon as I can get the best out of them, my team will be much better.\"",
      "Despite this wish from the Portuguese playmaker, Hojlund and Garnacho each have one foot out of the door at Old Trafford, it seems. AC Milan's sporting director, Igli Tare, recently noted that the 22-year-old striker is a viable option for the Italian giants – but not their only one.",
      "He said: \"Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.\" Milan may reportedly drop their interest in the United man if they can secure Dusan Vlahovic from Juventus instead.",
      "United value Hojlund at a reasonable £30million – a far cry from his £72m deal they struck with Serie A side Atalanta two summers ago.",
      "Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano reports that Chelsea are now in advanced talks with United over the signing of Garnacho. The report claims the Blues hierarchy have an excellent relationship with United's chief executive officer, Omar Berrada.",
      "The 21-year-old winger, who only wants to join the FIFA Club World Cup champions, recently turned down an approach from Bayern Munich. The Red Devils have priced Garnacho at £50m, but Chelsea are only prepared to pay about £30m as things stand.",
      "Garnacho and Hojlund join Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho as the four-strong squad that are on their way out of the club, with Roma, Besiktas and Atalanta all considering moves for the latter pair.",

      "Baleba was identified as Ruben Amorim's ideal candidate to strengthen his midfield following Benjamin Sesko's arrival. However, a move for the Cameroonian international failed to gather pace.",
      "United have spent big in the transfer window this summer, splashing over £200million on Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo. Further additions relied heavily on getting players out of the door but that has proven to be difficult.",
      "Marcus Rashford is the only big-name departure, leaving on loan for Barcelona. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony all remain at the club despite not being involved in Amorim's squad throughout the summer.",
      "Brighton's £100m-plus price tag, one they are adamant about sticking to, has also meant any summer move for Baleba is extremely unlikely at this point. However, it isn't impossible with interest growing in Garnacho, Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "In United's first game of the season against Arsenal, the midfield pivot came under scrutiny with Bruno Fernandes partnering Casemiro. While Fernandes performed well, Casemiro struggled at times and Manuel Ugarte, who came off the bench to replace the Brazilian, also failed to make an impact.",
      "A new midfielder, as well a goalkeeper, is the priority at Old Trafford before the window closes on September 1. Baleba continues to be linked with a move to Manchester and the player is one who is liked by two of Amorim's current charges.",
      "Mbeumo and Onana, who play alongside Baleba for the Cameroon national team, have recently made their feelings known of the midfielder's ability. Baleba played in Brighton's opening day draw with Fulham and took to Instagram to react.",
      "Posting a series of images from the match, Baleba said it is \"just me doing the thing I love most\" in a hint towards his current happiness at Brighton. \"Just me doing the thing I love most. Had fun playing at home with the boys. Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut,\" the caption said in full.",

      "United have at least five players they want to jettison yet they have still not outright sold a member of their first team squad this summer. Marcus Rashford, the most high-profile departure, joined Barcelona on a season-long loan.",
      "There are at least seven deals for United to negotiate over the next 13 days:",
      "Sign a midfielder",
      "As good as Carlos Baleba might be, United making a beeline for him a few years after they rued passing on Moises Caicedo seemed rather narrow-minded. Brighton polish gems better than most clubs yet value them much more than diamonds. United do not have the headroom for a record midfield signing.",
      "But they do need a midfielder and need to get creative. Manuel Ugarte, a dubious choice to bolster the midfield last year, is still playing second fiddle to the ageing Casemiro and it feels like United have all but given up on a player Ruben Amorim coached at Sporting.",
      "Joao Palhinha would have been a smart move by United but the word is they want permanent additions and he joined Tottenham Hotspur on loan from Bayern Munich. With deadline day less than a fortnight away, United may have to compromise on that stance.",
      "Sign a goalkeeper",
      "United have been on the lookout for a 'keeper for the entire calendar year, though sources stressed a new No.1 was not a priority. There are figures at the club prepared to give Andre Onana the benefit of the doubt and Amorim likes the Cameroonian.",
      "A bigger problem than Onana is what is behind him. Altay Bayindir is not Premier League quality and demonstrated that again against Arsenal, having got away with one on the final day of last season when he spilt the ball into Morgan Rogers' path. Bayindir was bailed out by a worse error by the referee.",
      "Amorim's reaction to the mention of Tom Heaton was akin to Hogwarts pupils' horror at the mention of Lord Voldemort. That would suggest Heaton may not get a kick for the third season running at United.",
      "Amorim claimed on Sunday he is \"happy\" with the goalkeeping options. It was delivered with all the diplomacy of a scheming politician.",
      "Sell Garnacho",
      "With the exception of Rashford, the bomb squad members have predictably remained in situ into the last fortnight of the window. Clubs are prepared to wait it out and force their value down, none more so brazenly than Chelsea with Garnacho.",
      "United sources feel that Chelsea's interest in January was part of the long game. A long game that Garnacho's representatives, Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, participated in when they visited Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea are the only bidders at the table after Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Atletico Madrid passed on Garnacho. The 21-year-old's publicly puerile behaviour mounts more pressure on United to sell him.",
      "United are determined not to undervalue a player whose valuation was listed at €97.4m by the CIES Football Observatory 12 months ago. But the closer we get to the deadline the more Garnacho's value diminishes.",
      "Sell Sancho",
      "Jadon Sancho is out of contract at United in ten months and is such a tough sell Chelsea paid £5m not to sign him. He has sought refuge in Italy, a sanctuary for Premier League rejects. Yet Sancho is refusing to take a salary cut, as if he is worth the £250,000-a-week United remunerated him with four years ago.",
      "If United cannot get a fee for Sancho then they would have to consider paying him off just to get him out of the building. Amusingly, a player who was banished from the first team dressing room at Carrington and has not played a competitive match for United in two years has his own space in the new changing area at the training complex. It is in United's interests to have Sancho's name taken down.",
      "Sell Malacia",
      "Talking of tough sells: Malacia did not play a club game for 550 days, was substituted at half-time in four of his five starts last term, was loaned to the Eredivisie and PSV Eindhoven did not want to make his loan a permanent deal.",
      "Malacia, billed as a \"youngster\" by club media last year, is now 26 and his deal expires next year. United only require a few million quid to avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules yet even the cheapest addition of the Erik ten Hag era is tough to shift. You could count the number of good games Malacia had for United on one hand.",
      "Sell Antony",
      "Antony excelled in La Liga and regained his place in the Brazil squad. In different circumstances, there would be a market for him.",
      "There is not one because United yielded to Ten Hag's demands and agreed a €100m deal with Ajax for Antony three years ago. United require around £32.5m not to make a loss on Antony, under contract until 2027. Few clubs could afford that and part with it.",
      "Antony has season-long loan with obligation to buy (minus a Sancho-style loophole) written all over him.",
      "Sell Hojlund",
      "For such a candid coach, it was mystifying that Amorim skirted the issue of Rasmus Hojlund's squad omission against Arsenal. It was established months ago that United had planned to sell Hojlund and he is not the first to be bombed out by Amorim after speaking publicly about his position in the team.",
      "Italy always seemed a likely exit route after Inter Milan touched base in the summer. Hojlund could return to northern Italy but to AC. United are so prepared to cut their losses they would accept £30m.",

      "Manchester United reportedly asked for an evolving Chelsea star in negotiations over the sale of Alejandro Garnacho to the London club.",
      "United have attempted to shift some players off the books who are surplus to requirements this summer. They got Marcus Rashford out on loan, to Barcelona, but the likes of Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are still at the club.",
      "Should they sell each of those players, they should make a decent sum of money, to potentially but some new talent.",
      "They have also been looking into a midfield signing since improving their attack, but the lack of available funds has hindered their pursuit of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, while Crystal Palace don’t want to sell Adam Wharton.",
      "But United have looked for a solution which solves both of their problems. They have been negotiating with Chelsea for some time over the potential sale of Garnacho.",
      "The Red Devils want £50million, while their Premier League rivals don’t want to pay more than £30million.",
      "But to potentially bring the price down and add a midfield star to their ranks, transfer insider Ben Jacobs has suggested that United asked for Andrey Santos.",
      "He said on The United Stand: “What I can tell you is that when discussions have been ongoing for Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, Andrey Santos has been spoken about.",
      "“I don’t think it’s going to lead anywhere, because Chelsea don’t want to sell. That’s another player, though, that Manchester United appreciate. It’s nothing more than that at this stage.”",
      "It is unsurprising that Chelsea don’t want to lose Santos. After going out on loan to Strasbourg last season, where he scored 10 Ligue 1 goals and assisted four more, he played four times in the Club World Cup for the Blues in the summer, assisting once, and came off the bench in this season’s Premier League opener.",
      "Reports earlier in the summer suggested that West Ham had approached Chelsea over the potential £45million transfer of Santos, but were turned away as Enzo Maresca’s side see a lot of promise in the Brazilian midfielder.",
      "That will leave United sweating that they’ll have to let Garnacho go to Stamford Bridge for a cut-price fee, as Ruben Amorim doesn’t want him, needs cash, and currently Chelsea are the only side who are in for him, but won’t budge.",
      "A recent report has stated the Red Devils have given Tottenham the green light to make an approach for Garnacho, as drumming up some extra interest might mean the winger’s price rises and Chelsea don’t get an easy deal.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly given Tottenham the ‘green light’ to come back into the frame for Alejandro Garnacho, as they fear gifting Chelsea a cut-price signing.",
      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working to finalise the signing’ of Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho amid a ‘discreet offer’.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed his clear “feeling” on Alejandro Garnacho’s situation at Manchester United amid interest from Chelsea.",
      "Chelsea have reportedly made a ‘whopping offer’ for a defender, while Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons.",
      "Arsenal have rejected the opportunity to sign Man Utd winger Alejandro Garnacho this summer in favour of Eberechi Eze, according to reports."

      "Each looked promising despite United losing their Premier League opener to Arsenal, but attempts to improve the midfield are still ongoing.",
      "Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton are two of the players currently being pursued, but the former will cost north of £100million, while the latter will command a £60million fee, and Crystal Palace are not interested in selling him.",
      "But United could have a perfect opportunity dropped in their lap, as transfer insider Romano suggests previous target Rabiot, currently at Marseille, could be offered to them.",
      "He said on YouTube: “Many of those who are close to Adrien Rabiot’s camp are proposing the opportunity to offer Rabiot to clubs, for example, also to Manchester United.",
      "“He’s a player who was a target for Man United many years ago, and in recent years was never close. At the moment, guys, I’m not hearing anything concrete on Manchester United in negotiations for Rabiot.",
      "“He is going to be offered to Manchester United and many other clubs as an opportunity for €15-20 million. But at the moment, again, it’s still an open situation. Let’s see what’s going to happen there.”",
      "Marseille president Pablo Longoria has suggested the club have no choice but to put Rabiot and Jonathan Rowe on the transfer list following a violent exchange in the dressing room.",
      "He said: “What happened was extremely serious and extremely violent, something I’ve never encountered before. We had to take a decision because what happened went way beyond what is acceptable in a football club, as it would be in any organisation.",
      "“I wasn’t in the dressing room but the staff who were told me it was incredible, violent, aggressive and went beyond any limits.",
      "“I think we all have enough experience to say we have never seen anything like it in a dressing room … Even in the worst punch-ups there are rules. Not in this case.”",
      "Rabiot is said to have accused Rowe of a lack of commitment, before the pair insulted each other and the confrontation then turned physical.",

      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Manchester City) – £53.1m",

      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",

      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",

      "20) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Arsenal\nThe Sun reckons Arsenal were already monitoring Rogers before Havertz’s knee knack but the German’s injury has focused the Gunners’ mind on the Villa star, even after securing Eze. That being true, you would expect Villa to offer stubborn resistance, unless Arsenal come with silly money. And it seems certain Spurs will make an offer too.",

      "19) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too. Friday night’s chaos against Bournemouth might spring them into action, mind.",
      "",
      "",
      "17) Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Tottenham\nEverton are at risk of doing a Spurs here, taking too long to tie-up a deal that seemed to be done, only for a club to swoop in. Tottenham have held a long-standing interest in the Saints winger so that coupled with his availability – for a hefty price – makes for an easy and convenient link. We’re not sure it’s anything deeper than that.",
      "",
      "16) 🔼 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Manchester City\nBack on the agenda after the winger remained an unused substitute in Real’s La Liga opener. City are keen, but only if Tottenham take Savinho. Which few at the Etihad were convinced is a wise idea, but Spurs might not come a little more forcibly once they have wiped the Eze custard from their chops. So to speak.",
      "",
      "15) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Aston Villa\nYou can’t blame Chelsea for trying to maximise the fee they eventually bank for Jackson but £80million is just daft. It does, however, make £60million sound more palatable to the likes of Villa and Newcastle, who are more motivated to move as the deadline approaches. Villa are said to be looking at a loan-to-buy deal, which could still cost them a total of £70million. Which seems awfully steep for a one-goal-in-three striker who Chelsea clearly have little use for. Indeed, he won’t be involved against West Ham at the weekend while Chelsea wait for their patsy.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Which might have scuppered whatever hope Napoli might have had of filling their Romelu Lukaku void with the Dane, but that hasn’t stopped them from talking it over with United on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will want big money since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs were close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million. Maybe the performance at Leeds will persuade Everton to pay up.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million but at least they seem tohave warmed to the idea of taking back Christopher Nkunku. Which would free up some of the funds to sign Simons.",

      "8) ↔ Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option on Tuesday night with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him, which they have not yet shown a firm desire to do. If Liverpool had not taken Hugo Ekitike from under Newcastle’s noses, Isak would quite likely be in red by now. He’s not, and while we won’t rule out the prospect of Liverpool going big, it’s no more likely to happen than it was before Isak hit ‘share’ on his Instagram story.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly picked out their ‘dream target’ from another Premier League side, and the star man is open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "United have been very active in the summer window. They have spent over £200million so far, with more than half of that going on Premier League stars Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The Red Devils are clearly eager to ensure they can compete in the Premier League – after a 15th-placed finish last season – by landing experienced talents.",
      "That is also true of Carlos Baleba, who has had two good seasons in English football, but United are seemingly aware the signing of the £100million-plus-rated midfielder is not plausible right now.",
      "As such, our friends at TEAMtalk report the Red Devils have picked out a different ‘dream target,’ also from within the Premier League.",
      "United have long been known to be admirers of Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, and it’s said they dream of bringing him to Old Trafford.",
      "They have been given positive signs in that pursuit, as it’s reported Wharton would be open to a move to United, where he is drawn due to their storied history, and the vision of boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The manager himself is said to see the midfielder as ideal for his system, offering vision and control in midfield.",
      "Though he’d be open to joining, the report also states Wharton is ‘deeply respectful’ of Palace. The Eagles themselves are also in no rush to sell the midfielder, who has played 45 times for them since joining from Blackburn in January 2024.",
      "His contract runs until 2029, and as a result, Palace know they are in a very strong negotiating position, and could demand upwards of £60million.",
      "That, though, has not deterred United. The report states there has been a caution that it would be ‘unwise’ to rule out a formal approach from the Red Devils before the window closes.",
      "However, similar was said about Baleba, and for this summer at least, things seem to have died down.",
      "Indeed, it’s been known that United are going to struggle to finance deals without sales this summer, and with essentially no money being made, they have been unable to lodge a bid for Baleba.",
      "Though it looks as if Wharton will cost £40million or so less than the Brighton man, the Red Devils might well still struggle to finance that deal this summer in their current state.",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and after just one solitary game, there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a strong group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame.",
      "",
      "8=) Chris Wood (2)\nThe Nottingham Forest striker smashed in two goals v Brentford in his opening game of the season; it’s interesting that the bookies give him more chance of keeping up that form than Richarlison. And based on last season, fair enough, too.",
      "",
      "7) Joao Pedro (0)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning.",
      "",
      "6) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "5) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (0)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd.",
      "",
      "2) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres on Sunday.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",
      "Mind games? Being nice to an Arsenal interviewer? Whatever the reason, the newly minted Player of the Year reckons Mikel Arteta’s side are the favourites this year.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for two-and-a-half seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends.",
      "Either Pep Guardiola’s new Man City are incredibly good, or denuded Wolves are incredibly bad. It could well prove to be both."

      "",
      "8=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nA goal in the Community Shield and then another in the opening Premier League game v Bournemouth puts the Frenchman higher in the betting than Virgil van Dijk or Alexis Mac Allister.",
      "",
      "8=) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nA shortlisted player from the 2024/25 season, the Swede is currently in a stand-off at Newcastle as he pushes for a Liverpool transfer. He will have to either eat humble pie in the north east or hit the ground like a demon at Liverpool to win this award.",

      "7) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nIt literally took about 45 minutes against Wolves to convince everybody that the Dutchman is absolutely brilliant and could help win Manchester City another title.",

      "",
      "3=) Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nA phenomenal Club World Cup has raised expectations for Palmer, who is central to any Premier League title challenge from Chelsea. Probably does need to score some open-play Premier League goals, though.",

      "3=) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe now three-time winner of the PFA award is up there again in the betting, though we have a sneaky feeling this will be an After The Lord Mayor’s Show of a season from the Egyptian.",

      "3=) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nThe most expensive signing of the summer has to be on this list. There can be no bedding-in period when you cost upwards of £100m. If Liverpool are to retain the title, Wirtz needs to deliver a banger.",
      "",
      "2) Bukayo Saka (Arsenal)\nA curious one this but worth noting that he was an early favourite in the 24/25 betting before he got injured. Maybe everybody thinks he is due a trophy. He was poor against Manchester United in the opening game.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nThe favourite to win the Golden Boot is a former winner and really quite likely to score the goals to win the Premier League so, yeah, fair enough at this point."

      "72) Chris Mepham (Bournemouth)\nHad a brilliant season on loan at Sunderland and there was plenty of expectation that might become a more permanent arrangement. Now apparently on the radar of Wrexham who – little-known fact for you here – have famous owners.",
      "",
      "71) Romain Faivre (Bournemouth)\nLeft Lyon for the south coast in the summer of 2023 but has still spent far more time in France than England since then after loans at Lorient and Brest. Has made only five brief substitute appearances in the Premier League and doesn’t appear likely to add to those any time soon.",
      "",
      "70) Timothee Pembele (Sunderland)\nFell out of favour last season, spent time on loan with Le Havre in France, is not part of the Black Cats’ grand Premier League plans.",
      "",
      "69) Abdoullah Ba (Sunderland)\nFell out of favour last season, spent time on loan with USL Dunkerque in France, is not part of the Black Cats’ grand Premier League plans.",
      "",
      "68) Ashley Barnes (Burnley)\nJoined Burnley for a third time after signing from Norwich in January following 18 months away and declared he had ‘unfinished business’ upon signing a one-year extension to that short-term deal in the summer. Certainly brings vast top-flight experience to the Clarets, but the nagging question is how much chance he’ll get to bring that experience to bear on the actual pitch. Get the sense this is unofficially almost a player-coach role.",
      "",
      "67) Jay Matete (Sunderland)\nSpent last season on loan with Bolton in League One. Seems unlikely to now force his way into a bolstered Premier League-ready squad.",
      "",
      "66) Hannes Delcroix (Burnley)\nSpent the second half of last season on loan at Swansea and appears unlikely to add to his 12 Premier League appearances from 23/24.",
      "",
      "65) David Carmo (Nottingham Forest)\nWent out on loan to Olympiacos straight after signing for Forest last summer, and it’s important not to look at who owns Olympiacos. Appears to be available for another temporary move at least this summer.",
      "",
      "64) Joe Anderson (Sunderland)\nMade his first Sunderland start 811 days after signing during that fun and ultimately justified period late in the season when Regis Le Bris was resting all his key players for the play-offs. Unlikely to see how that translates to Premier League opportunities now.",
      "",
      "63) Etienne Green (Burnley)\nWe very much enjoy the fact the Anglo-French goalkeeper played for Saint-Etienne. And actually played, too, which hasn’t been the case since joining Burnley last summer. Presumably because his name is not Etienne Burnley.",
      "",
      "62) Emmanuel Dennis (Nottingham Forest)\nIn the last year – and realistically surely last days – of a Forest career that has just never got going after a £10m move in 2022. Less than 30 appearances later, there is zero chance he adds to that tally with Dennis likely available for free to anyone who wants him.",

      "61) Alfie Gilchrist (Chelsea)\nDoesn’t take a genius to work out that, with no permanent deal materialising, another Championship loan appears likely.",
      "",
      "60) Armando Broja (Burnley)\nShort of fitness after a disrupted pre-season, was Scott Parker’s explanation for his absence at Spurs. Fair enough, probably.",
      "",

      "58) Nathan Patterson (Everton)\nHas had a torrid time at Everton with injuries but had been involved during pre-season before being left out altogether at Leeds on Monday night.",
      "",
      "57) Sam Greenwood (Leeds)\nAttracted plenty of Championship interest early in the summer but it’s all gone a bit quiet for a player who spent last season on loan at Preston and is entering the final year of his Leeds contract.",
      "",
      "56) Josh Bowler (Nottingham Forest)\nHas had five loan moves in three years at Forest, most recently at Luton for the second half of last season, and appears to be further away from the first-team picture than ever.",
      "",
      "55) Issa Kabore (Man City)\nSpent last season out on loan at Benfica and Werder Bremen, and the right-back is powerfully unlikely to still be at City when the transfer window music stops.",
      "",
      "54) Callum Doyle (Man City)\nSet to be the latest high-profile member of the great Wrexham Circus.",
      "",
      "53) Omar Richards (Nottingham Forest)\nWas unlucky with injuries when he first signed for Forest from Bayern Munich, but any chance of making a go of things at the City Ground has now surely passed him by. Spent last season on loan with Rio Ave in Portugal, and a permanent return has been touted and seems a win all round.",
      "",
      "52) Harry Amass (Man United)\nWas even left out of the U21 side as United seek to secure a loan for a player they’ve been clear is not available for permanent transfer. There is interest from the Championship, but United appear in no rush to push Amass out the door.",
      "",
      "51) Luca Koleosho (Burnley)\nCould be heading back to his former club Espanyol on loan, according to the Burnley Express. Which is a newspaper and not James Anderson.",
      "",
      "50) Martial Godo (Fulham)\nCoventry are keen on the winger, who was a bit-part first-team player last season and appears unlikely at this stage to be any more than that for Marco Silva this time around.",

      "49) Alex Murphy (Newcastle)\nSpent the second half of last season on loan at Bolton and the start of this one back with Newcastle’s Under-21s.",
      "",
      "48) Eric da Silva Moreira (Nottingham Forest)\nBologna have been linked with the young full-back who made only two brief appearances in the Premier League last season but did make it as far as the bench for four of the first five games. But, perhaps tellingly, only once in the second half of the season.",

      "47) Alan Browne (Sunderland)\nFilled in in various positions during the promotion season, but among those seemingly now left behind by the squad’s Premier League glow-up.",
      "",
      "46) Aaron Anselmino (Chelsea)\nAccording to Matt Law, Chelsea ‘haven’t quite decided’ what they want to do with the Argentine, who they signed for £15.6m last summer, sent back to Boca Juniors on loan for the season, recalled in January, never picked, then took to the Club World Cup, where he played for two whole minutes. Our crystal ball says: season-long loan somewhere in La Liga.",

      "43) Ahmed Abdullahi (Sunderland)\nInjury wrecked his first season on Wearside and Regis Le Bris was apparently keen to at least give him a pre-season chance to show his worth. We’ll have a definitive verdict on that over the next week or so.",
      "",
      "42) Jeremy Sarmiento (Brighton)\nSeeking a permanent move away from Brighton over the next couple of weeks having spent the last two seasons as something of a Championship promotion specialist after spending time at both Ipswich and Burnley in their successful campaigns.",
      "",
      "41) Harrison Ashby (Newcastle)\nStill yet to make a competitive appearance for Newcastle since his move from West Ham, and at 23 can surely no longer rely on ‘promising youngster’ status. Make-or-break season, you feel. And a sub-optimal start.",
      "",
      "40) Nazariy Rusyn (Sunderland)\nHajduk Split opted not to trigger a permanent move after his loan last season.",
      "",
      "39) Fabio Vieira (Arsenal)\nDoes sadly now look like he will not go down as the greatest Vieira to play for the Gunners. A loan to Stuttgart has been mooted for a player further away from the first-team picture than ever after Arsenal’s extravagant summer purchases.",
      "",
      "38) Matt Targett (Newcastle)\nPlayed only 19 minutes of Premier League football last season but did at least generally make the bench when available.",
      "",
      "37) Maxwel Cornet (West Ham)\nThe most forgotten of forgotten men. Graham Potter has been very gentle but very clear. “He’s at a stage in his career where he needs to play regularly. At the moment, it’s difficult for me to guarantee that.”",
      "",
      "36) Tawanda Chirewa (Wolves)\nSpent last season on loan at Derby and Huddersfield. Something similar is likely on the cards for 25/26.",
      "",
      "35) David Datro Fofana (Chelsea)\nThe top question suggested when you Google him is ‘Who does David Datro Fofana play for?’ and that is an uncomfortably profound question.",

      "32) Fabio Silva (Wolves)\nNow apparently set for a move to Roma, because he is less fussy about these things than Jadon Sancho apparently.",
      "",

      "30) Isaac Schmidt (Leeds)\nA loan switch to Werder Bremen is all agreed, but Leeds want numbers in before letting the full-back leave.",
      "",
      "29) Karl Hein (Arsenal)\nHas made one Arsenal appearance in seven years – of course it was in the Carabao – and appears to be in the itchy-feet, want-to-play school of third-choice keepers rather than the can’t-believe-this-is-my-life-this-is-amazing group. Werder Bremen are apparently keen.",
      "",
      "28) Chido Obi (Man United)\nPatience is the key for a 17-year-old who made his breakthrough last season and will surely get opportunities again this time around, especially when/if Hojlund is bombed out.",
      "",
      "27) Owen Bevan (Bournemouth)\nHighly-rated Wales U21 centre-back has seen injuries hamper his progression to the first team, whether that’s at Bournemouth themselves or somewhere else on loan. If he stays fit, could yet get a chance this season given the way pretty much Bournemouth’s entire defence was picked off in the summer.",
      "",
      "26) Raheem Sterling (Chelsea)\nWe’re calling it now: deadline-day loan to Spurs after both he and they have exhausted all other options.",
      "",
      "25) Pedro Lima (Wolves)\nA loan looks like a smart idea for the right-back, who is one of approximately 7398 fringe Premier League players apparently of interest to Wrexham.",
      "",
      "24) Jamaal Lascelles (Newcastle)\nThe club activated a contract extension last season, but with Lascelles having now apparently slipped to, at best, fifth-choice centre-back it wouldn’t be a huge shock to see Newcastle’s longest-serving current player moved on over the next 10 days.",
      "",
      "23) Reiss Nelson (Arsenal)\nArsenal would like to sell him, Fulham would like to have him back. Should be simple, but the Cottagers favour another loan for an injury-prone player entering the final two years of his contract while Arsenal would prefer something more permanent. It screams loan-with-option on September 1, frankly.",
      "",
      "22) Mike Tresor (Burnley)\nRestricted to one substitute appearance in the FA Cup across the whole of last season. It’s just never quite happened for the winger at Turf Moor and having been prominently involved in pre-season was nowhere to be seen in the matchday squad at Tottenham, suggesting a departure over the next couple of weeks is surely the likely outcome here.",
      "",
      "21) Ethan Pinnock (Brentford)\nHas seen it all across six years at Brentford and you’d imagine he remains a welcome familiar sight after a summer of upheaval and flux for the Bees. Played 32 matches in Brentford’s first Premier League season, then 30, 29 and 22 in the subsequent three. No great surprise to see those numbers continue on that trend this season, but he was still on the bench for every game he was available last term.",
      "",
      "20) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nCurrently sat with his trotters up on close to 200 grand a week. You can only be so miffed about that. Chelsea’s transfer policy is not his fault, and he’s another one whose wildly generous contract terms make him extremely awkward to shift no matter how surplus to requirements he becomes.",
      "",
      "19) Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nDoes appear among the more shiftable of the 25/26 Chelsea bomb squad. Spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and there must surely be a Premier League suitor out there that works for all parties. Also not one of the Chelsea outcasts on the very daftest money, putting him within the wage structure of most non-crazy Premier League clubs. Most obviously and necessarily Bournemouth given the scale of their defensive losses this summer.",
      "",
      "18) Albert Sambi Lokonga (Arsenal)\nSevilla didn’t take up the option to make his loan permanent at the end of last season, so Lokonga is back in career limbo. They’re not Man United-level, but Arsenal are low-key bad at getting fringe players out the door.",
      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho (Man United)\nChelsea or nothing has been Garnacho’s mantra all summer. Could actually end up being nothing. Can Chelsea get Prick Protection?",
      "",
      "16) Illan Meslier (Leeds)\nHigh-profile errors last season didn’t cost Leeds in the end, but have cost Meslier. Firmly replaced as first choice by Lucas Perri and not even on the bench against Everton. A return to France seems the likeliest outcome here.",
      "",
      "15) Jadon Sancho (Man United)\nEverything appears to be agreed with Roma for a loan-with-obligation, and we’re not quite sure what Sancho is waiting for as his ill-fated United career meanders to an acrimonious close. We should all be hacked off at this waste of an obvious talent, but not sure where exactly Sancho can reasonably now direct his own ire without asking himself uncomfortable questions.",
      "",
      "14) Konstantinos Tsimikas (Liverpool)\nNow behind Milos Kerkez as well as Andy Robertson in the left-back pecking order at Anfield, with Fulham, Leeds and Nottingham Forest all keen to offer him a more straightforward route to Premier League minutes, but he could yet be retained at Liverpool for squad depth purposes.",
      "",
      "13) Tyrell Malacia (Man United)\nPart of the bloated United Bomb Squad, but not perhaps a villain in the same way as certain other members of that cohort. Malacia’s crime, such as it is, is to be not quite good enough. He also wasn’t quite good enough for PSV, where he spent the second half of last season on loan.",
      "",
      "12) Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)\nHas made over 100 Premier League appearances for the Seagulls and signed a one-year contract extension in the summer, but could yet move on before the window closes. Everton have been sniffing around, by all accounts.",
      "",
      "11) Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton)\nLooks certain to join the Brighton exodus; the only question is where, for how long, and/or for how much. The list of clubs reportedly interested is a long and glamorous one with Spurs, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Roma and also, in fairness, Leeds, West Ham and Forest all credited with interest of some sort or other in the Argentine playmaker this summer.",
      "",
      "10) Carney Chukwuemeka (Chelsea)\nChelsea are holding out for a permanent sale, and want somewhere close to the £40m release clause in his contract. Borussia Dortmund wanted another loan move, and now Juventus are reportedly interested having allowed Douglas Luiz to join Nottingham Forest on loan.",
      "",
      "9) Emerson (West Ham)\nMarseille are keen on the left-back who played 31 Premier League games last season but has apparently fallen way down the pecking order at the London Stadium. Which really might be a blessing.",
      "",
      "8) Antony (Man United)\nDesperately wants to return to Real Betis, where he enjoyed himself so much on loan last season, and is clearly willing to wait until the very last minute if necessary to give that move every chance of coming to fruition, no matter how much United might have preferred a swifter solution.",
      "",
      "7) Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nFulham, Porto, Fenerbahce and Real Betis have all been linked but no solution appears imminent for the Ukrainian as he enters the final year of his Arsenal contract.",
      "",
      "6) Rasmus Hojlund (Man United)\nErik Ten Hag continues to haunt Manchester United, apparently closing off one exit route for Hojlund by selling Victor Boniface to one-time Hojlund-suitors Milan. Surely someone somewhere must want a striker who doesn’t really score goals but runs about a bit while secretly being far taller than you expect.",
      "",
      "5) Ben Chilwell (Chelsea)\nA member of last year’s bomb squad and back hanging around the training ground after Crystal Palace opted against making his loan move permanent. Genuinely quite daft from all concerned this hasn’t been sorted out more swiftly and permanently.",
      "",
      "4) Patrick Bamford (Leeds)\nHas been told he is not in Daniel Farke’s plans and is free to find a new club with just a year left on his contract. Leeds’ understandable concerns around Bamford’s injury history are nevertheless slightly dented by signing Dominic Calvert-Lewin as his direct replacement.",
      "",
      "3) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\n‘We’ve made a decision that he’s not available after a very disrupted pre-season,’ was future-Sporcle-scupperer Keith Andrews’ statement ahead of the Nottingham Forest game. “I’ve been very clear on the situation as head coach: I want Yoane in the building.” But not, at this time, on the pitch. Has probably played his last game for the club.",
      "",
      "2) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nNo shame in being unable to shift William Saliba or Gabriel Magalhaes from the starting XI, but slipping behind Cristhian Mosquera and out of the full-strength matchday squad altogether might sharpen Kiwior’s focus on finding a new club. Although, funnily enough, also didn’t make the matchday squad on the opening day last season, before being in every single one of the remaining 37, so maybe it’s fine actually.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle)\nWe’ve scoured the internet and can find no mention of Isak anywhere, meaning his absence from the opening-day draw with Aston Villa is a complete mystery. Perhaps some things man is not meant to know.",
      "He can be – and is – very pissed off indeed that he’s missing the start of this season, but should really be aiming almost every drop of that boiled piss in a different direction.",

      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "18=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",

      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",
      "",
      "14=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "12=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "10) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "7) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "6) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (albeit since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which still feels entirely possible because surely not everyone is as bad as Brentford – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list."

      "Manchester United are ‘accelerating’ to secure the signing of Lucien Agoume from Sevilla after Ruben Amorim ‘failed to convince’ the Red Devils board to sign an Aston Villa star.",
      "United have already spent around £200m this summer, with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo joining the club to form an entirely new front three, with left-back Diego Leon also arriving to bolster Amorim’s options.",
      "But the Portuguese boss is also keen on adding a new midfielder to his ranks, and having walked away from a possible deal for Carlos Baleba having decided they couldn’t stump up the £100m Brighton are asking for, Spanish outlet Fichajes claim they’re ramping up their efforts to sign Agoume.",
      "The report states that United are joined by two further Premier League clubs in ‘probing the situation’, but the Red Devils are ‘in the lead thanks to the insistence of their coaching staff’.",
      "The 23-year-old has a release clause of £35m but it’s thought he could make the move to the Premier League for as little as £21m.",
      "A Sevilla executive commented privately that “the arrival of offers from England forces the club to listen,” reflecting the growing expectation about a possible transfer, with the La Liga club ‘seeing the sale of Agouti as a strategic option to clean up their accounts and make room for new signings’.",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n👉 Garnacho ‘Pr*ck Protection’ grants perfect transfer compromise for Man Utd and Chelsea\n👉 Man Utd fans told they have the next Darwin Nunez as stinging verdict of £74m signing dropped\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘His physical display, tactical reading and ability to move the ball under pressure make him a modern profile, with characteristics similar to those demanded by English football. In addition, it is considered that personal conditions will not be an obstacle, since the Frenchman is open to transfer.",

So any data that counters this trend will be deemed an anomaly or people will find all manner of explanations as to why it looked like United were the better team by a distance. But of course we also know that United have played well against the big teams last season as well so United’s games against Fulham and Burney will ironically tell us whether Arsenal should be lauded for winning ugly or considered just lucky.

      "Goalkeeper: David De Gea\nYou’d be hard pressed to find a Manchester United fan who rates David De Gea higher than Peter Schmeichel (one inclusion) or Edwin van der Sar (three inclusions), but the current Fiorentina stopper was a rare gem in the bleak post-Fergie years at Old Trafford, warranting selection five times. If you fancy a goalkeeper challenge, try naming the keeper with the most appearances in the top flight TOTY since its inception in the 1973/74 season.",
      "",
      "Defender: Gary Neville\nAlthough seemingly quite content to laugh at himself when others play down his talents, Gary Neville must’ve been doing something right considering he was selected by his peers as the best right-back in the Premier League on six occasions. The only full-back to feature more often in the top tier’s Team of the Year is Arsenal and Crystal Palace legend Kenny Sansom with eight.",
      "",
      "Defender: Rio Ferdinand\nNeville’s former Manchester United team-mate also makes this side, having been selected six times. His first inclusion came with Leeds United in 2001/02, before a big money move to Old Trafford saw him become a TOTY regular, lining up alongside centre-back partner Nemanja Vidic three times in the Premier League’s best XI.",
      "",
      "Defender: Virgil van Dijk\nVirgil van Dijk’s inclusion on Tuesday night sees him stay one clear of Salah. However, the Liverpool captain needs to be selected one more time to equal Anfield legend Alan Hansen’s record of six. Van Dijk remains just one of three defenders to win the individual award in the Premier League era, standing tall alongside Paul McGrath and John Terry, with Gary Pallister picking up the gong in the last ever First Division campaign of 1991/92.",
      "",
      "Right wing: Cristiano Ronaldo\nSeven full seasons in English football and selected for the PFA Team of the Year in five of them, with his final inclusion coming in his late thirties. Cristiano Ronaldo would have surely broken all the individual and team records if he didn’t swap Manchester for Madrid, but thankfully the PFA awards remain far more diverse than the Ballon d’Or circa 2008 to 2017.",
      "",
      "Central midfield: Patrick Vieira\nPatrick Vieira’s impressive six selections in nine years at Arsenal sees him make this team, with the French midfielder often lining up alongside fierce rival Roy Keane in the best Premier League side of the season. Keane may have won the war when it came to league titles, but Vieira won the PFA Team of the Year battle, with one more inclusion than the Irishman.",
      "",
      "Central midfield: Kevin De Bruyne\nNow playing in the blue of Napoli instead of Manchester City, Kevin De Bruyne’s fifth and final TOTY inclusion came in the Citizens’ treble-winning season of 2022/23. Five of the Premier League’s best XI came from the Etihad that year, in a repeat of 1998/99, when the same number of Manchester United players appeared as the Red Devils battled their way to glory at home and abroad.",
      "READ: Top 10 Premier League teams of all time has new entrant in Man City 22/23",
      "",
      "Central midfield: Steven Gerrard\nWith eight PFA Team of the Year selections, Steven Gerrard has more than Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes combined. Does that put the debate to bed? Probably not.",
      "",
      "Left wing: Ryan Giggs\nThe fifth and final Manchester United legend in this elite XI, Ryan Giggs was a member of the first TOTY of the Premier League era and won the Young Player of the Year award in the same season. Sixteen years later the Welsh wizard made his sixth and final appearance in the top flight’s best XI whilst also lifting the big individual award in 2008/09.",
      "",
      "Striker: Harry Kane\nIt is of course very Spursy that Harry Kane was selected for the PFA Team of the Year six times without winning the Player of the Year, whilst also standing out as the only man in this side not to lift a league title or cup in at least one of the seasons he was selected in. But he’s got his Bundesliga medal now and Tottenham have dusted down their trophy cabinet for the Europa League, so all is well.",
      "",
      "Striker: Thierry Henry\nLast but not least, arguably the Premier League’s greatest ever player. Thierry Henry was selected for TOTY six times in a row at the start of the millennium and won Player of the Year award twice during those years. Despite that success in England, the Highbury hero missed out on the Ballon d’Or at his peak, finishing as runner-up to Pavel Nedved in 2003.",

      "We’re trying to avoid Alexander Isak in this Mailbox so we start with Eberechi Eze and see where we go from there…",
      "Eberechi Eze will remain loved by the vast majority of Crystal Palace fans; he did things very differently to Alexander Isak.",

      "Manchester United see £50m for Alejandro Garnacho as a ‘fair and accurate’ price, while Chelsea don’t want to pay more than £30m. Neither club is wrong – both valuations are entirely reasonable. Which is why rather than meeting in the middle to leave both United and Chelsea £10m unhappy, we propose a significant level of Pr*ck Protection to ensure the perfect transfer.",
      "Chelsea are in an excellent negotiating position. Garnacho is a desire rather than a need; if they don’t get him, they’ll either sign someone else or no-one at all and be just fine. He’s desperate to join them, with his ‘Chelsea or nothing’ vow tested and affirmed this week as he said no to Bayern Munich. And United are obviously very open to offers for a man who’s played his last game for them.",
      "The smart money would be on United lowering their price tag to bring in some of that sweet ‘pure profit’ cash to aid in the PSR stakes and perhaps put towards a new midfielder or goalkeeper.",
      "But there must be more than a temptation – after Garnacho told them “Chelsea or I stay here and don’t play football for 6-12 months” – for the United bosses to test that resolve given his off-field antics this summer.",
      "He’s only on £50,000 per week; they might see £2.6m as an annual price they’re willing to pay for the cathartic suffering of their academy graduate. If we’re making knee-jerk assessments on the opening day of the season – and of course we are – United will be just fine without further additions while Garnacho rots at home.",
      "And just imagine the malicious joy Ruben Amorim would take in Garnacho coming to his office in October with his tale between his legs asking him to play football in a World Cup year. “Still got the Marcus Rashford shirt, mate? Yeah, shut the door on your way out.”",
      "Between his donning of that Aston Villa top, labelling United’s season “sh*t” after being dropped for the Europa League final and spending most of their post-season trip of Asia ‘flipping the finger to fans’, supposedly in jest, Garnacho didn’t leave much space for reintegration after Amorim informed him he wasn’t in his plans.",
      "It does make you wonder just how much of a childish little arse a talented footballer has to be for other clubs not to be interested in signing them at all, though our guess is there will always be a manager with an ego big enough to believe they can be the ‘fix’ for a lost soul no matter what they’ve done, within the boundaries of the law.",
      "Enzo Maresca isn’t alone in thinking Garnacho’s quality and potential outstrips his infantile behaviour, with Aston Villa’s Unai Emery and Bayern’s Vincent Kompany seemingly of a similar mind.",
      "And Chelsea’s belief that the 21-year-old can become a ‘key player in the right environment’ isn’t without reason. Although their own experience with Jadon Sancho suggests Stamford Bridge perhaps isn’t the best landing spot for Red Devil outcasts, fellow bomb squad members Rashford and Antony both thrived having escaped United last season.",
      "Chelsea only sign footballers they believe will be worth more than what they paid for them in the future. It’s a model we scoffed at but is now reaping rewards. And there’s no doubt that Garnacho represents a big market opportunity.",
      "It was barely a year ago that United deemed him untouchable as a £100m player in the making, before setting a £70m asking price that’s now dropped to £50m. That dip in valuation is thanks to what we’ve been told is a need for the club to make money through player sales, a lack of progression on Garnacho’s part in that time, his unsuitability to Amorim’s system and United’s bizarre bid to secure the lowest possible transfer fee for their footballers by telling the world they’re desperate to be rid of them.",
      "We would suggest – and this may well be Chelsea’s position – there has been no allowance made by United for just what a knob he’s been in the last three months. And thus we present to you: Pr*ck Protection.",
      "The issue we foresee in Chelsea drawing up a contract which includes this £20m-worth of Pr*ck Protection, or add-ons as they’re more colloquially known, is the subjectivity of pr*ckery. We’ve all met several pr*cks in our lives and often what makes them a pr*ck is intangible – it’s something you feel in your bones. “Why don’t I like them? Don’t know, just a bit of a pr*ck.”",
      "And even the things that could possibly be measured – number of social media posts involving you wearing the shirt of a rival club, a sulk to goals ratio, volume of bullsh*t spouted on your behalf by your loud-mouthed sibling – aren’t typically the things written into a contract, with add-ons tending to be based on players achievements rather than stuff they’ve managed to avoid.",
      "Chelsea may have to rely on the usual appearances, goals, assists bonuses to serve a similar purpose – Maresca won’t pick a pr*ck  – but in whatever guise, they will feel they should be afforded some insurance from United: financial recognition of the risk they’re taking on a player who probably is worth £50m, but only if he stops being a pr*ck.",
      "Manchester United reportedly asked for an evolving Chelsea star in negotiations over the sale of Alejandro Garnacho to the London club.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly given Tottenham the ‘green light’ to come back into the frame for Alejandro Garnacho, as they fear gifting Chelsea a cut-price signing.",
      "Arsenal have booked Eberechi Eze in for a medical on Friday, assuming he comes through his final Palace appearance unscathed. So who will Tottenham turn to?",

      "We are one gameweek down and with less than two weeks until the transfer window closes, plenty of Premier League clubs have some glaring holes in their squads.",
      "From goalkeepers flapping at corners to £27m strikers managing two shots, here are seven much-needed transfers highlighted by the opening weekend.",
      "On another day, Altay Bayindir may well have got the free-kick he was asking for having flapped at the ball for Arsenal’s goal but his performance shone a spotlight on United’s most pressing need: a new goalkeeper.",
      "Even in the dark years, United have tended to have decent shot-stoppers with David de Gea carrying the team for a number of seasons, but his replacement Andre Onana and his deputy Bayindir do not inspire confidence.",
      "Fixing that problem is key and the club have been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emi Martinez, both of who would be upgrades on their current options.",
      "Away from the keeper, United also need a new midfielder with 33-year-old Casemiro looking past his best. Adam Wharton would be the best replacement but it may be hard to convince Crystal Palace to sell with Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi likely to leave before the window closes.",
      "The headband-wearing Antony Gordon’s impression of Bjorn Borg was better than his impression of a No.9 against Aston Villa as Newcastle looked particularly toothless up front.",
      "Alexander Isak being the clear first choice meant Newcastle have had the luxury of not needing to spend too much time thinking about squad depth but this summer has proved just how hard it can be to secure the top striking talents.",
      "Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko have both gone elsewhere with Isak sulking in an unknown location, leaving Gordon to try to impose himself on opposition defences.",
      "The result was an expected one. All but one of his shots inside the box were blocked and of his seven efforts, just two hit the target. Crucially, they were efforts taken outside the box and to the left, his more natural position.",
      "With Isak in the wilderness and Callum Wilson now at West Ham, Newcastle need to get a striker in and, even if PSR will prevent getting a replacement close to Isak’s level, anything is better than nothing at this stage.",
      "A 3-0 win to start the year suggested Tottenham may not miss the creativity of James Maddison following his long-term injury but they will come up against far better opposition than Burnley this season.",
      "Against the Turf Moor side, Thomas Frank started a very young midfield of Lucas Bergvall, Archie Gray and Pape Sarr but as the season goes on and tougher games take place, you get the feeling they could do with some more experience in there.",
      "The obvious link is Eze who has been reported as ‘one step away’ from signing with the north London club but with Yves Bissouma looking like he may leave, Spurs could do with even more reinforcements than just the Palace man.",

      "Monday’s loss to Leeds United was a humbling way for Everton fans to start what was supposed to be a season of positivity.",
      "A brand new stadium may soon be filled with the same existential dread that painted the walls of Goodison and while it is easy to answer the question with ‘How do you fix Everton?’ by replying ‘Get a whole new team’, realistically, they should focus on the forward department.",
      "Their back line is solid and would have kept a clean sheet had a harsh VAR call not gone their way while the summer reinforcements of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish look like smart acquisitions, but it is the No.9 spot that Everton have struggled with for years.",
      "The perennially injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin has joined Monday’s opponents and while Beto scored five in five back in February, a run of eight games without a goal is perhaps more representative.",
      "Against Leeds, the Guinea-Bissau international registered the fewest touches of any player to last the full 90 and managed just one shot. The fact he played the whole game only demonstrates how hamstrung David Moyes is in that area. New signing Thierno Barry was only trusted for a few minutes.",
      "The Toffees have been linked with Reims forward Adama Bojang and out-of-contract Jamie Vardy but Moyes needs something if they are to avoid the drop this year.",
      "Where to even begin?",
      "If West Ham fans were not already worried, a 3-0 thumping at the hands of newly promoted Sunderland was enough to send even the calmest head into panic mode.",
      "The weakness of last season’s promoted teams and the laughable chaos at Spurs and United allowed West Ham to reach the flattering spot of 14th but it is already looking like it would need a miracle for them to do so again this time round.",
      "Their xG against the Black Cats was only better than Wolves (who played Manchester City) and Villa (who played Newcastle with 10 men). At the other end, the xG conceded was not awful at 0.8 but the team look so toothless going forward as the tactic of ‘pass the ball to Bowen and hope for the best’ reaches its limit.",
      "The worst offender was Niclas Fullkrug who managed just two shots in the full 90 minutes and lost all but three of his 19 duels. The decision to sign him for £27m only a year ago now fits neatly into West Ham’s woes with strikers.",
      "The Hammers are said to be competing with Everton for Bojang but it is hard to see why any player would choose this ‘project’ at the moment.",
      "If it continues like this, West Ham’s most important signing may well be a new manager.",
      "For a team that had eight goalkeepers on their books only a year ago, Chelsea sure have found it difficult to find a decent one.",
      "In Chelsea’s 0-0 draw to Palace, a technicality saved Robert Sanchez from conceding a free-kick he really should have stopped and although he came away with a clean sheet, he only had to make four saves with Palace’s total xG at only 0.66.",
      "Tougher tests will come but Sanchez is not a keeper that inspires a huge amount of confidence. Despite this, the club insist hey are not in the market for a new shot-stopper. The fools.",
      "When your own manager is describing your transfer window as “passive”, not much more needs to be said.",
      "Fulham owners the Khans have typically been late spenders but Fulham have parted with less than £500k this summer. Five League One clubs have spent more than that.",
      "Marco Silva wants four new signings before the window closes but it should be in creative areas that the club focus on.",
      "Away at Brighton, they created just one big chance and had an xG of 0.76 and next face the visit of Manchester United.",
      "",
      "Arsenal have booked Eberechi Eze in for a medical on Friday, assuming he comes through his final Palace appearance unscathed. So who will Tottenham turn to?",
      "When Alexander Isak is trending and you’re not based in Liverpool or Newcastle, just make up some nonsense…",
      "We’re trying to avoid Alexander Isak in this Mailbox so we start with Eberechi Eze and see where we go from there…",
      "We have a PFA Team of the Year XI made up of players who have been included at least five times in the Premier League era.",
      "Eberechi Eze will remain loved by the vast majority of Crystal Palace fans; he did things very differently to Alexander Isak.",
      "Arsenal have beaten Tottenham to Eberechi Eze, but a move billed as a hijacking had actually been made long before Spurs struck a deal for the playmaker."

      "Andre Onana, who came under scrutiny last season, was left out of the squad entirely, with Amorim insisting the decision was tactical rather than down to injury.”",
      "Rooney believes the situation cannot be allowed to drift, insisting United’s defenders need to feel the same confidence his generation had once Edwin van der Sar arrived.",
      "“There’s the goalkeeper situation and I’m sure every Man United fan is asking the same question,” he said.",

      "“I go back to when we had Roy Carroll and Tim Howard in goal. I don’t think there was 100 per cent trust from the defenders in front of those two goalkeepers.",

      "“These United players want that confidence and trust in the goal behind them and I just don’t see that with the ones we’ve got at the moment.",

      "He also offered a word of encouragement for Onana, who he says is capable of recapturing his Inter Milan form if Amorim decides not to pursue another option.",
      "“Andre Onana is a fantastic keeper, I watched him at Inter, and he was brilliant. So you hope if they don’t sign a new goalkeeper, he can get back to that level of form, but he certainly didn’t fill us with confidence last season.”",
      "Rooney also identified midfield as another area in need of reinforcement.",
      "United have been linked with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, and Rooney says addressing that department is just as important as resolving the goalkeeper issue.",
      "“You would be, yeah, but obviously we don’t know what the situation is with PSR,” he explained when asked if a new midfielder was a priority.",

      "Thursday 21 August 2025 21:43, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Chelsea will turn the heat up on West Ham boss Graham Potter on Friday Night Football.",
      "If you take the relegated teams out of the equation, West Ham rank bottom in the Premier League per 90 for expected goals, shots, shots on target, chances created from open play and passes played into the box since Graham Potter took charge.",
      "There's a clear problem with converting their possession and territorial advantage into quality chance creation and scoring goals - not the first time we've said that about a Potter team.",
      "It can be possession for the sake of possession. The structure is there, but the soul isn't. It's just not very West Ham. The locals want a team that plays with grit and conviction. It could just be that Potter is a bit too spreadsheety for the Hammers. And things could become worse in the short term.",
      "Chelsea played just fine last weekend against Palace and had the most possession (72 per cent) and made the most passes (568) of all Premier League teams but failed to score from an expected goals tally of 1.7.",
      "They won't leave these points out there. Chelsea to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/4 with Sky Bet stands out.",
      "Here's a sentence that would have made absolutely zero sense this time last year: Tottenham are becoming a serious set-piece threat.",
      "Under Ange Postecoglou it was all vibes and vertical football, but under Thomas Frank there's good reason to believe Spurs could evolve into a set-piece machine. Brentford ranked second for expected goals from such situations last season in the Premier League and the early signs are positive for Spurs' ability to create havoc in the same vein.",
      "Hello, Micky van de Ven.",
      "He's not just a Rolls Royce in open play and with the ball - his power, pace, and timing make him an aerial asset waiting to be unlocked from attacking corners and free-kicks. In two starts under Frank, he's already amassed three shots and a goal against PSG.",
      "He is 6/4 with Sky Bet to register at least one shot and while the markets remain sleeping on the true probability, he is a great bet to attack.",
      "If you wanted some evidence about how much Brentford have potentially fallen in the summer, analysing their win price in the last meeting between these two clubs in March says a lot. The Bees, with Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and Yoane Wissa in tow, were 11/10 shots to beat Aston Villa at home.",
      "They are priced up as 21/10 here just five months later, which indicates almost a five per cent implied probability shift.",
      "That's massive when assessing outright prices.",
      "They were utterly hopeless in the first half of their 3-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest. First day nerves to blame? Or more a deeper underlying issue that this is a bigger rebuilding job than the club first imagined? I'm in the latter camp.",
      "Sometimes in football betting, you just have to go back to basics.",
      "Squad downgrade? Check. Squad imbalance? Check. Dangerous opponents who have one of the best managers in Europe? Check.",
      "All signs point to a Bournemouth win over Wolves this weekend at 4/5 with Sky Bet - and this could be a bleak season for Vítor Pereira's men.",
      "At home, with the crowd behind them and Wolves trying to implement Pereira's possession-based patterns under pressure, this game sets up nicely for Andoni Iraola's side and the fast and frenetic Bournemouth style. The Cherries may just squeeze Wolves into errors and feast on transitions. They may have lost a lot of quality in their dressing room but the most important man remains: Iraola - as shown by their performance at Anfield.",
      "That's why they can be trusted to go again despite the squad overhaul.",
      "The Premier League has become a league where pace, power, directness and ability to have real physicality off the ball is so key. This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "I think Sunderland have noticed this trend and spent all summer planning to join the fast-break party because their recruitment has centred around bringing in big strong boys who either have lots of physical presence or carry great pace and power. They were so good on the break in the 3-0 win over West Ham. It was all about energy and progressive running.",
      "Habib Diarra was the real star - this kid is powerful and full of direct running forward. Regis Le Bris gave him lots of license to support the front man and he fired in two shots, one of which was defined a big chance. He's 6/5 with Sky Bet to hit two or more shots again in a game Sunderland will be targeting three points from.",
      "Beware: Declan Rice is a player I'll be rabbiting on about a lot this season.",
      "Since moving to Arsenal, Rice has evolved into more than just a midfield shield. Under Mikel Arteta, he's given license to step into advanced pockets, recycle possession and let fly when space opens up. This positional change makes him a fantastic betting prospect in the attacking props markets.",
      "Rice has covered his two or more shots line in his last six starts and boats an overall shots figure of 2.15 when playing in the No 8 role in 2025.",
      "That figure should be capable of being hit against against a newly-promoted team, where Arsenal will dominate territory and Rice finds himself with time to test the 'keeper or pepper the goal. Combining Arsenal to win and Rice to have two or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet looks a nice angle to attack.",
      "My first port of call whenever a key player leaves or suffers a serious injury is the with and without data to try and quantify how much a team will miss that player's output. Well, since the start of the 23/24 season, Eberechi Eze - on his way to Arsenal - hasn't started 21 games in the Premier League and in that time Palace's win percentage goes from 40 per cent to 19 per cent and their points per game drops from 1.5 to just 1.0 per game.",
      "Oliver Glasner has a difficult job in keeping confidence and mentality levels high within his squad after losing such an important and well-liked player.",
      "Forest are a trustworthy team as you know exactly what you're going to get in that they're very good in both boxes, and are led impeccably by Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo in defence - one of the best defensive pairings in Europe.",
      "This looks a great time to head to Selhurst Park and the away win at 21/10 with Sky Bet does appeal.",
      "One lazy narrative that has stuck out during the pre-season chat is how Everton could struggle without the fortress of Goodison Park and may suffer from new stadium nerves. However, the last five teams in the top two tiers of English football that have moved stadiums possess a healthy record across their first five games.",
      "From those 25 games, they won 16 of them, losing just four.",
      "The Hill Dickinson Stadium has been strategically built to keep the atmosphere hot and hostile and when Everton fans turn up the noise, they remain one of the most passionate set of fans in the country. Brighton are a team overrated by the markets in my view and the 19/10 with Sky Bet on Everton starting with a win at their new home looks a solid wager.",
      "The market likes what it saw from Manchester United against Arsenal based on their win price here. They are 21/20 with Sky Bet although it doesn't feel like particularly smart money is driving the United price into what it is. They still looked very timid in central midfield without the ball and doubts remain about whether the wing-backs - a key cog in any 3-5-2 system - provide enough attacking output to turn United into a functional and exciting team.",
      "I like backing Fulham when they are overlooked. Marco Silva's men are mostly ignored by the market but they took 30 of their 54 points last season against top-half teams. That's a huge return and one that made them very profitable to back as outsiders when the price was right. You can get 6/4 with Sky Bet here on Fulham on the draw no bet market meaning stakes are refunded if the game ends level.",
      "Eddie Howe is doing a great job at using the Alexander Isak situation to bring the club together as best he can.",
      "When St James' Park smells disrespect, it bites back. You can expect the atmosphere to be a bearpit on Monday. Every Liverpool touch booed. Newcastle players pumped to play aggressively from the first whistle as they look to utilise that hotbed of noise to their advantage.",
      "And that's when the Toon are at their most dangerous.",
      "Despite the win vs Bournemouth, Liverpool appeared more vulnerable on the break than last season as they faced more fast breaks (5) in that game than in any Premier League game at Anfield last season.",
      "And Newcastle are built to counter-attack with a front three of Anthony Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes perfectly equipped to hit Liverpool in transition. The hosts look a great bet in the double chance market at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",

      "Old Trafford is a difficult place to go, especially on the opening weekend, but Arsenal found a way to win.",
      "They will need to improve because it wasn't the greatest of displays. They had to rely on a set piece again, but they got their goal, and the defence was rock solid. They got themselves over the line for a vital three points, especially with the game against Liverpool coming up soon.",
      "It was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.",
      "But advantage Arsenal. The way I see it now is Liverpool and Man City have to go to Old Trafford to win to match Arsenal, and that's a huge positive at such an early stage of the season.",
      "Special mention for Martin Odegaard. I thought he was back to his best.",
      "There were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.",
      "If he can maintain those levels that is a big plus for Arsenal.",
      "No-one has really even mentioned Man City in the build up to the season.",
      "It's like no-one knew what to expect from Pep Guardiola and his side, but they really impressed me. It's like we forgot how good they can be because of how bad they were last season. People are starting to take notice now, however.",
      "The win at Wolves was a warning to the other sides wanting to win the title.",
      "I know it wasn't the hardest game in Wolves, but winning away from home 4-0 on the opening day of the Premier League is no mean feat.",

      "He needs some support. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.",
      "But he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.",
      "It's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.",
      "It's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.",
      "You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.",
      "I'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.",
      "That was a must-win game against Burnley. I expected it to be a bit tighter so credit to Spurs for that, but it would have been a shock had they not got all three points at the weekend.",

      "INCIDENT: Eberechi Eze free kick disallowed by VAR after Marc Guehi interfered with the wall.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: This is the law. If a wall is set up with three or more players, opposition players have to be a metre from it. Often you see forwards standing in front of the wall. In this case, Guehi is stood between two players.",
      "Where they set up, Guehi initially is not deemed to be in the wall, he's between two players to the right of the wall, but as the ball is kicked, Guehi's movement is towards Caicedo and without doubt, he's not a metre from it.",
      "The IFAB Laws of the Game for 2025/26 state: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\n\n\n\"If, when a free-kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from a 'wall' formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free-kick is awarded.\"",
      "You don't see it often. Most free kicks don't result in a goal, and because this one does, VAR has to check it.",

      "Arsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second. I do feel they'll get there at some point.",
      "Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.",
      "City have an unbelievable spine.",
      "I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.",
      "Jamie Carragher - Liverpool, ahead of Man City",
      "What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.",
      "A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.",
      "I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.",
      "Neville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd",
      "I've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!",
      "It was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.",
      "And I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.",
      "Carragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "I think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.",
      "Neville - Nottingham Forest",
      "For Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.",
      "Neville - Leeds, Burnley, Wolves",
      "Brentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…",
      "Carragher - Wolves, Sunderland, Burnley",
      "It's easy to put the three promoted teams there. I'm desperate for someone to stay up. I don't want to be talking about the three [promoted] teams going down. I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.",
      "Neville - Brentford",
      "It will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.",
      "Carragher - West Ham",
      "It wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.",
      "Carragher - Erling Haaland",
      "Mohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.",
      "Neville - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "I thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.",
      "He's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.",
      "Carragher - Florian Wirtz",
      "It's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.",
      "Carragher - Estevao",
      "He's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake.

      "Neville - Ruben Amorim",
      "There's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure. He has to deliver in these first few months of the season. I think he will perform. All eyes are on him. Amorim has the toughest job in English football, that's why he's one to watch.",
      "Carragher - Oliver Glasner",
      "I think he's a top manager. He plays the same system [as Amorim]. It's very difficult for Crystal Palace to get specialists, a club of that stature. Won the FA Cup, going into Europe, watching them against Chelsea and against Liverpool in the Community Shield, they beat Man City in the FA Cup final… he knows that system inside out. That guy Glasner definitely knows that system right now better than Ruben Amorim.",

      "Ruben Amorim has praised his Manchester United side for not being \"boring\" during the 1-0 loss to Arsenal but Roy Keane has criticised the low expectations at the club following the defeat.",
      "United's new-look attack - consisting of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - impressed throughout the fixture as Amorim's side played with a fresh impetus going forward.",
      "The hosts unleashed a total of 22 shots towards the Arsenal goal, with nine of these coming from Mbeumo and Cunha, as well as two from fellow new arrival Benjamin Sesko off the bench.",
      "Despite their promise and threat, David Raya's seven saves at Old Trafford ensured Mikel Arteta's side walked away with a clean sheet and all three points on the afternoon after Altay Bayindir's error gifted Riccardo Calafiori the only goal in the game.",
      "​​​​​​​In the aftermath of the defeat, Amorim chose to focus on the positives from the performance, where he applauded their improved bravery and aggression in comparison to last season.",
      "\"Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home.",
      "\"We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.",
      "\"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.",
      "\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.",
      "\"We need to win games but that was a completely different game to last season.\"",
      "United will look to convert another positive performance into points in their next fixture when they face Fulham, live on Super Sunday, on August 24.",
      "\"The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary [Neville] said on commentary, everyone is OK with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better,\" Keane said on Super Sunday.",
      "\"It does worry me. Some of the new signings, there was encouragement with that. They were getting you up the pitch with a bit of power.",
      "\"Things will improve, it's tough against Arsenal, but no goals and another defeat. There's still problems there with Man Utd.\"",
      "Speaking after the game, he said: \"I thought they [United] played well, they were the better team in terms of performance.",
      "\"We know that performance isn't enough sometimes. Arsenal have got real resilience and can grind out 1-0 victories.",
      "\"There were some positives. Mbeumo in the first half and Cunha in the second half. They showed they can handle a big game at Old Trafford, they showed they have got the quality and ability. We obviously know that from Wolves.",
      "\"This is a tough start. Arsenal are a tough team to break down. I'm not too downhearted. I thought the system worked better and the back three did better.",
      "\"Casemiro and Fernandes did well in midfield; they held their own. Throughout the match, Man United were the better team, but they have lost the game.\"",

      "Arsenal clinched a 1-0 win over Man Utd at Old Trafford thanks to Riccardo Calafiori's goal from a corner but the performance also highlighted the key areas for improvement this season; Viktor Gyokeres struggled to make an impact on his debut",
      "Sunday 17 August 2025 21:07, UK",
      "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.",
      "They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.",
      "No other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.",
      "They are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.",
      "Even finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.",
      "They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "Their experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.",
      "\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"",
      "The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.",
      "The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.",
      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "Monday 18 August 2025 15:56, UK",

      "Despite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.",
      "The game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.",
      "On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.",
      "\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.",
      "\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.",
      "\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.",
      "\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.",
      "\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"",
      "Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.",
      "\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.",
      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",
      "More from Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim on Arsenal's winning goal:\n\n\n“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.\n\n\n“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed so he cannot defend it.\n\n\n“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…",
      "\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"",
      "\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: \"If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.",
      "\"I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…\"",
      "That prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.",
      "\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.",
      "\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"",
      "Keane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",
