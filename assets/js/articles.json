      "It's the £300million question - and only Bruno Fernandes has the answer. The Manchester United captain has been given the chance to leave the sinking ship at Old Trafford for steadier waters in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Hilal, one of the big hitters in the Saudi Pro League, have offered Fernandes a mega £700,000 per week contract which the 30-year-old is understood to be seriously considering after his agent met Saudi chiefs in Riyadh last week. Three years in the Middle East would see him pocket a staggering £200m while Al-Hilal are also willing to pay United a £100m fee.",
      "That's enough to transform the Red Devils' summer transfer budget and give Ruben Amorim funds to further build the team in his own image. But at what cost?",
      "United's lowly 15th-placed finish was off the back of Fernandes' brilliant individual campaign, so would his departure deepen their ongoing crisis? Amorim, at least publicly, wants him to stay but the Portugal international hinted that he'd be open to leaving following last month's Europa League final defeat.",
      "Fernandes should be off from Manchester United like a shot. He owes United nothing, having carried them on his back for the last few seasons.",
      "And his reward for this is to be left stuck in a team without European football - and with a cat in hell's chance of winning the title next season. He will be 31 in September and is approaching the age when big names look to cash in one last time. And moves don't come more lucrative than ones to Saudi Arabia.",
      "He will know leaving Old Trafford would leave the team in an even deeper hole. But that's not his problem. And besides, club bosses have just made him go on a farcical post-season tour to Hong Kong and Malaysia, so he also knows where United's skewed priorities lie.",
      "From the player's point of view, this would seem like something of a no-brainer. Bruno Fernandes is the wrong side of 30, Manchester United are in a perilous state and there is no European football on the horizon.",
      "If Fernandes had a concrete offer from one of the continent's big-hitters, there would be a decision to make. But in lieu of that, could anyone really blame him for taking the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia rather than staying at Old Trafford?",
      "Yes, the standard of football is dramatically worse. But he will be a marquee figure and there is little evidence it will affect his international involvement given Cristiano Ronaldo's enduring Portugal career despite playing in the Middle East.",
      "I'm still not convinced Manchester United have quite bottomed out yet, and Fernandes should take the opportunity to make sure he's not around to see that happen. Not to mention the £100million parting gift to swell the club's coffers. It might even save a dinner lady her job.",
      "The focus shouldn't be on reasons for him leaving, they should be all about why he should stay. After all, Fernandes has essentially carried United on his back for five-and-a-half years, with only two domestic cups to show for it.",
      "In a hypothetical world, he could have moved to the other half of Manchester and already be in conversations for being the league's best player. United have done nothing to improve the squad around him since he arrived in 2020 - in fact it has got significantly worse.",
      "At 30, Fernandes could be excused for lacking the patience for what seems to be another massive rebuild at Old Trafford. I would like to see him stay in Europe, but who could blame him for taking the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia?",
      "United under Sir Jim Ratcliffe seem more bothered about their balance sheet than the team sheet. Fernandes would do well to cut ties.",
      "There's obviously the Club World Cup pressure as Al-Hilal press for a deal during this mini transfer window, but if any player deserves a summer off then it is Bruno Fernandes, so if he can find a way to sit tight then I'd do that right now.",
      "The Portuguese has just had arguably the best season of his career, despite everything crumbling around him at Manchester United. But if he is to leave - which he probably should do if he's interested in winning things - I'd like to see him at one of Europe's top sides before making the move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Fernandes previously had three seasons at Udinese and one at Sampdoria, is well respected at Italy's bigger clubs, and he'd certainly improve Inter Milan given their showing at the weekend. He'd make AC Milan, Napoli, Juventus and the rest better, too.",
      "Italy might not be an option for him just yet though, and it certainly won't be as lucrative as Saudi would be, but he should be sitting back and relaxing right now after the rigours of a tough season. Yes, get out of United, but take your time about it.",
      "The main argument against Bruno Fernandes leaving Manchester United comes from his perceived importance to everything the team does. However, if we translate that to league form, what does that actually mean? The difference between finishing 15th and 17th?",
      "United need a summer rebuild - that much is obvious. They'll need to sell in order to buy after missing out on Europe and there's only one member of their squad who can fetch the big one-off fee to accelerate that process.",
      "He's already given his best years to the club, and they're some way from being back in a position of being competitive at the top end of the league. By the time that happens (if it happens?), who knows how big a toll that average of 53 games per season for five straight years will have taken.",
      "Sure, United might miss Fernandes in the short term. As we've seen with Paris Saint-Germain post-Kylian Mbappe and Liverpool post-Phillipe Coutinho in recent years, though, forcing yourself to spread out the creative responsibilities can sometimes be the best way forward.",
      "Fernandes should go. He can only do so much in Manchester and he's about to find out that Amorim's system may not be overly inclusive of him as a player. Without a natural No.10 spot and more demands placed on positions, Fernandes may struggle to perform the role his manager wants.",
      "While I think he should leave the Red Devils, I'm not a lover of players heading to Saudi in their pomp, but heads get turned when mammoth sums are on offer, so it is understandable. It may not do much for his career but would be very kind to his bank balance.",
      "Fernandes has just had one of his best years to date and it got United absolutely nowhere, so it proves that one fantastic individual cannot solve a magnitude of problems. He's given it his all but a new challenge would certainly benefit him and the Middle East may be his only option."

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana is another player in the squad who could head to Saudi Arabia this summer amid talk of a lucrative switch for captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "But whilst the Portugal playmaker has been a leading light Onana continues to underwhelm at Old Trafford. He's just concluded his second season with the club but has continued to make errors leading directly to goals. He was signed as David de Gea's replacement, but the jury is out as to whether the club made the right move.",
      "Reports have claimed Onana is in advanced talks with newly-promoted Saudi Pro League side Neom SC and that United would be open to his sale. The Cameroon goalkeeper was left out of United's matchday squad to face Aston Villa in their final day win over Aston Villa.",
      "Onana was replaced in goal by Altay Bayindir with Ruben Amorim having to come out and defend his goalkeeper. In April, following a poor showing in Lyon, Onana was dropped for the loss at Newcastle before returning.",
      "The goalkeeper's current deal runs until 2028 and a source said: “Andre’s plan is to stay in Manchester and he wants to knuckle down and get United back to where they should be.",
      "“His sole focus is on United and nothing else. He’s a confident person and wants to prove the doubters wrong. He knows he has made mistakes but he sees proving people wrong as a challenge.”",
      "That hasn't stopped reports swirling and it is understood that the Manchester outfit are considering a move for Torino keeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic. The 28-year-old started his pro career at Old Trafford before leaving due to work-permit problems. The Serbian has played a major role for Torino, keeping ten clean sheets in Serie A, to put a number of clubs on alert.",
      "United are set for a major overhaul and their turnover of players could be aided by the potential sale of Fernandes, who could leave for Saudi in a deal worth £100m. Al-Hilal want the Portuguese star, who is weighing up the offer, even though Amorim is desperate to keep him.",
      "He said: \"I just have that feeling. When you talk to someone, you have that feeling if he wants to stay. Of course in a lot of games this season he was so frustrated, but he knows what we are doing. The feeling that I have every time I speak to him is he wants to continue for sure at Man Utd. But you never know.\"",

      "Barcelona sporting director Deco says that his club will focus on the futures of their own players before making moves for targets such as Marcus Rashford. Barca are in the process of tying down a number of key players, with Raphinha and Lamine Yamal recently putting pen to paper on new deals.",
      "Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny also has an offer on the table while Barcelona are in negotiations with defenders Inigo Martinez and Eric Garcia to secure their long-term futures. But they still expect to make 'two, three or four signings', Deco has confirmed.",
      "One of those could be Rashford, whose agent and brother, Dwaine Maynard, was seen meeting with Deco in Catalunya last week. The England international has been put up for sale by Manchester United, who loaned him out to Aston Villa for the second half of the season.",
      "Villa negotiated the option to sign him permanently for £40million but they're now unlikely to trigger that clause. It leaves Rashford, who's set to lose his shirt number at United, searching for pastures new and Barcelona are understood to be his dream club.",
      "But the 27-year-old will have to be patient and hope that they pursue a move for him instead of Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, as Deco outlined Barca's priorities. \"We have been focusing on renewing contracts, after that, we'll discuss players to come,\" the former midfielder told BBC Sport.",
      "\"Of course, these two players, like you mentioned, they are good but have contracts in their clubs, so we won't speak because it's not fair. But when you decide to go to the market, for sure, we find some names. In my opinion, we don't need to bring many players.",
      "\"When I speak with the agents of the players, everyone wants to come or stay. So this is important. The image of the club is still good. We are proud because Barcelona is still such a big club, and the way we are playing football makes players want to come.\"",
      "Deco also confirmed that Barca will 'not sell their best players', despite their precarious financial position. The newly-crowned La Liga champions dominated Spanish football in Hansi Flick's first season in charge and were minutes away from reaching the Champions League final.",
      "Flick described both Rashford and Diaz as a 'fantastic players' when asked about the attacking duo last month. \"I don't want to talk about players who aren't part of my team, but they're both fantastic players and I like them,\" the German said. \"We'll see what happens.\""

After their Europa League loss to Spurs, Garnacho admitted his frustration over not being picked and said the team's season was \"s***\".",
      "Souness - who played 354 times for the Reds before managing them for three years in the 1990s - feels both players are examples of a poor culture in the dressing room and said there was \"too much money and respect\" influencing young players.",
      "\"The fact Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave Manchester United underlines why I have persistently said he is a classic example of a young player who has had too much too soon,\" he told the Daily Mail.",
      "\"That's too much admiration, too much money, too much respect from within the football club and too much from outside, from the public. It puts players like him in a headspace that is detrimental to their growth as a human being and as a football player. It's compounded by the fact he is at Manchester United where a player's profile, even before he has even appeared regularly for the club, is bigger and wider than with any other club in the country.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford, has one season of scoring 30 goals and what does the club do? Give him over £300,000 a week. Look at how that has worked out.\"",
      "Souness claimed there weren't enough experienced leaders in the dressing room to help Garnacho stay grounded and cited Cristiano Ronaldo as a player who the youngster could have benefited learning more from. He insisted when he was a player, he felt \"insignificant\" despite being club captain, because manager Ronnie Moran kept them on their toes.",
      "\"You often hear United managers talk about the culture being wrong. Who does Garnacho have to look up to in that dressing room, that is setting an example? Someone he would want to become. They had the best example in the world and let him go: Cristiano Ronaldo. He would have been worth keeping for the example he set. Staying on after training, dedicating his lifestyle to the sport.",
      "\"At Liverpool you were never allowed to have a big head on your shoulders. That's why I cite Ronnie Moran as the greatest influence on my career. I was captain of Liverpool, but I felt insignificant. Statistics tell you we were pretty good, but Ronnie never let us become 'Billy Big Heads'.\"",
      "Garnacho is now being linked with a move to Chelsea after returning from the club's post-season tour to Asia. The 20-year-old made it clear he was unhappy to travel after uploading a picture of the airport runway after getting back home, with the caption: \"Finally\".",

The Red Devils announced on Sunday that they'd agreed to sign Cunha from Wolves, paying his £62.5million release clause to make the Brazilian their first addition of the summer transfer window.",
      "Cunha, 26, has signed a five-year contract which keeps him at Old Trafford until June 2030. There's also an option to extend his stay by a further 12 months.",

      "\"During two-and-a-half seasons at Wolves, Cunha has scored 33 goals in 92 appearances. Everyone at Manchester United looks forward to welcoming Matheus to Old Trafford.\"",
      "It's understood that United will complete the signing of Cunha and unveil him after the international break which starts this week. The forward has been called up to play for Brazil, as the five-time World Cup winners face Ecuador and Paraguay over the next fortnight under new manager Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "Will Matheus Cunha be a success at Manchester United? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Cunha also hasn't commented on his move publicly. The ex-Atletico Madrid star stayed at The Lowry Hotel in Manchester on Saturday with his family before jetting off to Brazil, where he'll hope to build on a his good final season with Wolves, scoring 17 goals and providing six assists in 36 games.",
      "Wolves, who helped avoid relegation thanks to Cunha's form, confirmed that his departure will earn them a club-record fee. The Premier League side added in their statement: \"Everyone at Wolves would like to thank Matheus for his contributions in old gold and wish he and his family the best of luck for the future.\""

      "“Without Champions League, we don't need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course. But our big plan is to improve the team that we have, is to improve our academy, because I think that is the future.",
      "\"It was the past, so can be the future. It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules. We are not allowed to do much this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.",
      "\"It's important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I have a feeling and I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.\"",

      "Manchester United have been handed a setback in their bid to offload Marcus Rashford this summer, with Barcelona telling the Red Devils they don't want to pay for the winger, according to reports. Rashford is one of several United players who are likely to leave the club in the upcoming transfer window after a successful loan spell at Aston Villa.",
      "Rashford netted four goals and assisted five during his stint under Unai Emery but it is unclear whether Villa will activate their £40million option to buy him permanently.",
      "Villa's failure to qualify for the Champions League means it is unlikely they will try to sign him, with the player eager to play in Europe's top competition.",
      "Rashford enjoyed two Champions League ties against Club Brugge and eventual winners PSG before the team were dumped out in the quarter-finals.",
      "Barcelona have since moved ahead of Villa as the most likely destination for Rashford, but according to German outlet Bild, the club do not want to pay the £40m fee.",
      "It claims that Rashford is eager to move to the Nou Camp after falling out with Ruben Amorim and manager Hansi Flick is interested in making the deal happen.",
      "But it adds that Barcelona don't want to sign him on a permanent transfer and are only keen on a loan move.",
      "It comes as a significant blow to Manchester United, who are in a difficult financial position and need to make money from outgoings if they are to spend this summer.",
      "Rashford joins the likes of Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Joshua Zirkzee who have been linked with an exit. Christian Eriksen, Jonny Evans and Viktor Lindelof have already left on free transfers.",
      "But Barcelona's own financial struggles have been made clear too and they have previously had difficulties registering players. Last season they had a dispute with La Liga over the registration of Dani Olmo.",
      "It is claimed United would give the thumbs up to loaning Rashford out one more time, but they would require Barcelona to cover his £325,000-a-week salary while also paying a loan fee of between £5m and £10m on top.",
      "The Red Devils would also want an obligation for Barcelona to buy Rashford in the summer of 2026 - though the club have also been linked with moves for Liverpol's Luis Diaz and Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli, who they could turn to instead.",

      "Now Garnacho will be ramping up plans to leave United and Stamford Bridge is his No 1 choice, according to the Sun. The Blues were linked with the player in January, with his agents even being spotted in the stands at a Chelsea game.",
      "A source told the outlet he wants to stay in England, saying: \"Alejandro knows the Premier League is the best in the world. And while he has had some good moments at United, he wants to establish himself as a world star. England is the best place to do that and Chelsea have assembled a lot of good young players.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha was a relatively simple transfer for Manchester United to complete.",
      "Cunha wanted to swap Molineux for Old Trafford, his wage demands were not a problem and the £62.5million release clause could be paid in instalments.",
      "The deal ticked almost every box and it was announced on Sunday, the opening day of the summer window. Cunha will officially seal his transfer when he returns from international duty and his visa is approved, but United will be relieved to get him through the door at the earliest possible opportunity.",
      "The reality is that most negotiations for transfers aren't as straightforward because a club could be reluctant to sell, a player might need to be persuaded, or personal demands could be an issue.",
      "There are plenty of moving parts. United walked away from signing Moises Caicedo before he signed for Brighton due to his agent's demands, for example.",
      "Now Cunha has been wrapped up, United will turn their attention to other targets and it's almost guaranteed their next signing will be more complicated than the first.",
      "Talks to sign Cunha from Wolves were plain sailing. Signing a striker won't be as simple.",
      "Liam Delap has already decided to join Chelsea, who will activate his £30m relegation clause, and United will now move on to other targets after missing out on the 22-year-old.",
      "Victor Omsihen ticks most boxes, just like Cunha did, although his wage demands caused his proposed transfer to Chelsea to collapse last summer and the indication is they could be a problem again.",
      "Ineos have lowered the United wage bill since gaining control of football operations and won't pay a huge salary to Osimhen. However, he might be a player worth compromising on.",
      "The new wage structure won't be completely ripped up to accommodate Osimhen, but United need a proven goalscorer and striker is arguably the most important position on the pitch. Ruben Amorim needs goals and Ineos chiefs must decide what price they are willing to pay to deliver them.",
      "United's identification of Delap as their prime target suggests they are taking a different approach. He is young with considerable upside and would have been attainable for a value fee.",
      "Osimhen feels like a signing that the previous decision-makers at Old Trafford would have approved, but the importance of signing a proven goalscorer cannot be understated.",
      "If Osimhen is overlooked, then perhaps Viktor Gyökeres could be a suitable alternative, given he has built an impressive goalscoring record and worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Gyökeres already has experience of English football after developing in the Championship with Coventry, he is 26-years-old and will reportedly be available for £60m this summer.",
      "Osimhen and Gyökeres would be great additions, albeit challenging for United to get over the line for different reasons (Osimhen's wage demands and rival interest in Gyökeres).",
      "Furthermore, the elephant in the room is that United are not particularly attractive for new signings. They have just endured the worst campaign in the club's modern history, finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to qualify for European football, so there is not a huge amount of appeal.",
      "Napoli want to sell Osimhen because he's not in Antonio Conte's plans, but Gyökeres has just won the league with Sporting and they will compete in the Champions League again next season.",
      "Gyökeres may feel it's better for him to stick than twist. Are United the right club for his next move?",
      "There were no such conversations with Cunha because he was adamant about joining United."

      "Subject to a visa and registration being granted, the Brazilian has joined United on a five-year deal after the club agreed to pay his £62.5million release clause. He also has the option of an additional year.",
      "United had been tracking the former Atletico Madrid man for some time after identifying him as one of their top targets to strengthen the squad ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Cunha scored 17 goals across all competitions for Wolves this season, including 15 in the Premier League, and will sharpen a blunt United attack. The Reds have ended each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "However, to ensure they give themselves the best possible chance of increasing their attacking output next term, United want to add to the addition of Cunha by signing a striker.",
      "Like the Brazilian, United had long since identified Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap as a priority target, but he is now on the brink of finalising a move to Chelsea. Delap held talks with a handful of clubs and chose a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "It means United's search for a new goal-getter will head in an alternative direction, although it remains unclear who they plan to try and recruit instead. Napoli ace Victor Osimhen and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres are both continuing to be linked with moves to M16.",
      "United, at this juncture, need an experienced and proven striker that come in and hit the ground running. As tempting and as understandable a move for Delap, who was available via a £30m release clause, was, swooping for him would have signified a huge gamble after just one season as a regular Premier League starter.",
      "United gambled on potential in both 2023 and 2024, signing Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee respectively, but neither of them have done enough to justify leading United's attack, hence why the club is once again on the hunt for a striker.",
      "As well as bolstering their attack, United are also understood to be in the market for a new midfielder. Christian Eriksen will leave the club at the end of this month when his contract expires and neither Kobbie Mainoo or Casemiro are assured of a future at Old Trafford beyond the end of this summer.",
      "Casemiro is approaching the final year of his contract and Mainoo did not play as regularly as he would have liked this season. The club is also yet to reach an agreement with him over a new contract.",
      "The addition of a new right wing-back at Old Trafford cannot be dismissed this summer, either. Prior to it being confirmed in March that Geovany Quenda will join Chelsea next summer, United had expressed interest in the Sporting Lisbon youngster.",
      "The addition of a wing-back, at this juncture, is unlikely to rank as a top priority amid the overriding importance of strengthening the attack. Furthermore, United's intentions for the remainder of the summer are likely to rest on outgoings and raising funds via player sales."

      "Cunha reached a low point while at Atletico Madrid and he credits Wolves for breathing new life into his career. “Sometimes all we want in life is affection,” said Cunha in a fascinating interview with The Guardian in March.",
      "\"People think we have everything, but we’re human beings, too. We need a bit of understanding – we have our difficulties. Wolves gave me that joy back. The fans [have given] me a lot. The status I have today, the player I am now and the happiness I’m feeling, it’s because of them.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim's man-management should get the best out of Cunha. Amorim builds personal relationships with his players and the Brazilian should respond well to his approach.",
      "Cunha initially struggled at Wolves under the old-school Julen Lopetegui, but the appointment of Gary O'Neil helped him play with a smile again. \"Gary understood me completely,” Cunha said. “He came in and said: ‘Man, I think you’re an incredible person, but you need affection.",
      "\"And I’m going to give you affection. I’m going to complain when I need to complain, but I’m almost going to be family for you'. When someone sees something in you beyond the player, it touches you. These conversations and these lessons were of great importance in my life.”",
      "Cunha can speak Portuguese, English, Italian, French, German and Spanish fluently, which means he'll transcend the dressing room at Carrington, and he seems like a certainty to become popular among his peers.",
      "Former teammates have spoken about Cunha being a 'joker' around the training ground. Cunha has a strong personality and ticked a lot of boxes when United completed their due diligence.",
      "United believe Cunha is a brilliant addition on and off the pitch. He is passionate and extremely competitive, typical South American traits, and he won't need any time to adjust to the demands of the Premier League.",
      "The transfer made infinite sense and United deserve credit for getting the deal confirmed on the opening day of the transfer window, albeit Cunha still needs his visa to be completed.",
      "Cunha could have left Wolves in the January transfer window, but he wanted to stay and ensure they avoided relegation, which says a lot about him as a person. “I had a lot of offers but I wouldn’t feel well if I had done it,” he said.",
      "\"Some things you can’t control but I couldn’t leave the club in the middle of the season, in a difficult situation, in the relegation zone. Now, we’re close to achieving our goal [of staying up]. But I’ve made it clear that I need to take the next step. I want to fight for titles, for big things. I have potential.”",
      "Cunha has just celebrated his 26th birthday and he moves to Manchester as he enters the peak of his career. He is a proven Premier League star, but there is a strong feeling that there is still more to come from him.",
      "That is an exciting prospect considering no Brazilian player in Europe has scored more league goals than Cunha (27) since the start of last season, with the likes of Vinicius Jr, Raphinha and Rodrygo all behind him."

      "If Amorim searches for a replacement for Fernandes in one of his two attacking midfield positions in his 3-4-2-1 system, then a move for Mbeumo is simply a no-brainer.",

      "Two of the 21-year-old's 12 goals this season came in either leg of United's dramatic quarter-final win over the French side in the Europa League, while he also bagged 20 assists in all competitions.",
      "He is leaving Lyon this summer and is said to be available for between £20-25million. That appeals to City as they look to sign a replacement for Kevin De Bruyne and it should appeal to United, too.",
      "Sancet missed Athletic Bilbao's Europa League semi-final defeat to United and his impact on the Spanish side was sorely missed.",
      "The Spanish international scored 17 goals in all competitions for the Basque outfit and, at 25, his best years are still ahead of him.",
      "He is a wildcard option and would likely be expensive given he has seven years remaining on his current deal at San Mames but he is certainly a player to consider."

      "Matheus Cunha's £62.5million arrival from Wolves on Sunday is, hopefully, a sign of things to come at Old Trafford. With the first of two transfer windows opening this summer on June 1, United have done something they have, in recent times, been poor at and moved swiftly.",
      "In Cunha's case, the Brazilian's release clause set the record from the off and Wolves' willingness to allow a medical to be conducted made life easier. Now, attention swiftly turns to further business.",

      "However, United do also have some brilliant players which will come to good use to Amorim. The likes of Leny Yoro, Amad and Patrick Dorgu could all offer quality next season. Fortunately, Cunha's signing comes at the perfect time for one.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo endured a difficult second season in the first team after breaking onto the scene under Erik ten Hag. Injuries, minutes on the bench and uninspiring displays played their part for the England international in a year of struggle.",
      "Much has been made of whether or not the club keep him or cash in on one of their academy prospects. On his day, Mainoo starts for United. One thing that has been holding him back is the necessity of forcing Bruno Fernandes into the starting XI.",
      "Rightly so, the United captain had been relied on by Amorim and preferred in the midfield pivot alongside Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte. Yet in the Europa League final, Amorim opted for Fernandes next to Casemiro rather than him play-making in the attacking midfielder role.",
      "As a result of the club missing out on Champions League football, Fernandes' future has been placed into doubt. Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal are believed to be prepared to pay £100million for the playmaker, a deal which hasn't yet been rubbished by either the player or club.",
      "If Fernandes leaves, following Cunha's move, it could be the perfect opportunity for Mainoo to come back into the team and stamp his authority. The Times say that sources claim Amorim sees Cunha playing in one of the two No.10s or slightly 'further back in a more defensive role'.",
      "That would be a strange move by Amorim, considering he hasn't played deeper in his career. But his quality behind the striker makes him the perfect partner to Amad. That would leave Mainoo, Ugarte and Casemiro to battle for a place in the two midfielder slots.",
      "The switch from a player who can play deeper and more advanced, like Fernandes, to a more attack-minded, goal-driven player like Cunha means Mainoo could finally get his break in Amorim's system ahead of the World Cup next summer."

      "While Rashford is a year younger, he is far more unproven at the highest level, with his stellar 2022/23 campaign the standout during a near-decade-long career in the professional game. United could therefore have to look elsewhere to offload their winger, who may never see his dream move materialise if Diaz joins the La Liga champions."

      "MEN Sport reported this week that Fernandes' agent, Miguel Pinho, had met with Al Hilal's representatives in Riyadh to discuss the offer on the table.",
      "United are understood to be relaxed about these talks and are open to selling any of their players this summer. This was followed by reports on Sunday evening from the Middle East that Al Hilal are confident of completing a deal for Fernandes after 'positive talks'.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs claims that Fernandes has been given until Friday to decide whether to stay or go and he is currently weighing up his next move with his family. In the meantime, it is clear that the United captain continues to be held in high regard by his teammates.",
      "After sharing an update of himself arriving for the Portuguese national team camp on Sunday evening, Garnacho commented underneath with a perfect message. \"Brunooo, Brunooo, Brunooo,\" he wrote, mimicking the chants heard at Old Trafford on a regular basis.",
      "Fernandes is not the only player in this interaction who has an uncertain future ahead of him. Garnacho is also set to be sold this summer having forced Ruben Amorim's hand after the Europa League final.",
      "With the summer window now open, albeit briefly, it will be interesting to see whether Fernandes, Garnacho or both men end up departing the club."

      "Victor Osimhen has sent a clear message after he scored in what is likely to be his last Galatasaray appearance during their final day victory over Istanbul Basaksehir.",
      "That was the 26-year-old's 37th goal of the season in all competitions and with Osimhen key in winning the Turkish league and cup, it is hardly surprising that several suitors are interested in acquiring his signature. With Napoli wanting a permanent exit, Chelsea, Juventus and Manchester United have all been linked.",
      "The former have since agreed to pay Liam Delap's £30million relegation clause to sign him from Ipswich Town but signing another striker has not been ruled out. Juventus meanwhile, have been linked to signing Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting CP.",
      "Arsenal turning the focus onto Benjamin Sesko could result in the Italian giants having a free run at the Swede. United losing out on Delap has seemingly left them with a choice between Gyokeres and Osimhen even though the arrival of Matheus Cunha has been confirmed.",
      "His £62.5million release clause will be paid using instalments which could allow for other funds to be used elsewhere. Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho all sealing exits would also help Ruben Amorim's budget.",
      "Gyokeres, who inspired Sporting to a domestic double, has a similar asking price to Cunha while Osimhen could cost just a little bit more as Napoli want his £63.2million (75m) release clause met.",
      "Having also won two trophies in the last few weeks, he has been extremely active on social media and the striker has posted another message that shows what he could bring to Old Trafford.",
      "Posing alongside both trophies, in full Galatasaray attire, Osimhen posted a collage of photos with the silverware on display sending the message as no caption was included.",
      "As he has also proven his worth at crucial moments by guiding Napoli to a surprise Scudetto triumph back in the 2022/23 season, it has become quite clear that Osimhen is the man for big occasions and United are in need of players at that level.",
      "However, Gyokeres has done similar and therefore a tough call awaits Amorim and Co. on the experienced striker to bring in."

      "Now the post-season tour of Asia is complete, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be able to take a moment and reflect on exactly what needs changing this summer.",
      "The comedians among you will perhaps reply 'everything' and, to be honest, you are not too far wrong. The boardroom remains at loggerheads with the fanbase, the stadium still remains unfit for purpose and the playing squad have just rallied around to accomplish the worst Premier League campaign ever.",
      "However, Amorim only has a couple of months before they do things all over again in the Premier League. Take into account the pre-season obligations that shall begin in July and, ultimately, there really is no time to waste.",
      "To try and forget his issues, Amorim may have flicked on the Champions League final on Saturday night and be inspired by how a team that was once riddled with squad issues can regroup and ultimately lift the top prize in domestic football. If he just so happened to be in the United States, Amorim could have caught Beckham laying into his squad.",
      "\"It’s tough times,\" a deflated Beckham told CBS Sports. \"I don’t like seeing some of things that are going on at the club.",
      "\"On the pitch is what counts but in all honesty I’m seeing a lot of things that are not ok in my eyes as a fan and as a lover of Man United. You have to represent the badge.",
      "\"That’s what it is about. I’ve seen a lot of things where players are not acting in the right manner. We were a part of a team that was so well-mannered. We understood what it meant to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"We understood what the badge meant. Wherever we travelled, whether it was in Europe or in Asia, we respected the fans. We respected the fact that they were turning up, paying money and wanting you to sign and take pictures. You respect that.\"",
      "While Beckham's testimony fails to bring into account Amad's side of the story which provoked his outburst, the United legend does raise a broader point that does need addressing. This current group's behaviour off the pitch, and even sometimes on it too, has been too individualistic.",
      "There are some players who have the right character about them but together there is a severe lack of a team camaraderie and that must be addressed this summer. For Amorim, the plan should be clear.",
      "He must whittle out the members of this squad that do not fit with his vision and those that simply are disrupting this club from moving forward. Only when he does that, will United be able to move forward."

      "Manchester United have kickstarted their summer transfers with the announcement of Matheus Cunha's £62.5m arrival.",
      "The Brazilian joins on a five-year contract from Wolves, on the back of the 2024/25 campaign in which he scored 17 goals and provided six assists. Ruben Amorim hopes his new signing can have a similar influence in his Man United team, eyeing Cunha for the role of a specialist No.10.",
      "This in itself is a success as the 26-year-old had been on the club's wish list heading into the freshly-opened window, so that is one piece of intended business ticked off. Unfortunately it seems like the same will not be said for Liam Delap, with the striker target favouring a move to Chelsea.",
      "So it is back to the drawing board, at least somewhat, as Man United will look at alternative targets. And this crossroads may be the ideal time for Old Trafford chiefs to take a view of the growing pool of free agents available this summer.",
      "It's no secret that United need to sell before they can buy this summer and bringing in stars who won't command a transfer fee could solve some of Amorim's biggest problems whilst freeing up the budget to be used elsewhere.",
      "Angel Gomes has indicated that he will not renew with LOSC Lille for next season and beyond with it reported the creative midfielder prefers a return to England.",
      "And Man United fans should remember the 24-year-old fondly as an academy graduate of the club, breaking through to the senior team aged just 16 in 2017. He went on to make 10 appearances before moving to France.",
      "Now with Gomes' next transfer looming, Cunha would theoretically fill the same role as he would if a return was on the cards. That said, for no fee involved it is low risk and Amorim might appreciate all the talent he can get and the England international is versatile enough to slot into the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "With the club set to miss out on top choice Delap, an alternative striker option available for free, is fellow Lille star Jonathan David.",
      "The Canada international is also leaving the Ligue 1 club, having made 232 appearances over the past five years with an impressive record of 109 goals and 45 assists.",
      "David has acquired Champions League and international experience during his time in France, though he may not fit the same target man profile of Delap, standing at only 5'10\". Instead it is his pace and accuracy that make him a danger.",
      "One soon-to-be available option is the Brazilian's teammate at Wolves, Nelson Semedo, with his contract to expire at the end of June.",
      "Now because Man United are a fellow Premier League side, they would have to wait until July 1 to officially be able to enter discussions with the player. That means they would have to hope he has not agreed a move abroad by then.",
      "The Portuguese international, 31, might not be a long-term solution but provides vast experience having played in the Premier League for five years, and before that for Barcelona."

      "Throughout the entirety of 2023, Sheikh Jassim was embroiled in a fierce race with Sir Jim Ratcliffe to purchase United when the Glazers put it up for sale. The American family initially suggested that all outcomes, including a full sale, were on the table which invited the interest of the two businessmen.",
      "As it transpired, the Glazers were leaning towards selling a minority stake in the club, particularly the football side. While Ratcliffe chose to alter his demands, Sheikh Jassim stuck to his stance of a full buyout and wiping out the entire debt that had been collected by the club under the Glazers' watch.",
      "On Christmas Eve 2023, United announced that Ratcliffe had won the race to invest and by February 2024, his minority stake had been ratified by the Premier League. Since then, the Ineos founder has come under criticism for his perceived brutal spending cuts, including redundancies, poor staff appointments, chiefly Dan Ashworth and his decision to uproot season ticket holders.",
      "Ratcliffe has admitted that if he was to receive the same level of protests against him as the Glazers have received, he would look to walk away from the club. In a new report from The Telegraph, it is claimed that Sheikh Jassim remains hopeful of one day taking over.",
      "They insist that they expect United to be up for full sale in the future and nothing that the Glazers' and Ratcliffe's alliance have done so far have diminished that expectation. If they were to relaunch a bid to takeover United, the Qatari banker would need to re-establish The Nine Two UK Holdings ltd.",
      "This corporation was formed by Sheikh Jassim to takeover United and paid tribute to the Class of '92. However, it was dissolved in September last year after the takeover process had officially finished."

      "Selling Bruno? That’s unfathomable\nI find the emerging idea of selling Bruno, our best player, to raise funds to rebuild the team completely unfathomable. You don’t sell your best and most shining player to rebuild. Will Liverpool sell Salah to rebuild? Will Man City sell Haaland to rebuild? Will Chelsea sell Palmer to rebuild?",
      "The team improves when additional quality players are brought in, not when your best players leave. You sell marginal, fringe, surplus to requirement and/or underperforming players to raise additional funds to sign quality players to complement, support and play with your best players. INEOS and fans whose contention is ‘sell Bruno for £100M’ should rethink that idea, a completely ill advised approach.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",
      "Sell Bruno Fernandes? Man Utd need him to lead rebuild, not pay for it…",
      "",
      "…Or maybe?\nBruno Fernandes leaving? It shouldn’t be really that hard of a decision. 100 mil for a 30-year old with huge mood swings and tantrums while you cut off staff’s lunches? The answer should be an emphatic Yes!",
      "I get that news outlets are all trying their best to get as much as click out of this one, but for United it’s a simple decision. Sell him and any other you can and just buy better this time. They should have let Ten Hag go last summer but they didn’t and now it feels like the same mistake all over again.",
      "Mind you, if they don’t sell, I can’t wait to read the same news outlets’ reports, round about November, on how they would have been better off taking the 100 mil back in the summer.",
      "Bruno’s an alright footballer but he doesn’t play for the team and his very existence has reduced every manager’s plan to build a team into “just give it to Bruno”. United need team players now, so for sure sell him and buy Mbuemo-esque players. It’s as simple as that!\nMo. Reza",
      "",
      "Benitez for Man Utd?\nThere’s only one man United should be looking at to replace Ruben Amorim…",
      "The Spanish Big Sam, Rafa Benitez! Sounds like a joke but they could do a lot worse. I feel like I’m the only one who knows something obvious – and that is, Amorim clearly does not want to be there at all. He was happy where he was until the suits dictated that money would decide his fate.",
      "I say let him return home and bring in Benitez. United can not shore up the defence, that is a Rafa specially. United need to punch above their current financial might, that is another Rafa specially. I don’t even think the United fans could hate him after the shitshow of finish 2 places above relegation and losing the worst European final in living memory to “Lads, it’s Spurs”.",
      "Rafa Benitez should be exactly who United are looking at right now because he guarantees exactly what they need. Look at what he achieved at Chelsea with the fans booing him every game… Imagine what he could achieve with the squad United have, the support they have and the Stadium they play in. It’s a stone cold fact.",
      "Man United under Rafa Benitez would achieve a cup wing and qualify for Europe at the end of next season if appointed now. Besides all that, you have to imagine there’s a large part of Benitez that would love to knock Liverpool back off their perch after the way he was cast aside and overlooked when the club hired Roy Hodgson. He knows the league, he knows the club and he like United is due some form of redemption.\nGreasy Belcher",

It took years and billions of dollars of investment, not just in players, but infrastructure, recruitment, scouting, etc. to reach this point.",
      "The chilling lesson that we should all be pondering is that, given City’s all conquering exploits from last year, the clear message is that this type of success is going to become the domain of fewer and fewer clubs, run by nation states or billionaires with unlimited funds, just like the NFL, with the obvious end game being a super league.",

      "They did incredibly well finally winning a trophy after all that time, especially considering they did it with a Championship level squad. But I honestly think that had they faced pretty much any other European team from any of the top 4/5 leagues then they would have lost. They were very fortunate to have, as their opponents, the most inept Manchester United team that has been seen in decades, a team who has had an equally poor a season as them in the league.",
      "And don’t talk to me about injuries. Who the hell out injured would have improved their team that much? When you are spending huge amounts of money on players like James Mannequin and Dominic ‘W**ky’ Solanke you aren’t going to challenge consistently in the league. Their better players are on the wane anyway, and I wouldn’t take anyone they have on a free transfer, let alone pay a fee, if I was a Premier League team in the top half of the table.",
      "Their Champions League fixtures will only stretch the existing squad even more, and they will be out at the first opportunity if there aren’t major changes. Daniel Levy will have to dip in and spend £100-200M to get this squad to challenge at the top of the league. But even then, do you trust them to buy decent players with their track record? If they are as big as they say then they shouldn’t be overpaying for players who were one season wonders in the league but at least trying for the likes of Sesko or Gyokeres along with the other top teams.",
      "I like Postecoglou actually, and with the right team I think he’d have a lot more success, although he does come out with some crackpot shit often! I’ve no idea why he’s keen to stick with a club with so little ambition though. Whatever happens I’m sure Spursiness will remain anyway. Besides, it’s all Chelsea’s next year!!\nBlueBaz",

With trademark lack of any self awareness, and having a club that finished 17th (not by accident), he refers to recruiting Fulham’s Marco Silva as ‘always a danger for mid table managers that sustained competence is exactly what big clubs ought to want but can also make you a bit invisible’. Brilliant. Never change Dave.",

      "What the hell were Manchester United doing in Malaysia? Are they mad? They should all be lying down in a dark room, trying to forget how bad they’ve been. It’s like they’re just pretending everything is normal when it’s an absolute bin fire. This is no way to run a business and certainly not a football club.",
      "It doesn’t take the wisdom of Solomon to realise a) earning £7.8million from a trip to Malaysia is peanuts which they routinely fritter away on poor players and which they could surely drum up through a commercial deal for United-endorsed pressed duck feet or something, b) they’ll ruin the brand further by losing games and playing poorly, c) the players will be exhausted and humiliated by being beaten, which means they’ll not be rested or inspired for a new season, meaning more failure, and d) there’s a limit to how much you can charge to see such a terrible team, putting off more fans than they can attract, making them feel resentful towards the club. Things are going downhill and fast, aided by Airhead Jim’s lack of basic business acumen.",
      "The club clearly sees the players like donkeys at the beach, forgetting that they are actually human. Does anyone think the best way to get over an appalling season is to get booed off in Malaysia? Actually booed off in Kuala Lumpur by people who had paid up to £260 to witness these sweating bodies being hopeless. These have been loyal followers, prepared to pay to see the club, even in the knowledge it likely won’t be the first team.",
      "That is no way to enhance your brand, to say the least. Do you think they’ll keep buying merchandise in these circumstances? You do, don’t you, Ratcliffe, you fool.",
      "Only a mean, insensitive cretin like thick-as-a-brick Jim would think this is a good idea. The manager obviously doesn’t have any confidence, saying, “We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game – that is what happened. I always feel guilty for the performance of the team since the first game I was here,” as he continues his ‘please sack me’ campaign in earnest.",
      "This sort of overseas tour fails to see that every season is just one part of every year; what you do in the summer influences what happens in the new campaign. Players don’t just reboot in mid-August and start fresh again and I really don’t think this is appreciated. Given that pre-season will start in mid-July and internationals are in the second week of June, they’ve all got about four weeks’ rest, unless Stupid Wurzel has got another trip planned, probably to the Arctic to play Eskimos.",
      "They obviously need a good rest and a re-set, not flogging even harder. They’re no good and don’t play well together, but it’s not a lack of games to blame. The football matters. It should be at the core but it seems almost incidental. Losing to sides you should easily beat just makes everything, on all levels, worse. Just playing terribly in more games isn’t going to make them improve. Even winning occasionally has proved to be nothing but a blip in a long-term trend.",
      "Failure is endemic and needs correcting from the boardroom to the pitch. And to do all this just after the season ended seems more akin to punishment. And don’t forget, players need to be sold and desperately. Given how mediocre they are, exposing their inadequacy is probably a bad idea if you want to get rid of them (and why wouldn’t you?) and want to get a decent price for them.",
      "They already have little or no leverage as it is; getting beaten in Malaysia just makes it easier for buyers to drive down the price, giving them less money to replace them with. How did this stupid actually become a billionaire?",
      "These things don’t take a degree in Business Studies to work out. It seems there is no limit to some people’s ability to see black as white as they go about their business, doubtless wondering who broke all the china in the shop and sh*t up the walls, completely unaware it’s them.",
      "It’s clear the people involved in driving this juggernaut don’t know where they’re going, haven’t even got a driving licence and are wearing a blindfold. Put more prosaically, they’re sh*te. The trouble is, they don’t realise, even as they plough the juggernaut into the sea. They think they’re great and can do no wrong, even as the once-great edifice crumbles to dust at their feet. Their delusion is total. But you can’t tell stupid people they’re stupid because they’re too stupid to understand.",
      "Their obsession with generating money is making them worse and effectively crippling them. I repeat, £7.8 million, that’s all they’re generating by doing this. That’s 10% of an Antony. It’ll pay a player’s wages for approximately four months. In return they get a knackered, demoralised squad and a devalued, reviled brand. Is it worth it? Only a fool would say yes. But that’s exactly who is in charge. Shambolic."

      "There were arguably some encouraging signs in the final weeks of the season, but eight points from the final six games isn’t that great really, and when all those points come from games against Southampton, Tottenham, Man United and Ipswich it becomes an even flimsier looking foundation for significant growth.",

      "According to reports, Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal think an ‘agreement is close’ for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes amid one ‘key factor’.",
      "Fernandes was Man Utd’s best performer in a disastrous 2024/25 campaign and he’s one of the few players who can hold his head high after their 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd could sell Fernandes in the coming days as he is being pursued by Al-Hilal as they look the finalise their squad for this month’s Club World Cup.",
      "Man Utd’s dire performances in the Premier League and loss in the Europa League final leave them with a limited summer budget and they likely need to sell to buy.",
      "So, while it would be incredibly difficult for Man Utd to replace Fernandes, his sale for £80-100m would significantly ease their financial troubles and enable Ruben Amorim to sign more upgrades suited to his 3-4-3 system.",
      "READ: Six reasons Man Utd should replace Ruben Amorim with Arsene Wenger…",
      "Fernandes has largely remained coy when asked about his future, but recent reports have indicated that he is open to a move to the Middle East outfit.",
      "It’s been said that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘risks a fallout’ with ‘seething’ Amorim if Fernandes is sold, while another recent report claimed he is ‘very close’ to an exit.",
      "Now, journalist Ben Jacobs has provided a clear update, claiming Al-Hilal chiefs believe they are “close to an agreement” with Fernandes following “positive” discussions with his representatives.",
      "Jacobs also claims that one ‘key factor’ will be behind his final decision, and a deadline has been set.",
      "Jacobs tweeted: “Al-Hilal now believe an agreement with Bruno Fernandes is close after a week of positive meetings.",
      "“Fernandes is currently deliberating with his family. A key factor in whether Fernandes agrees will be if the move is also right for his family. It will be more than just a football decision. Hilal want a final answer by Friday.",
      "“No formal approach or bid yet to Manchester United, but Hilal’s belief is a sale will be sanctioned if Fernandes asks to leave. #MUFC still insist they don’t want to sell their captain”",
      "Reporter Graeme Bailey has already revealed that Al-Hilal are “pushing the boat out” for Fernandes, with £100m “a lot to turn down”.",
      "“Al-Hilal are going for this. Inzaghi, Ronaldo and now the Premier League’s finest,” Bailey said.",
      "“I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "“They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out.",
      "“United have told Bruno he isn’t going…but 100 million would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes may leave Manchester United but it will not be because he attended a birthday dinner with his friend…",
      "Should Man Utd sell Bruno Fernandes? The fans are split. We also have views on the new Man Utd manager, Spurs and more.",
      "Man Utd are prepared to sell another starter to Saudi Arabia this summer amid interest in Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has explained why he thinks Matheus Cunha’s arrival will lead to two stars leaving this summer.",
      "On Sunday, Man Utd announced the signing of Cunha in the most expensive transfer of this summer’s transfer window *so far*.",
      "The Red Devils made the versatile attacker their No.1 target and activated his £62.5m release clause after he contributed 17 goals and six assists for Wolves in all competitions during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "This is a key signing for Man Utd as they have been toothless in attack under Ruben Amorim and Cunha fits perfectly into the head coach’s 3-4-3 system.",
      "Ferdinand has given a few reasons why he thinks Cunha will be a great signing for Man Utd.",
      "“He needs to reboot this attack. We don’t look like we’re going to score goals in open play unless it’s Bruno [Fernandes] or maybe Amad [Diallo],” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Six reasons Man Utd should replace Ruben Amorim with Arsene Wenger…",
      "“We’ve taken Wolves’ top goalscorer this season. He’s got 16 goals to his name in all competitions.",
      "“He’s one of the players that I mentioned a few weeks ago: if I had a shopping list, he would be on there.",
      "“He knows the Premier League so he doesn’t need any adaptation time.",
      "“This is a huge factor… if you’re going to buy players from foreign leagues, players that don’t have the experience in the Premier League, there is always a risk.",
      "“But he has the experience here, we’ve seen him here, he grew up a Manchester United fan.”",
      "There is a drawback to this deal, though. This is because Ferdinand believes Cunha’s arrival will force Man Utd to offload Marcus Rashford and one more player this summer.",
      "“I’m hearing he’s taking the No.10 shirt which was Rashford’s shirt. What does that mean for Marcus Rashford, man?” Ferdinand continued.",
      "“There’s a lot of questions that will be asked about that as well and it might answer a few questions. But 17 goals and six assists in 36 games for a Wolves team is impressive.",
      "“The recruitment team, the coaches and the players will have seen what he did to Manchester United at Old Trafford. He was slicing through Manchester United like a hot knife through butter.",
      "“He looked like he had the power and I think he fits a Ruben Amorim player profile perfectly. He’s quick, he’s dynamic, he’s aggressive, he’s capable of dropping deep and transitioning with the ball, he can pass and he can threaten the opponents with a goal by running deep or coming short.",
      "“I think he’s the type of player that Ruben Amorim has been crying out for and with neither [Rasmus] Hojlund or [Joshua] Zirkzee at the moment looking like the answer in advanced positions, I think he has a real opportunity to play across one of those three positions quite easily, as a nine, as one of the guys off the sides.”",
      "He added: “The only thing I would say in this window is that £60m in this window, it will remain to be seen what type of work gets done when you’re spending a big chunk like that.",
      "“As much as I’m happy with it, it means they are going to be some going out of the door and it means there’s going to be somebody like Garnacho or Kobbie Mainoo… and Marcus Rashford.",
      "“They will be the players that will be going I think, so when you look at it it’s a lot of money. But where are you going to get players that can come and affect your first-team for that type of money?”",
      "Rio Ferdinand was “hurt” to see long-term Man Utd target Jeremie Frimpong sign for arch-rivals Liverpool ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Barcelona could make an offer for an Arsenal star if they fail to land Marcus Rashford from Man Utd this summer, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Man Utd duo Rasmus Hojlund and Mason Mount need to leave Old Trafford this summer to rescue their careers, according to ex-Red Devils defender Paul Parker.",

      "Both men played more than 30 Premier League games in the season just gone, but neither passed five goals.",
      "As a result, there’s speculation regarding both being sold, with United to sign a better striker. They have some big names on their radar, but might struggle to convince any great players to join given their lack of any European football next term.",
      "They have been offered a solution, though, as TBRFootball reports United are among the clubs who have been ‘approached’ by the representatives of Tammy Abraham, and ‘informed’ on his willingness to return to the Premier League.",
      "Abraham played 89 times in the English top flight, largely with Chelsea, and scored 26 goals and assisted seven more.",
      "He moved to Roma in 2021, and went on loan to AC Milan this season, racking up 47 goals and 20 assists since heading to Italy.",
      "At Milan this season, Abraham was directly involved in 17 goals, but wants to come back to England, and several Premier League sides are informed on his situation.",
      "TBRFootball’s report states West Ham, Everton and Newcastle have all taken an interest in him, while Aston Villa and Leeds are both keeping tabs on the striker’s situation.",
      "Villa know about Abraham’s qualities, having had him on loan when they were in the Championship in 2018-19. That was their last season in the second tier, with the striker helping them back to the top flight with 25 regular season goals and three assists, as well as a goal in the playoffs, which Villa won.",
      "Though that was now seven seasons ago, it has been suggested a few times in recent seasons that Villa might like to bring Abraham back to the club if possible.",
      "It looks unlikely that Marcus Rashford will be signed permanently, given he and Barcelona want to join forces, so Villa might well be keen on signing a new striker."

      "Manchester United have been told by Danny Murphy that the consequences will be “devastating” if their best player leaves this summer amid heavy Saudi threat.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League this season. The campaign will surely go down as one of the worst in their history.",
      "One of the only shining lights was Bruno Fernandes, who was directly involved in 39 goals in an otherwise below-par side.",
      "There has been a lot of speculation about his future, with the attacking midfielder courted by the Saudi Pro League at the minute, having reportedly had ‘positive talks’ with Al-Hilal.",
      "Former Premier League midfielder Murphy does not feel Fernandes can be allowed to leave.",
      "Writing in the Daily Mail, he stated it is ‘imperative’ that the midfielder stays at United, as if not, and he kicks off next season in Saudi Arabia, the ‘consequences will be devastating’ for the Old Trafford outfit.",
      "Murphy has praised Fernandes for wanting to ‘stand up and be counted during a terribly difficult period’. He also stated that the recent successes of the club, reaching cup finals, is ‘down to Bruno’.",
      "The pundit suggests that the sale of Fernandes, who is 30 and would surely command a giant fee makes ‘financial sense’ but from a performance perspective he is ‘irreplaceable’.",
      "Indeed, though United want to sign a new striker, and the sale would help to finance that, whoever is signed would be ‘far less effective without having the wonderful passes and crosses Bruno would provide’ per Murphy.",
      "Speculation over Fernandes’ exit has been ramped up given Cristiano Ronaldo is being eyed by Al-Hilal, who wants Fernandes to join him ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "Insider Graeme Bailey said: “Al-Hilal are going for this. Inzaghi, Ronaldo and now the Premier League’s finest.",
      "“I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "“They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out.",
      "“United have told Bruno he isn’t going…but 100 million would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes may leave Manchester United but it will not be because he attended a birthday dinner with his friend…",

      "Man Utd are prepared to sell another starter to Saudi Arabia this summer amid interest in Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",

      "PSG have taken the long road to Champions League glory – with humiliations by Manchester United and Newcastle – but Luis Enrique has ended their ‘obsession’.",
      "",
      "“The Champions League is not at all an obsession – that is over. I said that at the first press conference with Luis Enrique,” said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi with all the conviction of a man whose sportswashing had shrunk under the pressure of one too many loads.",
      "“We are building a new identity; our own style, our own principles of how to play, an offensive play, and a new culture. That’s what we want, and then the results will follow.",
      "“We are building a team that is really playing as a team. We want our players to enjoy playing, our staff to enjoy coaching, and for our fans to enjoy it when you watch.”",
      "Ten days later, PSG were beaten 4-1 at St James’ Park. The players, staff and fans cannot have particularly enjoyed watching Miguel Almiron, Dan Burn, Sean Longstaff and Fabian Schar score against Europe’s perennial underachievers – although the schadenfreude was irresistible for neutrals.",
      "It has been a long, arduous and often absurd journey to the summit. PSG have avoided the ultimate ignominy of exiting at the group stage ever since this odyssey began, but the trade-off for that has been a preposterous propensity to stumble at all manner of other hurdles: consecutive away-goal eliminations by Barcelona and Chelsea; victims of La Remontada; a humiliation so thorough it forced Manchester United to make Ole Gunnar Solskjaer their manager for more than two years; being entirely and utterly Karim Benzema’d in the Bernabeu.",
      "PSG and the Champions League had been in a toxic, unrequited relationship for years, and the former was kidding itself if they ever believed themselves to be in a position to declare it “over”.",
      "But Luis Enrique has broken the cycle.",
      "The Spaniard’s words at his unveiling became a eulogy at the funeral of Inter’s entire psyche. “The attacking identity is non-negotiable – it’s my philosophy. You have to adapt to your players, my job is to get the best out of my players individually and collectively. I am committed to putting a winning team together and I have no doubt that I will be able to do that and give PSG fans something they will like.”",
      "There were tears in the stands, in the dugout, on the pitch. It was historic but harrowing, a traumatic scene of youthful exuberance obliterating grizzled experience. It was the end of the road for Inter, who would have taken Boyz II Men 0 as early as the 20th minute had they been offered the choice. And after almost a decade and a half it is the belated start of what PSG hope to translate into a period of utter dominance.",
      "Over the course of those 90 minutes it was difficult to envisage any other scenario developing over the next few years. The youngest starting line-up in a Champions League final this century produced two of the five youngest ever European Cup final scorers. The man of the match was 19-year-old Desire Doue. The only player older than 30 of the 16 used was record appearance maker Marquinhos. This is not a group on the verge of disbanding.",
      "That provided an interesting juxtaposition with Inter, for whom this was a second Champions League final in three years, but with the tangible sense it would be their last together. The future of Simone Inzaghi is deeply uncertain, three of their starters were at least 36 and the rest were made to look twice as old. PSG started by hammering the ball out for a throw-in deep in Inter’s half and for the subsequent hour and a half rarely afforded them the opportunity to escape.",
      "This was their last stand and the early mistakes betrayed it, culminating in the double salvo from Federico Dimarco which ended the game as a contest. He was caught in his own offside trap and then later isolated by Doue down the right as PSG took the quickest two-goal lead in final history.",
      "Willian Pacho was winning everything, including a battle with Nico Barella as the Inter midfielder hoped to shepherd the ball out for a corner, only for the PSG centre-half to poke it away and launch the counter which produced the second goal. Achraf Hakimi started popping up at centre-forward and on the left-wing.",
      "Hakan Calhanoglu, the set-piece master, was gifted a presentable free-kick in the vicinity of the PSG area and thumped it straight out for a goal kick early in the second half; it summed the proceedings up neatly.",
      "Then came the landslide. Inzaghi made his changes, four by the hour mark. The sight of Matteo Darmian taking to the pitch somehow did not galvanise Inter but PSG derived motivation from it anyway, hitting a ridiculous triple punch of quality goals: Vitinha to Doue; Ousmane Dembele to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia; Bradley Barcola to fellow substitute Senny Mayulu.",
      "It was almost painful to watch by the end, particularly through the prism of the hapless Francesco Acerbi.",
      "Perhaps only Kylian Mbappe had a more uncomfortable night as the modern-day Michael Owen: the prodigy distracted by the lights of Real Madrid, only for his boyhood club to thrive and immediately capture the sport’s biggest prize in his absence. He might be able to console himself with having scored in that Newcastle defeat.",
      "As it is, the evening belonged not to Al-Khelaifi – despite some weird yet entirely predictable “win for football” nonsense – but Luis Enrique. His personal story is touching enough but even on a professional level it is refreshing to watch such a phenomenally talented and often overlooked coach achieve something so historic.",
      "This PSG success cannot be framed properly without acknowledging the vast spend needed to deliver it. With the highest wage bill in Europe and over £200m invested on transfers this season alone it is, in many ways, simple maths. But Enrique going where incredible managers before him could not at least means something.",
      "And that thing, ultimately, is a Super Cup final against Spurs. It is the showdown of Europe’s true greatest teams we all deserve, and the only real way to celebrate the long-awaited climax of an “obsession”.",
      "There are 10 Champions League final participants who are either Premier League rejects or never made it there at all…",
      "Chelsea rejected Luis Enrique twice, Arsenal turned him down for two reasons, Spurs pulled out at the last hurdle and Manchester United came close too.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique insists he’s “not worried at all” about facing Arsenal after the French side’s unexpected defeat against Nice.",
      "Youri Tielemans and Luis Enrique have been speaking to the press ahead of Aston Villa’s huge Champions League clash with Paris-Saint Germain."

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Monday 2 June 2025 12:57, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",

      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",

      "Monday 2 June 2025 12:20, UK",
      "Speaking to Matheus Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."

      "Bruno Fernandes is yet to make a decision on his future with Al Hilal willing to pay Man Utd £100m for their captain and nearly treble his wages; the potential sale poses a dilemma with the club in need of a cash injection to fund their rebuild but also so reliant on Fernandes",
      "Sunday 1 June 2025 19:13, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has often been relied upon as Manchester United's saviour - so it is fitting his parting gift could end up being one last rescue act.",
      "United always knew sales would be required this summer to create enough financial flexibility to reshape the squad for Ruben Amorim. Selling Fernandes was not part of that plan, the captain's future a widely presumed certainty until Al Hilal came to the table.",
      "Despite the Saudis' willingness to pay £100m for a player turning 31 in September, United and Amorim want to keep Fernandes. The United boss believes the midfielder wants to stay, though he could not guarantee he would. But can the club afford to turn this down?",
      "Such an offer is unlikely to come again given Fernandes' age. The windfall would be transformative for United ahead of a summer when the budget is pinched, and an overhaul is so dearly required. Fernandes' sale could kick-start a new chapter for the club.",
      "This rationale only holds up under the assumption that the funds would be spent wisely and, for a club with such a poor record in recruitment, it would be a huge gamble. No wonder there is scepticism. Go backwards again and relegation looms.",
      "Old Trafford has become a graveyard for stars over the last decade - Fernandes one of the few shining exceptions - and although INEOS are not to blame for that legacy, it highlights how tricky it would be to replace the club's best signing since Robin van Persie.",
      "We all know Fernandes is a production machine, but he has also become a leader. Imperfect, certainly. United's captain tends to try too hard when things go wrong - to his and the team's detriment. But where would they be without him?",
      "Well, United have not won a Premier League match without Fernandes since March 2022. The sample size is small, yet the record is telling. Six matches, five defeats and one draw. In a squad lacking in character and quality, Fernandes brings both in abundance.",
      "Fernandes' departure would rid United of their one elite player and surely make Old Trafford an even less attractive destination. Liam Delap has already chosen Chelsea over United. Finding adequate replacements is hard enough without Champions League.",
      "Emotionally, in a summer when academy graduates Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho appear set for the chop, on the back of hundreds of redundancies and the worst season for decades, the loss of Fernandes could bring the fanbase to its knees.",
      "In the context of the past year - and the past decade - when the club has been accused of losing touch with its identity, losing Fernandes would make United nearly unrecognisable heading into a summer that could become make or break for INEOS.",
      "If this were another club, it would be easier to predict how they might handle a similar scenario without such a glum outlook. The Philippe Coutinho comparison - although flawed - is an example of how a well-run club can sell a star to improve the collective.",
      "Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker were signed by Liverpool using the £146m fee paid by Barcelona. Their additions proved transformational for Jurgen Klopp, who would win the Champions League and Premier League in the next three years.",
      "Liverpool were further along in their rebuild, but the example offers a blueprint for how United could enjoy a similar transformation if Fernandes leaves. With a goalkeeper, central midfielder and striker dearly needed, £100m could fund a new spine for the team.",
      "Matheus Cunha, undeterred by the lack of European football, is already through the door. If others share his faith in the project remains to be seen, though the signing, sealed on day one of the window, suggests INEOS might be starting to figure things out.",
      "They will hope that is true after spending £200m in their first summer and taking the club from eighth in the table to 15th. Erik ten Hag was still in charge then though and the window had his fingerprints all over it with two more former Ajax players recruited.",
      "Now INEOS have another year under their belt and Amorim in place with a system that he has made clear will not change, the conditions certainly appear more conducive to a better window and the early signs are good.",
      "Cunha, 26, is one of a handful of Premier League-proven players United have signed while in their prime in the post Sir Alex Ferguson era - and if this is a sign of things to come, then INEOS are at least working to right the wrongs of the past.",
      "But funding moves for such players does not come cheap and could be difficult if Fernandes is not sold. Cunha, for instance, was £62.5m. Reports suggest that is more than half of the budget gone without any sales.",
      "If Fernandes stayed, risks would have to be taken on unknown quantities that suit Amorim's system, or he would have to put up with the current crop for longer. For a coach that could quickly come under pressure next season, neither sounds too appealing.",
      "But nor does losing Fernandes, and therein lies the dilemma. United want him to stay, so too does Amorim. The final decision, it seems, lies with Fernandes, who no one could blame for leaving after all he has put up with.",
      "United cannot afford to sell their captain but nor can they afford to turn down Al Hilal's offer."

      "United were booed in parts for their lacklustre display by those in attendance and, reacting to his side's reception in the Malaysian capital, Amorim said: \"I'm always guilty of the performance of the team, no matter what. Since I've been here from the first day, I am guilty. The boos from the fans is something that we need, maybe. Because every game we lost in the Premier League, they [fans] were always there [supporting].",
