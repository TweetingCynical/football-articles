      "Viktor Gyokeres has put Manchester United into pole position for his signature. The Swedish hitman has U-turned on making Arsenal his priority - re-opening the door on a reunion with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, is at the heart of the summer's messiest transfer saga. He is desperate to leave Sporting Lisbon, having scored 54 goals in 52 games last season.",
      "Gyokeres wants to test himself in one of Europe's biggest leagues, but hasn't found clubs rushing to knock down his door. Sporting insist they've not had any offer put their way, while club president Frederico Varandas has accused the player's agent of falsely claiming the club would accept £59million to sell the player as part of a 'gentleman's agreement'.",
      "The Gyokeres camp believe Sporting are asking too much money - with claims they're asking for fees totalling £86m - for a player who has scored 97 goals in 102 games since moving to Portugal from Coventry City two years ago.",
      "As such, there's been a major falling out among the two parties and claims that Gyokeres won't return for pre-season. But Gyokeres isn't getting the interest he perhaps felt he would this summer.",
      "He turned down the prospect of a move to Saudi Arabia last month. Al-Hilal made a £55m offer that was rejected by Sporting, but Gyokeres made clear he had no intention of moving to the Middle East, wanting to continue to compete in Europe.",
      "Real Madrid have made clear they don't want to spend big money to take him to the Bernabeu, as they seek a back up No.9 in the mould of former striker Joselu. Liverpool have been linked in recent days, but the Premier League champions have no interest in the Swede.",
      "Juventus have been linked, but the Italian side aren't flush with cash and no bid has been forthcoming, while Bayern Munich have Harry Kane and Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique isn't keen. Nor is his former club, Barcelona.",
      "That has left Arsenal and Manchester United front and centre, and the belief had been that Gyokeres' No.1 choice was a move to North London. The Gunners can offer Champions League football and a likely title challenge next season.",
      "But while new sporting director Andrea Berta has been testing the waters with the Gyokeres camp and Sporting, Arsenal's preferred No.9 option is RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. A £60m deal is, at this stage, most likely for Arsenal and the RBL forward.",
      "As such, Gyokeres is increasingly aware that his best bet this summer may be to reunite with former boss Amorim and intermediaries have made contact on the player's behalf to signal he is ready to join the Premier League under-performers.",
      "However, he may have to play a waiting game with United too. Matheus Cunha is already through the door at Old Trafford and Bryan Mbeumo is expected next, but United must offload before they can spend big again.",
      "United are open to selling pretty much any member of their first team squad if the right money is offered, but they're particularly keen to quickly get rid of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho - none of whom are part of Amorim's plans. They're hopeful that Real Betis will present an acceptable offer for Antony sooner rather than later too.",
      "Then, United will be back pushing to land the No.9 that has been earmarked after last season's dire campaign. And Gyokeres is finally ready for that to be him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United have been accused of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on sub-standard players and vanity signings that have plunged the fallen giants into their biggest crisis for half a century. United ended last season in 15th place, their worst-ever Premier League finish, and missed out on European football for only the second time in 35 years after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "The Red Devils have spent more than £1.5billion on players in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, yet have failed to compete for the Premier League title in that time and lost their way as a major force in world football.",
      "Money has been wasted on flops like Angel Di Maria, Alexis Sanchez, Morgan Schneiderlin, Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukau, Fred, Donny van de Beek, Jadon Sancho and Antony, none of whom delivered on their exorbitant fees or wages.",
      "United legend Teddy Sheringham, part of the historic Treble-winning side of 1999, accused his former club of losing the values that made the club great – particularly when it comes to the recruitment of players.",
      "“I think United have been valuing the wrong things in players for a long time now,” said Sheringham. “Sir Alex Ferguson, he always identified those deeper qualities in players. Whenever a player with a big upside was available, United and Fergie were in for them.",
      "“I think of the likes of Gary Pallister, Roy Keane, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand and more. They were great players before United and they wanted to sign for United because they knew what the manager could do to make them into top, top players.",
      "“That doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. More and more players recognise that their careers will do better if they go somewhere else.",
      "“If you get great players at an early age, and move them up to the very top of their game, it sets an example that other players want to follow. There’s not enough leaders at Manchester United at the moment. And that’s exactly where they’re failing.”",
      "Sheringham cited Scott McTominay to support his claim, the title-winning Napoli midfielder having just been crowned Serie A player of the season just a year after United sold him to the Italian club.",
      "“I think they knew he was a good player, maybe not to the degree that he’s performed this past season,” said Sheringham, speaking to Racing Tipster. “But let’s have a look at his attitude, his leadership qualities, the way he plays the game and the way he carries himself.",
      "“I thought these qualities were obvious for United and for Scotland. Every time he pulled on the Scotland shirt, you could tell he was a leader - and United fans loved him. He has that British mentality where he knows and understands what it means to play for United, to represent his country and all that.",
      "“The issue with what United did, for me, is that you’ve got to read the signs. They should have rated his leadership qualities, and all the things he brought to the table.",
      "“Okay, I understand that to go and be the player of the year in Italy last season is phenomenal. But the signs were there that he was capable of that. It’s exactly what United have been missing at the moment. He leads by example, and that’s how football clubs get better and stronger.”",

      "Malacia joins Antony, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho in being yet to secure an exit from Old Trafford. The full-back spent the second half of 2024/25 on loan at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "The 25-year-old was the first player to arrive at the club under Erik ten Hag in 2022. After making 39 appearances in his first season with United, Malacia failed to make a single outing in an injury-hit second year and made three Premier League showings before making the move to PSV last term.",
      "Despite making eight appearances as the Dutch side overcame as 12-point gap to win the Eredivisie ahead of Ajax, Malacia is struggling to generate suitors, per the Athletic. There is said to be no firm interest in the player.",
      "United's ability to raise funds is likely to dictate the business the club can conduct to strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad. Malacia would appear to have little room to break into the Red Devils' side after they signed Patrick Dorgu in Janaury.",
      "After joining PSV in January, Malacia appeared to take a dig at Amorim amid United's struggles. The defender noted his happiness to play 'good football again'.",
      "\"I'm happy to be here,\" he said. \"Finally playing good football again.\"",
      "\"I am coming off a long injury, but by now I am fit and know that my time will come again.",

      "Malacia was close to a move to Benfica earlier this year before the deal collapsed. Despite the move looking set to happen, the clubs were unable to come to an agreement over a loan fee and future option to buy.",
      "Dutch outlet Voetbal Verslaafd also claimed that Wolves were interested in the 25-year-old earlier in the year. But Malacia ultimately chose to make the trip to the Netherlands.",

United welcome Mikel Arteta's side – runners'-up in the Premier League last season – at Old Trafford for their opening fixture of the new league campaign .",
      "But United legend Sheringham, who helped the Red Devils to their historic Treble triumph of 1999, fears they could lose by as much as 4-0 to the Gunners, who will be pushing for the title after falling short the past two seasons. Sheringham fears a humiliating loss for Amorim's side on the opening weekend will see the United boss come under immediate pressure and suggested it may be hard for him to turn the situation around.",
      "“United are signing players and getting ready for a much different season this year than last year, but they must have those concerns on their mind at the moment,” said Sheringham. “More so than what Arsenal have on their minds.",
      "“It really is a horrible game for them to start the season. If the result is bad, if the scoreline is bad, things can escalate very quickly over there.",
      "“Everyone’s talking about Arsenal having a big, tough start to the season. First six or seven games, they look really tough. But I think when the fixtures came out, it was United who looked at them and said 'Oh no, Arsenal at home in the first game'.",
      "“You can imagine Arsenal coming up there with all the confidence, all the intent right now. They’ve got the momentum, a good squad. United are still figuring it out under Amorim.",
      "“If Arsenal go up there and roll United over and if they’re comfortable, get an early goal, a second before half-time, maybe even a third or fourth in the second half?",
      "“Arsenal are usually really strong at the start of the season. You’re more likely to get a result if it’s later on and they’re looking over their shoulder a little bit. It’s only one game, but if Arsenal really roll them over, United fans are going to be putting the pressure on Amorim from the get-go.”",
      "Sheringham also said United striker Marcus Rashford is making a big mistake by holding out for a summer move to Barcelona.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, after falling out with Amorim, but Sheringham said going to Barca would send out the wrong message to United and their fans.",
      "“I certainly hope he isn’t,” said Sheringham, speaking to Racing Tipster. “A few years ago, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was seen as the bad apple at Arsenal. Arteta wanted him out and he ended up going to Barcelona. What a move that is, for a bad apple!",
      "“For Rashford to not want to play at United, telling people after he signed a mega-deal that he doesn’t want to play for them, and yet he’s happy to pick up the money. Now he wants to go to Barcelona? It’s like, 'oof!'.",
      "“I really hope it doesn’t happen. That’s not the way football careers should work, for me. If you’re playing well, okay, look at where you can go. See if you can get a move to a team like Barcelona. Try and make yourself even better.",
      "“But not for downing tools and demanding that you get to go somewhere that’s debatably better than how you’re currently playing. That just doesn’t sit well with me. I don’t think Rashford could say that he has played his way into a move to the Camp Nou over the last few years.”",

      "Sporting Lisbon players went from celebrating a vital victory to bursting into tears when Ruben Amorim told them he would be leaving to join Manchester United. Amorim, 40, was appointed as manager of the Red Devils at the start of November, but did not officially start at Old Trafford until 11 days later.",
      "He left a squad who were on their way to their third Primeira Liga title in five seasons and looked set to finish in the top eight of the Champions League division phase. He also said goodbye to a group of players who loved him as a manager and mentor.",
      "This was confirmed by their emotional reaction when he told them he was going to Old Trafford. Sporting star Geny Catamo revealed a huge number of players burst into tears when Amorim informed them of his decision.",
      "In an interview with Bar Da Liga, the Mozambique international said: \"A week before, we were informed Manchester United was interested in our manager. Ruben Amorim only told us that everything was fine and not to worry, we just had to focus on our game in Braga.",
      "\"It was an epic match; losing 2-0 and turning it around to 4-2 in the second half. It was the best football we played all season.",
      "\"We were all celebrating in the locker room when he came in and announced he was indeed going to Manchester United. We were sad and cried. Most players cried. I believe I was one of those who cried the most that day.\"",
      "United forked out £11million to release Amorim from his contract at Sporting. When the news was announced, he remained with the Portuguese side to oversee clashes against Estrela, Manchester City in the Champions League and Braga.",
      "He would go on to mastermind convincing victories in all three matches, that ended 5-1, 4-1 and 4-2 in Sporting's favour. However, while the Sporting stars were devastated to see him leave, Amorim has not formed the same bond with his United players.",
      "In fact, the mood at Old Trafford has been the complete opposite, as United have not improved under his stewardship so far. After taking over from Erik ten Hag, Amorim was only able to guide United to 15th, their lowest position in Premier League history.",
      "Their loss to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final also meant United failed to qualify for European football for the first time since the 2014/15 campaign. While Sporting players were heartbroken when Amorim left, the current crop of United players do not have that same affection for the Portuguese boss, yet.",
      "One of Amorim's first major decisions at Old Trafford was to banish academy graduate Marcus Rashford, by leaving him out of the squad on several occasions before sending him on loan to Aston Villa in the January transfer window. In February, the Mail claimed several United players discussed whether Amorim should change his tactics, with the Portuguese boss insisting on using the same 3-4-3 formation he used at Sporting, for better or for worse.",
      "Moreover, Alejandro Garnacho also looks set to meet the same fate as Rashford. The Argentine winger publicly criticised Amorim after he was left out of the starting eleven for the Europa League final.",
      "Not long after reportedly being told to find a new club by the United boss, Garnacho was recently pictured wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Rashford's name on the back. He has since been linked with moves to Chelsea and Napoli.",

      "The Leicester star has a release clause in his contract after agreeing a new contract following the club's Championship win in 2024. It saw him commit to the club until 2027 but with the caveat he could depart for £9m should Leicester fail to cement their status as a Premier League club.",

Both United and Rashford are on the same page over his departure from the club in the summer transfer window, but the nature of that exit is where the sticking point lies.",
      "Rashford has made it clear that he is keen to join Barcelona ever since concluding a long spell at Aston Villa. While his brief loan spell at Villa ended in injury, Rashford still managed to revitalise his career with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances.",
      "That suited United, who have made it clear that Rashford does not have a future at his boyhood club after a falling out with Ruben Amorim. The 27-year-old has his heart set on a move to Barcelona – and his representatives held talks with the club in late May over the potential move.",
      "However, there are a few difficulties that must be overcome if Rashford is to get his move to Barca. First of all, his £325,000-a-week wages at United, where he is under contract until June 2028, are too steep for Barcelona, who have struggled with La Liga’s financial rules in recent years.",
      "Then there was Barca’s move for Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams, who now looks likely to arrive in a £50million move this summer. Williams – and Barca’s stand-out player last season, Raphinha – play on the left of attack, which is Rashford’s best position.",
      "Barca boss Hansi Flick reportedly believes that, rather than playing off the wing, Rashford could become a back-up to Robert Lewandowski as a No.9. Lewandowski scored 27 La Liga goals to help Barcelona beat Real Madrid to the title season, but will turn 37 in August.",
      "Another problem is outlined by The Times, who report that United want £40m for Rashford, while Barca are preparing to make an offer of a loan deal. His impressive form for Villa has strengthened the club’s resolve that he is worth £40m – and that could scupper a move to the cash-strapped Catalans.",
      "United still have 68 days left until the transfer deadline on September 1, so could draw out the negotiations. But they will be acutely aware that they could accept a loan deal, on the condition that Barca pay Rashford’s wages – a clause that would save them around £17m over a year.",
      "Rashford has been working on his fitness by himself, but has issued a clear plea to Barca. Speaking while on holiday in Marbella, he was asked by Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer whether he wants to play with Barca wonderkid Lamine Yamal in the future.",
      "\"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best,\" the forward replied. \"So hopefully, we'll see.\"",

Big money was spent on Antony, Casemiro and Lisandro Martinez, but these players did not boost United's chances of league glory, and the team ended up finishing third, some 14 points off champions City.",

A year ago, maybe more, I said this kid and Michael Olise – who went to Bayern – United should buy them for £100 million. Put £100m down and you will get two fantastic players.",

Eze has the decision-making, the talent, he’s a good athlete, he can create and score. He’s at the right age to step up and play on a bigger platform. It’s a no-brainer.\"",

      "Manchester United target Moise Kean will need to tread carefully around Ruben Amorim if he joins the Red Devils this summer. Links have emerged this week between the Fiorentina striker and United, who are looking to bolster their attacking options in the transfer window.",
      "Italian outlet La Gazzetta dello Sport reports that Kean has a £44.5million release clause in his Fiorentina contract which becomes active between July 1 and 15. That means, despite having four years left on his deal, the club would have to allow him to leave if another team activates the clause during next month's short window.",
      "That’s provided that he wants to join the Old Trafford side, who finished 15th in the Premier League but managed to reach the Europa League final this season under Amorim. And it would be somewhat of a surprise transfer given Kean’s unsuccessful time in the English top flight previously.",
      "The 25-year-old was disappointing for Everton following his move in 2019, where he scored just twice in 29 league appearances in his debut campaign. The following three seasons saw him go out on loan to Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus, who he joined permanently two years ago.",
      "During his time at Goodison Park, Kean also sparked controversy by holding a party at his house during the coronavirus lockdown in 2020. After being filmed enjoying himself at the gathering, he was fined two weeks’ wages, equating to around £160,000.",
      "His breach of the Covid-19 restrictions were said to have \"appalled\" Everton bosses. And the incident may ring alarm bells in Amorim's head ahead of a potential transfer, given that the Portuguese head coach is a known disciplinarian.",
      "Amorim, during his short time at United, has already shown he does not tolerate a lack of discipline, having taken a firm stance against several players who appear to be on their way out of Carrington.",
      "Marcus Rashford was frozen out of the squad after falling out with Amorim ahead of last December’s Manchester Derby. Alejandro Garnacho was also dropped for the same fixture for showing dissent towards the head coach three days earlier.",
      "With five years passing since Kean’s Everton transgression, however, it is entirely possible that he has matured.",
      "He has certainly been in form since his move to Fiorentina last summer, scoring 25 goals in 44 games across all competitions in his debut campaign and helping the side claim a sixth-place Serie A finish.",
      "Meanwhile, United have already added to Amorim's attacking options this summer. Brazilian Matheus Cunha completed a £62.5m move from Wolves earlier this month. The 26-year-old signed a four-year deal at Old Trafford, beginning what is expected to be a busy summer window.",
      "Amid the recent links with Kean, Amorim’s current strikers are Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee. The pair only managed to score 17 goals between them last season in all competitions.",

      "That was an obvious blow, given Sancho is not in Ruben Amorim’s plans and his £300,000-a-week wages are a drain on their finances. But that disappointment hasn’t lasted long, with Fenerbahce and Juventus emerging as serious contenders for the 25-year-old winger.",
      "Turkish media reported on Tuesday that Sancho had agreed personal terms with Fenerbahce over a summer transfer. While Napoli were reportedly put off by his wage demands, Jose Mourinho’s side are willing to hand him a deal worth €10m (£8.5m) per year.",
      "United are reportedly willing to sell the winger could cost them £73m in 2021 for just €20m (£17m) because he only has a year left on his contract. And now it seems that Juventus are ready to challenge the Turkish club for Sancho.",

The figure is a significant drop on the previous campaign, though there will still be some who expected perfection from the introduction of the new technology.",
      "All 20 clubs in the league voted on keeping VAR ahead of the season, with Wolves the only club to call for it to be scrapped entirely. Despite the league persisting with Video Assistant Referees, there were widespread calls for changes to improve the process.",
      "Premier League clubs made the case for more regular and better training for referees in an effort to improve the current state of play. They also asked for set teams of VAR officials to encourage better understanding between officials, as well as pushing for a drastic cut in delays and better messaging for fans in stadiums, with the latter an oft-repeated concern for match-going fans.",
      "So, about those 18 errors over the course of the 2024-25 season. The Key Match Officials panel comprises former players and/or coaches as well as one representative for the Premier League and one for PGMOL.",
      "The first VAR error took place on the opening weekend of the season. Bournemouth forward Ouattara thought he had scored a late winner, only for the effort to be chalked off for handball.",
      "The KMI panel voted unanimously that VAR got the decision wrong. That extra point for Newcastle was certainly helpful, with Eddie Howe's side ultimately qualifying for the Champions League on goal difference alone, though it's too simplistic to argue a decision on the opening weekend made all the difference.",
      "Another unanimous vote here. Fernandes was shown a straight red card during Manchester United's loss at home to Tottenham in September, with all five panelists believing that to be a mistake.",
      "United trailed 1-0 at the time and went on to lose 3-0. Fernandes' suspension was ultimately overturned on appeal, allowing the Portuguese to return to action.",
      "The KMI panel votes on the referee and the VAR in these instances. As with the Ouattara incident, the panel backed the on-field referee unanimously but went the other way when it came to the VAR intervention.",
      "No penalty was initially awarded after United defender De Ligt challenged Hammers striker Danny Ings late in the second half. A long VAR check saw referee Michael Oliver point to the spot, and Jarrod Bowen converted from 12 yards to win the game for West Ham.",
      "Brentford captain Norgaard was shown a straight red card during the first half of his team's draw at Everton. The Dane stretched for a ball at the back post and ended up connecting with home goalkeeper Jordan Pickford - enough for the VAR to intervene.",
      "This is the first split decision on the list, with the panel explaining (via ESPN): \"The panel were split (3:2), with the majority deeming the on-field decision correct as 'both players are committed to normal footballing actions.' Two panelists deemed the on-field decision incorrect as 'whilst this was a challenge for the ball, there was a high, full and forceful contact with the studs.'\"",
      "Some of the mistakes relate to non-intervention when VAR might have been better placed getting involved. One such instance relates to Maatsen's foul on Ismaila Sarr, with the panel arguing - by split decision - that he should have seen red.",
      "The argument comes down to whether Maatsen denied Sarr a clear goalscoring opportunity. While the on-field referee and VAR official believed there was a covering defender, the panel wasn't so sure.",
      "Not all of the decisions on this list had a huge bearing on the match outcome. Everton were already three goals to the good against Wolves when they benefited from what the panel considers to have been an incorrect call.",
      "Doucoure was ruled not to be interfering while stood in an offside position in the lead-up to a Craig Dawson own goal. Curiously, Everton had earlier seen a goal chalked off for a similar offence but were not punished for a second time.",
      "There was significant late drama when Forest beat Villa in December, with the home side scoring twice in the final five minutes to turn defeat into victory. However, the VAR controversy in the game came early on with the scores still level.",
      "Villa appealed for a penalty as Forest midfielder Anderson pulled back Morgan Rogers, but no spot-kick was forthcoming. The KMI panel argued by a margin of three to two that there was enough holding inside the box to warrant a penalty.",
      "When West Ham and Brighton played out a draw in December, all the drama took place after the break. Mats Wieffer and Mohammed Kudus exchanged goals, while Brighton defender Estupinan risked a late red card for serious foul play.",
      "Neither the on-field ref or the VAR felt the Ecuadorian deserved to be dismissed for his foul on Max Kilman, but the KMI panel didn't see things that way. \"The action of Estupinian has speed, force, intensity and endangers the safety of the opponent,\" they said.",
      "Just one week later, another Brighton player escaped a red card. Joao Pedro flung an elbow at Brentford's Yehor Yarmoliuk but stayed on the field.",
      "The Brazilian made no contact with his opponent, but this doesn't mean he should have escaped dismissal. Indeed, the KMI panel argued unanimously that the officials got it wrong.",
      "After finding themselves on the right end of a VAR penalty mistake in October, West Ham were on the wrong end in December. They might feel it could have made a big difference, too, with a 1-0 deficit growing into a 5-0 defeat after the decision.",
      "Mac Allister threw Carlos Soler to the ground off the ball, with the KMI panel split on the call as some argued it had no impact on play. The defeat ended up being Julen Lopetegui's last game at the London Stadium, with the manager dismissed after a loss at Manchester City a few days later.",
      "After finding themselves the beneficiaries of VAR errors in December, Brighton were on the other end in January. The Seagulls appealed for an early penalty at Ipswich after Burns impeded Jan Paul van Hecke, but didn't get the decision.",
      "Ultimately it didn't matter too much, with Fabian Hurzeler's side going on to win 2-0. Had they failed to find the breakthrough, though, they may well have dwelt on that missed call.",
      "Nottingham Forest's win against Southampton in January was far more tense than it needed to be. Part of that was the hosts seeing a 3-0 lead reduced to 3-2, and part comes down to the disallowed goal which might have stopped that happening.",
      "Milenkovic thought he'd made it 4-1 moments after the Saints' first, only for the goal to be chalked off for offside against team-mate Chris Wood. According to the panel, though, Wood made no impact on an opponent and the goal should have been allowed to stand.",
      "Arsenal youngster Lewis-Skelly received a first-half red card at Molineux after stopping a counter-attack. There were no arguments about him being penalised for his foul on Matt Doherty, but the visitors were shocked by the colour of the card shown to him.",
      "Arsenal still won the game, with Wolves also ending the game with 10 men, and Lewis-Skelly's suspension was later overturned. \"Yeah obviously really happy that the decision has been made and Myles is going to be available for us,\" Gunners boss Mikel Arteta said.",
      "After that January error, we had to wait until April for another VAR decision which the KMI panel felt to be the wrong one. However, it was one of two on the same day.",
      "Brighton youngster Hinshelwood avoided punishment for a foul on Jacob Ramsey, with the panel unanimously arguing Villa should have won a penalty. It didn't impact the final score, with Unai Emery's side going on to win 3-0.",
      "A second VAR mistake on April 2 and a second with a unanimous response from the KMI panel. Everton defender Tarkowski was only shown a yellow card for a foul on Alexis Mac Allister which many at the time felt should have earned him a red.",
      "\"The clear dangerous nature of the challenge is not mitigated by Tarkowski winning the ball first,\" the panel said. \"A clear example of endangering the safety of an opponent.\"",
      "Liverpool suffered just their second league defeat of the season in April when Fulham got the better of them at Craven Cottage. The London side even managed to shake off a controversial decision in which they were denied a penalty.",
      "Reds keeper Kelleher took out Fulham's Andreas Pereira after the Brazilian played the ball across. The Irish international wasn't punished, but it ultimately didn't stop the hosts running out 3-2 winners.",
      "Another moment of Bournemouth controversy after that opening day drama. Once again, Andoni Iraola's side may feel the VAR mistake impacted the result, as they led 1-0 at the time but ended up only drawing.",
      "Evanilson was sent off after a challenge on United's Noussair Mazraoui. He appeared to slip into the challenge, though, and this was cited in the panel's explanation, with the Brazilian's ban ultimately overturned.",
      "We end with relegated Ipswich, who were already down when they got a meaningless let-off against Brentford. Defender Tuanzebe dragged Bees counterpart Nathan Collins to the ground, but no penalty was awarded.",
      "The panel argued the holding between the players was not mutual, with Tuanzebe holding his opponent with both arms. The decision has no bearing on the result, with Brentford 1-0 up at the time and winning by the same scoreline.",
      "Brentford suffered the most from those incorrect decisions, finding themselves on the wrong end on three occasions and not benefiting from a mistake even once. At the other end of the scale are Everton, who gained on three occasions and lost out on none.",
      "ESPN also looked at the biggest beneficiaries of VAR decisions - not just those errors listed above - over the course of the season. Newcastle are out in front in that field, with 13 decisions in favour and just four against, with Bournemouth at the other end after four decisions in their favour and 11 against.",
      "Three teams - Chelsea, Leicester and Manchester City - were involved in no VAR errors all season long. In fact, City only had four VAR interventions in their games in total - three in their favour and one against.",

      "After wrapping up the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves exactly a fortnight ago, United are now closing in on the signing of Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It is understood a deal is edging closer towards being finalised after United submitted a new and improved offer in excess of £60m earlier this week. Barring any late snags or hiccups, he will become the club's second signing of the summer.",
      "United went into this summer's window with no choice but loosen their purse strings after a forgettable 2024/25 campaign marked their worst season in 51 years. However, few anticipated they would be as ambitious as they have been in the opening weeks of the window.",
      "United announced they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Cunha just 14 hours after the transfer window had opened on June 1, ensuring they put down an early marker, and now they are closing in on the signing of Mbeumo less than four weeks later.",
      "Defeat in Bilbao was supposedly going to hinder United's ability in this summer's transfer window. Instead, it has given them the jolt they needed.",
      "It goes without saying that two signings won't be enough for United this summer, and they will need to bring in more faces once they flex their muscles in the seller's market, but to have Cunha and potentially Mbeumo through the door by the end of June is admirable.",
      "United finished last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10, meaning they needed to commit funds to strengthening their attacking department. After missing out on Champions League qualification, it felt as though attracting big-name players would be a struggle.",
      "However, United have been reminded by both Cunha and Mbeumo that they will always be a powerhouse. Cunha had his heart set on a move to Old Trafford for months and Mbeumo has followed suit by prioritising a move to M16 over Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "The elephant in the room, however, is that once the deal to bring Mbeumo to Old Trafford gets over the line, United will have spent north of £120m on the duo. Considering sales are expected to dictate what is possible for United this summer, the Reds have certainly shown plenty of ambition early on amid the fact they are yet to oversee a single outgoing.",
      "Cunha is the first signing of the Ineos era to have cost more than £60m. United brought in five new signings last summer and Leny Yoro was the most expensive addition at a base price of £52.2m.",
      "After years of being taken for a ride in the market, United have become a little bit wiser under Ineos' governance, refusing to pay over the odds. Sir Jim Ratcliffe admitted last year that he would prefer to discover a hidden gem \"rather than spend a fortune just trying to buy success\".",
      "You could argue Ratcliffe has contradicted himself by allowing United to sign Cunha for £62.5m and lodge a bid worth more than £60m for Mbeumo. However, every club that shares the same ambitions as United has to splash the cash every once in a while to strengthen their squad.",
      "United will be unable to preside over many more £60m-plus deals this summer. In fact, they may not be able to preside over another if they are unable to offload the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Nevertheless, they have made an exception to their own rule to get Cunha through the door and attempt to sign Mbeumo, and it does make sense this time around. Their attack was in a sorry state last season and they could not afford to do nothing about it this summer.",
      "Cunha scored 17 goals last season across all competitions, and Mbeumo plundered 20 in the Premier League. Between them, their tally of 35 in the league was only nine fewer than what United scored as a collective.",
      "With that in mind, United are right to have settled on them as two of their priority targets. There is no guarantee they will be successes at Old Trafford just in the same way no managerial appointment is ever guaranteed to pay off.",
      "But in choosing to try and recruit two attackers with Premier League pedigree, United are trying to make up for last season's failings in the best possible way."

      "After Manchester United lost last month's Europa League final in Bilbao, supporters would have been forgiven for feeling somewhat deflated heading into this summer's transfer window.",
      "United's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham spelt the end of their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League. It means they will be absent from Europe for the first time since the 2014/15 campaign next term.",
      "Despite that, United have started this summer's transfer window on the front foot. After wrapping up the signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha earlier this month, they are now closing in on Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After tabling a second offer in excess of £60million earlier this week, it is understood United are now making progress in their attempts to bring him to M16. The club hope to have him signed ahead of pre-season starting in just under a fortnight's time.",
      "Mbeumo was nothing short of outstanding for Brentford last term, scoring 20 Premier League goals. He also contributed seven assists.",
      "Although United have attempted to distance themselves from paying north of £60m for players under Ineos, they have made an exception to their own transfer rule with the addition of Cunha for £62.5m and their pursuit of Mbeumo.",
      "However, the duo, who scored 35 Premier League goals between them last season, are Premier League proven and will slot straight into Ruben Amorim's first-choice starting XI. Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 berth but where Amorim sees Mbeumo's natural habitat at Old Trafford remains to be seen.",
      "Whether he starts as a No.10 or at wing-back, Amad will almost certainly fill the role Mbeumo does not. The Ivorian should be one of the very first names on the teamsheet next term after a very encouraging 2024/25 campaign.",
      "United had to prioritise strengthening their attack this summer and getting a deal over the line for Cunha nice and early was a solid start. The prospect of also having Mbeumo in the building by the start of pre-season would represent an excellent start.",
      "However, United are yet to lay their hands on a striker. Their hopes of signing Liam Delap were scuppered by Chelsea and it remains to be seen who they will turn to in their quest for a No.9. The addition of a striker will be the last piece to add to their attacking jigsaw.",
      "Currently well-stocked at centre-back, defensive reinforcements are not required this summer unless something drastic changes. In midfield, however, there is a hunger to strengthen.",
      "Amorim wants to add a new central midfielder of an athletic profile. Bruno Fernandes is expected to become a long-term operator in one of the two No.8 positions, meaning he could be in need of a new partner.",
      "Manuel Ugarte experienced an up and down first season at United and his ability on the ball has been questioned in recent months. In an ideal situation, United need to strike a fine balance between being defensively sound and good on the ball.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo flittered between midfield and the No.10 positions last season, suggesting Amorim is yet to decide on his long-term role. The England international likes to play on the front foot and progress the ball, meaning he is not necessarily the right partner for Fernandes in a midfield two.",
      "The additions of a striker and a midfielder will be United's top priorities once Mbeumo is in the building, but sales will be key to ensuring those deals can be completed.",
      "But with the window still open for another nine-and-a-half weeks, there is plenty of time for Amorim's dream XI to come to fruition."

      "It will have a catastrophic effect on their playing squad, too, with clubs now monitoring their best players in case they are relegated from the French top flight.",

      "The 24-year-old scored 17 goals in all competitions last season - which is the same number as Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee managed combined - and added a further 11 assists.",
      "Mikautadze plays mainly as a centre-forward but can also play as a 10 or on the wing, giving him the versatility that United CEO Omar Berrada has said the club are looking for with any new recruits.",
      "He still has three years remaining on his contract with Lyon but should their relegation to Ligue 2 be confirmed it will likely spark a mass exodus of their top talent.",

      "Now, talkSPORT reporter Alex Crook has claimed that Mbeumo's move to United is on the verge of completion, despite rumours claiming that Tottenham are planning to hijack the move.",
      "Football Insider claim Man United-linked Emi Martinez has his 'heart set' on a move to Atletico Madrid.",
      "As a result, they are said to have turned to Lille shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier and are 'weighing up' a move for the Frenchman. The report notes that he is valued at around £40m.",
      "Lindelof says he will always continue supporting Man United after leaving the club this summer.",
      "\"A perfect ending,\" Lindelof told MUTV. \"Clean sheet and a win, so it was a great ending. To spend it with my family here [on the pitch afterwards], as well, was special. So, yeah, I couldn't have asked for a better ending.",
      "\"Yeah, I am proud of myself,\" the defender continued. \"It's been a lot of ups and downs. \"But I mean, for me to be able to represent this club for eight years, it's been an honour and a privilege, and a dream come true.\"",
      "The defender's next steps remain uncertain, but he will continue to support United as a fan. \"I'm leaving as a player, but I will always be a fan,\" the defender stated.",
      "\"I wish nothing but the best for the guys and everyone around the club. Yeah, hopefully next season will be a little better than this one. I'm very sure it's going to be.\""

      "It might not feel like it but the new Premier League season is just 50 days away.",
      "It represents a fresh start for Manchester United after the domestic woes of the 2024-25 campaign. The Reds finished a dismal 15th in the table and missed the chance to save their season when losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United have set a target of being a top six side next term and Ruben Amorim knows a strong start is crucial as he prepares for his first full season in charge.",
      "The Reds have acted swiftly in the transfer market to sign Mathues Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million and are set to complete a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo in the coming days.",
      "That would take spending past the £120m mark and United will then turn their attention to sales as they seek to offload unwanted quartet Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Shifting those four on, and recouping significant income, will help United's quest to sign a new centre forward while the Reds may look at other areas of the squad ahead of the window closing on September 1.",
      "We take a look at three key aspects of the next seven weeks.",
      "Getting Mbeumo over the line in time for the start of pre-season would be a significant step for United.",
      "Having him and Cunha in the building early allows the maximum time possible to integrate them into the squad and for Amorim to plot a path for both in the first team.",
      "The duo seem set to occupy the two number 10 roles but that has a knock-on impact elsewhere and having a full summer to fine tune the line-up would be a real positive for the Reds boss.",
      "United have made it clear they want to shift four first teamers.",
      "Rashford, Sancho, Antony and Garnacho have no future at Old Trafford but moving them on, and achieving the desired fees, is easier said than done.",
      "Garnacho has admirers and his ability and talent mean plenty would be willing to pay for his services, while Rashford and Antony enjoyed productive loan spells in the second half of last season that have created something of a market for the pair.",
      "Chelsea opted not to turn Sancho's loan permanent and he is being linked with a move to Turkey.",
      "The issue for United is they are in a weak bargaining position with everyone fully aware they are desperate to offload. That makes driving the price up with potential suitors difficult. How much United are able to rake in from the four could go a long way to defining the success of the summer.",
      "Amorim will be keen to maximise pre-season with his squad to fine tune his style and tactics with the volume of games last season offering precious little time on the training pitch.",
      "United are now set for a first pre-season under the Portuguese coach while the absence of European football could prove a blessing in disguise if it allows Amorim and his coaching staff time to get their methods implented.",
      "Deals for Cunha and Mbuemo would reshape the squad and leave United pretty close to an XI Amorim would want. There remain a couple of gaps in the squad but there is plenty to work with and plenty of time to work."

      "Were Barcelona to act on their interest in Manchester United's Marcus Rashford, all three parties involved can look forward to the dream scenario developing quickly.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs may have hoped Aston Villa would be the ones to eliminate an issue before it sprung, though the Premier League rivals have not taken up their £40m option to sign Rashford at the end of his recent short-term loan. Therefore a new home will have to be found for the 27-year-old who has been out of Ruben Amorim's plans since last December.",
      "Barca sporting director Deco has already openly discussed their interest with the summer transfer window in play, now the latest rumour is of a loan deal for the season ahead.",
      "It might not fetch Man United a fee right away, though the La Liga champions have actually just confirmed their latest major financial boost - one that could help shift Rashford on for good at a later date.",
      "On Wednesday, it was announced Sunday, August 10 will be the date that Barca return to playing home matches at the Spotify Camp Nou. The iconic stadium has been through a £1.25bn restoration project that meant the club have been forced to play elsewhere over the past two seasons.",
      "Originally with capacity of 99,000, the Spanish side moved from Camp Nou to their temporary home at the city's former Olympic Stadium, which holds a reduced 60,000. Their renovated stadium is aiming to house 105,000 - the largest football venue in Europe.",
      "Revenue from ticket sales and all fees supporters are charged with around the match-going experience will serve to drastically increase Barca's income over a period of time and put them in a much more secure financial position to go out to sign their top targets at will.",
      "In Rashford's case, even if just a loan now it will be a dream come true, or so it is said, for him to be a part of a new era with the five-time Champions League winners.",
      "Barca get what they desire most - added depth amongst their pool of wingers - and for Man United it is an opportunity to get a player off the books again for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "If they offer the La Liga club the same £40m option that Villa were handed, only for next summer's transfer window, they could at least land the fee they have been asking for all this time Rashford has been out of the fold at his boyhood club.",
      "A win, win, win scenario."

      "Manchester United have been busy in the summer transfer window with Matheus Cunha through the door and Bryan Mbeumo edging closer to joining him.",
      "The double signing will see United's spending surpass the £120million mark, something that seemed very far-fetched following their Europa League final defeat to Tottenham at the end of May.",
      "United have been forced to splash the cash in the early stages of the transfer window after recording their worst season in 51 years, consequently missing out on European football for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Once Mbeumo comes through the door, United will have to place their focus in balancing pursuing more targets and selling players. Some big names could depart Old Trafford this summer but there are doubts over their ability to offload unwanted players such as Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho.",
      "Casemiro is another player who had seemed to be up for sale but the defensive midfielder enjoyed a resurgence under Ruben Amorim in the second half of last season. However, reports from Saudi Arabia this week have claimed that the Brazilian is close to joining Al-Nassr this summer.",
      "Those reports have gone quiet in the last few days but news of Cristiano Ronaldo's contract extension at the club could accelerate a move. The 40-year-old has agreed a new two-year deal at Al-Nassr, ending speculation about his departure.",
      "According to journalist Santi Aouna, the former United forward has received guarantees from the country's Public Investment Fund to build a competitive team with Ronaldo set to be a 'main decision-maker' in Al-Nassr's squad building.",
      "The journalist has also claimed that Faris Najd wants to sign a new centre-back, defensive midfielder and left winger, at the very least, this summer. After playing with Casemiro previously at United and Real Madrid, Ronaldo could be the key dictator in a third reunion with the Brazilian this summer.",
      "Casemiro isn't expected to bring in a hefty transfer fee that the likes of Garnacho and Antony are valued at, but his reported £375,000-per-week wages being removed from United's wage budget would see a whopping £19.5m saved.",
      "A recent report from The Times has claimed that United will be in the market for a striker, a wing-back, a midfielder and a goalkeeper once Mbeumo signs."

      "Before Manchester United had even unveiled Ruben Amorim as their new head coach last November, almost all the conversation was about his preferred 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United identified Amorim as their first-choice candidate to replace Erik ten Hag and moved at speed to extract him from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Much of Amorim's success in Portugal stemmed from his unique system. With United in desperate need of new ideas, it was inevitable they would transition to a three-at-the-back formation.",
      "Indeed, Amorim confirmed what everyone anticipated when he set up with a back three for his first game in charge against Ipswich Town at Portman Road.",
      "The system means width is provided by the wing-backs, who are responsible for being equally comfortably defensively and offensively. Amad and Diogo Dalot were the first to be tasked with that role.",
      "Eight months on, Patrick Dorgu looks set to go into next season as United's first choice left wing-back. Amad will face competition from Noussair Mazraoui, Dalot and potentially Bryan Mbeumo on the opposite flank.",
      "Prior to Amorim's appointment, Amad was considered as a natural winger; he is now considered as a wing-back or a No.10. He is equally effective in either role.",
      "Amad's adaptability to Amorim's 3-4-2-1 has been admirable. He is the only member of United's pool of wingers from the beginning of last season that is guaranteed to still be at the club come the start of next term.",
      "United are prioritising the sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony this summer and are also open to selling Alejandro Garnacho at the right price. None of them fit into Amorim's system.",
      "Rashford, Sancho and Antony all spent time out on loan last season and United hope to sell each of them on a permanent basis. Rashford is valued at £40million, Antony is available for £32.58m and Sancho is expected to command a fee in the region of £20m.",
      "Garnacho, who was the subject of a £40m offer from Napoli in January, is set to command a fee north of £50m, meaning United could find themselves banking a healthy sum of money for four players that do not fit into Amorim's system.",
      "United need to raise funds via players sales to bring in new recruits this summer and they are trying to use their natural wingers as sources of revenue. There is value and logic in attempting to offload players who simply do not fit into Amorim's system.",
      "As chief executive Omar Berrada explained back in March, United will only commit to sales this summer that will benefit the team.",
      "\"We need to be cautious and, and we need to try to make as many good decisions as we can in recruitment,\" said Berrada. \"And also when it comes to sales, we will do it purely on the basis of whether it helps improve the team or not, not for financial reasons.\"",
      "Rashford and Garnacho rank as two of the most sellable assets within the squad, but United would not be actively looking to sell them this summer if they had important roles to play.",
      "By attempting to sell them, plus Sancho and Antony, United's hierarchy are in full support of Amorim. They are also showing they are in full support of his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "On the flip side, if United experience a rocky start to next season and feel they have no choice but to sack Amorim in search of an upturn in results, they may feel obliged to recruit a replacement well-versed in a three-at-the-back formation.",
      "United are in need of a sense of stability and supporters are fully behind Amorim, confident he will turn the club's fortunes around after a first summer transfer window at the helm.",
      "With the sales of wingers being prioritised, it shows that United's hierarchy are in full support of Amorim and his philosophy."

      "It was noticeable during Omar Berrada's first summer as Manchester United chief executive that the club never broke the £60million barrier for a signing.",
      "For years, Berrada's former employers at Manchester City privately bragged that they seldom spent more than £60m on a player. Jose Mourinho felt he was on a hiding to nothing against a state-backed club but it was a matter of quality more than quantity with City.",
      "To date, City have spent in excess of that figure on only four players: Rodri, Ruben Dias, Jack Grealish and Josko Gvardiol. Grealish is the sole failure and his best season still coincided with City's treble triumph.",
      "Leny Yoro was United's most expensive acquisition last year for an up front fee of £52.18m. The deal could total £58.91m.",
      "Already this summer, United have crept above the £60m mark for Matheus Cunha, who had a reasonable release clause of £62.5m. Bryan Mbeumo, who outscored Cunha and everyone else in the Premier League bar Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Mohamed Salah, could fetch an identical fee.",
      "That is the going rate for a Premier League-standard forward. Only one of United's five arrivals last year was an attacker and Joshua Zirkzee also had a release clause. He was based in Italy, whose league has been in decline for nearly two decades and has become a dumping ground for English clubs. Ie. not United material but nearly as economical as Jasprit Bumrah's bowling.",
      "Sensibly, United have sought forwards with Premier League pedigree this year. Liam Delap was another they wanted on board and the eventual identity of their new No.9 (to consider Cunha or Mbeumo as one would be a complete cop-out) will be curious as it is unlikely to be a domestic deal.",
      "Before he purged his Twitter account, Berrada revelled in how much United had overpaid for Angel di Maria in 2014. Di Maria, a reigning Champions League winner who had recently helped Argentina to reach the World Cup final, commanded a British-record £59.7m fee.",
      "The problem with Di Maria was not the fee but the fact that he did not want to move to Manchester. United had a free run as Paris Saint-Germain, Di Maria's preferred choice, were out of the running due to financial fair play issues.",
      "Di Maria effectively covered the cost of James Rodriguez, Madrid's vanity signing. They still had change to get Toni Kroos, possibly the bargain of the decade, at £20m.",
      "Ed Woodward had also incepted the United tax by signing Marouane Fellaini for £4.5m more than was necessary in 2013. Back when FFP was not an issue for United and profitability and sustainability rules had not entered the football lexicon, Woodward operated as though spending inflated fees was a sound strategy. Luke Shaw became football's most expensive teenager two months before Di Maria was driven through the barriers at Carrington.",
      "Erik ten Hag aimed high in the Premier League market and the price was not right for United. They were not in the running when Declan Rice was available in 2023, having already earmarked Mason Mount as their central midfield target, and refused to test the waters with Tottenham for Harry Kane.",
      "Those two England internationals cost £187m combined when they moved to Arsenal and Bayern Munich. The negotiations of those deals involved 'big six' clubs, whereas Cunha and Mbeumo are more affordable, having operated outside of the elite, and are not England internationals.",
      "Brentford were looking for between £50m and £60m for Ivan Toney last year until it transpired that no Premier League clubs would meet them at the table. That drove his price down to £40m for Al Ahli. Mbeumo, in contrast, generated interest from Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United and outperformed any of Toney's top-flight campaigns before he decided on United. So he was never going to be as cheap.",
      "£60m is a figure that came to define United's 2023 summer window, one of their worst. Everyone at the club maintained that was the maximum they would pay for Rasmus Hojlund. Eventually, they overpaid with a final package of £72m.",
      "On the eve of the 2024 window, Berrada warned United would be on a \"slippery slope\" if they overpaid clubs, players and agents. Their spending was more disciplined, even if it eventually totalled £206m, but this year it is needs must after United's worst season in 51 years. A little more than £120m for two of the best forwards in the Premier League last season is a statement.",
      "United have made savings through their existence outside of the Champions League. For the third season out of four, players will be on a reduced salary due to their failure to qualify for the competition again.",
      "Two rounds of redundancies and slashing the non-playing workforce by roughly a third have also freed up funds after a decrease of £20m year-on-year on employee benefit expenses. United's net cash inflow of £22.3m during the last quarter was an increase of £7.2m from the same quarter last year.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's remark that United could have gone \"bust\" by Christmas always sounded like scaremongering. PSR has genuinely compromised them (they loaned in Wout Weghorst as Cristiano Ronaldo's mid-season replacement when Cody Gakpo was available), only it was undermined by squandering £625.43m under Ten Hag.",
      "United's market movement under Berrada has been hitherto inoffensive but the greater the price, the greater the scrutiny. And United are now going north of £60m."

      "Despite already strengthening their attack with the addition of Matheus Cunha, United are determined to bring Mbeumo to Old Trafford after he scored 20 Premier League goals last season. The Cameroonian has informed confidants of his desire to move to M16.",
      "Only three players scored more Premier League goals than Mbeumo last term, meaning he would be a statement signing if United were to get a deal over the line.",
      "If United are successful in their efforts, Mbeumo will become another significant cog in United's attack. They have already added to Ruben Amorim's pool of attacking options this summer by signing Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "United have prioritised strengthening their attacking department this summer after finishing with a goal difference of -10 in the Premier League last season. They also recorded a minus tally in 2023/24.",
      "Although Cunha and potentially Mbeumo will add goals and assists to United's attack, they are determined to sign a striker. However, after missing out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, it remains to be seen in which direction their search for a goal-getter will head in.",
      "A cluster of strikers are continuing to be linked with moves to M16, such as Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen, but any hopes of United signing a striker of their quality will rest on outgoings. They are yet to oversee a sale this summer.",
      "Doubts have also been shared about Manuel Ugarte's ability on the ball. Amid the likelihood of Cunha becoming United's left-sided No.10 next term, Bruno Fernandes is expected to occupy one of the two central midfield positions, meaning the club is expected to be looking for an ideal midfield partner for him.",
      "Following the club's decision to give Tom Heaton a new deal and the fact Onana is preparing for the new campaign under the assumption of remaining United's No.1, Altay Bayindir is the most likely to exit the goalkeeping department, meaning any incoming will most likely become Onana's deputy.",
      "Elsewhere, the addition of a specialist right wing-back has not been fully dismissed, but Mbeumo could also offer Amorim an option out wide if he arrives from Brentford."

      "The Premier League's Key Match Incidents panel has pinpointed 18 VAR errors throughout the 2024-25 season, marking an improvement on the previous year.",
      "All 20 clubs in the league cast their votes on retaining VAR ahead of the season, with Wolves being the sole club advocating for its complete removal. Despite the league's decision to continue with Video Assistant Referees, there were widespread appeals for modifications to enhance the process.",
      "Premier League clubs argued for more frequent and improved training for referees to better the current state of play. They also requested for fixed teams of VAR officials to foster better understanding among officials, as well as advocating for a drastic reduction in delays and improved communication for fans in stadiums, with the latter being a recurring concern for match-going supporters.",
      "The Key Match Officials panel consists of former players and/or coaches, along with one representative each from the Premier League and PGMOL.",
      "ESPN has highlighted the errors identified by the panel over the course of the most recent Premier League season. Here's some further insight into the mistakes - as well as which clubs were affected most.",
      "The first VAR error occurred on the season's opening weekend. Bournemouth striker Ouattara believed he had netted a late winner, only for it to be disallowed due to handball.",
      "The KMI panel unanimously agreed that VAR made an incorrect decision. That extra point for Newcastle proved beneficial, as Eddie Howe's team qualified for the Champions League based solely on goal difference, although it's overly simplistic to claim that a decision on the opening weekend was the deciding factor.",
      "Another unanimous vote here. Fernandes received a straight red card during Manchester United's home defeat to Tottenham in September, with all five panellists deeming it a mistake.",
      "United were 1-0 down at the time and ended up losing 3-0. Fernandes' suspension was eventually overturned on appeal.",
      "The KMI panel votes on both the referee and the VAR in these cases. As with the Ouattara incident, the panel unanimously supported the on-field referee but disagreed with the VAR intervention.",
      "Initially, no penalty was given after United defender De Ligt tackled West Ham forward Danny Ings late in the second half. A lengthy VAR review led referee Michael Oliver to award a penalty, which Jarrod Bowen successfully converted from 12 yards to secure the win for West Ham.",
      "Brentford skipper Norgaard was sent off in the first half of their stalemate at Everton after a challenge on goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, which led to VAR stepping in.",
      "The decision was contentious, with ESPN reporting that the panel was divided (3:2), stating: \"The panel were split (3:2), with the majority deeming the on-field decision correct as 'both players are committed to normal footballing actions.' Two panelists deemed the on-field decision incorrect as 'whilst this was a challenge for the ball, there was a high, full and forceful contact with the studs.'\".",
      "VAR's hesitance to intervene has also been questioned, particularly regarding Maatsen's tackle on Ismaila Sarr, which some argue warranted a red card.",
      "The debate hinges on whether Maatsen's foul on Sarr prevented a clear scoring chance. Despite the referee and VAR not finding sufficient evidence of this, the panel remained unconvinced.",
      "Not every controversial decision had a significant impact on the game's result. In the match where Everton dominated Wolves with a three-goal lead, the panel still found fault with what they considered an erroneous call.",
      "Doucoure was deemed not to be interfering with play while in an offside position in the build-up to a Craig Dawson own goal. Interestingly, Everton had a goal disallowed for a similar offence earlier in the match, but were not penalised on this occasion.",
      "The match between Forest and Villa in December saw late drama, with the home side scoring twice in the final five minutes to turn defeat into victory. However, the VAR controversy occurred early on, with the scores still level.",
      "Villa appealed for a penalty as Forest's Anderson pulled back Morgan Rogers, but it was not awarded. The KMI panel argued, with a 3-2 majority, that there was sufficient holding in the box to warrant a penalty.",
      "The match between West Ham and Brighton in December saw all the drama unfold after half-time. Mats Wieffer and Mohammed Kudus scored, while Brighton's Estupinan risked a late red card for serious foul play.",
      "Neither the on-field referee nor the VAR felt the Ecuadorian deserved to be dismissed for his foul on Max Kilman, but the KMI panel disagreed. \"The action of Estupinian has speed, force, intensity and endangers the safety of the opponent,\" they stated.",
      "Just a week later, another Brighton player avoided a red card. Joao Pedro threw an elbow at Brentford's Yehor Yarmoliuk but remained on the pitch.",
      "Despite making no contact with his opponent, the Brazilian should not have avoided a red card, according to the KMI panel, who unanimously agreed that the officials made an error.",
      "In December, West Ham found themselves on the wrong end of a VAR penalty mistake, having previously benefited from one in October. The Hammers may feel this could have significantly impacted the game, as their 1-0 deficit ballooned into a 5-0 loss following the decision.",
      "Mac Allister was seen throwing Carlos Soler to the ground off the ball, leading to a split decision among the KMI panel, with some arguing it had no impact on play. This defeat marked Julen Lopetegui's final match at the London Stadium, as he was sacked following a loss to Manchester City days later.",
      "Brighton, who had previously benefited from VAR errors in December, found themselves on the receiving end in January. The Seagulls appealed for an early penalty at Ipswich after Burns obstructed Jan Paul van Hecke, but the appeal was dismissed.",
      "Ultimately, it didn't make much difference, as Fabian Hurzeler's side went on to secure a 2-0 victory.",
      "Nottingham Forest's encounter with Southampton in January proved a nail-biter when it really shouldn't have. A comfortable 3-0 advantage was unnervingly slashed to 3-2, in part due to the controversy surrounding a disallowed goal which potentially could have halted Southampton's comeback.",
      "Milenkovic was under the impression he had extended the lead to 4-1 just after Saints' initial strike, only to see his effort ruled out for an offside decision against his colleague Chris Wood. The expert panel, nevertheless, agreed that Wood did not interfere with play and the goal should have stood.",
      "In the Wolves vs Arsenal clash, Myles Lewis-Skelly was shown a red card before the break at Molineux for halting a counter. There was little dispute over the foul on Matt Doherty warranting action, yet the severity of the card caught Arsenal off guard.",
      "Despite being a player down, Arsenal clinched victory, and Wolves concluded the match similarly handicapped, seeing one of their own dismissed. Following a review, Lewis-Skelly's red card was rescinded.",
      "\"Yeah obviously really happy that the decision has been made and Myles is going to be available for us,\" said Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta.",
      "It wasn't until April, after these contentious January moments, that another dubious VAR outcome emerged, as acknowledged by the KMI panel. However, this instance marked the first of two contentious calls made on that same day.",
      "Hinshelwood's challenge on Jacob Ramsey was overlooked by officials, and despite Villa claiming it was a clear penalty, they won the game 3-0.",
      "James Tarkowski was only booked for a contentious tackle on Alexis Mac Allister. The KMI panel unanimously agreed that despite winning the ball first, the dangerousness of Tarkowski's action warranted a red card, stating: \"The clear dangerous nature of the challenge is not mitigated by Tarkowski winning the ball first,\" and identified it as \"A clear example of endangering the safety of an opponent.\"",
      "Fulham, hosting Liverpool at Craven Cottage, won 3-2, marking just the second league defeat for the Reds this season in April. Fulham managed to overcome being denied a valid penalty when Liverpool's goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher fouled Andreas Pereira without receiving any consequence.",
      "United's game with Bournemouth also saw VAR controversy. The game ended in a draw after the home side had led, even though Evanilson's red card stirred debate over referee decisions once again.",
      "Evanilson was shown the red card following a tackle on United's Noussair Mazraoui. However, it seemed he slipped into the challenge, a point noted in the panel's explanation, leading to the Brazilian's ban being ultimately rescinded.",
      "Our list concludes with relegated Ipswich, who were already relegated when they received an inconsequential reprieve against Brentford. Defender Tuanzebe pulled Bees' Nathan Collins to the turf, but no penalty was given.",
      "The panel contended that the grappling between the players was not mutual, with Tuanzebe clutching his opponent with both arms. The decision had no impact on the outcome, as Brentford were 1-0 up at the time and won by the same margin.",
      "So, who benefited the most... and who suffered.",
      "Brentford bore the brunt of these incorrect decisions, finding themselves on the losing side three times without benefiting from a mistake even once. On the flip side are Everton, who profited three times without any losses.",
      "ESPN also examined the biggest beneficiaries of VAR decisions - not just the errors listed above - throughout the season. Newcastle lead the pack in this regard, with 13 decisions in their favour and only four against, while Bournemouth are at the opposite end with four decisions for them and 11 against.",
      "Three teams - Chelsea, Leicester and Manchester City - experienced no VAR errors throughout the entire season. In fact, City only had four VAR interventions in their matches all season - three in their favour and one against."

      "Onana is under contract at United until 2028 and the club would require a fee of £28.32million to sell him without making a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",

      "",
      "10) Burnley – £49.27m\nThere has been a slew of converted loans and then the first ‘new’ signing has arrived in the form of goalkeeper Max Weiss, perhaps precipitating James Trafford’s move to Newcastle. Quickly followed by the improbably named Quilindschy Hartman.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",

      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund – £52.48m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could add Jason Sancho.",

      "",
      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £62.5m\nThey have completed the most expensive transfer of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. We’re not sure where all this money is coming from…",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea – £99.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £100.5m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £196m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m."

      "England were a lot of things at Euro 2024 but spectacular wasn’t one of them. Reaching the final and getting within five minutes of winning the trophy speaks for itself and the Three Lions, gradually, found their way after a dull start. They were never exciting. They just found their way.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo was a big part of that small improvement. He barely played in a group stage that was worryingly tame but started all four matches of a more controlled, more effective knock-out phase.",
      "Mainoo turned 20 in April. He’s proven his worth in an England shirt. He’s a Stockport-born United academy graduate with 50 Premier League appearances under his belt. That his future isn’t completely certain this summer is an indictment not only of the club, but of football’s financial governance.",
      "Specifically, it highlights the flaws in football’s financial governance frameworks. In the Premier League, profit and sustainability rules (PSR) allow clubs to make a £105m loss in any given three-year period.",
      "Because teams are on an endless quest for improvement on the pitch, players need to be bought and sold. In the PSR era, those sales are increasingly coming from the ‘Do Not Sell’ pile.",
      "Profit from sales is booked immediately and transfer fees are amortised over the lengths of the players’ contracts. Clubs sell players with value to pay down their losses and replace them with expensive successors, whose futures will be subject to the same calculations down the line.",
      "United themselves are pertinent to the PSR debate – if debts aren’t part of the calculation and clubs have to sell players against their wishes on June 30 only to buy someone more expensive on July 1 to comply with allowable losses, is it really doing its job? – but the basic fact of the matter is this: Manchester United shouldn’t be considering the sale of Mainoo in a million months of Super Sundays.",
      "And yet they might. It’s the same with Alejandro Garnacho, albeit the winger’s departure would be welcomed more positively given his penchant for bridge-burning.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho did not command transfer fees on the way in but would on the way out, and that helps United equip Ruben Amorim with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Liverpool up to fifth in Premier League net spend table over the last five years\n👉 Wirtz, Delap, Cunha: Top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Man Utd boost as Gyokeres alternative Wilcox ‘appreciates’ reveals Red Devils ‘dream’",
      "Mainoo has been forced out of the spotlight through a lot of injury and a little under-use since shining in the latter stages of the European Championship. He started exactly half of United’s Premier League matches in 2024/25, five fewer than the previous season which he began injured.",
      "He might even have been slightly forgotten by the most casual football supporters beyond the ranks of Red Devils but he’s still an exciting prospect who will be looking ahead to 2025/26 with hopes of getting his fitness back on track.",
      "There have been reports that Mainoo’s wage demands could be a factor in his club’s calculation. His contract expires in two years; a decision would be made soon at a smart club and might be made soon at United too.",
      "His coaches speak of maturity, physical strength and imagination on the ball. Even at 20, his one-on-one skills are beyond doubt, proven at the highest level. Mainoo has the mentality and ability to be a part of what United need to become.",
      "Manchester United have been a dominant commercial force in football for decades. They’ve taken their brand, their sponsorship appeal, their global fandom, and turned it into varying degrees of success.",
      "They’re a colossus – a shadow of their despised and dastardly dominance nowadays, maybe, but they’re not wiped out on the mat just yet.",
      "United don’t just buy great players. They make their own. For all their spending in the transfer market, they almost always have at least one academy product in their first team. It’s kind of a thing.",
      "Clubs up and down the Premier League are looking to their player development as the magical route to blissful spending inside PSR compliance but United, perhaps more than anyone, know the intangible benefits of bringing players through for their own line-up.",
      "Consider where United are today.",
      "They finished a few places outside the Premier League relegation zone and might have been even lower if Aston Villa hadn’t laid an egg on the last day of the season. They spurned a last-gasp chance for salvation by losing the Europa League final. They were awful.",
      "United have backed their head coach after a poor season in which the tone was set by his predecessor and a club hierarchy that leaves an enormous amount to be desired.",
      "Amorim has been anointed as the rescuer of a club that needs to become Manchester United again. The Red Devils must bounce back and they haven’t got the time or margin of error they might think.",
      "Cunha is the embodiment of one strand of that rejuvenation but they need players like Mainoo too. United’s empire was built upon them.",
      "Mainoo can control and affect the game. He travels nicely with the ball and can influence the play by doing the simple things well in the middle of the pitch with the easy confidence of a player ten years older.",
      "David Beckham won’t look enviously into his passing toolkit but Mainoo is more than just a relaxed character in midfield. What he does there is technical.",
      "“It is how he prepares before he receives the ball,” former United academy coach Paul McGuinness told Adam Bate before the European Championships.",
      "“What he does off the ball makes it seem like he has time on it. To receive it, he has to look before it comes. Amateur players look up after they have received the ball and then decide what they are going to do. The top professionals, and that is a good phrase for Kobbie, they are efficient and everything they do has a flow to it.”",
      "One of the reasons Amorim will even make it as far as the start of the new season is that he adheres to a specific system and didn’t have the players to apply it mid-season with any degree of success – it’s almost like somebody should have said something.",
      "The outrageously talented tactical analyst and tea-maker Adam Clery recently filmed a video explaining why Cunha is the perfect signing for United’s system.",
      "In his illustration of Amorim’s 3-4-3, Clery defined the four players midfield players as follows: Flying Machine on the left behind(ish) an inverted winger, Inverting Enthusiast on the right behind(ish) a creative number 10, and a Ball Winner and Plays Everywhere in the centre.",
      "His energy and tenacity contribute to a midfield’s ball-winning ability too but that Plays Anywhere role is made for Mainoo.",
      "United’s recruitment should be defined entirely by the system if they’re to climb back up the table in any meaningful way and, in Mainoo, they have a player ready to develop into one of the most important spots.",
      "One year in every four, the decisions made by players take on a different hue. 2025 is a World Cup year minus one, the year in every World Cup cycle in which players either don’t move or seek a safe bet with the attention of their international managers in mind.",
      "There’s no obvious buyer for Mainoo but PSR can do funny things and Bruno Fernandes not going to the Saudi Pro League means that the chances of the midfielder leaving are higher than zero.",
      "One of the major problems with the way football finance is governed by the Premier League and other bodies in Europe is its dehumanising impact on players. In the very worst cases, they’re shuffled around like pawns on a chessboard. They are their book value and nothing more.",
      "But if Mainoo has a say, he should stay. He needs regular football in a familiar setting and that means both staying fit and staying put.",
      "If Mainoo were to leave it would be a big deal. As a United youth made good he’s part of a rich heritage and his premature departure would shine a light on PSR’s negative impacts. He is, culturally and tactically, where he should be.",

      "The top three is now exclusively Arsenal but the momentum is swinging yet again as they keep Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko waiting…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Liverpool\nOh, hello. A report in Portugal suggests Liverpool have made enquiries around Gyokeres’ price as they look to replace Darwin Nunez. Colour us sceptical. It’s very convenient for Sporting to have Liverpool painted as potential suitors all the while Arsenal fanny about over the price.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe know Liverpool like Isak. Everyone likes Isak. But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle. The Magpies want to keep the Swede, and there is talk of a new structure-smashing contract, but they can sell a sale to their fans if they are getting silly money. And if Isak states a desire to move. Both things will need to happen. And they might…",
      "18) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nSwapping Garnacho with Christopher Nkunku would solve some problems for both clubs, but maybe not enough for United. Getting rid of Garnacho would be the big win, but Nkunku is not the type of forward they really need. If they sign Bryan Mbeumo to play as a no.10 alongside Matheus Cunha, then they are sorted for forwards off the front man – it’s the central striker they badly need. And if Chelsea get Gittens, with Geovany Quenda arriving in a year, do they really need Garnacho? They definitely don’t need his bullsh*t.",
      "",
      "17) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nThe rumour that won’t go away. Madrid will say they don’t want to sell but if Arsenal offer big, big money for someone not guaranteed to start, they’ll sell. That’s a big if, mind. A big, big if.",
      "",
      "16) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nOf course Rashford wants to join Barca, and the forward must have received some encouragement from the Catalans that they will take him. But only on their terms. Which involve a loan, not a purchase. Which United must have seen coming.",
      "",
      "15) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Fenerbahce\nA move abroad is surely the plan for Sancho, but with so many United players, his salary will make any permanent departure tricky. Saying that, those Turks are being very ambitious this summer and Jose is apparently keen. Juventus are still sniffing, though, with a call said to have taken place between United and the Old Lady on Wednesday.",

      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "14) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",
      "",
      "13) Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nThe clubs are at least £15m apart on valuation according to latest reports, with Bournemouth understandably reluctant to see Zabarnyi follow Dean Huijsen out of the club in the same summer. The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it. Even if it means losing 80% of their back five from 2024/25.",
      "",
      "12) Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle failed with an opening £45m offer for Elanga, with Forest apparently looking for £60million. Which seems… excessive? Newcastle have sought to compromise at £50million. Forest are thinking it over…",
      "",
      "11) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nChelsea were linked with the Brighton striker but Newcastle always seemed most keen, which has led to a £50million offer. Brighton reportedly wanted £60million initially, but the forward has made it clear he wants to move on. We would expect the Magpies and Seagulls to find common ground soon. Pedro won’t be going to from the south coast to the North-East to play second fiddle. So what could that mean for Alexander Isak?",
      "",
      "10) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nSpurs are reported to have piqued Mbeumo’s interest and the prospect of staying in London to play for a manager he trusts would certainly appeal. But now United have returned to Brentford with a second offer, how serious are Spurs about reuniting Mbeumo and Thomas Frank?",
      "",
      "8) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Arsenal seem to feel they will get a better deal on the other guy…",
      "",
      "7) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nEven if Sesko is the man most wanted at Arsenal, the Gunners see an opportunity to get more bang for their buck with Gyokeres. The Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training next week. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres but Arsenal are working to their own timetable even if Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nOnly the fact that United have made a second bid puts them ahead of Tottenham. We wait to see Spurs’ reaction and whether they counter – Brentford will pray they do something to prolong any bidding war. Apparently, United have been having conversations with the Bees so we have to assume they are confident this offer will suffice, but only if Daniel Levy and Thomas Frank don’t show similar intent.",
      "",
      "5) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "4) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – but Quansah won’t be heading to Germany until after he’s faced them in the European Under-21 Championship final.",
      "",
      "3) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nNice and easy, this, because of the £5million clause in his Chelsea contract. A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper. Apparently, Kepa has done his medical and put pen to paper on a deal that should give David Raya the heebie-jeebies.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. A medical is in the offing.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment six weeks ago but, finally, the midfielder is in London to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we must be getting close to an unveiling."

      "Christian Norgaard to Arsenal appears very much like it might well be A Thing.",
      "Now we like Norgaard rather a lot. In our view, his has been an under-rated contribution to Brentford’s post-Toney attacking success, with his lower-key creative input significantly and understandably overshadowed by the more eye-catching Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.",
      "Point is, he’s a very good player available at a very good price and he might be just the thing. But…bit underwhelming, isn’t it? One thing Norgaard is not and never can be is the big-name striker Arsenal fans crave so desperately.",
      "But sometimes this precise kind of initially underwhelming transfer can obtain enormous significance come the final reckoning, like these five lads whose eventual contribution to title glory in their first season was far greater than the excitement that greeted their arrival.",
      "We’re talking specifically players who actually helped win their teams the title, not Ralph Wiggum-style helping. So no Federico Chiesa here, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "Manuel Akanji (Man City, 2022)\nOne of the problems with a feature like this is the fact that a vast number of Premier League titles have been won by Manchester United ages ago and Manchester City more recently, meaning any new signings – underwhelming, overwhelming or those that merely adequately whelm – are coming into teams already well used to winning titles by the sh*tload and thus making it harder to make decisive contributions.",
      "But if we try to do this feature without any contribution from Manchester we’re in very deep trouble, so we will have to make the best of it.",
      "And thus, Manuel Akanji is our man. There was little fanfare when he arrived right at the end of the 2022 summer transfer window to join two-time defending champions for whom Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias had formed an estimable first-choice defensive pairing with top-tier reinforcements in the shape of John Stones and Nathan Ake.",
      "At the very least it would be fair to say that of City’s two signings from Borussia Dortmund that summer, Akanji’s (for less than a third of the fee City threw Leeds’ way for Kalvin Phillips) was the lower profile.",
      "And while, yes, the very much not underwhelming signing of Erling Haaland certainly played its part in City’s continued success, so too did Akanji. He would end the season with more Premier League appearances than any of Ake, Dias, Stones or Laporte despite not making his debut in the competition until mid-September, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League knockouts and in every round of the FA Cup for the treble winners.",
      "Now Manchester City need an upgrade, but then he was an underrated revelation.",
      "",
      "Marcos Alonso (Chelsea, 2016)\nChelsea’s rollercoaster journey from 2014 to 2017 will always be one of the Premier League’s very best bits, with a pair of hugely impressive title wins under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte sandwiching a comically disastrous season that ended Mourinho’s second spell and resulted in a 10th-place finish.",
      "As well as appointing Conte, something else Chelsea did in the summer of 2016 was sign Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina.",
      "Now he had proved himself a very capable player for La Viola in Serie A, but here in England we have very correctly never really placed much stock in what a player might achieve in daft little foreign leagues like that one. It only matters what you’ve done here. And in Alonso’s case, that was ‘be a bit-part player in a relegated Bolton team and half-a-season of relegation-battling with Gus Poyet’s Sunderland’. In other words, nothing very interesting at all.",
      "Yet he was absolutely crucial to Chelsea’s success under Conte. We’ve all enjoyed the banters about the sorcery of Conte’s ability to win the league with Victor Actual Moses as his RWB – a magic trick matched only by Conte’s ability to regrow his own hair – but it’s easily overlooked now just how brilliant and integral Alonso was on the other side, and how that really was not something everyone knew would be the case at the time.",
      "As well as his defensive work, Alonso became a key progressive component of Chelsea’s dominant title-winners, more than doubling his career tally of top-flight goals in that one season.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante (Leicester, 2015)\nFeels like it’s a bit of a cheat to include anything at all from Leicester’s 2015/16 miracle, because for very, very understandable reasons not one soul on earth was talking about any Leicester signing of any xW (expected whelm) as being the one that might just propel them to the title after their escape from relegation in 2015.",
      "But equally it feels like you just can’t have this list without Kante given the sheer gulf between the lack of fanfare that greeted the arrival of a player on the back of one mid-table season in Ligue 1 with Caen and the mammoth significance of his contribution to Leicester pulling off the Premier League’s greatest ever madness.",
      "Such was his impact that he moved on to Chelsea after just one season – duly winning the season again as a signing that was in no way underwhelming – and his name remains to this day an instantly understood shorthand for a very specific and very special type of player.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick (Man United, 2006)\nIt’s one of those things that’s been largely memory-holed now by all involved, but at the time of Carrick’s move from Tottenham to Manchester United there were plenty of United fans who felt they’d been sold an overpriced pup by those wily southern chancers.",
      "The mood was febrile enough around Old Trafford back in the summer of 2006 on the back of a truly unthinkable three-year Premier League title drought. It seems hilarious to think of that now – largely because it is hilarious – but at the time United had never previously gone even two seasons of Barclays without winning the thing.",
      "Jose Mourinho had come along and ruined everything, the great Special prick that he was, and there was widely held suspicion about the idea a pretty-passing midfielder of such conspicuous pretty loser stock as West Ham and Tottenham could significantly change matters.",
      "Five Premier League titles and 316 Premier League appearances later, opinions had altered a bit.",
      "",
      "Jens Lehmann (Arsenal, 2003)\nGot to have a bit of Arsenal in here, haven’t we? And there really is only one contender when you look through the names.",
      "Now it’s not like Arsenal fans thought they’d signed a dud when Lehmann arrived, but he was a goalkeeper with a reputation for being something of a loon.",
      "As the man to replace the very safest of English goalkeeping hands in David Seaman, it was undoubtedly a bit of a punt. Yet a punt that led to Lehmann being an ever-present member of the first and still very much only unbeaten English league champions since the Victorian era.",
      "Look, fair play.",
      "Arsenal have reached an ‘agreement’ for their third summer signing as a replacement for a midfielder who looks to be Barcelona bound."

      "Newcastle are prepared to move heaven, earth and the Angel of the North to keep Alexander Isak from the prying hands of Liverpool, but it can backfire.",
      "While they face relegation if Isak is sold, speculation persists that Newcastle might be unable to resist the title-contending overtures of Arsenal and Liverpool.",
      "It seems unlikely either club can afford the requisite sums while persuading Isak to leave a club coming off the back of a trophy-winning, Champions League-qualifying season. But any player thriving outside the Big Six is destined to be linked to those in it.",
      "Newcastle still hold the cards with a full three years left on the contract Isak signed when he joined, but reports of the Magpies considering breaking their wage structure to make him the highest-paid player in the club’s history bring hope and warnings from the past.",
      "",
      "Arsene Wenger once said his principle on wages was “to pay something that makes sense and is defendable in front of every single player,” adding: “We make exceptions sometimes but they are not maybe so high. If you want to keep making profit you have to respect that.”",
      "He also said that “we have no players on £200,000 a week and I think other clubs will come down to us with financial fair play”.",
      "That remarkably optimistic and hilariously naive philosophy just about held up when Mesut Ozil joined on £140,000 a week eight months later, even if that deal, in the words of the Daily Telegraph at the time, meant Arsenal had ‘broken their wage structure’.",
      "But it was entirely obliterated when the German signed his next contract in January 2018. After some preposterously protracted and public negotiations it was decided that handing Ozil a reported £350,000 a week for three years was the “cheapest option” instead of losing him for nothing that summer and having to replace him.",
      "“On the other side all of our players are well paid. Very well paid. To feel sorry for them – I’m not sure that it’s the most objective assessment,” the manager added, lighting the ticking timebomb he had just carefully planted in a dressing room he would vacate months later.",
      "It is unknown whether Mikel Arteta or the club’s hierarchy agreed whether keeping Ozil was indeed the most economical choice possible when he a) refused to take a pay cut during a global pandemic, b) was paid in full until his departure for Fenerbahce in January 2021 despite not playing for the Gunners since March 2020, and c) still had 90% of his record Arsenal wage paid by the club during his first five months in Turkey.",
      "",
      "The line heavily pushed on Florian Wirtz this summer was that while his transfer fee shatters the club record, his incentivised salary will fall in line with the club’s highest earners – or at least those behind the Egyptian king.",
      "As far as basic wages go, Salah is the clear bar-setter at Anfield. Salah became the best-paid player in the club’s history on around £350,000 a week when he extended his deal in 2022, then when those terms were approaching expiration in April 2025 he agreed a rise of up to £480,000 if performance-related bonuses were triggered.",
      "Had that deal been sorted before that season he would have earned a fortune, but those 34 goals and 23 assists in 52 title-winning games provided a decent bargaining position during talks.",
      "“When you have someone as special as Salah the rule that you have to have in place you have to certainly bend them, maybe not necessarily break them but you have to maybe go closer to a position that maybe you don’t want to,” said Carragher at the time, dancing around the fact the Reds quite understandably felt compelled to make a significant exception to keep their best player.",
      "The usual Liverpool transfer exceptionalism notwithstanding, few could argue Liverpool were wrong to make Salah a pay-scale anomaly on either occasion.",
      "",
      "“I was a bit annoyed with the first offer put to me,” said Keane in August 1999. “Deep down they must have known it wasn’t something I could sign. Our dealings have to be realistic. I am not naive enough to settle for anything less than a reasonable valuation of my worth.”",
      "A £38,500-a-week deal would have made Keane the highest earner at Man Utd while remaining commensurate to his teammates. But with Juventus and Bayern Munich prepared to throw ludicrous and lucrative figures around in the age of fresh Bosman hysteria, the realisation quickly set in at Old Trafford that they stood to lose a prized asset for nothing.",
      "Keane was free to talk to those clubs and sign a pre-contract from January 1; his new £52,000-a-week Man Utd contract was signed on December 8, putting him on twice as much money as Ballon d’Or runner-up David Beckham mere months after the Treble – and making him the best-paid player in the Premier League.",
      "The BBC said Man Utd had ‘smashed their pay structure’, while The Guardian called it a ‘dismantling’. It also meant Keane was earning considerably more than Sir Alex Ferguson, who ensured after the Wayne Rooney deal fiasco in 2010 to get it in writing that no player at the club could be on a higher wage again.",
      "Keane being Keane and Man Utd being Man Utd, there was still controversy to be enjoyed as the ink dried.",
      "“I’m not one for holding grudges but this was a stupid mistake, a bad public relations exercise and something that should never have happened,” the Irishman said of a letter the club sent to supporters preposterously justifying an increase in ticket prices as a means to help pay Keane’s salary.",
      "Don’t give Sir Jim Ratcliffe any ideas.",
      "",
      "Before Isak came Kane, the modern standard-bearer for exceptional Premier League forwards operating outside the absolute elite, destined to forever be cast unrequited admiring glances from those within it.",
      "An unhealthy portion of Kane’s career at Spurs was spent linking him with a move to those clubs for unthinkably large sums while he excelled as an individual in a team tapping forlornly against a glass ceiling, and that fate has promptly befallen Isak.",
      "Daniel Levy happened to reach the same ingenious solution Newcastle have stumbled upon: paying something closer to the wages on offer elsewhere. With Kane already sitting alongside Hugo Lloris at the top of the Spurs pay structure that was easier said than done, but perhaps mindful of a potential World Cup-based boom in interest, the England forward secured a 100% pay rise in June 2018.",
      "Kane won the Golden Boot for the semi-finalists in Russia, but a new deal which forced Spurs to ‘rip up their wage policy’ in the words of the Daily Telegraph, had two significant knock-on effects.",
      "It perhaps contributed to Tottenham becoming the first team in Premier League history not to make a single signing across a summer transfer window. Mauricio Pochettino had challenged the hierarchy to be “brave and take risks” but likely had something different in mind.",
      "And that six-year contract with no exit clause effectively trapped Kane when his personal numbers continued to inflate at a time Spurs as a collective inevitably dropped off.",
      "If Isak does exploit the tedious Arsenal and Liverpool speculation his representatives will not make the same mistake – mainly because they have the experience of managing other clients and won’t be distracted by the motorbike and fake tyre tracks on his office floor.",
      "If Florian Wirtz triggers enough of his add-ons to become a Premier League record transfer then he may find himself among some fine Manchester United deals.",
      "Liverpool will hope Alexander Isak can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging.",
      "Harry Kane has basically joined Manchester United after an ‘Arsenal hijack’. It’s all happening…",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ivan Toney became the 35th and 36th players to be capped while playing for foreign clubs.",
      "Roy Keane has tipped an England player to be “fuming” at manager Thomas Tuchel for the role he gave him in the Three Lions’ 3-1 loss to Senegal on Tuesday.",

      "There’s no Rayan Cherki, Mathys Tel, Jaka Bijol or Diogo Coppola in our top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "10) Marcus Edwards (Burnley)\nNot long ago, there was talk of Edwards joining the Premier League from Sporting CP for around £30million. Instead, he’s now a Burnley player for a measly £8.4m. That might suggest he was never quite good enough to justify a big-money move to a top club, but we’re still convinced this is a brilliant deal for the Clarets.",
      "Signed on loan in January, Edwards didn’t exactly set the Championship alight, but we’d suggest not digging too deep on that; he should be a key player for Scott Parker next season.",
      "",
      "9) Jeremie Frimpong (Liverpool)\nFilling Trent Alexander-Arnold’s boots is a tall order, and Jeremie Frimpong is the man Liverpool have picked for the job. There are some reservations. He’s not really an out-and-out full-back and will probably get caught out defensively just as often, if not more, than Trent, which has always been the main stick used to beat him with.",
      "Right-wing-back in a back three is Frimpong’s natural habitat, and Arne Slot is unlikely to tear up his entire system just to accommodate him.",
      "But now that the pessimism is out of the way, there’s a strong chance he’ll be a roaring success. He’s one of the quickest players in the league, which helps cover a multitude of sins – just ask Kyle Walker – and his end product is frankly ridiculous. In a Liverpool team that sees loads of the ball, he’ll probably be just fine.",
      "",
      "8) Liam Delap (Chelsea)\nThis was supposed to be a long, tedious transfer saga with every top Premier League club in for the young striker thanks to his £30million relegation release clause. But, in a rare act of competence, Chelsea wrapped it up quickly – fast enough, in fact, to take him to the Club World Cup.",
      "He made an immediate impact on debut in the United States, assisting Enzo Fernandez against Los Angeles FC. Then on his first start, he scored. It was a lovely goal too. Delap’s all-round game was on show: stayed onside, perfect first touch, confident take-on, instinctive finish.",
      "That ability to run the channels and produce an end product – whether a pass or a shot – makes him look like an absolute snip at £30m. And he’s only 22.",
      "Will he be the next victim of the cursed No.9 shirt at Stamford Bridge? Probably. But at least he’ll go down swinging.",
      "",
      "7) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. Like Frimpong, the Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re more confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Every £50m+ transfer between Premier League clubs with Isak primed to shatter record\n👉 Ranking the Premier League record transfers Wirtz will hope to match with Chelsea shamed\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Man Utd linked with England striker after Mbeumo move",
      "",
      "6) Kendry Paez (Chelsea)\nSince Todd Boehly’s arrival, Chelsea have invested heavily in young talent. While not every signing has worked out (see Diego Moreira, Deivid Washington, and Angelo), the expectations for 18-year-old Paez are exceptionally high.",
      "The teenager already has 18 caps for Ecuador and will have the support of big brother figure Moises Caicedo to help him settle in west London — a move that could be a significant adjustment for someone so young.",
      "The potential is clear. Paez could well become one of the Premier League’s standout players within the next four years. Chelsea will need to carefully manage his development and make the right decisions to help him reach that promise.",
      "",
      "5) Matheus Cunha (Manchester United)\nThere’s one glaring issue with this transfer: This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. They have a habit of botching signings, no matter how brilliant the player was before taking the graveyard shift at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha was outstanding for Wolves last season and arrives as the perfect ‘wide 10’ in Ruben Amorim’s system. Add Bryan Mbeumo on the right and an elite finisher up front, and the Red Devils might just sneak a top-half finish next season. Lofty ambitions, sure.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling. He’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, it’s Man United.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "4) Estevao Willian (Chelsea)\nChelsea have signed two genuine blockbuster wonderkids, and barely anyone’s batting an eye. Probably because it’s Chelsea, innit? A club where forwards are on a never-ending audition — fail to dazzle straight away and the door hits you on the way out. They’re normally prepared to bin anyone who doesn’t explode onto the scene from day one.",
      "Estevao is billed as the next Neymar, and the Blues defied the odds by beating Barcelona, PSG and Real Madrid to his signature, which is a rare feat for a Brazilian teenager tipped to become one of the best players in the world.",
      "This signing injects a rare shot of excitement that Premier League fans aren’t exactly used to. Chelsea supporters should be buzzing that this kid chose them over the typical big hitters.",
      "",
      "3) Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford)\nAnother intra-Premier League move, Kelleher has finally left Liverpool to spread his wings as a top-flight No.1. As his ranking shows, this looks like an outstanding pick-up for Brentford, who have replaced Mark Flekken superbly and sorted the goalkeeper spot early this summer.",
      "Kelleher had to leave, especially with Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving, and considering how brilliant Liverpool are at flogging fringe players, we’re honestly stunned his initial fee is only £12.5million. It could rise to £18m, which is still a steal.",
      "Selling him for half what Jarell Quansah will fetch at Bayer Leverkusen probably sums up Liverpool’s weak stance in transfer talks. Kelleher wanted out, and keeping him made little sense. Brentford will be bloody chuffed.",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nNico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "Tongue no longer in cheek, the Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. Because that’s what really matters – not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone who’s world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summer…so far.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "A Liverpool fan does not think the Reds are firm favourites for the Premier League title due to four concerns, with Florian Wirtz the ‘new Kai Havertz’.",
      "Sure, you’ll know your Pogbas and your Rices, but what about your Amdounis and your Igor Tiagos?",
      "Liverpool are in ‘active talks’ with Bayer Leverkusen over a £30m defender in a deal that’s said to be ‘separate to Florian Wirtz’.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool will not be breaking their wage structure when they sign Florian Wirtz, as Fabrizio Romano has revealed what he will earn.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool could ‘break the British transfer record’ twice this summer as they have decided their ‘dream’ signing after Florian Wirtz.",
      "A new report has revealed Liverpool’s “expected” next move after they secure the services of Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez for around £156m combined."

      "But manager Ruben Amorim ‘wants to recruit at least two offensive players’ this summer and having missed out on Liam Delap, who opted for a £30m switch to Chelsea from Ipswich, the United boss is desperate to add a new No.9 to his ranks after giving up hope on Rasmus Hojlund, who could return to Serie A.",
      "Ben Jacobs revealed on Wednesday that United could be in line to feed on Arsenal ‘scraps’.",
      "“It could be a scenario where whoever Arsenal go for it opens the door for Manchester United for the other,” Jacobs said.",

      "But United are also scouring the market for alternatives and United In Focus claim ‘Tolu Arokodare’s name has emerged on United’s radar in recent months’.",
      "The 24-year-old joined Genk from Amiens for £4.2m in January 2023 and managed 23 goals and seven assists in all competitions last term to catch the eye of several European giants.",

      "It’s claimed Genk want around £20m for Arokodare, who has now told SportsBoom that he “dreams” of a move to the Premier League and is “a Manchester United fan”.",
      "“Obviously, it’s a dream to play in the Premier League, but I have my eyes on it for sure,’ he said. “Whatever options I have, I’ll take my time and make the best decision. I’m a Manchester United fan, and if it happens, it would mean a lot to me and my family.”"

      "The Sweden international only has eyes for Arsenal according to various reports, but may reopen the door he appears to have closed to United should the Gunners sign Sesko, just as Sesko could become United’s chosen striker should Gyokeres be Arsenal’s.",

Or, just Harvey Elliott.",
      "The perceptive/cynical Red Devils fans must be concerned as they supposedly near the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for a fee similar to the £62.5m they paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha that they either won’t have much more money to spend on further significant squad surgery required this summer, or are kicking a huge potential PSR problem down the road by continuing to spend big and continuing to be balls.",
      "After promising to be more savvy in the transfer market having taken over the club, after overpaying for pretty much everyone they signed last summer and selling the current best player in Serie A, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have made one very obvious transfer and are on the verge of another.",
      "That’s not to say that either Cunha or Mbeumo will be bad signings for United, but they didn’t think the innumerable flops they’ve signed for similar or greater fees over the last ten years would be either. And there’s a danger that with both 26 years of age by the time the season starts that they – again, like seemingly many to have arrived at Old Trafford in the last decade – will consider their career complete having been handed four-year contracts worth around £200,000-per-week. They will never need to work again.",
      "One would hope due diligence is done to assess the hunger of these players, but that desire wouldn’t be in doubt if United were instead signing teenagers or players in their early 20s on contracts deemed lucrative by them but not to the club, who have potential to grow in quality and – crucially – value. We thought that was INEOS 101 and page one of Project 150, but apparently not.",
      "The Mbeumo deal’s not done yet, and amid reports claiming Amorim ‘wants to recruit at least two offensive players’ in what remains of the transfer window anyway, an admittedly left-field possible addition to fix United’s attacking problem was driving England to victory over the Netherlands to reach the U21 Euros final in stunning fashion.",
      "Elliott was a man possessed here, as he has been throughout the U21 Euros – he might just be the best player in the tournament. His touch to take the ball away from the defender and his fierce shot into the roof of the net provided unambiguous evidence of his level above anyone else on the pitch to give Lee Carsley’s side the lead in the second half.",
      "Manchester City’s James McAtee has been mooted as a ‘controversial’ possible signing for United, as Elliott would be for similar rivalry reasons, but possibly due to the greater experience of the Liverpool man in pressure situations or simply because of his superior quality, this wasn’t McAtee’s night, it was Elliott’s.",
      "The playmaker has consistently stated his desire to fight for his place at Liverpool even after just 360 minutes of Premier League football last season, but the writing isn’t so much on the wall following the £116m signing of Florian Wirtz but drilled into it in 20ft-high letters: his Liverpool career is over.",
      "Brighton are interested and will likely now be convinced he is worth Liverpool’s £40m valuation, as United should be because – let’s be clear – someone who’s not quite good enough for Liverpool is exactly the level of footballer the Red Devils should be targeting. Plus, he ticks every other box…",
      "He’s a 22-year-old with a point to prove and plenty of room to grow, just shy of 100 Premier League appearances, ideally suited to that inverted winger role in Amorim’s 3-4-3, who currently earns just £40,000-per-week and can arrive and thrive to thoroughly f*** off a rival fanbase who could do with being knocked down a peg or two.",
      "“If Lionel Messi had done this, the world would be stopping,” Joe Cole said while analysing Elliott’s second goal of the night, as the Liverpool star turned away from a defender 30 yards from goal, drifted past another, and another, before letting fly into the corner from the edge of the box.",
      "It was superb, he’s great, and we suspect there will be a few more sporting directors asking for his agent’s number on the back of this quite wonderful display. Jason Wilcox should really be among them.",
      "A Premier League club have reportedly joined the race to land a Liverpool midfielder, and have a ‘secret weapon’ which it’s believed ‘could help persuade’ him to join.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho’s latest misdemeanour won’t endear him to any coach who might have been tempted to take a punt on a player Manchester United desperately need shot of…",
      "It’s not entirely Alejandro Garnacho’s fault. Like all of us, he’s a product of his environment and his, for the last five years, has been one of the most dysfunctional in football. But even in a sea of sheltered, selfish stars, Garnacho’s attitude is up there among the most pungent to have stunk out Old Trafford in recent seasons.",
      "He’s in good company. The likelihood is that in less than a fortnight, Garnacho will return to Manchester United as part of a four-strong bomb squad for whom, to the surprise of absolutely no outside Carrington, there has been little interest amid a fire-sale in which the Red Devils will struggle to make half of the ridiculous sum they originally hoped.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "Garnacho was expected to fetch the highest fee, originally in the region of £60million before – with no justification whatsoever – United bumped up the price by £10million. All for a player Ruben Amorim told to ‘pray’ for a new club.",
      "United really have not got the hang of this selling lark. The player they expected to make them the most money appears set to be the one still darkening their door come the start of the season.",
      "Marcus Rashford will find a new club, but most likely on loan with an option like that Aston Villa have so far refused (they are in enough PSR trouble). Jadon Sancho could be heading for Turkey with the last year of an undeserved salary seemingly safe. And Real Betis will probably come to some arrangement over Antony. But what about Garnacho?",
      "Doubtless United are pitching a premium, prodigious winger, a Puskas winner, an international with the World Cup winners, but what they are selling, no one is buying. Certainly not yet. While it is possible a market will form for Garnacho, it might be made up of summer shoppers waiting for the yellow stickers down the whoopsie aisle as closing time approaches at the end of the window.",
      "It wasn’t meant to be this way. It should not have been this way. When Garnacho stepped up from the youth team – to call him an Academy graduate is a stretch since he was no longer a schoolboy when he joined from Atletico Madrid – he was seen as one of United’s great hopes. As is too often the case with young talent at the very highest level, his profile grew disproportionally to his performances. And there were warning signs from the beginning; Erik ten Hag spoke more than once of the need for the teenager to buck up his ideas when he broke into the first team.",
      "His first senior start only came after warnings over his ‘attitude, resilience, determination’. Pushed on what specifically Garnacho had done wrong, Ten Hag gave him a pass.",
      "“Not wrong. It’s young kids, eh? They have to grow and to raise their personality, and they have to know what are the laws and demands in top football.",
      "“It’s not only about a trick or about scoring one goal. No, we have to win football games and that demands a lot and then you have to fulfil every day the highest standards.”",
      "Eighty-seven starts and a new manager later, it’s clear the message never got through. Garnacho’s patches of form over the last two-and-a-half years are roughly equal in number to the headaches he’s given Ten Hag and Amorim.",
      "Amid the club’s desperate attempts to portray Garnacho as the present and the future, Ten Hag had little choice but to persist with the winger, then a teenager, his youth earning unmerited passes from the increasingly beleaguered boss over his attitude, sloppiness, and social media mis-steps. Amorim, presumably given fair warning upon his arrival, was less forgiving. Garnacho was dropped for the derby in December, not just for this, but also as a consequence of behaviour patterns observed around Carrington. Too many strikes so he was out. Then in. Out again. In a bit, now definitely out.",
      "Posting a photo of himself in ‘brother’ Rashford’s Villa shirt boiled plenty of p*ss but Garnacho’s bridges were already torched at Old Trafford. All he achieved with his holiday pic was a thinning out of the few United fans who still stood in his corner.",
      "It won’t enamour Garnacho to any the few suitors he may have had. Certainly not when United are asking for silly money.",
      "🚨 MORE ON GARNACHO FROM F365\n🔴 ‘Immature’ Garnacho slammed for latest antics – ‘If I was Fernandes… I’d smash him’\n⚪ Roy Keane tells Man Utd star Garnacho to buck up or ‘get a job somewhere else’\n⚫ Ex-Man Utd man tears into Garnacho over behaviour and haircut; Amorim told to ‘ship him out’",
      "It would be daft even if Garnacho didn’t come with the baggage. Managers today want low maintenance, high performance. But when it comes to those most basic expectations, Garnacho seems to have got things woefully muddled.",
      "For coaches looking for a forward with range, Garnacho is not their guy. As a winger – Amorim has seen he’s no No.10 – he doesn’t have lightning speed and, coming off the left touchline, defenders know he has little intention of going outside them. Garnacho is most effective in a counter-attacking set up, lacking the guile to break massed ranks. And his best performances tend to come off the bench.",
      "If the anecdotal evidence doesn’t make buyers beware, the stats ought. Thirty-five matches separated his two Premier League assists last season – Manchester City’s goalkeeper doubled that tally – and he created only four big chances, fewer than 113 other players. Garnacho wasn’t much more effective when he was on the end of the opportunities. Though he scored six league goals, he missed 14 big chances.",
      "Such form isn’t that of a £70million player. With the statistical context contradicting the notion that he’s being dragged down by the underperformers around him, he would be dear at half that price. Then you consider the character witness testimonies… why the shuddering f*** do United and Garnacho seem so confident of attracting good offers?",
      "Perhaps the bravado masks a fear from the club and the player that they could be stuck with one other. Almost certainly, each will have to tolerate the other when pre-season starts. But parting is a must. And both United and Garnacho will have to try harder to make it happen.",
      "As wind-up tactics go, wearing the shirt of another club next to a yellow Ferrari is a guaranteed way to annoy fans and burn bridges with one’s employer.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",

Yes, we technically paid money for Vlachidimos but that was very much a technicality with our backs against the wall in the Anderson deal.",
      "So, fast forward to this summer and finally we can buy. But we face two massive problems – 1. Everyone we want to buy, seemingly someone bigger does, and 2. We can’t (due to PSR) offer them as much in wages.",
      "This cost us last summer with Tosin going to Chelsea, or Mbeumo to Man U (now maybe Spurs) this one. As the Isak article pointed out, we could lose our best player because he can get paid triple at Liverpool (yes, there may be other reasons but this matters).",
      "We therefore have to tread a very narrow path of players who are both good enough to play for a team with grand ambitions and playing in the Champions League but don’t have huge wage demands/transfer fees or wanted by Chelsea.",

The club could clearly do better here, and it’s not helped by the changes at board level, but many targets who are deemed good enough may get gobbled up by the bigger fish offering an extra £50-100k a week or £15m in transfer fees (Liverpool taking Szboszlai when we were negotiating, same happened with Ekitike and PSG).",
      "So you can build the depth even younger, which they’re doing – signing 16-18 year olds and hoping they come good. Or you have to start taking gambles.

      "According to reports, FC Barcelona have made a significant decision on Manchester United star Marcus Rashford as they are ‘keen on a loan deal’.",
      "Rashford has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona over the past six months, with this potential transfer mooted since the forward announced his intention to leave Man Utd during this year’s winter transfer window.",
      "The England international decided to leave the Red Devils after butting heads with Ruben Amorim over his poor training performances and attitude.",
      "Barcelona were linked with Rashford in January, but they opted against a move due to his disappointing form over 18 months and his huge salary.",
      "Other clubs across Europe, the Premier League and the Saudi Pro League also monitored Rashford’s situation until he joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m. They took a punt on the forward after selling Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Man Utd linked with England striker after Mbeumo move",
      "This risk paid off as Man Utd’s academy product returned to form at Villa Park, grabbing four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances.",
      "In an ideal world, Aston Villa would realistically want to sign Rashford permanently, but their hopes of securing his services have seemingly been dented by their failure to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "It has also been widely reported that he is favouring a move to Barcelona, with a switch to the La Liga giants deemed his ‘dream’ transfer.",
      "Rashford’s improved form has attracted interest from Barcelona, who are in the market for a new winger, but his salary and Man Utd’s asking price are still obstacles.",
      "The forward was also recently dealt a further blow, with Barcelona stepping up their efforts to fend off competition from Bayern Munich and Arsenal to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Williams’ anticipated move to Barcelona had been expected to end Rashford’s hopes of joining Hansi Flick’s side, but a report from The Guardian claims they are ‘keen on a loan move even if’ the Spain international ‘arrives’.",
      "Barcelona’s stance on Rashford is fuelled by his ‘flexibility across the frontline viewed being an asset’, as Flick ‘feels he can enhance his options’.",
      "Regarding Rashford’s potential role at Barcelona and the terms of this deal, the report adds:",
      "‘Rashford’s pace from the wing and ability to operate at No 9 would deepen the squad and give the head coach a capable deputy to Robert Lewandowski at centre-forward.",
      "‘Rashford, who spent the second half of this season on loan at Aston Villa, is one of United’s highest paid players, earning around £370,000 a week. While United would ideally want a loan fee they may be forced to accept a deal that involves Barça paying a proportion of his salary.’",
      "Newcastle United are casting their net far and wide in the hunt for a new winger, according to reports.",

      "",
      "22) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "21) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "20) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "19) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "18) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "17) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",

      "16) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "15) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "14) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",

      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",

      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",

      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes – including three Man City cast-offs and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Pep Guardiola has reportedly asked Manchester City to include Jack Grealish in a deal for a Real Madrid superstar in order to lower the price of the deal.",
      "Chelsea have already directly replaced three transfer-listed players they are yet to sell this summer, with 10 stars available for £337.6m on their ways out.",
      "According to reports, Jack Grealish could join another Manchester City star in joining Everton this summer as Kyle Walker has ‘agreed a sensational’ move."

      "",
      "18) Andriy Shevchenko – £30.8m, May 2006 (AC Milan to Chelsea)\nIt was a dream transfer Roman Abramovich revisited in each of the four summers from his takeover of Chelsea to the belated capture of a Shevchenko past his prime at 29, carrying injuries and still psychologically broken by Jerzy Dudek.",
      "The player himself cited the owner’s “persistence” and a change in his circumstances with the imminent birth of his second young son as the key motivating factors behind the move.",
      "Milan president Silvio Berlusconi worded it slightly differently, saying that “his wife ordered him to London with their children where the fog will do their lungs the world of good”, and “when his wife shouts, he runs under the bed like a lap dog”.",
      "That presumably made for an awkward reunion when Shevchenko and his fog-filled lungs returned to Milan two years after he left for a loan which only further underlined how far he had fallen; the Ukrainian added two goals in 26 games to his glittering record with the Italian giants.",
      "Chelsea cut their considerable losses three years after making Shevchenko the most expensive footballer in British top-flight history, packing him back off to Dynamo Kyiv as a free transfer with as many Premier League goals as Gervinho in two more games.",
      "",
      "17) Juan Sebastian Veron – £28.1m, July 2001 (Lazio to Manchester United)\nYouse are indeed f**king idiots, but it was revealing that within a year of that impassioned rant in support of “a f**king great player”, Veron had been sold to direct Premier League rival Chelsea for about half of what Manchester United paid to sign him two years before.",
      "“You tell me what is wrong with Veron,” sounds more like a desperate plea to the bewildered journalists present than a defence of the Argentinean playmaker in retrospect.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson would later write that ‘he was an individual’, a ‘free bird’, a ‘wildcard’ who ‘went wherever he liked’ and ‘just couldn’t play in our team’. If only Roy Keane hadn’t been there.",
      "",
      "16) Robinho – £32.5m, September 2008 (Real Madrid to Manchester City)\n“On the last day, Chelsea made a great proposal and I accepted,” said a clearly quite shell-shocked Robinho, the Blues having erroneously started to sell shirts with his name on the back before Manchester City marked their new takeover with a good old-fashioned transfer hijack.",
      "By the admission of manager Mark Hughes, there was also “probably a grain of truth in the rumour that Robinho thought he was actually signing for Manchester United”.",
      "But it was Manchester City the Brazilian blazed a trail for – for about three months. Robinho scored 12 of his 16 goals for the club between his arrival in September 2008 up to the end of that December, after which he soon faded from view before being completely phased out by Roberto Mancini.",
      "Manchester City made about half their money back within a couple of years but it required a helping hand from AC Milan.",
      "",
      "15) Enzo Fernandez – £106.8m, January 2023 (River Plate to Chelsea)\nThere is plenty of scope for Fernandez to improve his standing with Chelsea, the Argentinean having already overcome his first few injury and Pochettino-shaped hurdles at Stamford Bridge.",
      "This past season was the biggest step yet in the right direction as Fernandez established a more defined position, embraced a captaincy he should never have been awarded and inspired the Blues to Conference League glory.",
      "A little more is needed to justify an absurd outlay but the good news is that Fernandez has time to do it with seven years left on his contract.",
      "",
      "14) Stan Collymore – £8.5m, July 1995 (Nottingham Forest to Liverpool)\nFew could have expected that Collymore closing in would mark the peak of his record-breaking Liverpool move and arguably his trophyless professional playing career as a whole.",
      "The raw numbers are far from shameful: 35 goals and 16 assists in 81 appearances for the Reds, who almost broke even when Aston Villa signed him in May 1997.",
      "But the issues which would plague and ultimately prevent Collymore from realising his potential were already bubbling under the surface and the emergence of Michael Owen meant Liverpool quickly outgrew him.",
      "",
      "13) Paul Pogba – £93.9m, August 2016 (Juventus to Manchester United)\nIt might forever be the penultimate world-record transfer, considering just how ludicrously how the market-shattering bar was set by Paris Saint-Germain and Neymar a year later.",
      "At least the French giants recouped a healthy percentage of that fee back; Manchester United managed to let Pogba go to Juventus for free twice while spending what remains a club-record sum to sign him in between.",
      "There was a Europa League, League Cup and PFA Team of the Year place but viruses, haircuts, dancing and feuding with Graeme Souness – not all four with Souness, to be clear – defined most of a mutually disappointing six years.",
      "",
      "12) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m, August 2023 (Brighton to Chelsea)\nThe add-ons built into their embarrassing climbdown on Caicedo were described as eminently ‘achievable’. Some were related to European qualification with the rest thought to be tied to appearances.",
      "If winning the Conference League, reaching the Champions League and making 95 appearances for Chelsea has not triggered those extra payments then it is only a matter of time.",
      "It is entirely feasible that Caicedo ends up among the more illustrious names on this list. The 23-year-old has overcome some early teething problems to emerge as the all-action midfielder Chelsea thought they had signed and it is instructive how infrequently to fee is mentioned two years on.",
      "",
      "11) Rio Ferdinand – £18m, November 2000 (West Ham to Leeds)\nThe atrocity of a pundit has made it easy to forget the magnificence of the player. It is not worth thinking about how many times Ferdinand might have repeated ‘Ballon d’Or’ had he ever been able to egomaniacally watch himself from the stands instead of tapes of Phil Jagielka at his peak.",
      "Leeds paid £18m for 18 months which feel like a forgotten footnote in Ferdinand’s career, but it was the perfect snapshot of how the club, in the immortal words of Peter Ridsdale, “lived the dream”: they finished fourth and fifth in the Premier League and reached the Champions League semi-finals, Ferdinand himself scoring in a win over Deportivo in the quarters.",
      "“I’m satisfied I’ve done the best job for Leeds United,” said Ridsdale with no hint of sarcasm of self-awareness when explaining the sale of Ferdinand to a bitter rival soon after. “If you invest £18m and get £30m you’ve done a good job,” he added. Leeds supporters might disagree.",
      "",
      "10) Fernando Torres – £50m, January 2011 (Liverpool to Chelsea)\nIf bringing Gary Neville to climax at the Nou Camp automatically qualifies any signing as a success then Torres can look back on his Chelsea career with immense pride.",
      "The Spaniard won three trophies with the Blues and played a significant part in the capture of each, so likely does not carry around the baggage of Stamford Bridge failure many have tried to saddle him with.",
      "But it is startling that he both played 30 more games for Chelsea than he did Liverpool, and scored 36 fewer goals. Torres crammed nine goals into his final half-season with the Reds before moving in the winter of 2011; in his best league campaign for the Blues he only found the net eight times.",
      "",
      "9) Chris Sutton – £5m, July 1994 (Norwich to Blackburn)\nAnother whose punditry present masks a playing past, Sutton was good enough to become the highest-paid player in the Premier League for a time as the title-unlocking foil for Alan Shearer.",
      "The 25 goals Sutton plundered in a Norwich title challenge which quickly faded remained his best career return in a season including even his Celtic stint, but that contribution to Blackburn’s ascent to the English top-flight throne was crucial.",
      "",
      "8) Jack Grealish – £100m, August 2021 (Aston Villa to Manchester City)\nAs eager as Manchester City are to write off their record signing four years after heartlessly plucking the free spirit from Aston Villa and meticulously teaching him how to pass backwards, it is important to remember what Grealish has achieved at the Etihad.",
      "Only seven teammates played more minutes in their Treble season and just six supplied more goals and assists as Grealish was made the headline star of the celebrations, backing up his objective when leaving Villa Park: to “have as many winner’s medals as possible”.",
      "Another Premier League title has since been added alongside a Super Cup and Club World Cup, but the more peripheral role Grealish played in those successes has only served to see him pushed out of the door entirely.",
      "",
      "7) Ruud van Nistelrooy – £19m, July 2001 (PSV to Manchester United)\n“This signing demonstrates that Manchester United are a force in Europe,” said Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon of a deal Ferguson hoped would fill the club’s transfer remit of “improving the team by one or two per cent every year”.",
      "Manchester United had won the Premier League title three seasons in a row but followed up Champions League glory in 1999 with a pair of quarter-final exits to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, so the explicit reason for bringing in Van Nistelrooy could only have been to push them past that continental barrier.",
      "Yet in Van Nistelrooy’s five seasons at Old Trafford, the club’s Champions League performance in chronological order – semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16 and group-stage exits – coincided with the Dutchman scoring well over a goal every other game even with injuries.",
      "A record of 150 goals in 219 appearances underlined his individual brilliance but it was eventually decided that it came at the overall expense of the team, especially when your Cristiano Ronaldos and the Wayne Rooneys of this world started to blossom.",
      "",
      "6) Alan Shearer – £3.6m, July 1992 (Southampton to Blackburn)\nShearer “felt the time was right to come to Blackburn” and few could have argued with his logic. With his choice of clubs as a 22-year-old coming off the back of a 20-goal season with Southampton, he sensed a shift in the sands with Jack Walker’s 1991 takeover.",
      "Rovers had secured promotion under Kenny Dalglish and Shearer was earmarked as the ideal signing. In four seasons at Ewood Park he scored 130 goals in 171 games, delivering the Premier League title.",
      "And the time was right for him to leave Blackburn when he did too; Shearer’s 31 goals were only good enough for 7th place in 1995/96 when he cashed in on his stock to secure his next move, and Rovers were relegated three years later.",
      "",
      "5) Andy Cole – £7m, January 1995 (Newcastle to Manchester United)\nA transfer so controversial Kevin Keegan felt compelled to defend it to fans on the steps of St James’ Park, Cole himself can have no regrets.",
      "After 68 goals in 84 matches for Newcastle were only good for third place and some early cup exits, a breakdown in the relationship between Cole and Keegan meant their productive union was, in the player’s own words, “a bit of borrowed time”.",
      "The optics were uncomfortable for Newcastle in selling to the enemy, but Cole made the most of his opportunity with five Premier League titles, two FA Cups – including one final won against the Magpies – and a Champions League.",
      "",
      "4) Alan Shearer – £15m, July 1996 (Blackburn to Newcastle)\nManchester United fans have spent the best part of the subsequent two decades imploring Shearer to cheer up and reminding him of the preposterous probably trophy haul he rejected not once but twice, but the all-time record Premier League scorer has always denied any regret he might have at joining the handful of world-class players to turn down Old Trafford and Ferguson.",
      "Some might still see it as a hollow coping mechanism but for Shearer, the honour of becoming his boyhood club’s greatest ever scorer outweighs what he could have achieved at Manchester United.",
      "And a dressing room containing both him and Roy Keane might well have imploded anyway.",
      "",
      "3) Dennis Bergkamp – £7.5m, June 1995 (Inter to Arsenal)\n“I would have taken Stan Collymore ahead of Bergkamp, even for £1million more. Liverpool have got a better deal than Arsenal,” will forever stand as one of the great early Premier League quotes.",
      "Stuart Pearce, then still playing for Nottingham Forest, went on to say “the odds” were “loaded against” Bergkamp “making any kind of impression in an Arsenal shirt” under a newspaper headline of ‘BERGY’S A WASTE OF MONEY’.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."

      "Thursday 19 June 2025 20:30, UK",
      "Morocco will host the 24-team tournament, which was originally scheduled to take place between June and July 2025 to avoid clashing with European clubs' schedules, only for the new expanded FIFA Club World Cup to put an end to those plans.",
      "As a result, it will now take place between December 21, 2025 and January 18, 2026, earlier than the 2023 tournament that happened between January and February 2024 due to the final two league games in the new enlarged Champions League being scheduled for January 20-21 and 28 next year.",
      "And so these Premier League clubs will be missing a number of players for, potentially, several crucial fixtures at an integral part of next season:",
      "Mohamed Salah will captain Egypt at the tournament, meaning the Premier League champions will be without last season's FWA Footballer of the Year for a critical juncture of their title defence.",
      "The forward contributed an incredible 29 goals and 18 assists to help Arne Slot's side win the 2024/25 Premier League and given he suffered a debilitating hamstring injury while playing for Egypt at the 2023/24 AFCONs that seriously impacted Liverpool's title challenge that season, Reds head coach Arne Slot will be praying his star man comes back fit from Morocco.",
      "Either way, the 33-year-old could miss these top-flight fixtures - depending on how far Egypt go in the tournament [they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage in 2024] - including a potentially defining clash at last season's runners-up Arsenal:",

      "Marmoush made an instant impact after moving to the Etihad from Eintracht Frankfurt in January, scoring seven goals in just 16 Premier League games, while City's new Algeria left-back is expected to play a key role for Guardiola's team next season.",
      "And that means City could be without both players for these league encounters, including the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on January 17, were either nation to make it as far as the semi-finals:",

      "If Bryan Mbeumo does complete a move from Brentford this summer, United will also be without their new Cameroon forward during the tournament.",
      "And with Amorim desperate to improve on the club's worst-ever Premier League finish last season, the Portuguese would not have wanted to be without that key trio - and maybe event quartet - for these possible matches, including potentially pivotal clashes at Aston Villa and Leeds United and home to Newcastle United and arch-rivals Man City.",

      "The impact for Enzo Maresca appears less severe than for others, with the Blues head coach only likely to have to make do without the services of Senegal striker Nicolas Jackson during AFCON.",
      "And while the 23-year-old's 10 Premier League goals did play a key part in Chelsea securing Champions League football last season, the Blues have since signed Liam Delap, who can replace him in attack during the tournament for these fixtures:",
