      "Ian Wright reckons Viktor Gyokeres will be on another level to Benjamin Sesko in the Premier League this season. The former Arsenal striker hit back at double standards from Gary Neville over what would constitute a positive season for the division's newest forwards.",
      "The Gunners were in the market for both players before opting to sign Gyokeres in a deal worth close to £64million. The Swede arrives from Sporting CP after averaging more than a goal per game last season.",
      "Sesko meanwhile, despite interest from Newcastle United, ultimately chose to join Manchester United in a deal worth up to £74m. Both goalscorers could feature as the two historied rivals meet in their opening fixture.",
      "But former Manchester United captain Gary Neville caught Wright's ire when establishing targets for the Red Devils' new frontline. The Salford City owner wants to see Sesko, along with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, combine to hit 35 goals, of which the Slovenia international could be content with ten.",
      "Wright was incredulous at Neville's suggestion after the pundit had disregarded the same figure being enough for Gyokeres. “You look at Sesko and he scored 13 goals in 38 games in the German league (sic), Marmoush left in December (23 January) and had 15,” Wright said on the Overlap.",
      "“That says to me as a striker that he should be scoring more at that level, so you’re coming to United… I think Gyökeres… he’s got such great ability and physical, I think he’s going to be another [level]. He’ll get 15 [goals].",
      "“But that is a worry, 13 for a whole season, that would be a worry for me… what if he [Sesko] got 10 goals [in the Premier League ]? What if he got 10? Because you just turned your nose up at me when I mentioned Gyökeres and 10 [goals], and now you’re thinking about Šeško and 10 [goals].\"",
      "\"I don’t care [that Gyökeres is further in his career],\" he added. \"It’s Man United and you have to expect it… am I hearing this right?! Why can’t I have [10 goals] for Gyökeres? When I said 10 you turned your nose up like I was smelling poo.”",
      "Sesko's agent recent gave his interpretation of why a move to Arsenal did not materialise despite the Gunners making the early progress for a transfer. \"It's hard to say exactly,\" Elvis Basanovic said.",
      "\"Whenever a deal doesn't go through, there are always several factors. In the end, everything has to align for it to happen.",
      "\"What's important here is that Benjamin's wish, for years now, has always been United. And for United, he was even willing to take a pay cut to make the move happen. As his agent, I wanted to make that wish come true.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Amorim will be desperate for a positive start given United's dire season last time out. But his side will have to take on Mikel Arteta 's men without two crucial defenders.",
      "Martinez will miss the game as he continues his recovery from a long-term knee issue, while Mazraoui is sidelined with a hamstring strain. Amorim has however confirmed that both Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee could potentially play.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Amorim said: \"No, Licha [Lisandro Martinez] and Mazraoui are out, they cannot play this game. Josh [Zirkzee] and Andre [Onana] are recovering and are options. We'll see.\"",
      "United have an otherwise clean bill of health aside from those four. Amorim's United face a tough start to the campaign with clashes against Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea to come before October. Asked about his targets for the forthcoming campaign, Amorim replied: \"It's hard to know.",
      "\"We cannot change everything in four weeks, but we are better. We are training harder and are more prepared to cope with the demands of the game. I'm really more confident, that is clear. Step by step, we will be a better team.\"",
      "\"We want to return to Europe,\" Amorim added. \"We have to be realistic with our fans. We will have to fight a lot because there are more teams with time together than us. We have to focus game by game. We want to win against Arsenal.\"",

      "\"That doesn't matter and I don't care. I need to live day by day. Everything that is noise to our team, I take out of the picture, so I just prepare my team against Arsenal.\"",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler insists he is “very, very, very confident\" that Carlos Baleba will finish the summer still at the Amex despite the noise surrounding a move to Manchester United - who may put their move on hold for now.",
      "The Seagulls are looking to retain their top talent and the Cameroon midfielder has emerged as one of their leading lights. He's flourished since his move from Lille. Brighton have continued to unearth unknown quantities with Baleba the latest.",
      "Those in Manchester, after spending £200million on their frontline, are now looking to bolster their midfield. The finances of the deal could yet prove beyond them with Brighton looking for around £100m before they consider letting Baleba leave the club.",
      "United are prepared to delay a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba until next year due to the difficulties involved, but the MEN claims that the 21-year-old would keen on making the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Hurzeler is heading into his second season in charge and has had Baleba as part of his pre-season preparations. Despite talk of a move away the manager insists he's seen no change in the player's demeanour and believes he's committed to the cause. He said: \"I didn't see any change, he only changed his hair! He is enjoying being a Brighton player.\"",
      "Already this summer Brighton have sold Joao Pedro, who left for Chelsea in a deal worth £60m, which has lessened their need to part with their top talent. The Seagulls have previously been willing to let their star men go, but only once they've landed huge profits.",
      "Moises Caicedo previously left for Chelsea in a then British record deal. But their CEO Paul Barber maintains interest in their top players in nothing new, but he admits the footballing landscape \"isn't always predictable.\"",
      "He said: \"There's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me. Speculation is speculation. Carlos is a fantastic talent. We hope he'll be here for years to come - but its subject to the dynamics of the football world, which isn't always predictable.\"",
      "United could turn their attention to Sporting Lisbon star Morten Hjulmand if they feel as though they Baleba is out of reach and they need reinforcements. The Dane would be available for £50m, which is notably less than his £68m release clause. The Portuguese side would be willing to accept a lower fee if the necessary add-ons were met, according to reports.",

The Swedish striker made his intentions to quit Tyneside known back in July and has since attracted a jaw-dropping £110million offer from reigning champions Liverpool.",
      "But the Magpies rate their star man much higher, leaving negotiations at a complete deadlock at St. James' Park. Isak has made it abundantly clear he won't pull on a Newcastle shirt this season as he pushes for his dream switch to Anfield, though with no improved offer on the table, the situation is becoming increasingly toxic.",
      "Powell, who featured in the top flight for Derby County, Charlton and Watford before moving into management, thinks there's still a way forward and believes the club could throw Isak a lifeline by promising to cash in on him in 12 months once they've lined up a proper replacement.",
      "\"There is a way back for Newcastle if they say to Isak, 'Give us a year,'\" said Powell, Footy Accumulators No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, in partnership with BOYLE Sports.",
      "\"We've seen it before with (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Sir Alex Ferguson) Fergie, give him a year and he can go next summer. That gives them time to get a replacement.",
      "\"At the moment, they've missed out on (Benjamin) Sesko, (Bryan) Mbeumo, one or two others, they can't get a replacement now. All of a sudden, they might panic and get players they don't necessarily want.\"",

      "Rashford is not the only player who is not eligible to play though. Goalkeepers Joan Garcia and Wojciech Szczesny, as well as young defender Gerard Martin, are still not registered.",

      "Bruno Fernandes admits it \"doesn't fill me with pride\" that he gets lauded whilst playing in a failing Manchester United side - and would much rather play a lesser role to see the team succeed.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker enjoyed another stellar campaign on an individual basis, but did so whilst the Red Devils endured their lowest ever Premier League finish. Their dire campaign was their worst since the mid 1970s and saw them end up in 15th.",
      "Fernandes' solo stats still made for impressive reading and he was often left to carry the struggling outfit. He scored 19 goals in all competitions and was nominated for the PFA Player of the Year award alongside the likes of Mohamed Salah and Cole Palmer.",
      "The 30-year-old's influence was such that Jeff Stelling remarked that they'd be fighting to remain a top flight team minus him. “Without Bruno Fernandes this season, Manchester United would be battling to stay out of the bottom three,” he said in April.",
      "Despite being hailed for his individual contributions Fernandes takes no solace from those reviews and would rather see his role and importance reduce if it meant the team were on the up.",
      "He told ESPN Brazil: \"I hope you'll hear less about Bruno this year, but a lot more about United. That's my main objective because my name being spoken, let's say vaguely alone, It doesn't fill me with pride or anything.",
      "\"United being talked about, being positive, that's the most important thing and that's what I want for this season. If it happens that Bruno has to score fewer goals, provide less assists or do another type of provision of what is necessary for the games, I would be very happy.\"",
      "There is likely to be less of a reliance on Fernandes to contribute in the final third. The playmaker has been joined by more than £200million worth of talent in Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and is confident that the right moves are being taken.",
      "He added: \"Now people have joined the club, not just the players, but also staff and management, who have a different vision. I hope that all these changes and everything that we have done can bring the club back to the place where it really deserves to be.\"",

      "If history is anything to go by don't necessarily expect the Premier League's first weekend to produce the results you expect - in fact the first set of fixtures are littered with shock results.",
      "Some of those have been a sign of things to come, others may involve a new manager or a new look team just getting to grips with each other and on some occasions it is an early speed bump, but nothing that matters come crunch time in May.",
      "The opening set of games can be unkind - just ask Manchester United and Arsenal as they prepare to square off on Sunday. For others, like Liverpool at home to Bournemouth, there's an expectation they should get the job done with minimal fuss.",
      "Manchester City head to Wolves, which has not always been a happy hunting ground, whilst Chelsea host the Community Shield winners Crystal Palace. Tottenham's game with newly promoted Burnley is also one the north Londoners are expected to negotiate.",
      "But the early weeks of the season, often involving new players and new systems, can mean the status quo is thrown out. They can lead to knee jerk reactions, especially if transfer windows have not gone to plan.",
      "We take a look back at some of the opening weekend results that raised serious eyebrows - some situations that were recoverable and others that were the beginning of the end.",
      "The Erik ten Hag era did not begin well as Brighton, then led by Graham Potter, rocked up at Old Trafford and found themselves ahead by the half hour mark. By half-time it was 2-0 and the home fans were shell shocked as their new manager was being outclassed. United pulled a goal back to set up a nervy finish, but it wasn't to be as Cristiano Ronaldo was bought off the bench to try and be the saviour.",
      "Remember the name Reece Oxford? He produced the one and only standout game of his career as he bossed the midfield to give the Slaven Bilic era the perfect start. It was also the match where the Hammers realised they had a potential star in Dimitri Payet. Arsenal thought they'd got the missing piece of the jigsaw when they signed Petr Cech, only for him to make a notable error for one of the goals.",
      "Another forgettable afternoon at the Emirates to begin the season. Boos rang out at full-time as Arsene Wenger saw his side beaten with Antonio Luna among the scorers. Arsenal would react by signing Mesut Ozil and rebuilding their season impressively, but before the German arrived it was looking like a bleak season in north London.",
      "Like the aforementioned Ten Hag, this was another new era that did not begin as planned. One this occasion it was Louis van Gaal, the Champions League-winning manager, who was outdone by Garry Monk. Wayne Rooney cancelled out Swansea's opening goal and it was set-up for the Red Devils to come from behind and pick up the three points - but Gylfi Sigurdsson had other ideas will the game's winner.",
      "The Blues hoped to build on a record-breaking title success under Antonio Conte, but that summer was marred by the club consistently failing to get the Italian's targets over the line. So come the first game of the season, against Sean Dyche's Burnley, the feeling was not positive and when the Clarets raced into a 3-0 lead the clouds were gathering over Stamford Bridge. A late fightback made the result look better, but it was not the start anyone wanted.",
      "An iconic scene as Premier League matches welcomed back full stadiums for the Bees' top flight debut. Their stadium was bouncing with Arsenal coming to town and the newly promoted side produced a streetwise performance to down Mikel Arteta's side - who would embark on a forgettable opening few weeks before they mounted a recovery. But not before there was calls for the manager to be axed.",
      "On the face of it, not an outstanding shock. But on paper this was a newly promoted side, who had just seen their manager leave his role, downing the Premier League champions. Leicester were out to prove that their 5,000/1 miracle was no fluke, but their difficult season began in Hull with a late defeat.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Peter Crouch is backing Benjamin Sesko to hit the ground running in the Premier League. Sesko has joined Manchester United in a £74m deal from RB Leipzig and will play alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a new-look £200m attack.",
      "“But out of the new faces, Sesko is the one that I like watching. I’m excited by him. There’s still the fact that he hasn’t played in the Premier League and that is something that you have to look at.",
      "“Can he settle straight away? But he’s the player that excites me the most out of the new signings.”",
      "Sesko has landed at Old Trafford after Arsenal opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon instead. The Gunners paid £64m for the ex-Coventry man, who netted a staggering 54 times in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "Gyokeres was considered by Ruben Amorim for a reunion at United, but will instead work under Mikel Arteta this season. Arsenal scouted Sesko heavily over the past few seasons before going for Gyokeres, yet Crouch is more excited by the Slovenia international.",
      "“Obviously he’s a proven goal scorer. I know someone who worked with him when he was in England previously,” the ex-Liverpool striker said of Gyokeres ahead of United vs Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "“It was strange that he was let go. He went out to Sporting and banged in loads of goals and I’m sure he can do the same for Arsenal. But how quickly will he settle?",
      "“It strikes me that Sesko is the man to hit the ground running. You just never know. If he gets a couple of goals then he’ll be full of confidence, he could go on a mad run because he’s more than capable of it.”",
      "United have invested heavily at the top end of the pitch after managing a measly 44 goals in 38 games as they finished 15th last season. Alongside Sesko, they have gone for proven Premier League quality in the form of Cunha, who scored 15 times in the league for Wolves in 2024/25, and Mbeumo, who bagged 20 goals for Brentford.",
      "Crouch thinks that their new firepower can propel United well up the table this season. “There are some great signings,” he said. “But the forward line needed work, didn't it? It was misfiring all last season and Bruno Fernandes got them out of a real hole at times.",
      "“Cunha and Mbeumo – it’s not like they haven’t played in the Premier League, they were both brilliant and scored a lot of goals last season. And Sesko is a top player.",
      "“I think they will be a force. It was an awful year for them last year. I think there will be a huge improvement and they will finish in and around the top six.”",
      "Peter Crouch was speaking ahead of Paddy Power’s most generous start to a season ever. With Super Sub your bet carries on – even if the player you’ve bet on comes off, meaning even more chances to win. With more FREE Bet Builders than ever before, there’s nowhere better to place your punt.",

      "The west Londoners are weighing up a move for the forward as Rodrigo Muniz is the subject of bids from Atalanta, which could leave them light in the final third. Those at Old Trafford are open to Hojlund's exit and are currently looking for a suitor.",
      "AC Milan have been in talks with United regarding the striker and have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m. That was seen as the most favourable option before Fulham expressed their interest, but they want to know about the player's state of mind, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "United want to move on Hojlund, especially after landing Benjamin Sesko for more than £70m. The ex-Atalanta man has been unable to deliver consistently during his two years in Manchester, leading to them dipping into the market once again.",
      "The player though has expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place, even if Sesko's arrival will push him further down the pecking order.",
      "It is unlikely that Fulham will want a player who was forced out of Manchester and moved to them against his will, as a result they have enquired about his willingness to make the move.",
      "Hojlund was adamant that he relished the competition when he was quizzed on his future during United's pre-season tour of the United States. He said: “I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim though gave no guarantees that Hojlund would still be a United player come the end of the summer transfer window. The club will be conscious that they would like to add a midfielder and a goalkeeper - with sales helping raise funds and balance the books.",

The Dane would be available for £50m, which is notably less than his £68m release clause. The Portuguese side would be willing to accept a lower fee if the necessary add-ons were met, reports The Sun.",
      "It was Amorim who bought Hjulmand to the Portuguese capital and he's known to be a fan of his leadership qualities. The midfielder is also fully embedded in how to play in the 3-4-3 system that the United manager has been implementing.",

      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot admits they need \"one more attacker at least\" as the club continue to go after Alexander Isak with their pursuit showing no sign of cooling.",
      "The Reds spent £79m to land Hugo Ekitike from Frankfurt, the Frenchman scoring on his debut, but Slot wants more and has opened the door to his new signing pushing out wide to accommodate another new arrival.",

      "Manchester United are in no mood to stand still when it comes to the transfer market. The Red Devils have already backed Ruben Amorim heavily with an eye-watering summer outlay.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have already sealed moves to Old Trafford and the pressure is now on the trio to perform. And while United's attack now looks in far better state than it did last year, it leaves a few players with uncertain futures.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho could all still exit before the transfer window shuts in a matter of weeks. There could also be some more arrivals.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has admirers at Old Trafford, but it's thought that he too would cost a huge amount should United make a move.",
      "With all of that being said, take a look at all of the transfer news and rumours coming out of the red side of Manchester:",
      "With the signing of Benjamin Sesko, it appeared that Hojlund was primed for an exit. And that could potentially be closer than first thought.",
      "AC Milan have already been linked with a move for the Danish hitman. Boss Max Allegri is reportedly set to play a big role in a potential switch.",
      "As per Gazzetta dello Sport, talks between Milan and Hojlund's representatives have already taken place. Hojlund will now have a meeting with boss Allegri, who will attempt to convince the striker to move to the San Siro.",
      "Amid United's apparent interest in Baleba, they could be set to make room for him with an imminent exit. As per The Athletic, academt graduate Toby Collyer is primed for a move to Championship side West Bromwich Albion.",
      "Collyer expressed his desire to leave for more first-team experience earlier this summer, and will join the Baggies on a season-long loan. Sheffield Wednesday and Leicester were both previously linked.",
      "It was also suggested that Collyer could have been involved in negotiations for Baleba, but that now appears to be off of the table.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly received an offer from Italian giants AS Roma for misfit winger Jadon Sancho. The winger remains out of favour at Old Trafford following his loan spell at Chelsea.",
      "And according to The Times, Roma have now offered to take him on a temporary deal for the season. The Red Devils would reportedly prefer a permanent sale to get his £250,000-a-week wages off of the books.",
      "United value Sancho between £20million and £25million. The winger has just one year remaining on his contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Complacent Premier League bosses have “no plans” to move any of their domestic fixtures abroad - and claim they have no need to export their brand. Spanish football will break new ground this season after Villarreal and Barcelona were given permission to play their LaLiga fixture in Miami on December 20.",
      "But Premier League chief executive Richard Masters insists English football won’t be following suit - even though clubs voted in favour of a 39th game back in 2008 and it was only binned after world governing body FIFA vetoed it.",
      "Masters said: “LaLiga have been very open about their desire to play matches abroad. The Spanish federation have approved it, but as far as the Premier League’s position is concerned, I’m very clear about it.",
      "“We don’t have plans to play matches abroad. It’s not being discussed around our table. The overall objective of playing matches abroad is to grow that league internationally - but we’re now a genuinely global league.",
      "“All of the data points suggest the Premier League is growing internationally without the need to play matches abroad. We have fantastic international broadcasting partnerships, we’ve got global digital services now for fans to interact with the game and, of course, we’re investing in other things like the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "“But I think playing matches domestically is where we’re going to stay.” Masters’ optimism that English football’s domestic calendar will remain confined to these shores may not be shared by Premier League clubs - more than half of whom have foreign owners.",
      "If a two-thirds majority - 14 top-flight clubs - decide they fancy playing abroad, Masters will be powerless to stop it. Eleven of this season’s Prem clubs are owned by American majority shareholders alone, and the States would be the No.1 choice for a game abroad, just as regular NBA basketball and NFL gridiron games are already played in London.",
      "Masters insisted: “There is no desire to discuss this at the moment. If La Liga want to do it, and it’s within the global framework of the game, then it’ll be a very interesting thing to observe. But number one, two and three: The Premier League does not have plans to do it.”",
      "In his pre-season briefing, Masters claimed the “lights on the dashboard are flashing green” to indicate the game’s rude health economically.",
      "The rising cost of attendance for match-going supporters, however, remains a huge bone of contention for diehard fans. Bournemouth fans face a 530-mile round trip through Friday traffic for tonight’s opening game at champions Liverpool.",
      "Adult tickets in the Holte end for Aston Villa ’s home game with Newcastle cost an eye-watering £77, while a full adult Chelsea replica kit will set fans back £148.",
      "But Masters said: “We fully understand the relationship between full stadiums being part of the show that goes around the world that makes English football special.",
      "“We’ve had a long period of flat ticket prices - some are going up, but eight clubs have frozen their prices this year, and we’re committed again to the £30 price cap for away fans. Although we can’t get involved in the pricing of kits, clubs do understand affordability.”",

      "The lengths Manchester United went to sign Benjamin Sesko have been revealed by the star's agent. Elvis Basanovic claims the Red Devils followed his every step to engage in talks across six different cities as they beat Newcastle United to his signature.",
      "United signed Sesko in a deal worth up to £74million from RB Leipzig to add to Ruben Amorim's squad in a summer that has seen Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also arrive at Old Trafford. Club chiefs were able to persuade Sesko that United was the correct club to join, despite Premier League rivals having a bid accepted first and being able to offer Champions League football.",
      "Arsenal were an early contender for Sesko's signature too, with the Slovenia international among their priorities. Such was the fee required, the Gunners decided to move on to land Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP instead.",
      "But it was United's persistent efforts that ultimately proved successful in getting a move over the line. And a longstanding relationship between the parties paid off.",
      "\"We were in contact with Man United's negotiations director, Matt Hargreaves, who was a ruthless negotiator,\" Basanovic told the 24UR programme on Slovenian station POP! TV.",
      "\"In the last 10-15 days, they followed my every step, and the talks took place in three different countries and six different cities.\"",
      "Sesko had been of interest to United for as long as seven years and the forward's agent had kept the club well aware of his plans. While Sesko opted against moving to Manchester as a teenager, a transfer to the Premier League was always on the agenda.",
      "Basanovic added: 'We visited their academy when he was just 15. Even then, we were planning this move for the future. At the time, we didn't want him to go [when he was] so young.",
      "\"In recent years, we stayed in contact but we told them our plan - two years in the Bundesliga, to prepare for the future in the Premier League. We're delighted the plan worked.\"",
      "Basanovic also gave his interpretation of why a move to Arsenal did not happen. \"It's hard to say exactly,\" he said.",
      "\"Whenever a deal doesn't go through, there are always several factors. In the end, everything has to align for it to happen.",
      "\"What's important here is that Benjamin's wish, for years now, has always been United. And for United, he was even willing to take a pay cut to make the move happen. As his agent, I wanted to make that wish come true.\"",

      "Manchester United's pursuit of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton could be thrown into disarray by Liverpool's transfer plans. Ruben Amorim's squad are considering midfield targets after bringing in three forwards this summer.",
      "New striker Benjamin Sesko is set to lead a revamped United attack, supported by fellow signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. After assembling their front three, United have shown interest in Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Seagulls' hefty price tag has reportedly led the club to consider Palace ace Wharton as an alternative. However, United's chances of securing a deal for Wharton could hinge on the futures of Palace's other star players, Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze.",
      "The Independent has stated that United have identified Wharton as an alternative to Baleba due to the latter's price tag, said to exceed £100million. However, it is suggested that the Eagles may demand even more for Wharton if they do part with England duo Guehi and Eze.",
      "Liverpool are keen on Guehi to strengthen Arne Slot's defensive choices. The 25-year-old is in the final year of his contract and Liverpool are hoping to sign the centre-back for £35m, while Palace are believed to be demanding £40m. The centre back is keen on the move but a deal looked to be off with both clubs some distance apart on his valuation.",
      "However, Guehi's situation at Palace has been further muddled by the club's interest in Liverpool's Harvey Elliott, who is valued at the same price. The Sun reports that a swap deal involving Guehi and Elliott hasn't been ruled out, which could damage United's hopes of signing Wharton.",
      "There was previously hope that Guehi might remain at Palace this season, potentially making the Eagles more receptive to offers for Wharton. However, the club are not prepared to let the defender walk away for nothing next summer.",
      "Following Palace's Community Shield victory last weekend, chairman Steve Parish said: \"Players come and go in football clubs, you know, I mean, it's a life cycle isn't it? Hopefully they're still here. That's what I'd like but we'll see.\"",
      "In the meantime, Palace are reportedly eyeing up Elliott as a potential replacement for Eze, who has caught the attention of Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. Eze's release clause is set at £68m, but it s claimed to be expiring on Friday.",
      "Should Palace part ways with just one of Eze or Guehi, the Eagles might be more inclined to consider bids for Wharton. However, if both Guehi and Eze depart, they'll become even more determined to retain the midfielder and will boast a stronger financial position following potential transfer fees for the duo.",
      "The 21-year-old has garnered widespread praise since his switch to Selhurst Park from Blackburn Rovers in February 2024, although injury setbacks hampered his campaign last term, limiting him to just 20 league outings.",
      "The defensive midfielder shares the same age as Baleba, who has likewise caught the eye in the Premier League since his move to Brighton from Lille two years ago. His boss, Fabian Hurzeler, dismissed speculation that Baleba was set to depart the club after he sat out Brighton's friendly against Wolfsburg due to a minor knee problem.",
      "\"He trained today, he trained yesterday,\" Hurzeler said. \"So we don't want to take any risks, but he will be back.\"",
      "United are eager to bolster their midfield ranks ahead of the forthcoming season. Amorim chiefly turned to Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield last campaign.",

      "Roy Keane made his thoughts clear on Manchester United's transfer plans by blasting Sir Jim Ratcliffe over his decision to get rid of staff meals. It's been an expensive summer for the Premier League side who've spent over £210million following what was one of the worst seasons in the club's modern history.",
      "Bringing in the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and most recently Benjamin Sesko, Ruben Amorim has transformed his attacking line-up through heavy spending. Despite the overhaul at the top end of the pitch, the Red Devils still possess issues in defence and midfield, especially the latter, with no signings having been made to improve the engine room.",
      "United are interested in signing Brighton's Carlos Baleba, who is reportedly valued at £100million by the Seagulls, who want to recoup a nine-figure fee to part ways with the talented 21-year-old.",
      "The Red Devils have also been linked with a move for PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who announced his acrimonious exit from the French champions on Wednesday after being shunned by Luis Enrique. Donnarumma could well join City instead but United have also been linked with other big-money moves, including for Emiliano Martinez and Adam Wharton.",
      "The two potential incomings were discussed on the return of The Overlap's Rest is Football podcast, as Keane took aim at United's possible further expenditure. \"If United were to get him [Donnarumma] and there's talk of Baleba from Brighton which I can't believe,\" Gary Neville began saying.",
      "After the Irishman asked how United would get the money to pay for Donnarumma and Baleba, Jamie Carragher piped in and said: \"I thought they were going bankrupt. They were months away from going bust weren't they?\"",
      "The Liverpool legend referenced Ratcliffe's claim earlier this year, where he said the club would have run out of money by Christmas this year if he hadn't introduced several rounds of redundancies and cut back on staff meals to save money.",
      "\"Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year - by the end of 2025 - after having me put £232.72m ($300m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer, he told the BBC. \"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans.",
      "\"The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\" In jest, Keane responded with: \"Are the staff gonna get their sandwiches back?\" It was in February that it was announced that free lunches for staff at Old Trafford and Carrington were removed, as well as the closure of the staff canteen at the stadium.",
      "While Keane said United's struggling midfield will receive some respite due to the ability of the new attackers to be on the front foot, it remains an issue for Amorim. The ex-United skipper said: \"There's slightly less pressure on their midfield, don't get me wrong, but that will be the problem that'll still hold them back over the next year or two unless they bring in players.",
      "\"But they have to start somewhere. They weren't going to bring seven or eight players.\" When asked by Neville whether he believes they could pull off a move for Baleba, Keane said there's one main reason a deal won't be done.",
      "\"I'd be surprised if it happens,\" he said. \"I still think he's got to do a bit more. It's still potential. You can't pay £100m for a player that you don't know where it's going to go.\" Amorim's new-look United attack will face an immediate acid test as the Red Devils' campaign commences on Sunday when they host Arsenal.",

      "Manchester United may have finally found a route out of Old Trafford for Jadon Sancho but it will come at significant cost. Serie A giants Roma have launched a £20million bid for the England international — a figure more than £50m short of what they paid for the winger in 2021.",
      "Sancho's four-year spell at United has not seen him find the success many anticipated. A falling out with Erik ten Hag in 2023/24 saw him return to Borussia Dortmund on loan before he spent last season at Chelsea.",
      "The Blues had an obligation to make his move to Stamford Bridge permanent but opted to pay a £5m penalty to see him return to United. Sancho has not been part of Ruben Amorim's first-team set-up this summer and has trained separately as he attempts to broker a move to a new club.",
      "Juventus had been hotly linked with securing a move for the 25-year-old who has just one year remaining on his contract. The Turin-based team have not been forthcoming in getting a deal over the line however, with one Italian chief suggesting players would need to be sold to coutenance a deal.",
      "United have already been forced to admit they will sell Sancho for less than £25m this summer, while Roma could also be interested in a loan deal, per BBC. That would contain clauses to be triggered at the end of the season but is complicated by Sancho's contract situation.",
      "The Red Devils have an option to extend the star's deal by a further year but his significant salary places some doubt over whether United would be willing to action such a move. Sancho was willing to half his wages in order to facilitate a move to Juventus, but the Old Lady were able to offer the lure of Champions League football, Roma are unable to provide the same incentive.",
      "Sancho is one of a number of players United have been unable to get off their books so far this summer. The ex-Manchester City youth product has been kept away from first team operations along with Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The latter is hoping for a move to Chelsea having agreed personal terms but a fee has not yet been agreed between clubs. Antony meanwhile is holding out for a transfer to Real Betis but has been handed an ultimatum by United to make a move more quickly with the La Liga side planning on waiting until the very end of the summer window.",
      "United boss Amorim has suggested that group could yet return to his plans. \"Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team,\" said Amorim earlier in the summer.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",
      "\"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.\"",

In everything he does, he can play different type of football, he’s going to feel that Premier League is really aggressive, he is going to learn but he has great potential. I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years. That is why we paid so much money, to have a striker to have his history in our club.",

      "Ruben Amorim has suggested Mason Mount could switch back to central midfield if Manchester United fail to reinforce the area.",
      "United have all but conceded defeat in their efforts to prise Carlos Baleba from Brighton this summer and they currently have only four out-and-out central midfielders.",
      "Toby Collyer is about to join West Brom on loan, Casemiro's contract expires next year while Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte have only lined up ten times together in central midfield.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is expected to start in midfield against Arsenal on Sunday and Casemiro started in three of United's five pre-season games. Ugarte and Mainoo were paired together for the win against West Ham United in New Jersey and the draw with Everton in Atlanta.",
      "When asked if he wanted to recruit a midfielder, Amorim replied: “I’m really happy with our players, they are working really well, we have different players for that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players.",
      "“Maybe Mason Mount is a player that can play in that position if we want something different. But then we are going to find out during the season. But we have players to cope and win games in the Premier League.”",
      "Amorim said \"we will see\" when Rasmus Hojlund's future was raised. Hojlund is open to joining AC Milan following the arrival of fellow striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Since Hojlund outlined his intention to stay after scoring twice in United's friendly victory against Bournemouth in Chicago, he was dropped to the bench against Everton in Atlanta and was an unused substitute in their final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",
      "Hojlund could be omitted from the United matchday squad against Arsenal on Sunday as Joshua Zirkzee has resumed team training.",
      "\"He’s one more option,\" Amorim added of Hojlund. \"We will see. We are focused on this game and Rasmus is still our player.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim will speak to journalists on Friday ahead of Manchester United's game against Arsenal.",
      "The misery of last season is firmly in the rear-view mirror at Old Trafford and Amorim is hoping to oversee major improvement in 2025/2026 after an encouraging pre-season this summer.",
      "Amorim has been backed with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon, and Sesko could make his debut against Arsenal this weekend.",
      "Arsenal are looking to mount another Premier League title challenge and will pose a huge test for United on the opening day of the campaign. The Gunners drew 1-1 with United when they played at Old Trafford in March.",
      "Amorim will address the media in the revamped press conference room at Carrington for the first time, following a £50million makeover to create a world-class training complex.",
      "Follow below for live press conference updates from Carrington.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is ready to start for United in their opening Premier League fixture against Arsenal.",
      "Sesko arrived in Manchester last Thursday and completed his £74million transfer from RB Leipzig on Saturday. The 22-year-old had his first training session with his new teammates on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been impressed with how dedicated Sesko has been to enhancing his fitness in anticipation of a debut this week.",
      "United will be without Lisandro Martinez, who is still recovering from rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament, and Noussair Mazraoui, whose only appearance during pre-season was in the first friendly against Leeds United in Stockholm.",
      "Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee have both returned to team training and are available for selection on Sunday.",
      "\"Nous and Licha are out, they cannot play this game,\" Amorim said. \"Josh recovered. Andre recovered. They are options for this game. We will see.\"",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Stay tuned on the blog for reaction from Amorim's press conference at Carrington.",
      "\"I'm really happy with our players, they are working really well and we have players in that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players.\"",
      "\"He's one more option. We will see. We are focused on this game and Rasmus is still our player.\"",
      "\"First of all, we have more than three [Cunha, Mbeumo, Sesko], so they are fighting for their places, but I'm really happy. I think he has great potential. In everything he does, he can play different types of football, he will feel the Premier League is very aggressive, he is going to learn and he has great potential.\"",
      "\"I really like that, especially when it's smart questions. He listens and he wants to perform, so that is very good.\"",
      "\"Even last season, when he played as a midfielder, he was the player who had more shots near the box. So I think it's a good thing for Bruno to stay in one position during training. I want Bruno near the ball, which is really important for our team. Now we have players with different characteristics who can cope with that, so we will try to manage the game by game, the players for the best positions.\"",
      "\"I learned a lot last season. I don't need to focus on the future. That doesn't matter and I don't care. I need to live day by day. Everything that is noise to our team, I take out of the picture, so I just prepare my team against Arsenal.\"",
      "\"Maybe Mason Mount is a player who can play in that position if we want something different. But we have players to cope and win games in the Premier League.\"",
      "\"That is a question for Mikel [Arteta]. Viktor is in a different league. Sporting have good scouting because they live from the players they can buy and sell to survive. I think he's a very good player. It's not a surprise to see him with a big club in England.\"",
      "\"We want to return to Europe. We have to be realistic with our fans. We will have to fight a lot because there are more teams with time together than us. We have to focus game by game. We want to win against Arsenal.\"",
      "\"It's hard to know. We cannot change everything in four weeks, but we are better. We are training harder and are more prepared to cope with the demands of the game. I'm really more confident, that is clear. Step by step, we will be a better team.\"",
      "\"I can see Ben being a striker atthis club for many years. That is why we paid a lot of money. He didn't have a lot of time [training], but physically he is ready. That is a big component in our league. He's ready to play and we'll see if he starts.\"",
      "\"No, Licha and Mazraoui are out, they cannot play this game. Josh [Zirkzee] and Andre [Onana] are recovering and are options. We'll see.\"",

      "Sancho is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and has been training on his own at Carrington since Chelsea opted against signing him permanently after a loan stint last season.",
      "Chelsea paid a £5million penalty fee to break their obligation to sign Sancho. The winger has been looking for a new club and Roma have contacted United to discuss the terms of a loan, with an obligation included.",

      "Hargreaves attempts to obtain value in negotiations and Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, described him as \"ruthless\" when he recently sat down in Slovenia to provide insight into his client's move to Manchester.",
      "Sesko arrived at Old Trafford for a fee of €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons last weekend. He signed a five-year contract and could make his debut against Arsenal.",

      "United have not completely given up on signing the 21-year-old before the transfer window closes on September 1 but senior sources concede a deal is unlikely.",
      "External sources have suggested a deal this summer is \"too difficult\". Baleba is under contract at Brighton until 2028, with the option of another year, and the club sold midfielder Moises Caicedo to Chelsea in 2023 for a then-British record £115million.",
      "Baleba would be keen to join United but he is valued at around £100m by Brighton. United have already invested more than £200m on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer.",
      "United still intend to reinforce their midfield as Toby Collyer is set to join West Bromwich Albion on loan. Collyer would prefer to stay but United want him to play regularly in the Championship.",
      "There was some surprise that United did not move for midfielder Joao Palhinha before he joined Tottenham Hotspur on loan from Bayern Munich. Palhinha, 30, played under United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting, excelled in the Premier League with Fulham and United have recruited three players from Bayern within the last three years.",
      "Agency sources said United would prefer to permanently sign a midfielder rather than bring one in on loan. Spurs have an option to buy Palhinha for £27m.",
      "An obstacle to United bolstering their midfield remains Casemiro. The MEN previously reported that four different figures were given a mandate to sell the 33-year-old but he is set to see out the final year of his contract.",
      "United have not received any concrete offers for Casemiro, who would have to be sold for £15m to avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "Casemiro's contract expires next year and United have the option of an additional year but will almost certainly ignore it.",
      "United recruited Manuel Ugarte on transfer deadline day last year with the intention of him becoming their long-term defensive midfielder. However, the £50.75m signing has underwhelmed and lost his place to Casemiro towards the end of last season.",
      "Ugarte, 24, had a mixed pre-season, shining against West Ham United in New Jersey before struggling against Everton in Atlanta. Ugarte started in two of United's five pre-season games.",
      "Amorim has to decide whether to play Bruno Fernandes with Ugarte or Casemiro in United's opening Premier League fixture against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",

      "I hope you'll hear less about Bruno this year, but a lot more about United. That's my main objective because my name being spoken, let's say vaguely alone, it doesn't fill me with pride or anything. United being talked about, being positive, that's the most important thing and that's what I want for this season. If it happens that Bruno has to score fewer goals, provide less assists or do another type of provision of what is necessary for the games, I would be very happy.",

      "Romano claims he 'guarantees' that Baleba would agree a move to Old Trafford quickly if a fee could be agreed.",
      "However, agreeing said sum is still far down the line.",
      "Explaining the latest situation in a Q&A, The Athletic's Laurie Whitwell has discussed the possibility of signing Baleba this summer.",

      "Spurs and Arsenal are interested in signing Crystal Palace talisman Eberechi Eze and Arsenal have already recruited winger Noni Madueke from Chelsea. Spurs have held discussions about potentially buying Savinho from Manchester City.",
      "Atletico, Garnacho’s former club, gave consideration to re-signing the Argentina international but bought fellow winger Alex Baena from Villarreal.",
      "Chelsea remain the frontrunners to sign Garnacho. Garnacho’s agents, Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, visited Chelsea during the January transfer window and De Lucas played for the Club World Cup winners in the 2002-03 season.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim told Garnacho he could leave in May. Amorim was unhappy that Garnacho, 22, cast doubt on his future and complained about his demotion to the bench in the immediate aftermath of the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Garnacho and Marcus Rashford were dropped by Amorim in only his seventh match in charge at Manchester City on December 15. Amorim was unhappy at how inattentive Garnacho was as he prepared to come on against Victoria Plzen in the Europa League three days earlier.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I think [with] Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" Amorim said last month. \"And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Garnacho paid for a team dinner by way of apology after he headed straight down the tunnel following his first half substitution in the home defeat of Ipswich Town in February.",
      "After United returned from their post-season tour of Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong, Garnacho posted an Instagram Story celebrating his return from the six-day jaunt. A month later, Garnacho donned an Aston Villa shirt with Rashford's name on it and posted it on his Instagram account.",
      "United sources have acknowledged Garnacho’s brother, Roberto, has also caused commotion with several social media outbursts.",
      "Garnacho did not travel on United’s pre-season tour of the United States amid his wish to leave and he has been told to report for training at separate times to the first team squad at the club's Carrington complex.",
      "Since United signed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid's academy in 2020, he has made 144 appearances and scored 28 goals. Garnacho decided United's FA Youth Cup triumph against Nottingham Forest in 2022 and he was on the scoresheet against Manchester City in the FA Cup final in 2024.",
      "After Garnacho made his first team debut under Ralf Rangnick in April 2022, he was named in Erik ten Hag's pre-season tour squad that summer. Ten Hag did not play Garnacho in any of United’s four tour friendlies after he was late for a team meeting.",
      "Garnacho had actually reported for pre-season earlier than expected that summer, having represented Argentina in the Toulon Tournament. He made his full United debut against FC Sheriff in the Europa League in October 2022.",

      "Sancho was an England international and one of the most exciting players in Europe when he arrived at United.",
      "However, Sancho contributed 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for United before his fallout with Erik ten Hag. He missed four months of competitive football due to that disagreement and re-signed for Dortmund on loan for the second half of 2023/2024 in an attempt to rediscover form.",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is facing the nightmare prospect of being unable to play for Barcelona this weekend as the La Liga club have still yet to register the forward.",
      "Currently, La Liga have put sanctions on Barca due to overspending their salary limit. On Wednesday, the club announced they had been given permission to register Joan Garcia after his fellow goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is injured.",
      "However, Rashford, Wojciech Szczesny and Gerard Martin have yet to be registered for their season opener against Mallorca tomorrow evening. According to The Athletic, Barca's board of directors have put their own personal worth at risk to secure a £6m bank guarantee.",
      "It is not known whether this emergency action will be enough to ensure that Rashford and his teammates will be registered to play. It is believed that Barcelona are confident they will manage to get all their new signings registered before the summer transfer window shuts on September 1.",
      "If, for whatever reason, they miss this deadline, the players in question will be forced to sit out of the action until the beginning of the January transfer window where the Catalan club can try again to register them. Rashford will have been hoping to hit the ground running at Barca after joining them on a season-long loan from the Reds.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The England international has remained relaxed about the situation when questioned about it. Speaking before flying off for the pre-season tour of Asia, the winger said: \"I’m calm; I trust that the club will sort it out.",
      "\"I’m just concentrating on training and getting in good shape to start the competition.\" The concern for Rashford is that Nico Williams, who was targeted before him, refused to join Barca because they could not offer him guarantees that he would be registered.",
      "Williams is believed to have wanted a clause in his contract that would allow him to leave for free if he was not registered and the La Liga giants refused. It remains to be seen if Rashford's faith in Barcelona is well-placed.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has described winger Amad as 'magical' ahead of the Premier League's return on Sunday at home to Arsenal.",
      "The Reds enter the match knowing they need to show drastic improvements from last season which fell well below the bar set at the club. Defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur ensured the Reds are without European football this season.",
      "The consensus is that Ruben Amorim's side will benefit from a full focus on domestic competitions with the goal being to re-enter European football in the 2026/27 season. In order to do that, United have entered the summer transfer market adding four first-team players to their squad.",
      "United's priority has clearly been on the attack with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all added to boost the forward line. However, it is one of the old guard that Fernandes decided to praise on social media ahead of the start of the Premier League campaign.",
      "Sharing a clip from a media day where Amad looked to show off his golfing prowess, Fernandes was left in hysterics as the Ivorian fluffed his shot and the ball barely moved off its tee. Posting the video to Instagram, the Portuguese midfielder captioned it: \"Luckily for us, his left foot is magical.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"Not like his hands.\" This campaign, United supporters can expect to see Amad utilised as a wing-back.",
      "When Amorim arrived, the winger was played in the No.10 positions but after Cunha and Mbeumo joined the team, it appears that Amad is being groomed to play as a wing-back offering plenty of pace and talent at both ends of the pitch. Battling for that position on the right will be Diogo Dalot who was handed a shirt number upgrade this summer.",

      "Adam Wharton could have saved his grandparents a lot of worry by signing for Manchester United, and a deal back in 2024 would have ultimately saved Old Trafford chiefs a lot of money – but it was Crystal Palace who ultimately took the plunge.",
      "Now, 18 months on, the Eagles are value the 21-year-old significantly higher, which could put the Red Devils off making a move for the England international. Wharton's value has skyrocketed quickly in his young career, after impressing Premier League sides with his skills at Blackburn Rovers as a youth project.",
      "The playmaker spent his entire youth career with the Championship side, before making 44 appearances for their first team and contributing four goals from the centre of the pitch. Last year, The Guardian reported that United scouts were among those to have watched Wharton at Ewood Park.",
      "While Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both showed interest as well, it was Palace who took the shot on the young star in a deal worth up to £22m. With 36 Premier League appearances already under his belt – plus the FA Cup and Community Shield – Wharton has been impressive for both club and country.",
      "The 21-year-old was also selected by the England senior team to participate in Euro 2024, after only making his international debut for the Three Lions just days before the tournament in June.",
      "This means that United could have potentially saved a huge amount of money had they decided to sign Wharton back in 2024 instead. A move to the north west would have also benefited his family life, as his father revealed last year that his grandmothers were \"worried sick\" for him moving to south London to play for Palace – although dad John claims he hasn't looked back since the move.",
      "The Englishman is one of two players that Ruben Amorim is considering bringing to his midfield this summer, with Carlos Baleba the more prominent option.",
      "United, though, ultimately face having made the same mistake with the Brighton star, as he was available for just £23m back in 2023.",
      "While playing for Lille, the 21-year-old was subject to interest from the Old Trafford outfit, but the Seagulls signed him on a five-year deal instead. Now, the Premier League side value Baleba at a whopping £104m – meaning Amorim's team would be slapping £81m more on the table than they should be if they take the swoop on the Cameroonian.",
      "With Wharton as an alternative, fans would be hoping that this transfer could be slightly easier to conduct; but this isn't the case. The sale of the England midfielder may all rest on Palace's ability to retain other star players in their squad, namely Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze.",
      "Liverpool have expressed a keen interest in tempting Guehi away from the team he captains, launching a bid worth up to £35m. While the Eagles are not planning on letting the star leave, the 25-year-old will come to the end of his contract next summer. Guehi, though, is prepared to see out his contract.",
      "Eze is also attracting moths to the flame this summer, with both north London sides interested in signing the classy midfielder.",
      "Arsenal and Spurs are potentially planning to wait out the England international's £68m release clause, which will expire at the end of this week.",
      "Wharton's move may depend entirely on whether either one or both of his team-mates move on to pastures new.",
      "With Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all in the building ahead of United's clash with the Gunners on Sunday, Amorim is keen to get his project on the go at Old Trafford.",
      "Discussing his \"selection headache\" ahead of the Premier League opener earlier this week, the boss told MUTV: \"That [a selection headache] is a good thing, it is supposed to be like that, not like last season that we have to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch.",
      "\"This is the normal thing so I need to think and they [the players] need to fight during the week, so they can change my mind, I have an idea but they will change my mind during the week.",
      "\"It is going to be tough because we try to arrange a full week of training, so we will have two really strong sessions with time to work and then we are going to break a little bit and then two days to really think about the strategy for the game and we will be ready.\"",

      "Backing up our understanding, The Telegraph reported this week that Brighton value Baleba at more than £100m. The Seagulls will undoubtedly be coming to this conclusion due to the then English transfer record fee Chelsea paid for Moises Caicedo.",
      "Such a figure will be out of United's budget, you would imagine. It also adds up with Brighton's stance that they do not want to sell Baleba in this window.",

      "Then on Thursday came another announcement from the Old Trafford club that they had secured another multi-year partnership with fintech firm Sokin - who will become the club's official global business payments solutions partner in another boost to United's commercial portfolio.",
      "The decline in competitive success over recent years has been impactful when it comes to United's commercial success. While the club is still seen as a global blue-chip brand where partnerships bring exposure, the rate of growth when it comes to commercial activity has not been at the rate of their 'big six' rivals, with United seeing a 10 per cent growth since 2019 up to 2023/2024.",
      "That compares to Arsenal (97 per cent), Tottenham Hotspur (89 per cent), Liverpool (64 per cent), Manchester City (62 per cent) and Chelsea (25 per cent). Across that period, United have been surpassed by both City and Liverpool when it comes to annual commercial revenue.",
      "They do have some major sponsorship inventory still to sell, with the naming rights to their revamped Carrington training complex that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe toured this week on the block, as well as the training kit provider.",
      "The club's previous deal with blockchain firm Tezos came to an end this summer and, for recently installed chief business officer Marc Armstrong, hired from French club Paris Saint-Germain earlier this year, finding partners for these opportunities was key.",
      "The Tezos deal was worth around £24million per-year to United, while naming rights for the training ground likely to fetch some £20million per season plus, with Arsenal's deal struck with Sobha Realty last year worth £15million a year on a four-year agreement.",
      "Ratcliffe, when speaking at the opening of the revamped training complex this week, said of United as a brand: \"This is one of the most recognised brands in the world. It stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.\"",
      "With that in mind, United will see both pieces of sponsorship inventory as key to them driving revenues forward to enable them to stay within the confines of PSR, and be able to reinvest in the squad at a time when they are facing a period away from the Champions League and its riches for another season.",
      "Not underselling the value of such inventory won't be lost on United's commercial department, and the hiring of Armstrong was designed to ensure that the Old Trafford club had the best operators to navigate the partnerships space at a time where they were struggling competitively, but also still had the leverage of being one of the most globally recognised brands in world sport.",
      "The challenge for Armstrong and his team will be to wrestle back the commercial initiative from neighbours City and Liverpool, but a chunk of that will depend on whether or not head coach Ruben Amorim can deliver success on the pitch.",
      "But commercial revenues should get a healthy bump soon, with both the training ground and training kit likely to see valuable partnerships struck up very soon.",

      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, because Liverpool and AFC Bournemouth kick off the new Premier League campaign on Friday, their deadline for registering fresh players has already passed for this weekend. Currently, it does not seem like United will be signing any new players before the weekend.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has been touted as a potential new recruit but it seems that United are too far away from the Seagulls' valuation to get that deal completed before the weekend, let alone Friday at noon. The registration window will be back open for United on Monday ahead of their fixture at Fulham.",

      "With Toby Collyer on the brink of leaving, Manchester United's midfield pool is about to become even weaker.",
      "Collyer, 21, is understood to be very close to finalising a move to West Bromwich Albion. It will mark a first loan spell of his senior career, meaning he will have the opportunity to get regular minutes under his belt.",
      "However, his impending exit only strengthens the argument for United to bring in a midfielder before the transfer window closes on September 1.",
      "With Mason Mount preferred as a No.10 in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, United's pool of senior central-midfielders will stand at just four players. That is not enough to get United through an entire season.",
      "Ahead of Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford, Bruno Fernandes is the only midfielder who can be considered a guaranteed starter. Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro are all competing to start alongside him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The fact there is no guarantee who will start next to Fernandes only strengthens the argument for United to bring in a new midfielder. Brighton ace Carlos Baleba is understood to be at the top of United's wish list.",
      "United's midfield has been a long-term problem they have been trying to fix for several years. Casemiro was excellent in his first season at the club in 2022/23, providing the defensive nous and bite they had been sorely lacking, but he was only ever going to provide a short-term solution, and that was demonstrated the following season.",
      "Ugarte, who arrived from Paris Saint-Germain last summer, was supposed to be the Brazilian's successor. However, he has struggled to get into any sort of rhythm and his capabilities in possession are limited.",
      "However, at the age of 24, Ugarte still has time to make a name for himself at United, and it is hoped a first full pre-season at the club will stand him in good stead for the 2025/26 campaign. Casemiro, though, has passed his peak and will turn 34 in February.",
      "With less than a year remaining on his contract, United should have been trying to sell the former Real Madrid man this summer. They need to secure £15m for his signature to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United have been guilty of allowing players to run down their contracts and leave for free far too often in recent years, meaning they should have been striving to avoid a repeat of that scenario this summer.",
      "However, with Collyer heading out on loan and still no sign of a new midfielder being brought in, United are looking increasingly unlikely to sell Casemiro, meaning they are poised to miss out on a cash injection.",
      "United have the chance to extend Casemiro's contract by an additional year, taking him through until 2027, but that feels somewhat unlikely. The chances are he will leave the club next summer on a free transfer.",
      "With no European football on the table this season, Casemiro is unlikely to play as regularly, certainly as a starter, as he might have done with European football part of the schedule.",
      "He reserved his best performances for the Europa League last season, struggling to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League. However, a lack of midfield depth means it is too risky to let him go right now.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane believes the club should distance themselves from the possibility of paying a nine-figure fee for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "With just over two weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, United are still in the market for a midfielder, and Baleba has emerged as a top target.",
      "Since joining Brighton from Lille two years ago, the Cameroonian has gone from strength-to-strength, establishing himself as one of the most highly-rated midfielders in the world. He is capable of doing a little bit of everything in the engine room, meaning he has an attractive profile.",
      "Despite signing Manuel Ugarte in an attempt to fix their long-term midfield woes last summer, United still need fresh blood in that area of the team. Bruno Fernandes is a guaranteed starter ahead of Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal, but there is an ongoing debate about who should start next to him.",
      "Some outlets have suggested Brighton could demand £100million to sell Baleba amid his potential, meaning it feels incredibly unlikely United will be able to fund a deal for him before the end of this window. The Reds have already spent nearly £200m this summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "And in the opinion of former Reds midfield ace Keane, it is too early to be able to tell if Baleba is worthy of such an eye-watering price tag.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"I'd be surprised if it happened. Because I still think that kid, he's got to do a bit more.",
      "\"You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",
      "Since joining Brighton in August 2023, Baleba, 21, has made 77 appearances for the club, chipping in with four goals. Of his 77 Seagulls appearances, 61 of them have been made in the Premier League.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "After needing to build up his match sharpness after arriving from Brentford, Mbeumo started both of the aforementioned fixtures as the right-sided No.10. Fellow summer signing Matheus Cunha also started both games, starting the 2-2 draw with Everton up front and the 1-1 stalemate with Fiorentina as the left-sided No.10.",
      "There is a strong likelihood latest summer recruit Benjamin Sesko will join the aforementioned duo in attack against the Gunners, meaning Mbeumo is poised to occupy the right-sided No.10 spot.",

However, the club's minority owner did then clarify: \"I mean, I don't know, I don't have great instincts on that.\"",
      "Those comments came after a visit to their training ground in November 2023, a month after they appointed the Manchester United legend. A fortnight after the documentary was released, Rooney has now addressed the comments.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "During the episode, host Kelly Somers asked Rooney if they should expect any issues with his work ethic due to the show's frequency. He laughed in response to the question before replying, \"I saw that this week or last week from Tom Brady, and I think it was a very unfair comment.\"",
      "Rooney added: \"I think Tom came in once, which was the day before a game, where the day is a little bit lighter anyway. I don't think he really understood football that well at the time; maybe he does now.",

      "Hojlund knows the division well and has the chance to be a regular starter in Serie A which could be the catalyst to reigniting his career. Should he choose to leave, the Reds will need to replace him in some fashion whether that's by promoting from within or buying a new recruit.",
      "This is where the opportunity to sign a Premier League proven striker comes in. Aleksandar Mitrovic excelled at Fulham both in the Championship and Premier League before deciding to take up Al Hilal's offer of a move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Mitrovic has excelled at his new club too, but it seems that Al Hilal are now ready to move on. It is reported by Al Kass that Al Hilal are open to paying the £21m termination clause in Mitrovic's contract so that he can leave the club and free up a place in their team.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Should they do this, the 30-year-old would become a free agent and may pursue a return to the Premier League. As spending options for United, particularly on a second choice striker, are limited, bringing Mitrovic on a free transfer is ideal for the Reds.",
      "He is the perfect type of player to act as a mentor to Benjamin Sesko and may not demand the regular playing time that other options could. Mitrovic's arrival would also halt the need to promote Chido Obi too soon and allow Joshua Zirkzee to be used deeper where he clearly helps the team more.",

      "But according to the striker’s agent, that was the move he wanted, anyway.",

      "Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has revealed he is “very confident” that Carlos Baleba will stay amid interest from Manchester United, as he revealed the “only change” the midfielder has made.",
      "Baleba, 21, has quickly risen to being one of the most important players in the Seagulls’ side. He has been a crucial asset for the past two seasons, and as has happened with other Brighton stars in recent years, he’s being courted by big clubs.",
      "It’s expected that in 2026, he’ll have an array of sides on his tail, but for now, Manchester United are the big club going after him.",
      "Our friends at TEAMtalk have suggested though United know signing Baleba – who’s valued at over £100million – will blow their budget, they are preparing to land him and will deal with the consequences later.",
      "But amid United’s push, Brighton boss Hurzeler is not afraid. He has detailed his confidence that Baleba will stay prior to the start of the Seagulls’ Premier League season on Saturday.",
      "Hurzeler said:  “I am very, very confident.”",
      "“I didn’t see any change [from Carlos], he only changed his hair! He is enjoying being a Brighton player. He seems to be in a very good place, enjoying it with his team-mates.",
      "Though Baleba has been suffering with a knee injury, Hurzeler has stated the midfielder is: “is an option to start tomorrow.”",
      "It is not the first time in the last week that the Brighton boss has suggested he does not feel United will succeed with their interest in Baleba.",
      "When asked earlier in the week if he feared United, he said: “No chance.”",
      "“I don’t feel fear. I’m not afraid of anything because the only thing we can do is be the best version we can be every day, like work as hard as we can.",
      "“All the other things we can’t influence, so we really have to focus on us. For sure, we can’t spend the money like the big teams but one of our biggest values is togetherness. And if you stay together, if we try to push our limits and increase the boundaries, then I’m sure we can compete with the big teams.”",

      "Antony has recently been given an ultimatum by Manchester United, but is now said to be open to a shock new commitment which could help all parties.",
      "Antony spent the second half of last season out on loan with Real Betis. He immediately looked at home, and finished his spell there with nine goals and five assists in all competitions.",
      "It’s known that both he and the Spanish club want to reunite if possible, but so far, Betis have looked unable to drum up the required funds for the move for the United man.",
      "That issue could be taken off the table soon, though. According to Estadio Deportivo, one of the options being considered to ‘unblock the situation’ is a new deal being offered to the winger at Old Trafford.",
      "That is an option Antony is said to view ‘more favourably’ than in recent weeks.",
      "That is as it could open the door for a loan move which would be good for all parties. Antony will not want to be tied down to then sit on the bench, but this avenue should be good for him.",
      "If he was to go on loan in his current circumstances, with his contract ending in 2027, he’d have just a year left on his deal at the end of that, and United would either get a small fee, or Antony could see out the final year and leave for free.",
      "If he extends his deal, the Red Devils will surely be happier allowing him to go out on loan again, knowing there’s still a good chance of them receiving a fee in the future, particularly if Antony plays well.",
      "For Betis, a loan seems the best course of action as they don’t have to drum up cash for the winger, but they’ll be able to get him back on a short-term deal, potentially to pick up where he left off last term.",
      "It was suggested earlier in the week that Antony had been told he needs to accept an exit by the end of the week or the threat of him being sidelined until January looms.",
      "That would have been a huge shame for the forward in relation to his World Cup chances. He was in the latest Brazil squad off the back of his Betis performances, getting back into international contention for the first time since 2023.",
      "Continuing to play well at Betis would have given him the chance to stay in contention for Brazil and potentially to play in the World Cup.",
      "That gives the forward another reason to accept a contract offer, if he’s allowed a loan beyond that.",
      "Antony is angling for a return to Real Betis but his actions have reportedly not pleased the Man Utd hierarchy.",
      "According to reports, a ‘new suitor’ has emerged in the race to sign Manchester United star Antony amid interest from a Premier League club.",
      "Antony has turned down two offers to move away from Man Utd as he has his heart set on a transfer to Real Betis this summer, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have received a blow in their desire to offload Antony, though there is fresh interest in another expensive flop, according to reports.",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Fulham\nFulham appear to have forgotten how to sign players but they have got around to making a ‘tentative enquiry’ for the Man Utd striker. The Cottagers are likely to have a hole in their attack and cash burning a hole in their pocket amounting to what United might demand for Hojlund. But you would expect the ex-Atalanta striker to favour loan interest from Italy.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. It comes down to this: Brighton value Baleba at £100million. Man Utd do not. Are Brighton likely to come down? No. No they are not.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",

      "16) Morten Hjulmand – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nIf Brighton refuse to sell Baleba – we expect they will for what United are willing to pay – then Hjulmand is next on their list, apparently. The Dane has worked with Ruben Amorim and knows his system but links with United pre-date the manager’s appointment at Old Trafford. The 26-year-old would be available for around half the price Brighton expect for Baleba.",
      "15) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",
      "",
      "14) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",

      "",
      "13) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",

That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs are close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "10) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Christopher Nkunku in as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Roma\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days and Besiktas have emerged as a possible destination for Sancho, but a move to Roma is now looking likely. The Italians have reportedly bid £20m for the 25-year-old. That being true, United should be snapping their hand off.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Omari Hutchinson – Ipswich to Nottingham Forest\nA club-record £37.5m deal is close to being agreed. It’s not fully agreed, but it’s looking good.",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Nottingham Forest\nBlimey. Forest are moving mad now that their Europa League spot has been confirmed. £26m for Kalimuendo is good business. £37.5m for Hutchinson is…interesting business.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nIt turns out that Ouattara has been an unhappy bunny on the south coast, and Brentford are prepared to make him happy with a key role in their attack. More of a Bryan Mbeumo replacement than one for Wissa, this deal could still help Newcastle finally land the 28-year-old.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nForest have won the race for McAtee, who had attracted interest from Germany. They will pay £30m and City have managed to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on clause. They are terrified of a Cole Palmer repeat.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. A deal worth £39million plus another £4million in add-ons was agreed and Ramsey flew to Tyneside for a medical on Thursday evening.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Giovanni Leoni – Parma to Liverpool\nLiverpool want Leoni in addition to Guehi and it seems they have got him. Apparently, a deal has been agreed worth £26million plus add-ons. So the 18-year-old has flown in and should be a Liverpool player by the weekend."

      "READ: Ten Man Utd alternatives to Carlos Baleba features Chelsea, Spurs and Aston Villa stars",
      "After reports emerged on Thursday that Roma had made a bid for Sancho, Italian journalist Nicola Schira has revealed that the Serie A giants have ‘reached an agreement’ to sign him.",
      "Schira wrote on X: ‘AS Roma have reached an agreement with Manchester United to sign Jadon Sancho for €22M. Roma are now pushing to try to close the deal: ready a contract until 2030 for the winger and are working to agree personal terms on the salary with Sancho.’",
      "Man Utd have had to accept a lower fee than they wanted for Sancho with former Everton chairman Keith Wyness predicting they would get slightly less than the €22m (£19m) they have agreed with Roma.",
      "Wyness told Football Insider: “I think they realise Sancho is not going anywhere for any sort of high price.",
      "“We’ve been critical about Man United many times over the last few months, and again they’re almost rolling back on this saying, the bomb squad that we’ve set up, if we want them back, they’ll have to come and integrate again.",
      "“That’s a little bit like closing the door after the horse has bolted. I think they’ve realised that there is no hope of a relationship there with Sancho. He’s going to have to go, and it’s a case of finding whoever will buy him.",
      "“I think it’s £15m-£17m. You may get a deal even lower than that for a buying club. Which is extraordinary, really. But look, there’s a talent there somewhere, and somebody’s going to take a chance at that sort of price. So yeah, he’s been priced to sell.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Manchester United have received a £20million offer from Roma for out-of-favour winger Jadon Sancho.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s time at United could soon be over as Serie A’s Roma have reportedly lodged a bid for the 25-year-old.",
      "Having returned to Old Trafford after a failed loan spell at Chelsea, Jadon Sancho is struggling to find his next destination in football.",
      "A wantaway Manchester United attacker is said to be liked ‘more than any other attacking option’ on a Serie A club’s shortlist, in a deal which could hurt Juventus after ...",
      "According to reports, Manchester United flop Jadon Sancho has ‘signalled’ his intention to make a significant ‘sacrifice’ to seal his preferred transfer.",
      "Manchester United star Luke Shaw has given his backing to head coach Ruben Amorim and hit out at four Red Devils “stragglers”."

      "",
      "10) Burnley – £111.89m\nFor their latest attempt at Premier League survival, Burnley have decided to build around some Chelsea cast-offs and some loanees whose deals were made permanent.",
      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; they desperately need some transfer depth, even if the Super Cup clash with PSG was encouraging.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £132.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd ‘contacts are continuing on a daily basis’ with Brighton and Carlos Baleba’s agent.",
      "The Red Devils have transformed their attack in the summer transfer market with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all arriving.",
      "But Man Utd are still looking to bring in more players with a defensive midfielder and goalkeeper top of their list before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Brighton midfielder Baleba is their priority target in midfield with the Red Devils prepared to see if the conditions are right for them to make an official offer.",
      "Speaking on Thursday, Romano said on his YouTube channel: “For Carlos Baleba, the contacts are still ongoing. This is a difficult deal for Manchester United, not just financially but also in terms of strategy.",
      "“Brighton at the moment are still not giving an official number to Manchester United. They did a similar situation with Moises Caicedo two years ago when he went to Chelsea, they were not giving a number, not giving an indication. Then when Liverpool arrived with an official bid, Chelsea offered a bit more and signed the player. Brighton are not giving a number for Baleba and keep saying they do not want to sell.",
      "READ: Ten Man Utd alternatives to Carlos Baleba features Chelsea, Spurs and Aston Villa stars",
      "“What is important to mention is Manchester United are still there, still in contact with the agents, still working on a deal. They want to understand how high is the wall from Brighton but they are still working on the Carlos Baleba. They are not giving up. Difficult? Yes. Very difficult? Of course. But, Man United are still there.",
      "“The player is not closing the doors at all. Personal terms are not a problem, European football for Baleba is not a problem. He would go to Man United immediately, I can guarantee that. But club to club, we are still far from a solution.”",
      "Before Romano added on X on Friday morning: ‘Man United keep working on Carlos Baleba deal. Sales (Garnacho, Antony, Sancho) could be key for higher bid. Initial approach to discuss with Brighton ready, deal difficult; #BHAFC want to keep + eventually sell in 2026. Carlos, keen on the move.’",
      "While in another update, Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Carlos Baleba, contacts are continuing on a daily basis with his agents and also with Brighton.",
      "“For Manchester United to present an official bid and to understand if it is worth negotiating with Brighton, it is important to see outgoings.",
      "“Selling players or finding solutions for players who are not part of the squad is really important.”",
      "Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has revealed he is “very confident” that Carlos Baleba will stay amid interest from Manchester United, as he revealed the “only change” the midfielder has made.",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives.",
      "Man Utd have identified Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber as a potential alternative to Brighton star Carlos Baleba, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are in front of neighbours Man City in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton this summer, according to reports.\nThe Red Devils are looking to continue…",
      "Manchester United have made a decision on Carlos Baleba as Brighton ‘have to listen to offers’ for the midfielder, who will be their ‘next major sale’.",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has demanded that the Red Devils see through a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba this summer, according to reports.\nThe Red Devils have…"

      "The 2025 summer transfer window is in full swing and there are a whole raft of deals agreed. This list will change roughly a trillion times over the coming weeks.",
      "If you want a full list of just Premier League transfers then this is your link.",
      "Players are ranked by size of the initial fee, with add-ons stated.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool) – £100m rising to £116m\nLiverpool’s quiet summer of 2024 certainly isn’t being repeated 12 months down the line with another Premier League trophy in the cabinet. And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United) – £66.2m rising to £73.4m with add-ons\nThe Red Devils turned to the 22-year-old after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, as they have taken a huge risk in a Rasmus Hojlund repeat when Ollie Watkins was right there.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",
      "",
      "8) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "9) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",
      "",
      "10) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting to Arsenal) – £55m rising to £63m with add-ons\nIt is finally done. At last we can rest for five minutes.",
      "",
      "11) Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea) – £55m rising to £60m with add-ons\nTwo years after joining Brighton from Watford for a club-record fee, the Seagulls have doubled their money on the Brazilian with the usual sale to Chelsea.",
      "",
      "12) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Tottenham) – £55m\nThis move will go down well in east London, we’re sure.",
      "",
      "13) Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth to Paris Saint-Germain) – £54.3m rising to £57m with add-ons\nBournemouth held firm for as long as they could but were only able to resist the European champions for so long before making their third sale of a defender for at least £40m this summer.",
      "",
      "14) Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle United) – £52m rising to £55m with add-ons\nNewcastle United have finally landed a right winger after missing out on targets in recent windows. Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak is a very fun front three…",
      "",
      "15) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",
      "",
      "16) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nChelsea didn’t have enough forwards already.",
      "",
      "17) Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nThere was an actual petition launched against the signing of Madueke, who might well have come in handy last season when it turned out Raheem Sterling was no Bukayo Saka.",
      "",
      "18) Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan to Manchester City) – £46.6m rising to £59.2m with add-ons\nThe last of four signings rushed through in the first transfer window to prepare for the Club World Cup, as officially Serie A’s best midfielder in 2024/25 Reijnders might be the most intriguing.",
      "",
      "19) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool to Al Hilal) – £45.9m plus undisclosed add-ons\nLiverpool might have just received the extra funds needed to sign Alexander Isak…",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma makes an awful lot of sense to replace Andre Onana as No.1 and won’t cost the world, but while we can absolutely see why Amorim has pinpointed Carlos Baleba as his ‘perfect’ midfielder, reports suggest the Red Devils aren’t able to drum up the £100m-plus required to sign him from Brighton this summer.",
      "They absolutely need a midfielder in a similar mould though, and as luck would have it, the great guys at FBRef have a very nifty list of 10 players from across Europe’s top five leagues who have similar characteristics to Baleba. Namely being an aggressive, tough-tackling midfielder who can go past opponents with the ball at his feet.",
      "",
      "Abdoulaye Toure (Le Havre, £2.5m)\nTen Ligue 1 goals from midfield for Le Havre last season sounds very promising indeed but a 15th-place finish having conceded 71 goals does raise the question as to how good Toure was at his primary job of protecting the defence.",
      "And there’s a suspicion of him taking a ‘f*** it, I’m going to enjoy myself’ approach to football at the age of 31 given his 11 previous seasons of senior football have yielded 17 goals in total.",
      "",
      "Felix Nmecha (Borussia Dortmund, £24m)\nOne that got away from Manchester City, not in the sense that he would ever have played for them, but because he left them on a free transfer in 2021, two years before being sold by Wolfsburg to Borussia Dortmund for £26m.",
      "United have been linked with the 24-year-old, but David Ornstein claimed ‘interest’ hasn’t turned into anything more concrete.",
      "",
      "Amadou Onana (Aston Villa, £43m)\nSigned for £50m from Everton last summer, Onana had a largely forgettable first season at Villa Park, partly down to a couple of injuries but also because of Unai Emery’s typical preference for Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara at the base of midfield.",
      "That’s a tricky partnership to break in fairness to Onana, who would undoubtedly improve United’s midfield but his transfer may also feel a tad underwhelming, as often appears to be the case when he plays.",
      "",
      "Jean-Eudus Aholou (free agent)\nUnconfirmed reports suggest Qatari side Umm Salal SC have already swooped in ahead of United to sign the 31-year-old journeyman, who represented seven Ligue 1 clubs before ‘amicably terminating his contract’ with Angers this summer.",
      "",
      "Mario Martin (Real Madrid, £1.3m)\nAfter 20 La Liga games for Real Valladolid last season the 21-year-old’s off to Getafe on loan this term. We wouldn’t be at all surprised to see Manchester United making a £50m-plus move for the graduate of the Real Madrid academy in 2027, because why sign burgeoning talent on the cheap when you can pay big bucks for them after developing elsewhere?",
      "",
      "Johnny Cardoso (Atletico Madrid, £22m)\nLinked with a move to Old Trafford earlier in the window as part of a possible Antony haggle, to the extent that there are several ‘Welcome to Manchester United’ videos on YouTube of the USMNT international, who instead swapped Real Betis for Atletico, which is in itself enough to suggest he would be the right sort of player to aid United. Diego Simeone loves a midfield pr*ck.",
      "",
      "Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham, £26m)\nHe was excellent against Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup and we love watching an on-song Bentancur, but he’s arguably the most Tottenham of all the Tottenham players, somehow managing to have the mercuriality of a 20-year-old winger as a 28-year-old defensive midfielder. We have every confidence that a move to Old Trafford would swallow him whole.",
      "",
      "Anton Stach (Leeds, £12m)\nAs much as we would enjoy the volume of boiled piss leaching into the rivers of West Yorkshire as a result of a player Leeds signed this summer moving immediately to Manchester United, it’s unfortunately unlikely to happen.",
      "",
      "Dario Essugo (Chelsea, £17m)\nWe have a sneaky feeling Chelsea may have another very, very good midfield destroyer on their hands in Essugo, who’s only just arrived from Sporting but will need at least one significant injury to play anything more than a bit-part role under Enzo Maresca this season, with Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Andrey Santos all very much above him in the pecking order. A loan move would be a smart option, but that’s not going to be to United.",
      "",
      "Seydouba Cisse (Leganes, £2.6m)\nRelegated with Leganes last season and a lack of interest in his services from sides remaining in the top tier suggests Cisse is not the big fix Amorim needs as the base of his midfield.",

Player welfare, player shmelfare, and while our football itch has been scratched by that delightful bleeding of one season into the next, so too has our great desire to see big football clubs spend the GDP of small countries on new players in a transfer window featuring several middle fingers to the PSR overlords.",
      "All that, the hope of a genuine Premier League title race and the promise of MORE FOOTBALL on TV than ever before and we’re about as giddy as we’ve ever been ahead of a new season and quite the opening weekend of action.",
      "Before you carry on, check out our at-this-point perfect pre-season predictions.",
      "",
      "It’s certainly a point of great intrigue and you can bet your bottoms we will be knee-jerking with the best of them to judge which of the two is the best thing ever and which is therefore a massive flop in comparison on the basis of this single Premier League outing. The only thing conceivably better than both being absolute horses*t would be for Rasmus Hojlund and Kai Havertz to start ahead of them.",
      "This is a much kinder opening fixture for Amorim than it is for Arteta, as all he needs to do is show tangible improvement on last term by not getting walloped by a side for whom anything less than the Premier League title this season isn’t good enough.",
      "Defeat for Arteta to this Manchester United, because it will still be this 15th-placed worst-ever Manchester United despite summer signings, will bring about immediate calls for his sacking from those horrible people and institutions (us) who feed on that sort of thing.",

      "Team to watch: Chelsea\nTipped to win the actual Premier League title by two of our boldest predictors after arguably the best six months of any football club in the world. Champions League qualification was shortly followed by completing the European trophy set before they spanked Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final to secure the whole trophy shebang.",
      "Goalscoring concerns have been eased and then some through the signings of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap, while further forwards who may or may not be brilliant have been bought to replace those who may or may not have been brilliant and turned out to be the latter.",
      "There are still doubts in these parts over Enzo Maresca’s style of football but no-one will care as long as they’re winning, and we suspect they may do that rather a lot, starting with Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on Sunday before a very soft start to the season then sees them face West Ham (A), Fulham (H) and Brentford (A).",

      "We imagine he’s dreading this season, not least their opener away at Villa Park on Saturday, in which either William Osula or Anthony Gordon will be leading his line. Having long thought Newcastle would at some point have to upgrade Howe in order to take the next step and challenge for the most major of major honours, we’re now left wondering whether they even deserve him.",

      "That can only be good news for him as he makes his Premier League bow against Bournemouth on Friday night, with Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo, Romelu Lukaku and Antony among those in the top 10 most expensive signings of all time who – at least initially – struggled to cope with the pressure of their price tags.",
      "We don’t see Wirtz as a player who will hide in games or struggle to get involved, and we can’t wait to see how he fits into a Liverpool side who never looked as though they were missing a player of his enviable skill in a playmaker role as they stormed to the title last season.",

      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "13=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "9) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nAnother really interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four points adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we’ve said elsewhere, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "5) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "2=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "1) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season has been encouraging, at least, and an opening run of games against Forest, Villa and Sunderland offers a realistic shot at an acceptable start given those clubs all have issues of their own, but things look (potentially) far choppier between the September and October international breaks with games against Chelsea, Fulham and both Manchester clubs.",
      "",
      "",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",
      "La Liga giants Real Madrid are planning an ‘early offer’ to sign youngster Max Dowman from Premier League side Arsenal, according to reports."

      "15) Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m): £127m\nA key part of City’s treble-winning team in 2022/2023, but it is odd for him to be City’s club-record signing.",

      "10) Arsenal v Manchester United – The Proper No. 9 derby\nObviously not a new rivalry, but one imbued with a different layer to finally propel it into the modern age.",
      "Their meetings are almost exclusively used as an excuse for indulging in nostalgia and reminiscence, or lamenting how the game just isn’t as compelling or rough around the edges as it once was.",
      "Trying to recall what happened between them last season is difficult but Pizzagate, Ruud van Nistelrooy versus Martin Keown, Roy Keane protecting Gary Neville from Patrick Vieira in the tunnel and Alex Ferguson pronouncing ‘Japan’ weirdly are all firmly embedded in the psyche and form a routine part of the pre-game build-up when the Gunners face the Red Devils.",
      "As a spectacle, the only hope of salvaging something meaningful from Arsenal v Manchester United is to feed into the contemporary phenomenon of manufacturing rivalries between players. And Viktor Gyokeres versus Benjamin Sesko has been ripening all summer long for that particular picking.",
      "The dream scenario of Gyokeres flopping for Arsenal while Sesko single-footedly drags Manchester United towards competence remains live, but really the alternative timeline in which Gyokeres delivers the title and Sesko proves to be a hilariously expensive gamble gone wrong is every bit as fun and enticing.",
      "It certainly feels a more even battle than the Erling Haaland v Darwin Nunez feud built entirely out of laborious comparisons between two pricey centre-forwards who happened to be signed at the same time by clubs with substantial fanbases.",

      "",
      "9) Leeds v Sunderland – The Summer Spend derby\nWhile sacking Peter Reid and flirting with financial implosion was the strongest common denominator between Leeds and Sunderland prior to this summer, promotion has pulled them closer together despite being remarkably far apart in their approach to Premier League preparation.",
      "Leeds have recruited sensibly if slowly, focusing on defensive additions to solidify their spine and avoid having to make another panicked May phone call to Sam Allardyce.",
      "Fees have been spent on a goalkeeper, two centre-halves, a left-back and two more defensive-minded midfielders. The free agent Lukas Nmecha has been their only attacking signing after a move for Igor Paixao proved too difficult.",

      "“With such high stakes surrounding today’s fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.”",

      "The PGMOL response never was revealed but could well have amounted to Howard Webb pointing out they should probably just have beaten a Manchester United side which had already lost 22 games last season by then, regardless of the referee chosen.",

      "3) Newcastle v Liverpool – The £150m Valuation derby\nWhen the signing of a potential £79m forward is only ever presented as a secondary plot point to the wider overall narrative, you know a lot of water has gathered under the bridge connecting Newcastle and Liverpool.",
      "A wise sage once referred to their rivalry as ‘toxic’ because of 1) some results, 2) Newcastle once poaching an analyst from Liverpool, 3) Liverpool being one of many clubs to oppose their takeover, and 4) Liverpool having spent some money more than four decades ago, but this summer did mark a definitive turn in their relationship.",
      "The Ekitike hijack could be forgiven by a club who have known nothing different in this transfer window. A target choosing to join someone else is part and parcel of the game, and losing a race to the Premier League champions who will be among the Champions League favourites can be brushed off quickly.",
      "But the Isak saga has cast an uncomfortable cloud over Newcastle’s summer and left a sour taste. Even when handed all the cards of a three-year contract with no release clause and no need to make a book-balancing sale, the Magpies have looked thoroughly unconvincing with their hard-line stance.",
      "They did land one shot with the loaded claim that Liverpool had ‘bottled’ their first and as yet only actual bid for Isak but there is a clear sense that even if he stays, the damage has been done.",
      "The best-case scenario for Newcastle is that they will be without their best player for the first couple of games of the season, and perhaps on a mental level well beyond that, before he recovers something close to the form which has made him so desirable.",

      "More than a month has passed and not only have Spurs not invested that £60m elsewhere, they have also lost to a probable season-long injury the sort of player Gibbs-White would have shared the creative burden with.",
      "Daniel Levy still struggles to understand Spurs fans and was given a public crash course in Evangelos Marinakis this summer too.

      "Friday 15 August 2025 09:34, UK",
      "“We struggled without a reference as a striker.” That was Ruben Amorim’s verdict on Manchester United’s final pre-season game against Fiorentina. “We have a new player, so we will see.” The hope is that Benjamin Sesko can make the difference.",
      "The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.",
      "But the modern United has become, perhaps, the ultimate test of that theory. At £73.7m, taking the summer spending on their new forward trio to over £200m, Ruben Amorim has certainly been backed. That brings pressure to make it work - and quickly.",
      "Amorim has been open about the fact that he is fortunate still to be in the job, reliant on the support of those above him after a miserable run of results that led to United's worst league finish in over 50 years. The consensus is that the mood has now changed.",
      "Luke Shaw recently admitted that the environment inside the club could be \"extremely negative\" and \"quite toxic\" before going on to claim that it is different now. Unhappy players have moved on. New ones have arrived with a point to prove. A cultural reset.",
      "Time on the training ground has helped too and the absence of European football means that there will be more of that throughout the campaign. Amorim will have the opportunity to demonstrate why he was regarded as a top young coach in the first place.",
      "The summer spending raises expectations, however. United are already fifth favourites for the title. Fail to secure European qualification and they will be out of Europe for back-to-back seasons for the first time since the ban on English clubs was lifted.",
      "The challenge is that Sesko is not the finished article. For now, at least, United are not in that market. And their opening Premier League game of the season offers an intriguing contrast. Opponents Arsenal tracked Sesko for a long time, a move seeming imminent.",
      "In the end, they opted for Viktor Gyokeres. The Sweden international has plundered well over 100 goals for club and country over the past two seasons at Sporting - more than Sesko has yet managed in his career. But he is 27. A signing for the here and the now.",
      "Maybe that reflects Arsenal's sense of urgency, a side that has been so close to major silverware in recent seasons, one that is seeking the final piece of their own puzzle. United are earlier in the process, betting on Sesko to develop into the superior player.",
      "His goal output might not be as immediately impressive as that of Gyokeres, but his 39 goals for RB Leipzig in all competitions over the past two seasons means that he has scored more than anyone else aged under 23 in Europe's five major leagues in that time.",
      "It puts him top of an illustrious list, although the presence of another name a little further down it is a reminder that, as former United coach Rene Meulensteen puts it, they are doing \"basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund\" with this signing.",
      "That is to say, United are spending big hoping to develop their own elite forward. Hojlund scored nine for Atalanta in Serie A prior to his arrival. Joshua Zirkzee managed 11 for Bologna before signing the following summer. For Sesko, it was 13 at Leipzig.",
      "That might temper the expectations a little. But speak to others and they will tell you that Sesko has better instincts. He is a player capable of finding space in the penalty box, someone who can get his shots away unusually quickly for a player of his size.",
      "He is not yet Alexander Isak and that is reflected in the price tag. But Isak was 22 years old, as Sesko is now, when he arrived in the Premier League after a season in which he scored six times in 32 games for Real Sociedad in LaLiga. That is the trajectory to target.",
      "Making it happen is the difficult part and it is now Amorim's job to help Sesko succeed where so many in a United shirt have struggled in recent years and fulfil his potential. Flanked by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, there is at least creativity around him.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are strong ball carriers who draw others towards them, creating space. \"It is going to be special,\" said Amorim of his two new wide forwards after the Fiorentina game. \"I think that they are maybe at 50, 60 per cent of what they can do.\"",
      "Another word of caution, though. There is some risk that the opposite is true. There were only three players in the Premier League who outperformed their expected goals by six or more last season. One was Chris Wood. The other two were Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Of the 10 previous players to have done that over the past eight years, only Heung-Min Son has scored more goals in the following season - and he dipped dramatically the year after. The vast majority of players have seen their goal output regress to the mean.",
      "One of the reasons cited for Liverpool's signing of Hugo Ekitike is that he actually underperformed his expected goals - they recognised the potential for his numbers to explode. United appear to have gone the opposite route, trying to sign elite finishers.",
      "Sesko could fall into that category having scored 27 Bundesliga goals over the past two seasons from chances with an expected-goals value of just 17.6. Could he be another Son, another Harry Kane, who consistently finishes better than the metrics suggest?",
      "If so, it could define United's season and with it Amorim's reign. There are other factors, of course. The balance in midfield is a concern and the wing-backs will be key. But it is this new forward line that will probably dictate how the rebuild is perceived.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have Premier League pedigree which will buy them some time. Rather unfairly, the referendum on young Sesko may come sooner than that. A swift impact against Arsenal, with Gyokeres among the opposition, would be most helpful."

      "The Premier League's elite clubs are rebuilding.",
      "This summer has seen the so-called Big Six spend in excess of £1bn between them on new signings. With several weeks of the transfer window still to go, the numbers will continue to rise.",
      "Liverpool are leading the way as they aim to consolidate their Premier League title win but Chelsea are close to their total for money spent, with Arsenal, Manchester City, and Manchester United next on the list respectively, and Spurs not far behind them.",
      "There is particular intrigue around the Manchester clubs.",
      "City recorded their lowest points total under Pep Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term. United plumbed far greater depths as they finished 15th and also failed to win silverware.",
      "So, are they on track to bounce back and enjoy the success their fans crave in the new season? Or is the road to the top longer? Much will depend on whether they can master the art of the rebuild, a process Sir Alex Ferguson once said he believed could take up to four years.",
      "Pep Guardiola and Manchester City have of course been here before.",
      "How they would love a repeat of the successful rebuild overseen early in his tenure following his arrival from Bayern Munich, when City recovered from a difficult first campaign, like the one they have just had, to win the first of many titles in 2017/18.",
      "\"They are one of the exceptions to that four-year rule,\" says Neville.",
      "\"Jose Mourinho came into Chelsea and won their first league title in a long, long time in his first season, creating a kind of unity straight away. Pep Guardiola got a great side that won the title in the space of two years at Manchester City.\"",
      "Neville also mentions Arne Slot's achievement in winning the Premier League straight after succeeding the legendary Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. \"I would say it was a very different team than under Klopp, with different components and ingredients.\"",
      "What they all have in common, and something key to a successful rebuild in Neville's eyes, is that they inherited the right type of characters in the dressing room.",
      "\"You think of what Slot was handed last season: [Virgil] Van Dijk, Alisson, [Mohamed] Salah, [Andrew] Robertson, [Alexis] Mac Allister, Trent [Alexander-Arnold].",
      "\"They are five or six proven winners at the highest level and they have been around the block. They've got pride and ego and they are not going to sit there and use the fact there's a new manager coming in as an excuse not to perform well.",
      "\"Players can hide behind managers. But if you've got good characters and leaders, people who have standards in their personal lives, you're going to get a better outcome.",
      "\"Slot harnessed that. He did a good job with those leaders. But he is not the one in the dressing room. People may or may not know this, but managers might not go in the dressing room at the training ground even for one minute during the week.",
      "\"For all those hours, it is policed by the senior players.\"",
      "Heavy investment was of course vital to the success of those previous Chelsea and Manchester City's rebuilds. But both Mourinho and Guardiola also inherited senior players to build around.",
      "For Mourinho at Chelsea, it was John Terry and Frank Lampard. Guardiola could call on Fernandinho, Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva at City.",
      "Guardiola has some similar characters now in Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, among others. At United, though, Amorim inherited very different personnel to the dressing room Neville experienced there in his playing days.",
      "\"For us it was Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes, Steve Bruce. Then when me, [Paul] Scholesy and others got older, it was us. When we left, others took over,\" he explains.",
      "\"You're asking those players in the dressing room to set the standards, to make sure negativity doesn't creep in. The people who sap energy, close them off straight away. Don't let them drain you, the people who constantly whinge in a negative way\"",
      "Amorim is still in the process of overhauling his dressing room as he aims to reverse a years-long slide from their success under Ferguson. Manchester United have signed three new attackers in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko but are still struggling to shift numerous unwanted players.",
      "\"This is a really unique situation,\" says Neville. \"I said before that you don't get three or four years to build a team, but because of Manchester United's relentless poor form over two, three, four or five years, it will take quite a bit to unwind that.",
      "\"Amorim has got players he quite clearly doesn't want and doesn't like, players on huge money, some of whom have cost huge money. And even if you do get them out, some of their wages will probably have to be subsidised by the club.",
      "\"So, I think he has a minimum of a two-and-a-half-year build to get to the point he wants with his unique system and buying the players he wants to fit that, just because of what has gone on there previously, but he's going to have to demonstrate progress.",
      "\"The problem he has is that you've got a top five now who like they are getting into the Champions League and the penalty for not being in the Champions League is big now because all these clubs - United, Villa, Newcastle, Chelsea - are on the edge on PSR.",
      "\"It's big for them if they drop out of those Champions League places. So Amorim has got to be relatively successful, which means finishing in the top four or top five, all while building a new team and recruiting the players he wants.\"",
      "Circumstances matter too when it comes to rebuilding efficiently. Guardiola knows that well given the importance of expiring contracts to his first Manchester City overhaul. A long list of departures in 2017 gave him space to reshape his squad.",
      "The list of players who reached the ends of their deals after Guardiola's first season included Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna and Jesus Navas. This summer, by contrast, the only one feels like a significant loss in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Guardiola points out there was a significant loss back in 2017 too. \"In that moment, we made one big mistake which was to not keep Jesus Navas with us,\" he says.",
      "\"I think he would have helped us a lot for the next years because he was a player who could play as a full-back, as a full-back inside, as a right-winger. He was incredible.",
      "\"For the rest, the club decided they needed new, fresh energy, so that's why we rebuilt. They bought some unbelievable players like Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva; top-class players who helped us start to do what we have done.\"",
      "Manchester City are having to work harder to shift players this time around. Their signings so far this summer have left them with a squad of 33 as things stand.",
      "Their plight last season shows the importance of forward planning. Could City's drop-off have been avoided if they had acted sooner to refresh their personnel?",
      "\"It's bloody hard when you've got a team that's won the treble, and a group of players who have been so good,\" says Neville. \"But they do tend to grow a little bit old together.",
      "\"It's about how you change it and when you change it when you have been as successful as they have been. To do it after a treble is the most difficult time.\"",
      "Neville sees some parallels between the plight of City's treble-winning team and that of United's in 1998/99.",
      "\"It felt like we only signed one or two players in the two years after the treble. We won the league in those years but then we saw a sharp decline and we only won one of the next four.",
      "\"You get this euphoric moment winning a treble, where you've built an unbelievable team, but within a couple of years they grow a little bit old together and you've got a situation where you can fall off the edge of a cliff and end up having to make big changes.\"",
      "Neville describes Manchester City's current rebuild as Guardiola's \"toughest job\" in management. \"You get to the point where you think, 'will he win it next season, or will it take two or three years?'\" he says. But the man himself sees it differently.",
      "\"The most challenging summer was when I was chosen to be the manager of the second team at Barcelona and prove myself to the board,\" he says with a smile.",
      "\"Then the challenge was to take over the Barcelona first team and prove myself, and after that go to Germany after the legend Jupp Heynckes had won the treble, when my German language was a disaster, to convince the players to keep going and winning.",
      "\"Then it was arriving here and in the first press conference they said, 'the club have brought you here to win the Champions League', and I said, 'wait a minute, please!' After that I was 'Fraudiola' and it was a disaster in the seasons we didn't win it.\"",
      "Guardiola is eager to point out that he saw progress even in his fraught first season, when he was assisted by now Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City finished 15 points behind eventual Premier League champions Chelsea.",
      "\"In the first season we played really, really well in moments,\" he says. \"Always with Mikel we talk about that, that in that first season we started to build something. This season is not the most difficult one because we did it. We proved we could do it.\"",
      "Guardiola is encouraged by how his side finished last season too, even if it ended in the disappointment of a second consecutive FA Cup final loss at Wembley, this time to Crystal Palace.",
      "\"I didn't like the way we lost against Man Utd in the [previous] FA Cup final. I was grumpy. This season, I was sad because we played really, really well. They know it. They knew we were there, the spirit was there, the chances were there.",
      "\"We missed something we have to recover next season. That belongs to me, it belongs to the players, it belongs to all of us. And after that we will create a team which can compete game by game and start in a better position in the Premier League.\"",
      "Guardiola stresses that pain forms part of every rebuild.",
      "That was true even for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, who mastered the art during his historic Old Trafford tenure, creating a series of trophy-winning teams.",
      "\"Each transition came with a bit of turbulence,\" says Neville.",
      "\"We then lost the first game of the next season and Alan Hansen said you can't win anything with kids. So, it was a lot of pressure at that time, changing and transitioning, and that is something you have to manage in a rebuild.",
      "\"We didn't win the league for three years between 2003 and 2006. That's the longest I ever went in my career. That was a point where Mourinho was absolutely on his game and [Arsene] Wenger's football was sensational. They were brilliant teams.",
      "\"Our recruitment wasn't the best. It took a while for Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to come through, for Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra to settle in.",
      "\"That was the time where I thought, 'will we win the league again?' We did it in 2006 and that set us up for another five or six years of winning titles because that team was amazing. But the key was the foresight and bravery Sir Alex had to let players go.\"",
      "The principles behind that ruthlessness remain crucial in today's game. It is about lowering the age of the squad and striking a balance between youth and experience while ensuring there is room for long-term growth and development.",
      "\"I used to think of it as a conveyer belt,\" says Neville. \"We came in in '92, '93, '94. We were the young ones at the start of the conveyor belt and we had the older ones falling off. We eventually moved on to the end of the conveyor belt and fell off ourselves.",
      "\"I always thought you needed a group of players that were young, a group of players in their peak, and then a few, four or five, who were in their 30s and set the standards. I think that was the sort of age profile Sir Alex considered when building teams, but there was always some turbulence.\"",
      "As their respective rebuilds continue, Manchester United and City will hope the turbulence eases for them in the new campaign.",

      "Friday 15 August 2025 10:04, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows is back in the Premier League predictions chair to provide his insight and best bets.",
      "We are so back.",
      "Bournemouth, with Andoni Iraola at the helm, won't just park the bus on this Friday night trip to Anfield under the lights. This is a side that presses high, plays boldly, and can punch back when falling behind.",
      "Expect end-to-end football, counter-attacks from both teams in a league that is now a fast-break central, and a few defensive wobbles to crank up the tension. Liverpool are going to take a few weeks to gain cohesion and chemistry across their new-look backline.",
      "This opens the door for Bournemouth to add to the scoring, so Liverpool to win and both teams to score at 6/4 with Sky Bet should go close.",
      "The case for an Aston Villa win is very compelling at 6/5 with Sky Bet when assessing all the evidence.",
      "Alexander Isak is missing for Newcastle in a saga that has been managed appallingly by those advising him - it didn't need to be like this.",
      "Of course, Eddie Howe has managed the situation perfectly, giving Isak the disappointed dad treatment rather than going too heavy on him in public. Howe is a master in these situations, but one area in management where he does struggle, looking at his recor,d is getting a team to start the season fast.",
      "Across the first three league games of a season for each club he's managed, he's only working at a 1.25 points per game ratio (P24 W8 D6 L10) and a winless pre-season won't have helped preparations for this one.",
      "Across the Champions League and Premier League, Villa are unbeaten in 24 home games, winning the last seven - including beating Newcastle 4-1 in April.",
      "If there's one fixture flying under the radar that screams goals at the prices this weekend, it's this one. I'm here banging the drum for the over 2.5 goals line at 4/6 with Sky Bet as a base to build a bet from.",
      "Brighton like to be positive at home and play with attacking risk in committing bodies forward, but that leaves gaps which expose their centre-backs. That's why backing the over line in their games last season was a betting-friendly angle, with 27 of their 38 games producing three or more goals.",
      "This has the smell of a goalless grind, doesn't it?",
      "I'm struggling to see how Sunderland score goals at this level. They only scored 1.29 goals per game last season - the eighth-highest in the Sky Bet Championship. Even Sheffield Wednesday averaged more.",
      "Regis Le Bris is someone who is suited to defence-first football and that is very hard to implement in this league with the quality in opposition ranks. Low-probability chances get taken.",
      "Le Bris will want to make this a scrap, kill the tempo, and smother the game. It's Sunderland's best chance for points.",
      "I wouldn't talk you out of the 0-0 correct score at a juicy price of 11/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Now I'm not for one second suggesting Scott Parker's side are about to storm North London and walk away with three points, but I do think the markets are disrespecting Burnley's potential to keep this competitive and overrating Spurs slightly based on their Super Cup heroics.",
      "This is a tough gig for Thomas Frank. Expectation is internally very high and Frank has no experience of managing workloads within a squad asked to compete across four competitions.",
      "They looked strong and organised for large parts vs PSG, but I think we need to treat that piece of form very carefully as the French side were clearly miles undercooked.",
      "Burnley aren't going to change their rigid and pragmatic style going up a level. This could be fiddly for Spurs as Burnley should be able to cover their +1.5 goal start handicap at 4/5 with Sky Bet, meaning we just need them not to lose by two or more goals.",
      "Jhon Arias could just take the Premier League by storm in this Wolves team. All the evidence suggests he'll adapt pretty quickly, be a main man in attack and judging by what I saw at the Club World Cup and from people who follow the Brazilian league, he has the quality to thrive in England.",
      "Wolves have played the Brazilian market very shrewdly in recent years, with Joao Gomes and Andre showing real adaptability to the league.",
      "Quick, direct and a great drawer of fouls, Arias will be to the fore for Wolves as they look to take advantage of Man City's vulnerabilities in transition without Rodri. Back him to be fouled at least twice through the Sky Bet BuildABet function at Evens.",
      "Trimmed from 20/1 to 8/1 in the summer to win the Premier League, there is a chance Enzo Maresca just might be building something extremely exciting at Chelsea.",
      "And why should we be taking them seriously? Moises Caicedo and Cole Palmer - they are Chelsea's assassins and quite possibly the core of what could be a title-winning side.",
      "Since Caicedo has found rhythm in the Chelsea midfield, he has owned so many games, including the Club World Cup final against PSG. If Chelsea are going to suffocate opponents and dominate the ball in big games - which they will need to do to win a title - it all starts with Caicedo.",
      "And Palmer is the stardust. When the spotlight is on, when the stage is at it's highest, Palmer performs. He can go to Eden Hazard's levels of domination at Chelsea this season.",
      "This axis puts Chelsea in the title mix, no question. It's a four-way fight. And they can start with a home win.",
      "Nottingham Forest played some unsustainable football last season and it's very hard to see how they're going to improve on what they achieved.",
      "Top goalscorer Chris Wood converted 30 per cent of his overall attempts in the Premier League last term, while goalkeeper Matz Sels enjoyed the season of his life, boasting the best save percentage in the league. They can't be expected to keep those numbers up.",
      "And Forest return to Europe this season which is bound to influence the side's performance. If you exclude Conference League participants, non-big-six teams who qualify for Europe win around 14 points fewer in the campaign immediately following qualification.",
      "That isn't too relevant for this devilishly difficult fixture to analyse from a betting perspective, but something to note when the fixtures start to pile up. This clash looks one where the draw is a huge runner at 12/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is going to a very watchable fixture, steeped in Premier League narrative - but one where goals could be lacking.",
      "I'm firmly in the under 2.5 goals camp - and at the prices on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet I'm happy to endorse it as one of the best bets of the weekend.",
      "Arsenal are traditionally a very reliable team to back under goals away from home, albeit also a risky favourite to back in these spots.",
      "When assessing the last nine games where they've gone off 11/10 or bigger on the road, they have won just once and the average goals per game sits at just 1.89 per 90 with seven of those nine going under 2.5 goals.",
      "Additionally, seven of those games finished all-square while four of the five meetings between Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have also ended level.",
      "Lots of the focus and pre-match narrative will be about Leeds, but I'm excited to see what Everton can do this season.",
      "I think we need to start putting some serious respect on what David Moyes is doing in the Premier League - I for one haven't given him enough credit. Since taking over at West Ham, he has recorded a 37 per cent win ratio in the Premier League - that's higher than Sean Dyche, Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "And when Jarrad Branthwaite was fit last season (he started 28 games), Everton conceded just 28 goals in those matches - that's one goal per game, which would equate to being the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season.",
      "With Branthwaite tied down to a new deal and money to spend, Moyes just may have the tools to overachieve on expectations. I like their chances at Elland Road, too, as Moyes has an exceptional record against newly-promoted teams, recording a 67-per-cent win rate from the last 16 fixtures. The away win looks big at 19/10 with Sky Bet.",

      "Friday 15 August 2025 06:17, UK",
      "The Premier League is back and has all the ingredients in the mix for this season to have serious G.O.A.T potential.",
      "For most of us the Premier League runs through our veins. Admit it, a little part of us has been missing these past few months. It is part of the fabric of society in this country - of why we all love this game.",
      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",
      "Wayne Rooney's first Everton goal that meant his world would never be the same again. Thierry Henry turning it on against Liverpool, bewildering our very own Jamie Carragher along the way, to keep Arsenal on track in the title race.",
      "David Beckham from halfway. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. Collymore closing in.",
      "Aguerooooo.",
      "Kevin Keegan loving it.",
      "Andrea Bocelli, Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City.",
      "Well, it's time to create new moments that are stamped in our memory banks as the 2025/26 Premier League rolls into town. And all the ingredients have been added to the pot to make this season one of the greats.",
      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",

      "By Nick Wright and Adam Smith",
      "Friday 15 August 2025 06:16, UK",
      "Are Liverpool destined to retain the title? Could Manchester United really finish in the bottom half of the table again?",
      "Liverpool are out to retain their crown. The champions are the Premier League's biggest spenders in this summer's transfer window as they look to build on the success of last season under Arne Slot.",
      "But will they see off the competition? Runners-up Arsenal have also strengthened. Manchester City have undergone a rebuild. Could Club World Cup winners Chelsea roar into contention?",
      "Opta predict Liverpool will retain the Premier League title following last season's success under Arne Slot, with Arsenal coming second again, albeit by a much narrower margin than last term.",
      "Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa are third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, meaning Opta's predicted top six mirrors the final top six last season.",
      "Opta's supercomputer is far from convinced when it comes to Manchester United and Spurs. They are predicted to come 12th and 14th respectively, only three places higher than last term.",
      "FA Cup and Community Shield winners Crystal Palace are predicted to clinch a seventh-placed finish, with Brighton, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest complete the top 10.",
      "At the other end of the table, Opta expect the promoted teams to go straight back down for the third season running, with Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland finishing 18th, 19th and 20th respectively, a long way off 17th-placed Wolves for expected points.",
      "Spurs, now under the management of Thomas Frank, and beaten on penalties by Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final, are predicted to come eighth.",
      "Liverpool, again, come out on top over Arsenal as champions, with Manchester City in third. But, as in Opta's table, the top two are only separated by a slender expected points margin.",
      "A key difference at the bottom of the table is that newly-promoted Leeds are predicted to survive at the expense of Wolves.",
      "The two tables feature key similarities, most notably in the make-up of their predicted top fours. But there are huge differences too.",
      "Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton are also given considerably lower predicted finishes, contrary to Opta's optimism.",
      "So why the differences? Both supercomputers are based on averages from 10,000 simulations, using bookmaker odds, historical and recent team performances, and transfer spending.",
      "But the intricacies of the algorithms are different, placing weight on varying factors, which helps to explain some of the disparities seen between the two predicted tables.",
      "The summer transfer window is of course a key factor in predicting how teams will fare. A high spend does not guarantee success. Far from it. But it can be vital to a team's capacity to improve.",
      "Their total spend is already close to £300m following the arrival of Florian Wirtz for a record fee along with the signings of Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "They are not the only ones to have strengthened at considerable expense. The so-called Big Six have spent over £1bn between them this summer. And in fact, Liverpool's net spend is much lower than most of their rivals thanks to some big sales, including those of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester City have work to do to shift their unwanted players but their high net spends help to explain why they are predicted to push Liverpool closer this term.",
      "Manchester United have overhauled their attack, making a trio of high-profile additions in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. So why the 12th-placed prediction from Opta?",
      "They are of course coming from a far lower starting point than Liverpool, having finished 15th last term, but it might also have something to do with how they have so far allocated their funds.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have plenty to offer offensively to a side that finished last season as the Premier League's biggest underperformers relative to their expected goals. The lack of firepower and cutting edge needed to be addressed.",
      "But have they overlooked other areas of their squad? Manchester United have invested nearly twice as much in forwards as any other club have invested in any position this summer, but there has been no turnover in goal or in midfield, and only £7m spent on defenders.",
      "This looks problematic given their issues last season were not limited to their attack. Ruben Amorim's side were far from solid in midfield or defence. Only nine Premier League sides conceded more goals. Only eight allowed more expected goals against.",
      "And yet, despite those issues, Manchester United look set to start the new Premier League season with roughly the same personnel as last season in goal, in defence and in midfield.",
      "Both predicted tables have Enzo Maresca's side in fourth place, and with near-identical points totals too, ensuring Champions League qualification for a second successive season, but falling a long way short of a push for Premier League glory.",
      "Chelsea, like their Big Six rivals, have invested heavily in new recruits this summer. There is excitement around Estevao, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in particular. They also start the campaign with a relatively favourable run of fixtures.",
      "But they haven't finished higher than third since their last title triumph in 2016/17. Could a tough run-in, when they face all of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Tottenham in the final 11 fixtures, and the exertions of an epic 2024/25 campaign, also bite them?",
      "Spurs finished last season on a Europa League-winning high but a 17th-placed Premier League finish did for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Frank has arrived from Brentford as his successor and the club have so far added six new players, including Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, both of whom impressed in their UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Daniel Farke's side, who pipped Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference last season, are predicted to finish 17th, fractionally ahead of Wolves, who have lost key players this summer in Cunha to Manchester United and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester City.",
      "The West Midlands club have so far spent modestly this summer, their outlay totalling just £48.4m, which ensures a healthy profit from the £103.7m received in sales, but raises questions about the quality and depth available to head coach Vitor Pereira.",
      "We asked our journalists to come up with their predicted tables too.",
      "As an average, Liverpool came out as champions, with Manchester United and Spurs in sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley are tipped for the drop.",

      "The superstars of the Premier League are ready to roll - but on the eve of the new season, who are the best players right here, right now?",
      "We asked them to rank a long list of Premier League talent and then took their average responses and honed it down to a top 25. So who came out on top?",
      "Read on to see our top 25 Premier League players - and then join the debate yourself in our live blog, where we want you to list your favourite footballers and debate and discuss our selections!",
      "Arsenal's defence was the meanest in the Premier League last season and Gabriel gets the recognition from our journalists and reporters - no doubt also impressed by his repeated threat from set-pieces at the other end of the pitch.",
      "Where would Man Utd be without Bruno Fernandes? That was a recurring question last season. Amid all of his team's travails, the Portugal midfielder's quality remains respected.",
      "Another driving force of Arsenal's title prospects, Declan Rice is becoming the complete midfielder in the centre of the park for the Gunners. If the football world is increasingly being filled by specialists, the England man can seemingly do it all.",
      "Arsenal supporters will surely want to see Bukayo Saka further up this list and their Star Boy could well prove this coming season he deserves a promotion. The next step is to inspire his team to success with his individual brilliance.",
      "Liverpool's imperious captain is the top-ranked defender and there will be few arguments with that. The Dutchman continues to be a commanding presence in the Reds' backline.",
      "The transfer saga of the summer? Alexander Isak's future at Newcastle is uncertain but his quality isn't in doubt. There's a reason why the Sweden striker is in demand after a brilliant campaign in black and white.",
      "Man City badly missed Rodri through his injury absence last season. If anything it underlined his importance to Pep Guardiola's side even more. He continues to be considered among the best in the world - fingers crossed he can return to his former levels.",
      "We love a maverick and Chelsea's Cole Palmer is one of the Premier League's top entertainers. He delivers in the big moments too - whether that's a Euros final with England or when Chelsea are in major finals.",
      "When you score 22 Premier League goals but are deemed to have had a disappointing season, you know you're a decent striker. Erling Haaland's goal-getting prowess continues to demand respect.",
      "No surprises here. Liverpool's star man swept the awards last season after inspiring the Reds to Premier League glory with one of the best individual campaigns we've seen.",
      "Premier League player of the year Mohamed Salah has taken the crown with Liverpool's Egyptian King voted ahead of Man City's Erling Haaland and Chelsea's Cole Palmer.",
      "Florian Wirtz - Liverpool's big-money summer signing - was the highest-ranked import, while it was Arsenal who had the most players in the top 10, with Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice and Gabriel Magalhaes making the cut.",

      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 16:54, UK",
      "No 9s and No 10s have been the talk of the summer and big money has been spent in the pursuit of goals.",
      "Chelsea are hanging their hopes on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Arsenal have got all their eggs in the Viktor Gyokeres basket, while Man United have gone wild and revamped their entire forward line by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £207m.",
      "Liverpool have front-loaded, too, splashing a nine-figure sum on Florian Wirtz before pushing overall spending beyond the £250m mark with a £79m outlay on Hugo Ekitike.",
      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",
      "His versatility across a fluid frontline will nevertheless be helpful to Enzo Maresca, who could use Pedro as a second striker behind the former Ipswich target man if he so wishes - or even on the wing.",
      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",
      "Pep Guardiola professed not to want wholesale change at Manchester City midway through last season's disastrous collapse, but that appears to be what he's got. City went big in January and have invested further this summer.",
      "Rayan Cherki has drawn most excitement, not least because of comparisons with one Lionel Messi - which may have as much to do with his short stature as his impressive close ball control, but any association with the great Argentinian has got to be deemed favourable.",
      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",
