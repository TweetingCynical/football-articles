      "Wrexham have made a sensational bid to try and sign Christian Eriksen following his exit from Manchester United. The Red Dragons, owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, are looking to make a statement in the transfer market after securing promotion to the Championship in April.",
      "Manager Phil Parkinson has already brought in six new players so far this summer, including Plymouth striker Ryan Hardie, former Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward and Empoli left-back Liberato Cacace.",
      "The Welsh side's transfer activity significantly gathered pace this week following the arrivals of Bolton captain George Thomason, ex-Sheffield Wednesday forward Josh Windass and Nottingham Forest midfielder Lewis O'Brien.",
      "It's now being reported that Wrexham have also made an approach for Eriksen, who left United this summer. The midfielder, who has also turned out for Ajax, Tottenham, Inter Milan and Brentford during his career, has an impressive CV.",
      "The Danish international has won league titles in the Netherlands and Italy, as well as English domestic cup wins with United. Eriksen joining Wrexham would therefore represent a major coup for the Championship new boys.",
      "However, despite being impressed by the club's offer, the 33-year-old has turned down the chance to move to North Wales. According to Eriksen's agent, Martin Schoot, Eriksen is keen to play at the highest level for as long as possible and has been approached by clubs from around the globe, including Saudi Arabia, the United States, Turkey and Brazil.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Mail, Schoot said: \"Wrexham are really upgrading everything both on and off the field, and it is a hugely impressive project, as you can see from the presence of people like Michael Williamson [chief executive] there.",
      "\"But Christian still wants to play in a first-tier competition and he absolutely wants to stay in Western Europe. There are some contacts going on but it has to suit both sides.\"",
      "Wrexham's chief executive previously worked at Inter Milan in several senior roles between 2014 and 2018. While Williamson had already left by the time Eriksen arrived in 2020, the American is understood to be making the most of his Italian contacts to aid the Red Dragons' recruitment.",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",
      "But does it have a dedicated, quality source of information piped through to your inbox each week, free of ads but packed with informed opinion, analysis and even a little bit of fun each week? That's where Wrexham is the Game steps in...",
      "Available every Wednesday, it provides all the insights you need to be a top red. And for a limited time, a subscription to 'Wrexham is the Game' will cost fans just £15 for the first year.",
      "Sign up for Wrexham is the Game here",
      "Eriksen is not the first big name star to be linked with Wrexham this summer, with Leicester legend Jamie Vardy and Fulham skipper Tom Cairney also said to have been targeted by the club. Eriksen has made 144 appearances for his country during his career, scoring 46 goals in the process.",
      "He was signed by United in 2022 after shining for Brentford in the Premier League. The Bees brought Eriksen in following his recovery from a cardiac arrest, which he suffered on the pitch at the Euro 2020 tournament.",
      "Eriksen made 107 appearances and scored eight goals during his three seasons at United, including a penalty against Aston Villa in his final outing in May. While Wrexham were unsuccessful in their bid to lure him to the Racecourse Ground, their transfer activity is expected to continue in the coming weeks as they prepare for life in the Championship, with Wales and Sheffield United striker Kieffer Moore claimed to be their latest target.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",

      "Alexander Isak's potential departure from Newcastle United could jeopardise Manchester United's pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. Despite securing the services of Matheus Cunha in early June and recently finalising the signing of Bryan Mbeumo, United are still on the hunt for attacking reinforcements.",
      "After Viktor Gyokeres rejected a reunion with Ruben Amorim to join Arsenal, the Red Devils' focus has reportedly shifted to Sesko. With the north Londoners close to sealing a deal for Gyokeres, United seemed to have had a clear path to the towering Slovenian forward.",
      "However, if Newcastle offload Isak, who has been linked with Liverpool and Saudi Arabian outfit Al Hilal after informing Eddie Howe's side that he would like to explore an exit from St James' Park, the Magpies will be expected to move for Sesko. This could spell trouble for United, who have already missed out on many striking targets this summer.",
      "According to The Athletic, Newcastle are considering a move for Sesko, who boasts a record of 27 goals and seven assists in 64 Bundesliga outings for Leipzig. The Daily Mail have also claimed that Newcastle have approached Leipzig about the possibility of signing Sesko, who could command a fee in the region of £60m to £70m.",
      "With Isak seemingly looking for an exit, Newcastle might decide to capitalise on what could potentially be a Premier League record transfer fee for a player. If this happens, they will likely speed up their chase for another prolific goal-scorer and Sesko seems to fit the bill.",
      "Given that the Magpies are competing in the Champions League this season, United may struggle to lure Sesko to Old Trafford. Furthermore, having already splashed out around £132.5m on Mbeumo and Cunha, United will probably need to offload players before they can make a serious offer, while Newcastle could have ample funds to spend if Isak's departure is accelerated.",
      "After netting only 44 goals in the Premier League last season, United are still in dire need of a lethal striker. Cunha and Mbeumo are both sharp finishers, with 35 goals and 14 assists between them for their respective clubs last year.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, neither are traditional centre forwards, which United have been searching for this summer. The Red Devils have already missed out on Delap, Gyokeres and, most recently, Hugo Ekitike, who secured a £79m move to Liverpool this week.",
      "United reportedly held discussions with the representatives of Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson, who is now thought to carry an £80m price tag. It's now understood a bid for the Senegal international from the Red Devils is unexpected.",
      "French outlet Foot Mercato also reported that Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani, who spent last season on loan at Juventus, is another potential target for United. However, Sesko could be the preferred choice for United.",
      "German media suggests he carries a price tag of around £60m - £12m less than what United shelled out to Atalanta for Rasmus Hojlund in 2023 - making the 22-year-old an attractive prospect.",
      "United still have Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee in their squad, but neither have proven they can lead the attack. The loan move of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona has freed up space and about £12m in wages, but United will still need to generate funds first before they can entertain bidding for another forward.",
      "Resolving the futures of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, who the club are openly willing to sale, will likely be top of Amorim's agenda, especially now Newcastle are putting pressure on them in the race for Sesko.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United’s hopes of selling Antony this summer have been boosted amid reported interest from Saudi Arabia. Antony is part of the so-called ‘bomb squad’ at United, having been frozen out of the first-team set-up by Ruben Amorim, who is desperate to offload him.",
      "United have signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer for a combined total of £133.5million and know they need to sell players in order to balance the books. Marcus Rashford has been sent on loan to Barcelona, who are covering his wages, but Antony remains on the books along with Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Amorim has jetted off to Chicago to start United’s pre-season tour without the exiled foursome, who have been told to look for new clubs. Antony spent the second half of last season on loan at Real Betis and had hoped to move to Seville permanently.",
      "The Brazilian winger got nine goals and five assists in 26 games for Betis last season, reviving his career and earning many new fans in the process. Betis are keen to re-sign him for the 2025/26 season, but want another loan, rather than a permanent deal.",
      "United have different ideas and are seeking a club who will sign Antony, who cost £85m from Ajax in 2022. They have received some interest from Atletico Madrid, but the Spanish side have not followed up on it yet.",
      "It is understood that Antony would prefer to stay in Europe’s top leagues, rather than move to the Middle East. Erik ten Hag – the man who oversaw his best form at Ajax and authorised his big-money move to United – is now in charge of Leverkusen, but he has distanced himself from a transfer.",
      "“He has great quality,” he told BILD recently. “I signed him twice. He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.”",
      "Antony has returned just 12 goals and five assists in 96 games for United and is a major drain on resources. He earns £200,000-a-week at Old Trafford, where he is under contract until June 2027.",
      "After a miserable time at United, he loved his stint at Betis, who he helped reached the Conference League final. “Yes, I'm very happy. I found myself,” he said at the time. “I needed to find myself and be happy. My family needed to be happy too. Every day that passes confirms it was the best decision and as you said, I'm enjoying the city and the club every day.”",

      "Manchester United icon Rio Ferdinand has advised the club to avoid RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko in their quest for a new striker. The Red Devils have already secured the services of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer to bolster their attack.",
      "Last season, Ruben Amorim's team lacked a reliable goalscorer, with Amad and Bruno Fernandes leading the scoring charts with a mere eight league goals each. United have been linked with a move for Sesko as the club attempt to improve their striking options.",
      "The 22-year-old, who has also been on Arsenal's radar, scored 21 goals across all competitions last term. Yet, Ferdinand has warned United that they need a more experienced forward than Sesko.",
      "\"I think you've got to look at the here and now at the moment with Man United. That's what I said about a number nine,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel. \"I'm not really doubting [Sesko] as a player. I'm saying Man United need experience at the top of the pitch.",
      "\"They've got Hojlund, they've got Zirkzee, they've got Chido. Young, inexperienced players. They need someone to look at and go, 'That's how you play as a number nine.' That's how you do it. When you're going to buy somebody who hasn't got as much experience as I'd like, I think that's another risk. Is it worth taking with inexperienced players at this level?\".",
      "Ferdinand has hinted that Ollie Watkins, who is on United's radar, could be the perfect fit due to the Aston Villa striker's Premier League pedigree. While Ferdinand has emphasised the need for a new striker, the former defender confessed he'd be willing for United to overlook a forward in favour of splashing out on Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "\"If I don't get a striker, I'd go midfield. There's only one name I'm thinking about, I've got to be honest, who I think fits the bill for what we need,\" Ferdinand explained. \"An Amorim-type player as well. Physically great, can drive with the ball, can take it in all areas, very good tactically, great energy, great legs, Premier League experience, centre midfield. Baleba.",
      "\"That's who I go and get. That's my man. That's the one I go and get. I go and break the bank. So if I got the money for the four players that are surplus to requirements now, would I get a number nine or would I get Baleba?",
      "\"Would I get a number nine I'm not sure about, who's a bit young, inexperienced, or would I get Baleba with Premier League experience and know what he can do here? I'm going Baleba, sorry.",
      "\"I'm going to go with Baleba. I think he'll have a huge impact on this squad, on this team. You free up a few people in that midfield area as well to have a little less responsibility defensively because I think he's all-action. He can do it all.\"",
      "Baleba was signed by Brighton from Lille for approximately £26million (€30m) in 2023. The young midfielder, aged 21, made 34 appearances in the league for the Seagulls last season.",
      "Meanwhile, United's current striking options, consisting of Rasmus Hojlund, Josha Zikzee and highly-rated prospect Chido Obi, managed to score a total of seven league goals last season. United are hoping to boost their transfer budget through the potential sales of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia, who have all been omitted from the club's US pre-season tour.",

      "Luke Shaw is 'ready to quit' Manchester United and willing to listen to offers from other clubs. The defender has spent more than a decade at Old Trafford but is open to an exit from the side as interest gathers in his signature.",
      "Shaw, 30, appears ready to accept that his Red Devils career is coming to an end. The Southampton academy product is reported to be aware of 'serious' interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "The England international still has two years remaining on his contract and is in the United squad that travelled to the United States for their pre-season tour. Shaw will be in contention to face West Ham on Sunday and played against Leeds as Ruben Amorim's side returned to action for pre-season.",
      "Shaw will have to battle for his place in the team come the start of the season. While the full-back started in the Europa League final against Tottenham last term, he is set to face competition from the likes of Diogo Dalot, January arrival Patrick Dorgu and summer signing Diego Leon.",
      "Dorgu is perhaps favourite to be Amorim's first option at wingback for the new season. There are high hopes for £3.3million man Leon who joined from Cerro Porteno of Paraguay too.",
      "The 18-year-old played in the opening half of the draw with Leeds and was praised by head coach Amorim. “He did really well,\" said the Portuguese boss.",
      "\"He’s learning things, he’s powerful, he’s going to be a very good player.”",
      "Amorim is said to be in no rush to lose Shaw from his squad, despite the injury-plagued star carrying £150,000-a-week wages. But the versatile defender is keen to secure playing time having missed out on a number of opportunities due to his injury record.",
      "If Shaw decides to leave in the coming months, it appears unlikely that United would stand in his way. The defender has only made 27 appearances across the last two seasons.",
      "The 13-times Premier League champions will hope to earn fees from the exits of the likes of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia. United have already facilitated a move for Marcus Rashford but only on loan, despite wanting to bolster their transfer funds.",
      "In addition to Leon, United have spent significant sums on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a bid to revitalise the club's forward line.",

Last summer, it was rumoured that United were contemplating a £50million swoop for Ferguson, with Chelsea also reportedly showing interest.",
      "However, a move to Old Trafford never materialised and Ferguson's career hit a rough patch last season due to a lack of goals and persistent injuries. The 20-year-old spent the second half of the campaign at West Ham on loan after finding opportunities hard to come by at Brighton, but only managed to start one game for the Hammers.",
      "He is now looking to kickstart his career with Roma after joining the Serie A club on a season-long loan, a deal which includes a £32million right-to-buy option.",

United are on the hunt for a new striker this summer but abandoned their pursuit of him at the turn of the year, which may well come back to bite them if his debut performance is anything to by.",
      "Ferguson will return to England next month, with Roma set to play friendly matches against Aston Villa and Everton before commencing their Serie A campaign at home against Bologna on August 23.",
      "United's interest in Ferguson will have waned following his tough 2024/25 campaign. With young strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee both struggling, Ruben Amorim desperately required established Premier League attackers, leading to the summer arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to address those needs.",

Following confirmation of his Roma loan switch, Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler explained: \"Evan had a challenging period across the past season and a half, and it has been one disrupted by niggling injury issues, which hasn't allowed him a run of games.",

      "Erik ten Hag's former Manchester United assistant Mitchell van der Gaag has admitted his main \"disappointment\" from his time at Old Trafford was the team's poor display in the Europa League.",
      "United endured mixed fortunes under Ten Hag as they won the Carabao Cup in his first season, finishing third in the process, and the FA Cup in his second campaign.",
      "But the 2024-25 season proved to be the end for Ten Hag as he was axed in October after leading United to their worst start in the club's history, with Ruben Amorim replacing him.",
      "Van der Gaag said he had positive memories from his time with United despite his turbulent spell working under Ten Hag, saying the team proved they could be a force in cup competitions.",
      "But he said he regretted their lack of impact in the Europa League after only reaching the quarter-finals in 2022-23, losing to eventual winners Sevilla 5-2 on aggregate.",
      "Speaking to Give Me Sport, he said: \"I look back on my time at Manchester United positively. I think it was two wonderful years. They were very positive and I learned a lot.",
      "\"The first year was very positive because we finished in third place, won the Carabao Cup and went to the FA Cup final. I think the only disappointment, in my opinion, was that we could have been better in the Europa League. But I think the first year was very positive, so everyone expected that we could improve in the second season.\"",
      "He reflected on a \"strange\" second campaign that saw the team suffer a terrible run of form that saw Ten Hag come close to the sack before winning the FA Cup, which bought him more time despite finishing eighth. Van der Gaag said he \"learnt a lot\" and enjoyed coaching with United even though it ended on a sour note.",
      "\"That was a very strange season [2023-24],\" he added. \"We were not good enough in the Premier League or Champions League. There were very strange results as well because there were games we were winning comfortably and then drawing or losing.",
      "\"But, in the end, we won the FA Cup. It puts everything in a positive way, so that was important. They were two years when I learned a lot, especially about the way the Premier League functions, the way football is played and the tactical variations. It was something that I really enjoyed.\"",
      "Ten Hag has since become the new manager of Bayer Leverkusen, but Van der Gaag decided not to join his backroom staff. Instead, he has taken up management himself by becoming the new manager of FC Zurich.",
      "It's set to be a tough start for Ten Hag's new team after selling two of their best players in Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool in a record £116.5m deal, while right-back Jeremie Frimpong also moved to Anfield.",
      "Meanwhile, defender Jonathan Tah joined their biggest rivals Bayern Munich on a free transfer and Granit Xhaka is in danger of moving to Sunderland.",

      "The 27-year-old is used to talisman status, having worn the No.9 shirt and scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season as they won the domestic double.

He's obviously a big player for us, but we do have a lot of quality in the squad as well. Bringing Anthony [Elanga] in as well, which I think was a great signing.\"",
      "Captain Bruno Guimaraes added: \"I’m really close to him. He’s a good guy. He’s been through some rough things at this moment. My focus is with the lads. Isak is something I cannot control. The club has control of it. I hope he’s going to be fit when we come back to Newcastle to prepare for the new season.",

      "With a £125million price tag, there aren't too many options - especially when you discount Saudi Arabia. All roads lead to Liverpool? Well, they do have the money available, despite their £265m splurge this summer.",
      "Watch this space.",
      "And welcome to another day of transfer news - and it promises to be a busy Friday.",

      "Mason Mount says Manchester United's players have targeted an immediate return to Europe next season.",
      "United missed out on qualifying for the Champions League after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham in Bilbao back in May. Ruben Amorim's side were also responsible for United's worst league finish for 51 years, ending the season in 15 th place in the Premier League.",
      "With no European football at Old Trafford next season for only the second time in 35 years, attacking midfielder Mount said getting back there is the primary aim for next season. “We obviously want to be back in Europe,” said Mount. “That's a massive, massive thing for the club.",
      "“That's the focus. The Champions League would be amazing for us. As a group - and as players - we want to be playing in that competition. So that's the goal. We know how difficult that is now in the Premier League. There are so many teams that are investing and playing very good football at the moment.”",
      "Mount, 26, said Amorim and his coaching staff analysed in detail what went wrong last season in a bid to ensure United hit the ground running when the new campaign gets under way. “It's the small details here and there that really affect that at the top of the league,” said Mount. “It's small little details that the manager sees.",
      "“When we do analysis on games, like the first game we played or even in training, it's just seeing those moments and everyone understanding that that matters. That small little movement, the pass, appreciation, this all counts and these small wins in the game will help create chances and will help us be more dominant with the ball. So that's what we've been looking at.",
      "“From day one of pre-season, it's about standards and details within training, on and off the pitch, and really focusing on what we need to do to be better and to perform better. We haven't done loads of analysis of last season. We looked at a few areas that we can improve on, but this is a new season, it's like wiping the slate clean.",
      "\"Coming into this season with a different kind of attitude and a feeling about it and we're ready to go. The vibe around the group is very energetic. In training, it's been a few kicks here and there, because we want to win in games. That's what you want as a group. You kick your mate, but after training, it's all good.”",

      "United are now in Chicago on that tour and are still yet to address many of the issues in their squad. One of the most obvious is the lack of goals, after they managed just 44 in 38 Premier League games as they finished 15th last season.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund scored 10 goals in 52 games in total, four of which came in the league, and with Marcus Rashford having left on loan for Barcelona, there is a need for a new striker.",

      "Another striker United have been linked with is Randal Kolo Muani, who is very much available from Paris Saint-Germain. He has been sent to train with the PSG youth team by manager Luis Enrique, who has made it clear he has no future with the club.",
      "The France international spent last season on loan with Juventus, who have seen a few bids rejected by PSG. He is now in the PSG bomb squad, along with Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio, Carlos Soler, Nordi Mukiele and Renato Sanches.",

      "United ended last season in 15 th place, their lowest finish since they were relegated in 1974, and missed out on Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham. Mount's two seasons at United have been blighted by injury following his £60million move from Chelsea, but he said he is determined to prove himself under Ruben Amorim.",
      "“The whole season hurt,” said Mount. “But this is a new slate now. We're looking forward to performing. We want to perform as a group. We know last season wasn't good enough so now it's about kicking on.",
      "“Going away in the summer, you're always looking at what you can do better, how you can be better for your team-mates and perform as a group, how we can all perform better. Last season it wasn't good enough. We know that, but we're kicking on now. We're ready to put right that wrong.\"",
      "Mount was out for four months midway through last season but returned to the starting line-up towards the end of the campaign and is determined to make himself a regular under Amorim. Despite United spending £133.5m on attacking duo Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Mount has backed himself to compete with them for a starting place next season.",
      "“When you're at a club like Manchester United, there has to be that competition there to perform and as a group we want to win and we're all in that together,” said Mount. “The new lads who have come in have been brilliant in training so far and the first couple of weeks is never easy.",
      "\"It's about integrating them into the group and making them feel as comfortable as possible and I think we've all done that. They've been brilliant in training and we'll be working together to get to that goal. They know what's coming with the Premier League and the games and how difficult it is now. What they've done in the Premier League already, the amount of goals they've scored, the amount of assists they've created, that's exactly what we need in the team.",
      "“We're working together to try and improve that, because last season we didn't hit those goals or assists as much as we could have done.” Asked how long it took him to get over United's 1-0 defeat to Spurs in Bilbao, Mount said: \"Quite a long time. I've had quite a few losses in finals, so it's not easy. It never gets any easier, for sure.",
      "“But it's about looking at what we could have improved on. In finals, little things that happen in the game, it's like they have a bigger impact. It was tight. But it's about looking forward now and really using this pre-season to work on a lot of things that maybe we didn't get enough time to do last season.",
      "“With the schedule, with the games, and with the manager coming in halfway through the season, this pre-season period is so vital for us as a group, to work on things.”",

      "The Red Devils have already bought two forwards - Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - for a combined £133.5million, with a new emphasis on signing players who are proven in the Premier League. Of those who United view as realistic options, they don't come much more established than Watkins.",
      "Since joining Villa from Brentford in a £33m deal five years ago, Watkins has scored 75 goals and registered 34 assists in 184 league games. The England international was the subject of a £60m bid from Arsenal in January but Villa immediately rejected it.",

      "Manchester United could sign Benjamin Sesko after RB Leipzig reportedly slashed their asking price for the striker. United have splashed £133.5million to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the summer transfer window, but still lack a centre-forward.",
      "United managed a pathetic total of 44 goals as they finished 15th in the Premier League last season, with Rasmus Hojlund netting just four times in the league. Ruben Amorim knows they need reinforcements this summer and has moved to land two of the league’s most exciting forwards in Cunha from Wolves and Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "And while there is interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson and Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani, there could also still be a glimmer of hope for United in the form of Sesko, who is available from Leipzig.",
      "Arsenal had initially preferred a move for Sesko over Gyokeres – in part due to the fact that he is five years younger – but they backed out of the transfer with Leipzig demanding a fee between £68m and £85m.",
      "However, BILD now reports that a fee of around €70million (£60m) could be enough to get a deal done for Sesko, who notched 13 goals in the Bundesliga last season. United’s head of scouting Christopher Vivell has been to watch him personally and is understood to be a big fan of the Slovenian forward.",
      "Sesko is under contract with Leipzig until June 2029 and scored 21 goals in 45 games across all competitions last season. The 22-year-old is not agitating for a move, as his agent explained earlier this summer.",
      "Asked about rumours that he had been lobbying Leipzig to lower their asking price, Elvis Basanovic said: “This is far from truth. We respect RB Leipzig and I am 100 per cent convinced RB Leipzig will also respect our decision for the next step when we decide to do it. Even if there may be – or will be – a strong desire of the player to move to a certain club, we will never force or blackmail RB Leipzig.",
      "“I believe this is not the right way, because the way you actually exit from the club shows your values. Values that you are bringing into a new club. I can understand in very big transfers, there are a lot of different interests but no matter what, I believe in football world should be more respect.",
      "“So that’s why we do things in the right way or we don’t do them. It’s very simple, even maybe in the media it looks very complicated.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been slammed for seemingly \"letting Manchester United down\" after making the switch to Barcelona. The forward completed his season-long loan to the reigning La Liga title-holders after being presented to fans on Wednesday.",
      "The 27-year-old has at least temporarily departed Old Trafford once again following his four-month stint at Aston Villa last season. Rashford found himself sidelined at United by head coach Ruben Amorim after his arrival in November last year.",
      "A move to Barcelona was understood to be the England star's favoured destination after losing his place in the international squad, and he has now secured his dream, with his new club holding the option to buy him next summer for £26m.",
      "The deal will see Barcelona cover Rashford's sizeable wages for the duration of the loan after he agreed to a 25 per cent reduction from his £325,000-a-week pay. Despite the financial relief, former Liverpool and Villa striker Dean Saunders has now slammed Rashford after questioning his commitment and arguing he hasn't earned the right to represent Barcelona.",
      "The former Wolves and Wrexham boss also challenged the Catalan club's reasoning behind the signing. Saunders gave a savage eight word-verdict on Rashford's performances in recent campaigns, saying: \"In five years, he's had one good season.\"",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: \"I think a lot of people are baffled. Hansi Flick is the manager and Deco is his director of football. I don't know what's going through their heads. What have they been watching that we haven't?",
      "\"I thought Rashford was nearer to going down the same road as Dele Alli than he was of going to Barcelona. Whether he deserves that move? Well, basically, he doesn't.",
      "\"I don't think he can produce brilliance. I think a talent is turning up every week. That's the biggest talent you've got, having the mindset to turn up and perform every week.",
      "\"There's a lot of players at Man United who have let the club down. In my era, Man United were the biggest club. If you played for them, you had to be the best player in the world in your position, with the best attitude.\"",
      "Saunders added: \"He [Rashford] has had years of [people] getting behind him and he's let the club down. In five years, he's had one good season.\"",
      "Rashford's questionable work rate was previously highlighted by Amorim as justification for dropping him from the squad for the Manchester derby last December. During his exile from the team, the Portuguese boss delivered a damning verdict, insisting he'd rather field his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach than select a player who lacks dedication.",
      "\"If you do the maximum and do the right things, we can use every player,\" Amorim said. \"And you can see today on the bench, we missed a bit of pace to go, to change the game. I will put [Jorge] Vital [on the pitch] before I put a player that does not give the maximum. I will not change in that department.\"",
      "Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick gave the go-ahead for Rashford's signing after having discussions with the player. The Catalan giants have been on the hunt for a left-sided forward this summer, and Rashford was a top target, along with Liverpool's Luis Díaz and Athletic Club's Nico Williams.",
      "Díaz's hefty price tag proved to be a significant hurdle, while Williams recently pledged his future to his current club by signing a new long-term contract. As a result, Rashford emerged as the most feasible and achievable target.",
      "United are keen to offload players who are no longer in favour in order to finance a substantial squad revamp. The restructuring process has already begun, with Matheus Cunha joining for £62.5million and Bryan Mbeumo following suit in a £70m deal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Kolo Muani, 26, was loaned out to Juventus for the second half of last season, making a good impression by scoring 10 goals in 22 appearances.",
      "Kolo Muani was allowed to remain with Juventus for the Club World Cup but has now returned to Paris, where he's been given the cold shoulder. French newspaper Le Parisien report that Enrique has ordered the former Eintracht Frankfurt star to train with PSG's under-21 squad alongside fellow unwanted players Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio, Carlos Soler, Nordi Mukiele and Renato Sanches.",
      "Having paid Frankfurt £76.4million to sign Kolo Muani two years ago and with a contract until 2028, PSG won't let him go on the cheap. It's explained that the Champions League winners will demand a total fee of £52m while Juventus would prefer another loan deal.",
      "United aren't the only Premier League club interested, too. The report adds that Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham all have Kolo Muani on the radar, although none of them have submitted bids.",
      "That's unlike Juve, who want the 26-year-old back. During the Club World Cup, Kolo Muani made it clear that his preference is to stay with the Serie A side, having been quizzed on links with Chelsea.",
      "\"I don't know anything about Chelsea,\" the France international stated. \"I'm trying to focus on the Club World Cup, which is a very fast competition.",
      "\"Once the tournament is over, we'll see what happens on the market. If it were up to me, I'd stay here: I'm really happy at Juve, I feel great.\"",

      "Manchester United finally got the signing of Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday after pursuing the Brentford attacker all summer, but the arrival of the soon-to-be 26-year-old will create a problem for them later this season.",
      "Mbeumo was seen as a key target for Ruben Amorim as he continues to remould the United squad he took over last November, with hopes high that he can improve on last season's dismal 15th-place finish.",
      "Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals for Brentford last term, is seen as a perfect and versatile addition for United, and someone who can play in one of Amorim's wide No.10 roles and perhaps even at wing-back.",
      "But if he is to succeed at the club in the coming season then he is going to have to do so while missing a key period of the campaign.",
      "That's because as a Cameroon international Mbeumo will be off to the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco in December, and that tournament is likely to be looming large in Amorim's mind given the potential headache it could cause him.",
      "As well as Mbeumo, the Ivory Coast's Amad Diallo is also extremely likely to be called up, as is Noussair Mazraoui who plays for hosts Morocco. There is also a decent chance that goalkeeper Andre Onana is recalled to the Cameroon squad despite some high-profile spats which at one stage led to his international retirement. He did however return to the fold last year.",
      "All four could be missing for a crucial point in United's season then, with the latest AFCON being brought forward to December 21 this year and running through to January 18.",
      "The change sees the tournament move from its previous January to February slot to come more in line with most European countries' winter breaks, and also avoid the final two league phase matches of the Champions League in late January.",
      "United don't have European football to worry about in the coming campaign of course, but they do still have key games in the Premier League over the AFCON period.",
      "United face Bournemouth at home on the weekend of December 13, and that is likely to be the quartet's final game before they head off to Morocco if all are selected.",
      "Then comes a potential Carabao Cup quarter-final on the week of December 15, before Premier League games against Aston Villa (away, December 20), Newcastle (home, December 27), Wolves (home, December 30), Leeds (away, January 3) and Burnley (away, January 7).",
      "The FA Cup third round then kicks off on the weekend of January 10, with the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-finals the week commencing January 12. United then host Manchester City in a derby match at Old Trafford on the weekend of January 17.",
      "Of course not all four players will be involved all the way to the end of the tournament, with a decent chance that most if not all are back by the time of that City game, but nonetheless Amorim will have plenty to ponder going into the winter.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is delighted for Marcus Rashford after he became the first Manchester United exile to escape the club this summer. Rashford completed his loan move to Barcelona on Wednesday, who have the option to sign him permanently, meaning his time at United may have come to an end.",
      "The 27-year-old has not played for United since December, having fallen out with Ruben Amorim, and joins Barca following a loan spell at Aston Villa. He had been placed in the so-called ‘bomb squad’ at United by Amorim, with the club’s unwanted players forced to train by themselves at Carrington.",
      "Rashford, Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have been frozen out by the United manager until they find a new club. While Rashford’s move is only a season-long loan, Barca have the option to make it permanent for €30million (£26m).",
      "He is delighted to have sealed his dream move to Spain and fellow outcast Garnacho clearly feels the same. Writing underneath one of Rashford’s many Instagram posts on Wednesday, the Argentina international said: \"Lets goooooo” with two saluting emojis.",
      "Garnacho is waiting for his own exit to materialise after Napoli pulled out of a deal. Having initially set his asking price at £70m, United have slashed their valuation to £40m as they court interest from the likes of Chelsea and Villa.",
      "He wasn’t the only United player to get involved on social media, with captain Bruno Fernandes and forward Joshua Zirkzee liking posts and Zirkzee writing: “Good luck brother” with fingers crossed and heart emojis. Former United goalkeeper David de Gea also added a like on one post.",
      "Rashford is keen to move on from United, where he had previously spent his entire career, coming through the academy to score 138 goals in 426 appearances. “The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while,” he said.",
      "“I don’t have anything bad to say about Manchester United as it has been an important part not only in my career but my life.",
      "“I was grateful for the opportunity to play for them. But football is like life – not everything goes as simply as you thought and this is my next chapter. I’m fully focused on this and trying to improve myself and helping the team win trophies.”",
      "He added: “I was clear on my preference from the beginning. It didn’t work out in January so I went to Aston Villa and enjoyed a good period there. I’m very grateful for the opportunity to play there. The summer came around very quickly, it was time to make another decision. My choice was easy. It’s a family club, something I’m used to from my past.",
      "“I want to win the biggest trophies and feel like Barcelona is a huge club in the football world so it is the perfect place,” Rashford said. “You see with the team last season, they have a young ambitious team and I want to add my qualities, my personality, improve the team and help them win.",
      "“It’s a club where people’s dreams come true and they win big prizes. And what the club stands for really means a lot to me as well. It feels like home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here.”",

      "Simon Jordan has slammed both Manchester United and Marcus Rashford after the England striker sealed his move to Barcelona.",
      "Rashford, 27, has joined the Blaugrana on a season-long loan deal - with Barca holding an option to turn it permanent for £26million. He was unveiled on Wednesday at Camp Nou, where Rashford declared: “I feel at home here – it's where dreams come true.”",
      "Certainly, his time at United under Ruben Amorim was far from a dream, with Rashford jettisoned from the first-team squad, dumped on loan to Aston Villa in the second half of last season and then made a part of the club's 'Bomb Squad' this summer, when the Portuguese made clear he wanted him nowhere near his first-team squad in the upcoming season.",
      "Now, former Crystal Palace owner Jordan has pointed the finger at both the club and Rashford for how his time at United has disintegrated to such an extent that getting him out of the club on loan without recouping any kind of up front transfer fee - they will save £12m in terms of salary - is seen in some quarters as a win.",
      "\"We should lament the loss of a significant talent,\" said Jordan, speaking on talkSPORT, when asked about Rashford's switch. \"I don't think he was ever at the level he was built up to be but we should lament the loss of the culture of Man United for a player to lose his way.",
      "\"Do you remember after the European Championships he hadn't been fit a lot of the season, was in the European Championships squad... came into that. After the European Championships, the club allowed him to go on holiday for two weeks and then have a shoulder surgery. Hang on... Get your priorities right!",
      "\"I think you have to lay the responsibility on the opportunities that have not been taken by the player at his own door, but if you don't create the culture for these young men to respect and value the opportunities that they've got, they can then get distracted by outside influences.\"",
      "While Jordan made clear his displeasure with how the Old Trafford hierarchy has handled Rashford in recent years, he also insists the player must bear responsibility for how his career at United has unravelled also.",
      "Jordan continued: \"Of course [it is Rashford's responsibility], but we know there are very few leaders in football. There are more often people who are followers.",
      "\"You lose them [followers], there's distractions and outside influences. They get more distracted in their social life. They make their decision for their birthdays. They make the decision to not turn up for training and go out on the whiz in Northern Ireland - and things of that nature.",
      "\"These are things that are clearly being tolerated by a culture. Alongside that you've then got the distractions, the affluence and the wealth footballers have.",
      "\"You've got a culture of not being able to tell people the truth because if you do, they can't cope with it - it's only good news they can hear so they don't build resilience and leadership.\"",
      "Damningly, Jordan finished: \"I think he'll be successful at Barcelona because the clear thing for Marcus Rashford is to get away from Manchester United. That's for Man United's sake and Marcus Rashford's sake - and we should lament that because he's a good player.\"",
      "Speaking at the Nou Camp after his unveiling, Rashford said: “I'm very excited. It's a club where people's dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the clubs stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "“It feels like I'm at home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here, because it's a family club, people are comfortable here and it's a good place for players to showcase their skills. I want to say thank you for the warm welcome. It's a different environment for me but it feels like home.",
      "“I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and help this club win. They won so much last year and I can see the ambition is to do better than last year and that is what you want to hear as a player. It keeps you improving year on year and that's what you need to be - the best version of yourself. So I'm very excited to be here, eager to get the games going and I'm enjoying every minute of it.",
      "“I always try to make decisive actions - fast, dynamic plays and I always like good football, so I have always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans. It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it.”",

The departure of Marcus Rashford on a season-long loan has given them more headroom to finance a move but outright sales are essential. United want to obtain fees for wingers Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Juventus are interested in Sancho but United have fielded more enquiries for Garnacho.",

      "Mason Mount has backed Manchester United signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to lift the team to \"another level\".",
      "United invested £133.5million to sign Cunha from Wolves and Mbeumo from Brentford and sharpen an attack that has recorded a minus goal difference in the past two seasons.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has repeatedly said he \"loves\" Mount, who is well versed at playing in a 3-4-2-1 formation, having lined up as one of the two playmakers in the 2021 Champions League and European Championship finals.",
      "Mount scored three goals in May after returning from a three-and-a-half-month lay-off with a groin problem but United have since brought in Cunha and Mbeumo, two prospective playmakers.",
      "\"Any time you do get that opportunity to be on the pitch, you want to do something,\" Mount stressed. \"You want to affect the game. That's always the way I've looked at it.",
      "\"Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself. I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that. Obviously with the new signings coming in, they (Cunha and Mbeumo)'re going to elevate us to another level and we all need to be at that level to really perform.",
      "\"He (Amorim)'s definitely given that confidence to me from the first day he came in, speaking to me, and I know what he wants, and I feel like I know how he wants the team to play. And, obviously, I've had some experience in that role as well.",
      "\"So that helps with the younger lads coming in and me helping them understand the positions of the formation and everything. So yeah, it's been brilliant and definitely having that confidence, the manager has that confidence in me to go out there and perform, it definitely helps as a player.\"",
      "Mount revealed United players are intensifying their pre-season training sessions by kicking each other more often. Amorim complained about a \"lack of aggression\" from the squad last season and Mount admitted there has been an edge to the pre-season sessions.",
      "The 26-year-old conceded he got \"far too many yellow cards for my liking\" when he came on in games after recovering from injury for the run-in last season but he is encouraged by the way his teammates are applying themselves.",
      "\"The vibe around the group is very energetic,\" Mount said. \"In training, it's been a few kicks here and there because we want to win in games. Little games here and there.",
      "\"That's what you want as a group. You kick your mate, but after training it's all good. He knows it was in the right mind frame.",
      "\"I think I've always had that (fouling) in me. It's just when you're at the end of last season, I was coming back. At the beginning I was obviously not starting games. I was watching games and when you have that opportunity to come into the game, you want to have an impact and you want to get straight into the action. You want to do something.",
      "\"Yeah, I got too many yellow cards and I had too many fouls. Sometimes they get you into the game and get you focused there and you're ready to receive the next ball. And then, yeah, don't get any more yellow cards after that. So, yeah, that's the way I look at it.\"",
      "\"It's been brilliant. We're all doing stuff together away from the training pitch, spending time with each other. That's massive for a long season where you're about to go in and fight against other teams. We're in a really good place and there's still time for us to work at things and everything like that. But we're good and we'll be ready for it.\"",
      "Mount started in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho, who complained about his demotion after the loss in Bilbao. The result marked the sixth time that Mount has been on the losing side in a final with Chelsea, United and England.",
      "He was unable to quickly move on from United's crushing disappointment against Spurs, which confirmed they would not play any European football this season for the second time in 35 years. \"I've had quite a few losses in finals, so it's not easy. It never gets any easier, for sure,\" he added. \"But as I said already, it's about looking at what we could have improved on.",
      "\"Any little thing that happens in the game, it's like a bigger impact, especially in a final. I think obviously it was tight. We looked at why these things could have happened, but as I said before and many times, it's about looking forward now and really using this pre-season to work on a lot of things that maybe we didn't get enough time to last season.",
      "\"With the schedule, with the games, and obviously with the gaffer coming in halfway through, this period is so vital for us to be as a group and work on things.",
      "\"So, yes, this is important. Finals are never easy to take when you lose. But when you're in that next one, you remember that feeling. It takes some time (to get over such a defeat), for sure. For sure. Because as a player, you're just thinking about little things in the game.",
      "\"I started the game, so it was like, what could I have done in that situation? Or could I have made that pass better? I think you don't look too much into it, because you would drive yourself crazy, looking into loads of detail.",
      "\"But it hurts and the whole season hurt. But this is, as I said before, a new slate now. We're looking forward to performing. And that first game of the season is a great opportunity for us to do that.\"",
      "Mount is targeting a return to a European competition, minimum. \"I'd say Europe. I think that's the focus. The Champions League would be amazing for us. And as a group, we want to, and as players, we want to be playing in that competition. And that's the goal.\"",
      "United bought Mount from Chelsea for £55m rising to £60m in 2023 to play in midfield alongside Casemiro. That experiment lasted two games and Mount has only played 47 times during two injury-plagued campaigns.",
      "\"We've looked at it and looked at why,\" Mount said of his persistent injury issues, \"and I feel we're in a really, really good place now going into this season.\"",

      "With just over five weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, Manchester United still have plenty of work to do.",
      "Ahead of facing West Ham United in their opening game of their pre-season tour of the United States this weekend, United have had a successful summer thus far, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "After scoring 35 Premier League goals between them last season, United have taken a huge stride towards solving their attacking problems. Cunha and Mbeumo were among the best players in the division last term and each bring a wealth of quality to M16.",
      "United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings this summer after finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference. However, they are yet to source the natural No.9 they desperately need.",
      "Having signed Cunha and Mbeumo for an overall package that could eventually be worth up to £133.5million, United need to rely on sales to fund further incomings. With that in mind, MEN Sport has had a close look at what United should still be striving to achieve ahead of the window closing.",
      "As already documented, United want to sign a striker before the window closes. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea from Ipswich Town last month, they are struggling to source an alternative.",
      "Set to miss out on the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, who is poised to join Arsenal, and Victor Osimhen, who is set to join Galatasaray on a permanent deal from Napoli, United are being forced to look elsewhere for a goal-getter. They are now being heavily linked with Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig.",
      "The elephant in the room is that United need to sell in order to be able to buy. Marcus Rashford's loan switch to Barcelona ensures United will save millions on his wages, but that package will not be enough to fund the addition of an elite-level goal-getter, meaning United need to raise more money via sales (more on that later).",
      "In addition to signing a striker, which has to be their top priority, United also remain keen on recruiting a midfielder and a goalkeeper. However, the Reds are unlikely to be able to swoop for a midfielder for as long as they are stuck with Casemiro.",
      "Despite signing Manuel Ugarte last year, United need an upgrade in midfield. It is understood head coach Ruben Amorim wants a midfielder who is equally comfortable on the ball and defensively.",
      "As far as United's interest in signing a goalkeeper is concerned, they want someone who can compete with and challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. They continue to be linked with Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens.",
      "Rashford became the first high profile departure of the window on Wednesday, but United need to oversee several more outgoings before September 1. It has been well-documented in recent weeks that Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony all want to move on.",
      "The quartet have been left out of the squad that has travelled to the US, highlighting they have no place in Amorim's long-term plans. It would in United's best interests if they could sell all four of them on permanent deals.",
      "Garnacho is the most valuable asset United are looking to sell this summer, and if they play their cards right, they should be attracting offers of at least £50m for him. He has enormous potential and United should try and secure every penny they possibly can for him.",
      "In addition to trying to offload their four wantaway stars, they should be looking to sell Altay Bayindir, but that will depend on if they can source a new goalkeeper first. As jittery as the Turkish international can be, United can ill-afford to leave themselves short.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Casemiro are two more players United should be striving to offload permanently. The former could find regular game time hard to come by after the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, while the latter is likely to suffer from a lack of European football this season.",
      "Casemiro saved his best performances last term for the Europa League and that is a luxury United will be without this term. The Brazilian has entered the last year of his contract, meaning this summer is the perfect time for him to be sold.",
      "He earns around £300,000-a-week and United need to sell him for £15m to avoid a loss and the profit and sustainability. He is currently competing with the likes of Toby Collyer, Kobbie Mainoo, Ugarte and Fernandes for a starting berth.",
      "Meanwhile, United need to try and get Ethan Wheatley out on loan once again after a disappointing time at Walsall in the second half of last season.",
      "Incomings: goalkeeper, midfielder & a striker.",
      "Outgoings: Altay Bayindir, Tyrell Malacia, Casemiro, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Joshua Zirkzee & Ethan Wheatley (loan).",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog from MEN Sport on Thursday, July 24.",
      "Now that Bryan Mbeumo is through the door, the priority at Old Trafford is now a striker. After missing out on Liam Delap, Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen, United are now considering alternatives.",
      "Ollie Watkins is one of the standout names linked with a move to Ruben Amorim's side. The Aston Villa striker boasts an impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League and has been linked with a move away from Villa Park in the past three windows.",
      "Meanwhile, United have been linked with Valencia's Javi Guerra. The midfielder has recently turned down a new contract at the Spanish club and reports have suggested that the Reds are working on a deal behind-closed-doors.",
      "For more signings to come in, players will have to be sold. Fortunately, United have already managed to get Marcus Rashford's wages off their books after he completed his season-long switch to Barcelona.",
      "The Spanish side have an option to sign the attacker permanently next summer and will cover all of his salary. The club will be hoping to secure similar deals for Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Keep up with all the latest United transfer news and rumours by following along with the MEN Sport blog below:",
      "There is still over a month remaining in the transfer window, and Manchester United have already strengthened their forward line considerably.",
      "Matheus Cunha made the switch to Old Trafford from Wolves at the start of the summer, while a long-running transfer saga involving Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo concluded earlier this week, as the Cameroon international was finally unveiled as a United player.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s squad are currently out in the United States for their pre-season tour, but work continues behind the scenes, with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins the latest striker to be linked with a move. Here, MEN Sport takes a look at the latest developments surrounding the England international’s future...",
      "The Reds have been busy in the summer transfer window so far, but they may not be done yet.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are now going to look at signing a striker, with outgoings also on the agenda.",
      "Here are the latest United transfer odds from the bookmaker Bet365, with a number of players tipped to sign for the club as well as leave...",
      "Benjamin Sesko – Newcastle 3/10, RB Leipzig 4/1, Man United 9/1, Arsenal 20/1, Chelsea 20/1.",
      "Christopher Nkunku – Bayern Munich 5/2, Chelsea 3/1, Newcastle 6/1, Man United 8/1, Inter Milan 10/1.",

      "Former Manchester United star Louis Saha has weighed in on the club being linked with signing a new striker.",
      "United are continuing to be linked with signing a new centre forward this summer, with Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins two of the latest names mentioned as potential targets.",
      "\"It [centre forward] definitely was the issue last year,\" Saha said in an interview with Betway.",
      "\"Defensively, we were stronger. We seemed to be more stable. We had a few mistakes from the goalkeeper, maybe a few from the defenders, but that’s obviously something that’s going to always happen in any season.",
      "\"With the lack of strength we had in midfield and the lack of ability to finish our opportunities, there are definitely a lot of weaknesses that need to be addressed, and having the striker gives you confidence because whenever you’re not playing well, he’s able to actually score his own goals. He’s able to score the goals that are important and can change the nature of the games.",
      "\"It is very important that the manager finds this with the striker, and that also gives the right platform for Hojlund or Zirkzee to perform as well, because there is not so much pressure only on their shoulders.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has given his take on rumours linking Manchester United with a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Slovenia international has been mentioned as a potential target for United, and now Ferdinand has had his say on the speculation.",
      "Sesko has also been linked with a move to Arsenal, Newcastle and the Saudi Pro League this summer.",
      "Manchester United still have several weeks remaining before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, but are being linked with several more potential new additions to their squad.",
      "United now have until September 1 to complete their transfer business for the summer, which still gives them time to sign a striker or any other new members for their squad should they wish to do so.",
      "Some of the latest transfer links concerning Manchester United centre around the possibility of signing a new striker.",
      "RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko has been linked with a move to Old Trafford in recent weeks, although it seems that Newcastle have also joined the race to sign the striker.",
      "Another day has arrived and it seems that Ollie Watkins' name will be near the top of the Manchester United transfer rumour mill.",

      "A fresh update has now emerged about United's links to signing Watkins.",

      "Make sure you stay tuned!",

      "Villa remain insistent that Watkins is not for sale amid United's search for a new striker.",
      "Watkins, 29, is under contract at Villa until 2027 but United are seeking a goalscorer with Premier League experience to sharpen their attack.",
      "TBR Football claim that Tottenham have 'enquired' about Kobbie Mainoo this summer.",
      "The 20-year-old was also linked with a move during the January transfer window, with Chelsea among the clubs reportedly interested. Meanwhile, Paul Scholes has previously urged United to keep hold of their academy product.",
      "Scholes said: \"I think Mainoo needs a run in the team, I think now it’s time to give him a chance. This back-four need protecting. No one senses danger as much as this young lad. He looked the real deal. I don’t see anyone else being able to protect the back four like he can.\"",
      "Valencia have confirmed that one of their key players has left the club, which could go on to affect Man United.",
      "Javi Guerra has been heavily linked with a move to United this summer. There have been reports that the Spain Under-21 international is being offered a new deal by the La Liga club, which is yet to be agreed and has led to United expressing an interest in a deal.",
      "If Guerra was to leave Valencia it would be another high-profile exit for the Spanish outfit. It was confirmed on Thursday that defender Cristhian Mosquera has left the club to complete a permanent move to Arsenal. In a statement released on their club website, Valencia confirmed that Mosquera has joined the Gunners after informing the club of his desire to move to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "It remains to be seen what Valencia will have planned for Guerra, with reports indicating their desire to keep the talented midfielder at the Mestalla amid rumoured interest from United.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly held initial talks with Aston Villa over a potential move for Ollie Watkins, amid Villa's interest in Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, are interested in Garnacho, a player United are open to selling but are currently unable to meet the asking price for a permanent deal. Garnacho is keen to stay in the Premier League and play Champions League football, though no move has materialised yet despite reported interest from Chelsea.",
      "While any deals for Watkins and Garnacho would be handled separately, a significant player sale by Villa could help fund a move for the United winger.",
      "According to Marca, Man United are prepared to submit an offer for Valencia star Javi Guerra, who is currently in a contract standoff with the Spanish club.",
      "United have already agreed personal terms with the midfielder and are prepared to offer up to £21.6million.",
      "However, Valencia have set a price tag of £23.4m, as they aim to secure at least £17.3m from Guerra’s sale -after accounting for a 30 percent profit share owed to his former club, Villarreal.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Aston Villa have no intention of selling the 29-year-old and have made it clear he is not available at any price.",
      "This isn’t the first time Man United have held talks with the Villa Park hierarchy this summer. There has been speculation that Manchester United could offer Alejandro Garnacho to Aston Villa as part of a swap deal for Ollie Watkins.",
      "While Garnacho is free to leave Old Trafford, he is reportedly eager to remain in the Premier League, with Villa said to be among the clubs interested.",
      "One to watch.",
      "West Ham United have reportedly opened talks with Manchester United-linked Callum Wilson this summer.",
      "United are keen to sign a new attacker this summer following the underwhelming campaign from Rasmus Hojund and Joshua Zirkzee. Hojlund has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "But any hopes of signing Wilson will need to see United accelerate their efforts after BBC Sport reported on Thursday that the Hammers are interested in a deal. It is also claimed that the 33-year-old has attracted interest from Premier League clubs and also has options in Major League Soccer (MLS).",
      "Juventus have reportedly begun to consider other attacking options like Hojlund and Liverpool's Darwin Nunez.",
      "According to Mediaset, United could be open to sending the 22-year-old on loan to Juventus.",

      "The 18-year-old, who joined Metz from the Generation Foot academy in January, made an immediate impact in his debut Ligue 2 season, scoring five goals and registering one assist in 17 appearances.",
      "Alexander Isak's name has been dominating the rumour mill today after news emerged that the striker could leave Newcastle United amid speculation of a potential £120million price tag.",
      "Away from the action on the pitch and the transfer speculation, Manchester United will also be looking ahead to the prospect of having a new stadium in the future.",
      "United unveiled plans earlier this year for a new 100,000-seater stadium, and now a fresh update has emerged about what the new home could mean for the club's supporters.",
      "Reports in recent days have linked Manchester United with a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United have been tipped to sign a new centre forward all summer, and now that Bryan Mbeumo has been signed those rumours are likely to ramp up.",
      "Sesko's name has been mentioned on the rumour mill in recent days having previously been linked with Arsenal and clubs in the Saudi Pro League earlier in the summer.",

      "#MUFC have made fresh contact with #AVFC re Ollie Watkins. Nothing close and no formal bid as any no9 arrival likely to be dependent on sales but one to watch. Villa value Watkins at £60m. With @JacobsBen for @talkSPORT",

      "Another striker target bites the dust at Manchester United in the summer transfer window.",
      "Last month, Watkins emerged as a potential striker target at Old Trafford, but reports suggested Aston Villa will not sell him this summer, which always felt like the most likely outcome.",
      "Aston Villa were believed to have wanted £60million to even consider a sale. Watkins is proven in the Premier League and he demonstrated his quality with England last summer at Euro 2024. He is an experienced centre-forward and would guarantee goals, but the deal never made sense from an Aston Villa perspective.",
      "Villa are one of the top flight clubs that are struggling with Profitability and Sustainability (PSR), but they are set to sell their women's team to avoid a breach, which should give them wriggle room.",
      "The elephant in the room was who lead their attack if Watkins were sold? Rashford has joined Barcelona and John Duran was sold to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in the January window.",
      "It was unlikely Villa would sell two goalscoring strikers in successive transfer windows, especially when there are limited striker options to replace Watkins currently in the transfer market.",
      "Villa are also a direct rival to United due to the good work of Unai Emery. The Spaniard has established Villa as European challengers during his reign and would not want to strengthen a competitor.",
      "Watkins has scored 87 goals during his time in Birmingham and reliable goalscorers are difficult to find, so Villa would obviously be better off sticking and not twisting in this summer window.",
      "The Telegraph report Villa have now insisted Watkins is not for sale at any price. And when you look at the state of the striker market this summer, that stance does not come as a surprise.",
      "That poses the question: which striker do United target this summer? There are concerns United could start the new season without a new centre-forward, which would be criminal after a train wreck 2024/2025.",
      "Watkins is not for sale, Jonathan David has signed for Juventus on a free transfer, Viktor Gyökeres is set to sign for Arsenal (United weren't interested) and Hugo Ekitike has signed for Liverpool.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is an option, but Victor Osimhen is still available and he should have been the leading target for United since the first day of the summer transfer window.",
      "Napoli were entertaining bids in the region of £70million for Osimhen before talks collapsed with Chelsea last summer and he only turned 26 in December, so he should be coming into his prime. Yes, Osimhen is a big name and would demand large wages, which goes against Ineos' policy, but he is a prolific centre-forward.",
      "Osimhen scored 37 goals in 41 games for Galatasaray - an undeniably impressive record, even in a weaker division - and he would be the dream centre forward signing for many United fans.",
      "So why hasn't Osimhen found a new club yet? The answer is probably wage demands. They have appeared to be a stumbling block so far in this window in talks with other clubs and United will not break their wage structure.",
      "Having said that, United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season and Osimhen would be the perfect solution to Ruben Amorim's biggest problem, so perhaps a compromise could be found.",
      "United are running out of striker options and must act sooner rather than later.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee had a fallow season, and United struggled to get the ball into the net. Adding Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer should go a long way towards solving that problem, but Amorim could also demand a new striker to make the most of this opportunity.",
      "Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko is widely admired across Europe, coming to prominence in Germany after a £20m move between Red Bull sister clubs Salzburg and RB Leipzig. He's had some good goalscoring seasons in the German Bundesliga, and has tallied up 16 Champions League goals over the course of two campaigns.",
      "At 22 years old, Sesko would fit the bill as a young star who can grow with the club as they rebuild. German media claims that a £60m bid would do the trick.",
      "For some fans, a striker like Sesko would complete the summer transfer window for United. Reader Itzmayor2406 says: \"The only striker that fits in the profile of potential world class strikers right now on the market is Sesko, he's only 22 and has his best days ahead of him, Newcastle signed Isak at 22, developed and now he's been priced at £120m.",
      "\"We are not looking at winning the league yet, but building a team to be able to do so in 3 years. A 15-20 goal striker, 22 years old, and potentially world class who will be 25 in 3 years on decent wages, is the way to go.\"",
      "Commenter Bestietom would like something like Sesko: \"We very much need a striker as all the top teams have acquired a top striker and we will again be left further behind. Sesko or even Vlahovic would be ideal for us. Both are available and we must get a striker to play with Cunha, and Mbeumo.\"",
      "Ep34109 writes: \"The media say we cannot afford to buy Sesko as he is too expensive (£60M plus I think) but now according to those same media outlets we are looking to bring Watkins to Old Trafford. Personally I would rather have Sesko (who is younger than Watkins). We have, in the past, bought older players for large amounts with no sell on value.\"",
      "Thetruthpersonified says: \"Has to be Sesko over Watkins. Much as I like Watkins he has peaked and will decline soon. What did Emery see that made him start Rashford ahead of Watkins! So for a similar transfer fee, surely it's Sesko. Personally, I find it hard to believe either will be viable until we get some inbound funds.\"",
      "TeesterX writes: \"Sesko is attracting interest from across Europe for a reason. I think now is the best time to buy. I think he'll be worth a lot more next summer.\"",
      "MrMo says: \"Really wanted Osimhen, but feel Sesko is the next best out there. Club should just go get him before we miss out AGAIN. Watkins' age is against him as Villa want to much and there would not be any sell on value in him. Jackson misses more than he scores and Chelsea want way more than he is worth. Out of the 3 that are available Sesko is a no brainer.\"",
      "Have your say! Should United go for Sesko if they can fit him in to their budget? Comment below, and join in on the conversation.",

      "Former centre-back Rio Ferdinand has said Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins would be a \"very, very good\" addition for Manchester United amid ongoing reports linking him with Old Trafford.",
      "With just over five weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, United are still on the hunt for a centre-forward after missing out on Liam Delap earlier this summer.",
      "After splashing out north of £120million on the additions of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, United will be reliant on sales to fund further arrivals. The Reds are also keen on recruiting a goalkeeper and a midfielder this summer.",
      "Having missed out on Delap and other options heading elsewhere, United are now being strongly linked with Watkins, who has been a regular source of goals for Villa in recent years, scoring 87 times in five seasons at the club.",
      "And in the opinion of Ferdinand, Watkins could be a brilliant signing for the Reds, outlining how he would add a degree of experience to Ruben Amorim's attacking options.",
      "\"I think he would be a very, very good addition to the Manchester United squad,\" the former defender said, speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents. \"He scored 17 goals last season, 14 assists in 54 appearances.",
      "\"He's 29, that's the only drawback for Manchester United. There's not going to be any sell-on value which I understand is an issue, but you've got to look at the here and now with Manchester United.",
      "\"Manchester United need experience at the top of the pitch. They've got [Rasmus] Hojlund, [Joshua] Zirkzee and Chido [Obi]… young, inexperienced players.",
      "\"They need someone to look at and go, 'That's how you play as a No.9, that's how you do it', and when you buy someone who hasn't got as much experience as I'd like, I think that's another risk.",
      "\"I think Watkins would be a very good addition for the younger ones to look at and go, 'Yes, that's the benchmark of someone who knows how the play the role'.",
      "\"He's done it consistently at the top level for the last few years, he's scored goals, Champions League football as well.\"",

      "There is still over a month remaining in the transfer window, and Manchester United have already strengthened their forward line considerably.",
      "Matheus Cunha made the switch to Old Trafford from Wolves at the start of the summer, while a long-running transfer saga involving Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo concluded earlier this week, as the Cameroon international was finally unveiled as a United player.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s squad are currently out in the United States for their pre-season tour, but work continues behind the scenes, with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins the latest striker to be linked with a move. Here, MEN Sport takes a look at the latest developments surrounding the England international’s future.",
      "Despite already making two attacking additions, United are reportedly targeting a new No.9, this summer, according to The Telegraph. As part of Amorim’s rebuild at the club, the current options of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are not considered sufficient.",
      "The report adds that a striker with Premier League experience is the priority, which is why Villa’s Watkins has emerged as a serious option for the United hierarchy. The 29-year-old has spent his entire career in England, having progressed through the youth ranks at Exeter City.",
      "Watkins made the move to Villa Park from Brentford in 2020 and has since racked up over 180 Premier League appearances. During that time, he has netted 75 goals, reaching double figures in each of his five top-flight seasons with Villa.",
      "However, The Telegraph also notes that Villa have told United that Watkins is not for sale this summer, effectively issuing a ‘hands-off’ warning. The Midlands club have no intention of parting with their striker, and the report adds he is not available at any price.",
      "Villa have long regarded Watkins as untouchable, having already turned down an approach from Arsenal during the January window. Instead, they raised funds elsewhere through the sale of Jhon Duran to Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr.",
      "Given the dearth of quality striker options on the market this summer, as well as the fierce competition from other top Premier League clubs, Villa’s reluctance to sell is understandable.",
      "In addition, a report from journalist Ben Jacobs this week echoes claims that United have held fresh talks over a potential move for Watkins. However, he notes that a £60 million valuation is seen as excessive for a player set to turn 30 later this year.",
      "It has been suggested United would be willing to progress negotiations should the price drop, but with Villa’s firm ‘not for sale’ stance, that appears unlikely. As alternatives, it’s understood that Benjamin Sesko, Nicolas Jackson, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, and Aleksandar Mitrovic have all been discussed internally.",

      "United travelled to the United States on Tuesday for their pre-season tour, where they will take on West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "Ruben Amorim has strengthened his United squad with the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer. Mbeumo was signed from Brentford for £65million plus £6m in add-ons, while Cunha's release clause of £62.5m at Wolves was triggered and will be paid over three instalments.",
      "United need to sign a new striker and other positions need addressing following an awful campaign, but sales are required to raise cash for further incomings this summer.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season and Shearer has warned United are still a few high quality signings away from competing at the top end of the table.",
      "Speaking in an interview with Betfair, Shearer said: \"Last year was a disaster for Man United. It will be better than that this season, I've no doubt, but how much better will depend on how much business they do between now and the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"There's no doubt they need a top-class centre-forward, which would go well with Cunha and Mbeumo, so they've still got business to do and it depends on what quality they bring in.",
      "\"Even with just Cunha and Mbeumo, there's no doubt they'll improve on last season. As I said, they're still three, maybe four top players away from challenging for the top six.",
      "\"Once they had shown their intentions that they wanted to sign Mbeumo, Brentford were always going to hold out for what they wanted, and I guess they've not got what they wanted.",
      "\"There's no doubt he's a very, very good player. We've seen that for a while at Brentford now. Him and Yoane Wissa have been the main threats and he's proven in the Premier League, which adds value to it.",
      "\"Mbeumo will likely be going to AFCON, but you know that when you sign these players. You just have to get on with it and accept it. He'll be a big player for Man United, so to be without him for that amount of time will hurt him and Man United, but other clubs will have the same problem.",
      "\"Salah will be missing for Liverpool, too, but the business they've done is fantastic. You have to be prepared for players going to AFCON and you have to have the squad for it.\"",
      "Shearer shared his thoughts on Marcus Rashford's move to Barcelona and said: \"It could be a huge move for Marcus Rashford. That all depends on him. I guess, and he probably thinks that it's time for a reset and if he can forget what's gone on in the past, the good and the bad, then he's got a great opportunity to kickstart his career again.",
      "\"It doesn't get much bigger than Barcelona, so Hansi Flick and the club clearly believe in him, they're paying his full salary and there's a clause at the end of the loan if they want to sign him on a permanent basis, so what an opportunity for Marcus to have a career reset.",
      "\"That's what he must do and that has to be the mentality. Only he can answer whether he gets back in the England squad. I don't know him personally, what his state of mind is in terms of where he feels he is.",
      "\"But I guess the whole Barcelona project believe they can get the best out of him, otherwise they wouldn't be paying the £300,000-odd per week for him. I guess they've done their homework, sat down with him and they feel it's a chance worth taking. It could be an expensive one or it could be a great signing.",
      "\"I don't know is the answer. We've seen flashes of his best at Aston Villa. They chose not to sign him permanently for whatever reason. Barcelona believe they can get the very best out of him and if they can, it could turn out to be a shrewd signing.",
      "\"But you also have to look at it and think it's a little bit of a gamble because we've not seen anywhere near the heights that he hit all those years ago for a long time now. Only Marcus knows where he is mentally and physically.\"",

      "On the one hand, United have completed two important signings already this summer with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Both deals have seen United commit to paying a total of £133.5million this summer, but on the other hand it seems there is still the need for more deals to be completed on the horizon.",
      "Which deals those will be remains to seen, with a host of players already being linked with moves to Old Trafford ahead of the September 1 deadline. Ruben Amorim's main focus for the time being will be preparing the United squad for the start of the new season, with pre-season training already well underway ahead of the new Premier League campaign which gets underway on August 17 against Arsenal.",
      "Much has been said about United's need to sign a new striker this summer, which has fuelled speculation about Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund's futures with the club. One area of the squad that may need reinforcements, though, is midfield.",
      "Christian Eriksen left the club as a free agent and Casemiro has now entered the final year of his contract with United, although there is the option of another year on his deal. As a result, United may be wise to look at the middle of the part for their next signing.",
      "Valencia star Javi Guerra is one of the names to be linked with a move to United this summer. The Spain Under-21 international is also thought to have an uncertain future with the La Liga club, with contract negotiations still up in the air as things stand.",
      "United are reported to have been weighing up a move for Guerra for some time, although AC Milan have also been credited with an interest in the 22-year-old. As a result, United will have to move fast if they wish to act on their reported interest in Guerra.",
      "There's no doubt, though, that Guerra is being tipped for a bright future and is regarded as one of the brightest midfield prospects in Europe. It would certainly be a shrewd piece of business from United if they were to agree a deal for the Valencia star this summer.",
      "Guerra can play in several positions in midfield, and his signing would allow Amorim to have greater flexibility in the middle of the park. It may also allow the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte to have more freedom in their roles going forward.",
      "It will not be easy, though, with reports indicating that Valencia do not want Guerra to leave the club this summer, even though there have been suggestions of a possible €25million (£22million) price tag. But if there is the potential for a deal to be made, United would be wise to be at the front of the queue of potential suitors.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee struggled to get onto the scoresheet last season, and the squad's overall output was a key part of a hugely disappointing campaign in the league. Top strikers like Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen may be out of reach for now, but there are \"Premier League-ready\" options that United could turn to if they want an immediate impact.",
      "Ollie Watkins has been impressive and energetic under Unai Emery at Aston Villa, but the inclusion of Marcus Rashford on loan dented his opportunities at times last season. United have reportedly made enquiries about the possibility of signing Watkins, who is valued at £60 million with three years left on his contract.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta is another option on the older side, having had a good couple of seasons at FA Cup winners Crystal Palace. RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko would come with a significant price tag, but has plenty of room to grow and brings Champions League experience.",
      "Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson may find himself out of favour after they signed former United target Liam Delap, and his situation is being monitored by top clubs.",
      "Fans are leaning towards one of these more realistic targets to add to their existing business. Reader Steady Irwin says: \"We are stronger, and have more goal potential in us, with less games, but we need a striker. I like Mateta because his strengths are Hojlund's weaknesses. Add him (or an alternative ) and someone with energy in the middle that can take a ball from the defenders and turn with it, and we've had a good window.\"",
      "Commenter Realredmanc writes: \"I like Ollie Watkins, but we should be careful about any contract offered.\"",
      "Toothpick says: \"For a club that isn't in any European football, we just need a striker who is a specialist. Either holds up the ball very well or knows when and how to position themselves in the box to score. We should avoid getting strikers whose abilities are unclear. We have too many strikers like Zirkzee and Hojlund who aren't excellent at any part of their game.\"",
      "Garth123 writes: \"With the profile of the striker Amorim is looking for. Ollie Watkins for me would be the best fit. If United can get him for under £50m, then we could get 3 or 4 good years out of him which will buy time for the development of Obi, who I think will inherit the No. 9 role in time.\"",
      "1968red says: \"Watkins in a swap with Garnacho would be better than a Mason Mount-type situation again with Chelsea, and monetarily better for us.\"",
      "Deanodo is dead against one option: \"No to Jackson, we don’t want any Chelsea rejects. If they're not good enough for Chelsea, why would we want them?\"",
      "Cdpc has different priorities: \"Personally I’d prioritize a dynamic box-to-box midfielder over a striker this year. I think for too long we’ve been overrun in midfield and had no interplay between the top 3. Everyone’s down on our current striker options, but if we’re fair, they’ve had terrible service over the past couple of years.\"",
      "IlSacristano writes: \"Ollie Watkins IMHO. A good striker who enjoys his game with a big smile. I think he's got a good few years in the tank.\"",
      "Have your say! Do United need a striker, or are they better off shoring up other parts of the pitch after the arrival of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo? Comment below, and join in on the conversation.",

      "Aston Villa have reportedly told Manchester United that Ollie Watkins is not for sale. Ruben Amorim's team are in the hunt for a new striker, and it is reported that the Villa forward is among those being considered.",
      "Watkins joined Villa in a £33million transfer from Brentford in September 2020. Since then, he has made his mark as one of the leading attackers in English football, netting 87 goals and providing 42 assists in 223 appearances. However, Watkins could be set to depart Villa during the summer transfer window.",
      "It has been suggested that he was left disgruntled after United loanee Marcus Rashford pushed him down the selection order, resulting in him being the second choice for several key matches in April, including the two-legged Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain. This has fuelled rumours about a potential exit.",
      "The Reds have reportedly held fresh talks with Villa over Watkins' availability. United want to sign a new striker after completing deals for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and their budget could depend on selling players first.",
      "But The Telegraph report that United have been informed Watkins is going nowhere. The 29-year-old, who is valued at around £60m, has three years left on his contract at Villa Park.",
      "The same report also claims that United made a surprise loan offer for Argentine World Cup winner Emi Martinez. Villa reportedly instantly rejected the offer for the goalkeeper",
      "It is said that Villa will only consider letting him go if a club meets their valuation. That. price is understood to be around the £40m mark.",
      "The Reds may sign a new goalkeeper this summer after Andre Onana's injury. Ruben Amorim has been open to signing a keeper to challenge Onana for his starting role for some time.",
      "But it is understood that the chances of a new arrival immediately usurping Onana are slim. The Reds have also been linked with Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",

      "There was once a time when Bryan Mbeumo and Ollie Watkins formed two thirds of the Championship's best attack.",
      "Alongside Said Benrahma, who is now at Saudi Arabian club Neom SC, the duo helped form a formidable front-three at Brentford, often dubbed as 'BMW'.",
      "They all made their names in the Championship and were eventually sold by Brentford for big-money, with Mbeumo's recent move to Manchester United banking the Londoners a fixed price of £65million. The deal could eventually be worth £71m.",
      "Mbeumo was identified as a top target for United this summer after scoring 20 Premier League goals for Brentford last season. After helping the Bees win promotion from the Championship in 2021, he scored 42 goals in four Premier League seasons for the Bees.",
      "Watkins left Brentford just under a year before they graduated to the Premier League, joining Aston Villa in September 2020. That saw him offered the chance to play in the top-flight for the first time in his career.",
      "Despite playing non-league football for Weston-super-Mare just a few years earlier, Watkins immediately adapted to life in the Premier League, scoring 14 goals and registering five assists in 37 appearances.",
      "That 14-goal haul marked a sign of things to come for Watkins at Villa Park. Each of his five Premier League campaigns at the club have seen him reach double figures for goals, scoring 14, 11, 15, 19 and 16 goals in the last five league campaigns respectively.",
      "Although he has never hit the 20-goal marker in a league campaign during his Villa career, he has always been a reliable and consistent source of goals. The 2023/24 campaign was his standout at Villa Park, scoring 19 goals and registering 13 assists in the Premier League.",
      "Last season, although not as fruitful, he still contributed 16 goals and eight assists in 38 league appearances. Watkins' hopes of scoring 20 goals in a single Premier League campaign for the first time last term were scuppered by the addition of Marcus Rashford in January.",
      "The United attacker, who joined Barcelona on loan earlier this week, was often deployed through the middle at Villa Park by Unai Emery, meaning Watkins lost his place in the starting XI. Rashford has always been more effective on the left and the expectation was he and Watkins would join forces in attack.",
      "Amid United's ongoing search for a striker, Watkins is continuing to be linked with a move to Old Trafford. The Reds are desperate to recruit a centre-forward this summer to complement the additions of Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference and have not been able to rely on an out-and-out centre-forward for goals since Cristiano Ronaldo scored 24 goals in his homecoming season in 2021/22.",
      "A club of United's stature needs to be able to rely on a proven goalscorer to spearhead their attack. Rasmus Hojlund scored just four Premier League goals last term and Joshua Zirkzee, who was signed to support him, scored just seven times across all competitions.",
      "Having targeted unproven operators to try and strengthen the tip of their attack in each of the last two summers, United need a tried and tested option this summer, and they will not find many options better than Watkins.",
      "Having missed out on Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea from Ipswich Town via a £30m release clause, United have been chasing lost causes in their striker search. Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen have both been heavily linked with United throughout the summer but are now expected to move elsewhere.",
      "Attainable strikers are at a premium this summer, and United have acknowledged that. But with the Reds in such desperate need of a goal-getter, they are going to have to pluck one from somewhere.",
      "If they were to swoop for Watkins, United could do far worse. Although he is yet to break the 20-goal barrier in the Premier League, he has often gone close.",
      "Having swooped for Cunha and Mbeumo already this summer, Watkins would also tie in with theme of recruiting players with Premier League pedigree. Unfortunately for United, however, the sticking point is that Villa will set lofty demands amid the fact he is under contract until 2028.",
      "It once again highlights the importance of United getting money in the bank via player sales to fund their top transfer objective.",

      "The former Newcastle United striker left Eddie Howe's side on a free transfer in June. The Reds have been focusing on bolstering their attack this summer and are looking to sign a new No.9.",
      "United will need to sell to buy after spending big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the current transfer window. One option reportedly being considered is looking at free agents, with ex-Leicester City star Jamie Vardy, former Everton frontman Dominic Calvert-Lewin, and Wilson all being linked with short-term moves to Old Trafford.",
      "But any hopes of signing Wilson will need to see United accelerate their efforts after BBC Sport reported on Thursday that the Hammers are interested in a deal. It is also claimed that the 33-year-old has attracted interest from Premier League clubs and also has options in Major League Soccer (MLS).",
      "Newcastle spent around £20million to sign Wilson from Bournemouth in 2020. He spent an injury-hit five years at St James' Park.but went on to score 49 goals in 130 appearances for the Magpies.",
      "Talking about Wilson's presence at Newcastle, Magpies boss Eddie Howe has said: \"What I can say is that Callum Wilson is, and has been, an incredible footballer for Newcastle. He’s someone who epitomises the spirit that has got us to where we are.",
      "\"He’s professional, brave – to come here and be the number nine in the manner and the moment he did, it was a difficult moment in the club’s history.",

      "Manchester United have made it their mission to recruit ready-made Premier League talent this summer after luring Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford for big-money fees.",
      "After completing the £62.5million signing of Cunha from Wolves last month, Bryan Mbeumo arrived in M16 earlier this week, arriving from Brentford for an initial fee of £65m. The deal could eventually be worth £71m.",
      "In Cunha and Mbeumo, United have added two experienced Premier League players to their ranks who enjoyed marvellous campaigns last season. Cunha scored 17 goals in all competitions and Mbeumo notched 20 in the Premier League.",
      "Cunha made his first appearance for the Reds in Stockholm last Saturday, starting the goalless draw with Leeds United, and Mbeumo is likely to make his first outing for the club when they face West Ham United at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey this weekend.",
      "After finishing last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference, United rightfully prioritised attacking signings from the outset this summer. Cunha and Mbeumo have scored 75 career goals in the Premier League between them, meaning they each boast a proven record.",
      "The Reds have turned to overseas options when strengthening their attack in recent seasons, signing both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee from Italian clubs in 2023 and 2024 respectively.",
      "However, United have repeated the approach former manager Sir Alex Ferguson so often took during his time in charge at Old Trafford, targeting the Premier League's best players.",
      "Speaking back in 2020, former United captain Gary Neville said of Ferguson's recruitment strategy: \"There were three categories to the policy. He wanted to promote youth wherever possible, that was number one before he even looked at the external market.",
      "\"Number two was to look at the best in the Premier League; those he could trust and still have growth and be with the club for a long time: Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Robin van Persie.",
      "\"And then he always wanted emerging international talent that could come over to Manchester, that he could work with and develop into great players: Nemanja Vidic, Peter Schmeichel, Patrice Evra, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\"",
      "In recruiting Cunha and Mbeumo, United have signed two of the Premier League's best players from last season. Cunha was a standout operator for Wolves, regularly catching the eye, and Mbeumo was the joint-fourth highest goalscorer in the division.",
      "Less than 48 hours after announcing the arrival of Mbeumo, United, on Wednesday, confirmed the departure of Marcus Rashford, who has joined Barcelona on loan for the duration of the 2025/26 season.",
      "The England international, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, has not played for United since last December after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Neville, continuing to address Ferguson's approach, added: \"In terms of selling players, he would get rid when they either weren't good enough, or when he felt they were questioning his control. He was ruthless on that. In all of his interviews, he talks about control, authority, discipline.\"",

      "Manchester United face a ‘dilemma’ over the future of Kobbie Mainoo amid interest from Tottenham amid claims the midfielder’s agent is ‘not asking for too much money’.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with the Old Trafford exit for the last year, with Chelsea approaching the Red Devils last summer and again in January over a move for the England international.",
      "United initially insisted Mainoo was ‘untouchable’ and then slapped a £70m price tag on his head amid their PSR woes and the midfielder’s dip in form.",
      "TBR Football claimed on Thursday that Tottenham have made a ‘shock enquiry’ to sign Mainoo and ‘actually stand a chance of signing’ the England international.",
      "Spurs ‘have asked about signing’ Mainoo as the north Londoners ‘appreciate the 20-year-old and are keeping abreast of his contract situation, which still hasn’t been agreed’.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is ‘keen to add another’ midfielder this summer and Mainoo could fall down the pecking order at Old Trafford with the World Cup just around the corner.",
      "With that in mind, Mainoo ‘will be eager to be playing regular football’ and that ‘could open the door for Spurs and Chelsea’ as TBR Football ‘sources suggest he could still move this summer’.",
      "Talks over a contract extension have stalled after it was claimed Mainoo’s representatives were asking for £180,000 per week for him to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "Those reports were later refuted, but with Mainoo currently earning just £25,000 per week and with two years left on his deal, as Dean Saunders explains, United face a ‘dilemma’.",
      "Saunders told talkSPORT: “I know his agent, and he’s not asking for too much money in comparison to what the players are earning at Man United.",
      "“But it’s a dilemma for the football club, what do you do with Mainoo? How much money do you pay him?",
      "“Because he’s actually not done much in the game but gets in the England squad and now he’s in Man United’s team and there’s players earning three times more than him, four times more than him.",
      "“So to protect their asset, how much money have you got to give him to get him to sign a new contract?",
      "“Or, if he’s not going to sign it, they’re going to have to sell him, otherwise he walks out on a free. But I think he’d get in Spurs’ team.”",

      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Only three Premier League players are on offer…",
      "Mainoo is so much more than ‘pure profit’ and the very idea of selling him is an indictment of Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes."

      "Luke Shaw is ‘ready to listen to offers’ amid ‘serious interest’ in his services this summer amid ‘fears’ over a lack of game time at Manchester United this season.",
      "Shaw made just 12 appearances for the Red Devils after missing the first three months of the campaign with a calf problem and his Old Trafford career in general has been continually blighted by injuries.",
      "United have worked to strengthen the left side of defence since Ruben Amorim’s arrival, with Patrick Dorgu joining from Lecce for £25m in January and Diego Leon added this summer in a £3.3m move from Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno.",
      "Leon played the first half of United’s 0-0 friendly draw with Leeds last weekend and Amorim was impressed with what he saw from the 18-year-old.",
      "“He did really well. He’s learning things, he’s powerful, he’s going to be a very good player,” Amorim said.",
      "Shaw is therefore facing the possibility of being fourth choice left wing-back in Amorim’s favoured 3-4-3 system, behind Leon, Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, who was a regular starter in that position last term, though Shaw has also operated as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "The Sun claim the 30-year-old ‘is aware of serious interest from Saudi clubs and is ready to listen to offers’ amid ‘fears his Red Devils career might be nearing an end’ despite having two years left on his contract, though Amorim is ‘in no hurry’ to get rid of him.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Shaw is seen as a popular and influential figure within the dressing room and Amorim is in no hurry to dump him or his £150,000-a-week wages. But the player himself is determined to make up for so much lost time and knows he faces a tough decision on his future over the coming months.",
      "‘Should he decide to leave it is unlikely United would be difficult to deal with in terms of a fee considering all those injuries and his lack of appearances – only 27 in the last two campaigns.’",
      "The Sun also claim that the Red Devils have ‘ruled out breaking the bank’ to sign a new No.9 as ‘the club is not in a position to go large unless there are significant exits’.",
      "This is a factor in Hojlund’s favour as ‘the decision not to push the boat out opens the door’ for him ‘to stake his claim during the three-match Premier League Summer Series tournament against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton’.",

      "‘United chief Ruben Amorim, though, looks set to give the Dane, 22, a final chance to show he can be the Old Trafford spearhead.",
      "‘Amorim believes the arrivals of Cunha and Mbeumo will give United a new attacking dynamism, allowing Hojlund to flourish in front of goal.’",
      "Tottenham were slightly better than a terrible Man Utd to win an actual trophy, but they’ve got four players in this list of ten who should be axed this summer.",
      "Mohamed Salah makes a rare appearance in the Premier League Worst XI and he is joined by two Liverpool teammates after their 3-1 defeat at Chelsea.",

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Anthony Gordon – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt’s been pretty quiet around Gordon so far this summer, but it seems someone is trying to drum up the noise. We all know he would probably walk to Anfield to join Liverpool, so most likely the stirring is being done by the those close to the player. Who will be dismayed by Alexander Isak’s stance since the Reds will most likely throw their money at the Swede over the Scouser.",

      "19) 🆕 Luke Shaw – Manchester United to Saudi\nThis hasn’t reached the stage yet of a suitor being named but reports suggest Shaw has seen the writing on the wall for his United career and he’s willing to make the best of it by taking the Saudi coin. Sadly, Ruben Amorim will have taken the view that Shaw’s fitness cannot be relied upon, and he is now well-stocked for left wing-backs. There is no urgency here – it could be one for January.",
      "",
      "18) 🔼 Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nUnited are ready to get a deal done quickly, apparently, at around £20million for the Spain Under-21 midfielder who has just rejected Valencia’s latest offer of a contract renewal. Reports suggest Guerra is hoping for a better offer from Valencia so this could simply be a case of his representatives using United and the oldest trick in the agents’ book.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Emi Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited have been heavily linked with the Villa keeper, but their intent was limited to a pitiful loan offer which the Villans, understandably, laughed off. Reports in Argentina suggest that’s as far as United will go, and Martinez will instead consider cashing in over in Saudi.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Antony – Manchester United to Atletico Madrid \nUnited have hoped Real Betis would somehow find the funds to pay £30million to make Antony’s loan a permanent arrangement, but they appear to have been stringing United along all summer. According to reports in Spain, Atletico are ready to step into the breach. Though neither are they likely to be a simple answer to United’s problem here.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nNo sooner had we reports of renewed interest from United in Watkins did we have the rebuttal from Villa. The England striker is considered by the Villans as ‘not for sale’. Which is what anyone looking to sell for top dollar would say at first. Watkins is valued at £60million by Villa. United would doubtless seek to negotiate down from there but we’re struggling to see where the two clubs find common ground here if this was a deal done in isolation.",
      "",
      "14) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, reaffirming somewhat that the winger has a higher opinion of himself than most others do. Chelsea and Spurs have been linked but it has always been tentative. The noise has been building around Villa’s interest in Garnacho, but like United’s view on Watkins, they can’t pay the amount requested. With all the accounting sorcery prompted by PSR, we’re sure there’s a workaround here that leaves everyone happy.",
      "",
      "13) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko seemed to be going nowhere while Leipzig were demanding in excess of £75million but in news sure to grind Arsenal’s gears, reports in Germany suggest that demand could have fallen to £59million, which would make the Slovenian much more appealing to United.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nIt was thought Xhaka might be heading for the riches of Saudi but instead he fancies the splendour of Sunderland. Indeed, the ex-Arsenal midfielder has told Leverkusen he only wants to move to the Stadium of Light while urging the German club to do a deal quickly. Those pleas, though, appear to have fallen on deaf ears, with Erik ten Hag insisting Leverkusen have already lost too many key players this summer.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up right now with Gyokeres, but once that deal is done, we should expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "9) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and he is the first on their list should Isak get his wish.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "7) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Sancho’s agent has been in Turin this week to attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "6) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. Only problem now is they need to deal with Brentford. Wissa reportedly returned early from the Bees’ pre-season training camp for talks over his future – he is unlikely to have liked what he was told. Quite reasonably, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa – the suggestion was he was only ever viewed as back-up to Isak – then they are going to have to try a lot harder than £25million.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe didn’t think this done just because Newcastle had told Liverpool that Isak was not for sale. Their stance hasn’t changed – but everything else has after Isak agitated for a move. If only he had done it sooner, Liverpool might not have spent the money on Hugo Ekitike, who might have filled the Isak void at Newcastle. Instead, the expectation is the pair will team up at Anfield. It won’t happen quick – Newcastle are determined to dig in and their worst-case scenario has to involve a British transfer record fee – but it’ll probably happen.",
      "",
      "3) Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nThis one doesn’t seem to have moved in since Forest saw their arse over Spurs randomly plucking the same number out of the sky that appears on Gibbs-White contract under the buy-out clause. Forest threatened legal action and since then… nothing. The player missed the start of Forest’s pre-season trip to Portugal to stay behind with his heavily pregnant partner but joined up on Wednesday. What now? For this to go through, Spurs must suss that they are legally on solid ground and pursue the deal at the cost of their original offer; or they sweeten the deal for Forest to sell a player who wants to move.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThe Netherlands defender’s agent is quite open about talks that have taken place with Chelsea, who have also been in touch with Ajax. Hato has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Real Madrid, but he’s apparently already ‘said yes’ to Chelsea, who seem intent on getting to the teenager first. Hato was left out of the Ajax squad for Thursday night’s friendly against Celtic in Como.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nAfter bemoaning the abject lack of progress in the last week, it seems we finally have some. On Tuesday, Ornstein reported that Sporting and Arsenal are ‘on the verge of total agreement’. Which is where we thought they were but, apparently, a ‘conclusion is imminent’. Which is something we can all be thankful for. Gyokeres is said to be waiting, passport in hand, to join Arsenal in Asia."

      "“They need someone to look at and go, ‘That’s how you play as a number nine, that’s how you do it!’, and when you buy someone who hasn’t got as much experience as I’d like, I think that’s another risk.",

      "Ferdinand has also argued that the Red Devils should “break the bank” on Brighton star Carlos Baleba if they had the choice of signing him or an “inexperienced” forward.",

      "Arsenal need another forward, Chelsea and Liverpool have players to offload, and Newcastle must clean up an unholy mess. With five weeks left, Premier League clubs still have plenty to sort before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: Add an elite left-sided attacker\nEasier said than done for Arsenal, who have spent the kind of money needed for Alexander Isak on Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres. The Newcastle striker’s transfer request came at the worst time for the Gunners, while Liverpool might already be feeling some buyer’s remorse after spending big on the versatile Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Madueke gives Mikel Arteta a new wide option, but he’s not a significant upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli on the left. He offers outstanding depth for Bukayo Saka and, considering Liverpool just won the title with Luis Diaz, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota as their left-wingers – after City dominated with Jeremy Doku, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez – it’s a smarter signing than most realise.",
      "Martinelli’s development has stalled, scoring just 14 goals across the last two seasons after netting 15 in 2022/23, and Leandro Trossard is more bench spark than starter. The next big-money addition for the Gunners after Madueke, Gyokeres and Martin Zubimendi should be a top-tier left-sided forward.",
      "Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze – naturally a midfielder – is a possible option, but the dream is Real Madrid winger Rodrygo. He’s available, and selling Martinelli to fund that move would be smart business.",
      "MORE: Arsenal keep or sell: Martinelli, Zinchenko gone but Trossard, Havertz stay",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Sign a right-back…and the rest\nRestricted by the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules, Villa have been worryingly quiet in this window.",
      "They made two smart January loan signings, Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio, who contributed to 29.3% of their goals from February onwards. Both have returned to their parent clubs, and that output now needs replacing. Only Fulham (£0) and Crystal Palace (£2m) have spent less this summer.",
      "Villa are in their best position in decades, but they risk falling behind as the teams around them strengthen. Clubs that finished above them are pulling away again and those below, like Manchester United, Spurs and Brighton, are closing the gap.",
      "Back in April, we said Emery needed a right-back. That still hasn’t happened. Once that’s sorted, they can get moving on the rest. They’ll need an attacker and a goalkeeper if Emiliano Martinez departs.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Defensive recruits\nIt’s rare to lose four of your back five in one summer, but that’s where Bournemouth find themselves. They’ve already lost 60%, and PSG target Illia Zabarnyi could soon make that 80%, joining Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and on-loan goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga out the door.",
      "They’ve signed a goalkeeper in Djordje Petrovic and a left-back in Adrien Truffert, but they’re yet to add a centre-back, when they might actually need two. And just like Villa, the one position that needed addressing most going into the window (right-back) still hasn’t been sorted.",
      "The priorities are obvious and Bournemouth need to get moving.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Replace Bryan Mbeumo\nChristian Norgaard has been replaced by Jordan Henderson. Caoimhin Kelleher is in for Mark Flekken. Attacking midfielder Antoni Milambo has joined. Now comes the hard part: replacing their best player.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 league goals last season before joining Manchester United for an initial £65million. That’s a massive hole to fill, but Brentford have the money and are one of the savviest recruitment teams in the league. Their most impressive work came in the Championship, but they’ve earned trust.",
      "Replacing Mbeumo’s output won’t be easy, but they’ll back themselves to find a solution.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Farm some more wonderkids\nWho are we to tell Brighton how to do transfer business? They’ve already done the hard part by improving at centre-back. They sold Joao Pedro for £55m, but signed £30m Charalampos Kostoulas, and Stefanos Tzimas is now officially part of the squad.",
      "Do they need to replace Pedro? Probably not. Brighton can do whatever they like, and it’ll likely involve signing the next batch of South American wonderkids while the rest of the league watches on in envy.",
      "MORE: Benfica are the greatest salesmen in football; even Brighton cannot touch them",
      "",
      "Burnley: Goalkeeper clarity\nThere’s always room to improve after promotion, and Burnley have had a much smarter window this time – less scattergun, more substance. They’ve added some experience and quality with Jacob Bruun Larsen, Kyle Walker, Jaidon Anthony and Marcus Edwards.",
      "But the biggest question mark remains in goal. James Trafford continues to be linked with Newcastle, and now Manchester City are sniffing around. That’s bad news for the Magpies and Scott Parker.",
      "The Trafford situation has dragged on too long. Burnley need clarity: is he staying or going, and do they need a new No.1?",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Offload players\nSurprise, surprise, Chelsea’s squad is too big. That’s what happens when you sign 20 players a window. They need to sell, they need to loan, and if things get desperate, Todd Boehly has Strasbourg on speed dial.",
      "Players Chelsea wouldn’t be blamed for moving on: Marc Guiu, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Joao Felix, David Datro Fofana, Raheem Sterling, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Carney Chukwuemeka, Alfie Gilchrist, Ben Chilwell, Aaron Anselmino, Axel Disasi, Benoit Badiashile, Gabriel Slonina, and Kendry Paez on loan.",
      "MORE: Premier League Bomb Squad XI includes Manchester United trio and Newcastle’s PSR pawn",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Get prepared for Europe\nPalace’s hierarchy are too busy appealing their Europa League demotion to notice that the transfer window is open. Just £2m spent so far, with Walter Benitez and Borna Sosa their only arrivals.",
      "Yes, they need to be more active, but the top priority is keeping their best players. Then, they need to add some squad depth to manage the Thursday-Sunday grind of European football, whatever competition they end up in.",
      "",
      "Everton: Find Iliman Ndiaye some help\nDavid Moyes has filled the striker void with Thierno Barry. Jack Harrison’s return to Leeds isn’t the worst outcome, but it does leave Everton light out wide.",
      "Dwight McNeil, still only 25, had a productive season considering his lengthy absence, providing four goals and eight assists in 21 games. But with no other consistent creative outlet, it’s all on Iliman Ndiaye.",
      "If teams figure out how to nullify Ndiaye, Everton are in trouble. Jack Grealish has been linked, and he’d be a dream fit under Moyes.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Do something…anything\nFulham are the only Premier League club yet to make a signing. They’re just…waiting. Maybe for another chance to bring back Willian on a free.",
      "We’re not fussy at this point. Sign anyone. A third-choice goalkeeper or an £80m striker. Literally any new player will do.",
      "",
      "Leeds United: Sign Lucas Perri\nLeeds’ pursuit of Lyon goalkeeper Lucas Perri is well advanced, and mentioning him by name highlights what’s clearly their biggest priority – signing a new No.1.",
      "Illan Meslier has struggled at this level (along with all the other levels). He was benched during the Championship run-in and outperformed by Karl Darlow, who also isn’t a Premier League starter.",
      "They’ve made some excellent additions since bouncing back to the top flight. Perri would be another smart one. Now just get it done.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Sell Darwin Nunez (and Luis Diaz if they want Alexander Isak)\nLiverpool have had an incredible transfer window. Wirtz for £100m, Frimpong for £30m, Kerkez for £40m, and Ekitike for £69m. That seemingly ruled out Isak, until it didn’t.",
      "With Isak now pushing to leave Newcastle, Liverpool are back in the mix. That could mean Luis Diaz joins Bayern and Darwin Nunez is finally moved on.",
      "Even if Diaz stays, Nunez has to go. Napoli were interested, now it’s just Saudi clubs. Captain Chaos has no place at Anfield anymore, and after such big spending, Liverpool need to sell.",
      "MORE: Transfer rumour ranking: Isak’s Liverpool desire screws Newcastle team-mate",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Sign a right-back\nMatheus Nunes is not the long-term answer at right-back. City started the window fast ahead of the Club World Cup, but have gone quiet since.",
      "Kyle Walker has joined Burnley; Rico Lewis didn’t quite convince last season. Nunes was a makeshift solution and has improved, but he can’t be Pep Guardiola’s long-term answer.",
      "With attacking left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri already signed, a more defensive-minded right-back should be next.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Sign a No.9\nIsak to United? Dream on. Jamie Vardy on a free is the more realistic scenario.",
      "They moved quickly for Matheus Cunha, but their pursuit of Mbeumo was classic United – first bid in June, deal confirmed in late July. Now it’s time for a messy striker chase.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres doesn’t want a Ruben Amorim reunion. Ollie Watkins isn’t for sale. Benjamin Sesko feels like a pipe dream. Jean-Philippe Mateta or Danny Welbeck? They could do a lot worse. We rank the best available strikers here.",
      "They also need to offload Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia after sending Marcus Rashford to Barcelona..",
      "",
      "Newcastle United: Sort their striker mess\nWell, that escalated quickly. Alexander Isak’s transfer request has turned Newcastle’s summer upside down.",
      "Liverpool look most likely to land him. Keeping Isak remains the ideal outcome, but his stance could cause a ripple effect. It might even unsettle Bruno Guimaraes and Anthony Gordon.",
      "If he leaves, Newcastle must sign a genuine star to replace him. Benjamin Sesko would be as close to like-for-like as they’ll get.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Improve in attack\nLosing Anthony Elanga wasn’t in the plan for Europe-bound Forest, but here we are. Replacing him is now the priority heading into the final weeks of the window.",
      "They had a bid accepted for Malick Fofana, but he wants Champions League football and is leaning toward other clubs. He’d be perfect, but it’s unlikely.",
      "Forest’s starting attack – Hudson-Odoi, Chris Wood, Igor Jesus – cost £28m total. Only Burnley spent less on a front three. They need more quality, and fast.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Granit Xhaka\nXhaka split opinion at Arsenal, but no one saw Sunderland linked and thought ‘that’s a terrible idea’.",
      "He’s exactly what this newly promoted side needs — a midfield general to anchor an ambitious summer of business. They’ve already made some impressive signings, but this would take it up a level.",
      "Burnley and Ipswich impressed in recent years but didn’t land a player like Xhaka. Sunderland should go all in.",
      "READ: Xhaka next? The most stunning transfer coups made by newly-promoted Premier League clubs",
      "",
      "Tottenham Hotspur: Recruit more midfield quality\nMorgan Gibbs-White looked set for Spurs and despite the Fabrizio ‘Here we go’, it collapsed. That’s a shame given the lack of creativity beyond an injury-prone James Maddison.",
      "Spurs haven’t shown any interest in Xavi Simons, and Eberechi Eze seems Arsenal-bound. Still, there are options, and being a Champions League club helps.",
      "With players returning to fitness and Thomas Frank at the helm, there’s reason for optimism, but another midfield creator is a must.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Sort the stiffness\nIt’s tough to explain, but this West Ham squad just feels…stiff. Without Mohammed Kudus, there’s a worrying lack of athleticism. Lucas Paqueta’s form has dipped since the betting scandal. Beyond Crysencio Summerville and Jarrod Bowen, there’s not much flair.",
      "They need a striker – ideally one quicker than Niklas Fullkrug, which might be all of the strikers. But more broadly, they need pace, technical ability, and players who get fans off their seats.",
      "",
      "Wolves: Sign a new goalkeeper\nNo matter the one-per-club theme, Wolves are always tricky.",
      "Matheus Cunha is gone. Jhon Arias is in and has taken the No.10 shirt. He won’t match Cunha’s level, but he’ll help. Fer Lopez adds depth. Jorgen Strand Larsen should lead the line well.",
      "But the big concern is in goal. Jose Sa looks past it. Sam Johnstone isn’t as good as they hoped. Simple, really: Wolves need a new No.1.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United star Alexander Isak has ‘set a condition’ for him to ‘accept an offer’ amid interest from Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United have chosen not to sign Alexander Isak and that is their call, but one player has dropped a ‘bombshell’ with their decision to ‘QUIT’.",
      "According to reports, PIF have ‘intervened’ to impact Liverpool’s hopes of signing Alexander Isak from Premier League rivals Newcastle United.",
      "Alexander Isak was ‘furious’ with Paul Mitchell and Newcastle last summer and wanted the ‘Saudi owners show more ambition, not just talk about it in Amazon documentaries’.",
      "Newcastle ‘want to go big’ to sign the ‘ideal’ replacement for Alexander Isak, but are the Magpies a “special” enough club to be eligible for the ‘gentleman’s agreement’?",
      "Newcastle legend Alan Shearer has slammed the Magpies for a “ridiculous” lie which kicked off the Alexander Isak saga, as the striker wants to leave the club."

Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",

      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £136.7m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "9) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nNot even a mess of medicals could prevent Manchester United from eventually pushing through the British record capture of Van Nistelrooy, the player Sir Alex Ferguson believed would help translate domestic dominance into consistency on the European front.",
      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",

      "Whoever was tormented by a prodigious Ljungberg, it was to Arsenal’s ultimate benefit. The forward became an Invincible, the club’s second-highest Champions League appearance maker, a winner of five trophies and a wearer of lovely pants.",
      "",
      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",

      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",

      "4) David de Gea\nIt might not be entirely accurate but it does feel as though De Gea single-handedly prevented Manchester United from enduring as catastrophic a season as their most recent on multiple occasions over a 12-year tenure.",
      "He was the original Bruno Fernandes, a tangibly better player than most if not all his teammates yet bizarrely keen to sacrifice the best years of his career to a failing institution. Once that fax machine faltered in 2015 it seemed as though De Gea just accepted his fate as a Manchester United lifer.",
      "The club never was going to show that same loyalty as soon as the Spaniard became dispensable and their handling of his exit was amateurish. But there was a time – after a rough initiation period – when Manchester United almost accidentally possessed the finest keeper in the world.",
      "",
      "3) Rodri\nWith all things being even, it remains the case that a fit, available and peak Rodri guarantees a title win for Manchester City.",
      "The hope is that theory can be properly tested next season, but four Premier League trophies in a row have been sandwiched by a chastening first year spent learning how to foul, and a campaign entirely ruined by a knee injury.",

      "If Blackburn had filed their paperwork properly and Dalglish not taken a sunny July weekend off in 1993, the first Premier League crown under Ferguson might have been marked by no Manchester United incomings whatsoever. But it opened the door to a record-breaking hijack which shaped the club’s future and heralded a glittering and often contemptuous spell.",

The latter are still in for Alexander Isak, while the former are surely full of regret after discovering the Newcastle United striker’s shock transfer stance. He rams through the opposition to take top spot in our ranking of the best centre-forwards available this summer.",
      "We also have the best available attacking midfielders, centre-backs, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African striker’s move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers can’t be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football could do a lot worse, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",
      "",
      "9) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Naturally, Manchester United are a solid option for Kolo Muani, while Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldn’t be ruled out either, having sent Marcus Rashford back to Old Trafford and returned Marco Asensio to PSG.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping £80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but he’s only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. He’s been a colossal flop but there’s still hope for Kolo Muani.",
      "MORE: Ten players in the Club World Cup shop window for Premier League scouts",
      "",
      "8) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, while the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford don’t want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning £65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting £27m for David Raya and £40m for Ivan Toney. Somehow though, Craig Hope reckons the Bees will accept ‘a fee in the region of £30m’.",
      "If that’s true, we should see Wissa holding up a Newcastle United top in no time.",
      "",
      "7) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nOn a list containing two Leipzig players, here is a former Leipzig player. During his time in Germany, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino’s team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. There is talk of Newcastle targeting him after missing out on Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If he’s available for under £40m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors.",
      "",
      "6) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nThe Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him. But who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli were very interested but showed no intention of paying £60m and signed Lorenzo Lucca instead, so the Reds are now anxiously hoping a Saudi Arabian club offers big bucks for Darwin to help fund the signing of Alexander Isak.",
      "Darwin is only 26, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leave a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",

      "5) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him – it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "4) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface could be part of a summer exodus at Bayer Leverkusen, but head coach Erik ten Hag has said there have already been too many sales since his arrival. That spells bad news for Sunderland target Granit Xhaka.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "3) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentford’s Wissa. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Probably from Manchester United.",
      "",
      "2) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nPredicting Benjamin Sesko’s future is essentially pointless at this stage.",
      "There is a lot of hype surrounding the young Slovenian and a move to Arsenal looked likely before they prioritised Viktor Gyokeres. Now, it’s anyone’s guess where he’ll be playing next season. Manchester United have been linked but need sales before even considering bidding for him, while Saudi Arabian champions Al Hilal have tried and failed already this summer.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite forward, but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could become the best striker in the world.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nWell, well, well. Isak has reportedly told Newcastle he wishes to explore his options this summer, just days after Arsenal received a Viktor Gyokeres ‘Here we go’, and Liverpool confirmed the signing of Hugo Ekitike. It’s very telling that the Reds have been briefing that Ekitike can play wide, with Fabrizio Romano reporting they’re still interested in Isak.",
      "That’s despite having already spent over £100m on Florian Wirtz, £70m combined on full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and now an initial £69m on Ekitike. My oh my, they mean serious business.",
      "Isak is one of the best strikers in world football, and his transfer stance has shocked many and rightly upset Newcastle fans, who are now dreading the loss of their talisman. The Swedish international has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances for the Magpies and is valued at around £130m.",
      "",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United star Alexander Isak has ‘set a condition’ for him to ‘accept an offer’ amid interest from Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United have chosen not to sign Alexander Isak and that is their call, but one player has dropped a ‘bombshell’ with their decision to ‘QUIT’.",
      "According to reports, PIF have ‘intervened’ to impact Liverpool’s hopes of signing Alexander Isak from Premier League rivals Newcastle United.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has told Manchester United to “break the bank” to sign a “Ruben Amorim-type player” in the Premier League over an “inexperienced” striker.",
      "Alexander Isak was ‘furious’ with Paul Mitchell and Newcastle last summer and wanted the ‘Saudi owners show more ambition, not just talk about it in Amazon documentaries’.",
      "From the Alexander Isak saga to Man Utd’s striker search, here’s what every Premier League club needs to do before the summer transfer window closes."

      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "Bild journalist Christian Falk revealed on Wednesday that Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting, could be ‘key’ to Sesko’s transfer having previously worked at RB Leipzig, and was seen watching the striker in action for Leipzig in April.",
      "It was claimed earlier in the window that the Bundesliga club were looking for a fee of at least £70m for their prized asset amid strong interest from Arsenal, but Bild now believe Leipzig will settle for a more ‘realistic price’ of £59m for Sesko.",

      "“So at the right price that’s a deal Manchester United would like to do, but Arsenal struggled to drive his release clause down, which is over €80million (£69m) and that’s why if Sesko to Manchester United is to develop there may be some patience required.",

      "Man Utd are still struggling to offload Antony this summer with Real Betis struggling to meet the Red Devils’ demands for a deal, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils are gradually bringing in the players they want this summer with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon signed so far.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly looking to sign a striker, a defensive midfielder and a goalkeeper before the transfer window shuts with INEOS backing Ruben Amorim despite their terrible performance last season.",
      "But the Red Devils could now have to concentrate on outgoings if they are to bring in more players with Marcus Rashford the first of their ‘bomb squad’ out the door after the England international joined Barcelona on Wednesday.",
      "Man Utd are still looking to sell Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia this summer as they make room for new arrivals.",
      "Antony spent part of last season on loan at Real Betis after it became clear he wasn’t part of Amorim’s plans and the Spanish side are keen to have him back.",
      "However, Real Betis president Angel Hato has explained that a loan is “more feasible” for them as Man Utd are asking for a lot of money for a permanent transfer.",
      "Hato said: “From an economic standpoint, it has to fit within our parameters. A purchase depends on United’s price. A loan rather than a purchase is more feasible, given what United want to ask for.",
      "“We’re assuming, and Betis are making efforts, that he can arrive, but if he doesn’t, I don’t want it to be seen as a failure. It’s difficult to bring in a player of this quality and such a high financial compensation.”",
      "Real Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo added: “Our responsibility is to be prepared, and we have alternatives in case Antony doesn’t arrive. We’re calm.”",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Tottenham make ‘shock’ approach for Man Utd star as they ‘actually stand a chance’ of doing a deal\n👉 Rodrygo set to top terrible list of Real Madrid stars moving to the Premier League\n👉 Man Utd ‘open talks’ with Ligue 1 teen as Zirkzee taps up £34.6m star in Nottingham Forest hijack",
      "‘Atletico Madrid are keeping an eye on his situation, but the winger is not a priority for them at this time. ‘",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen reckons Antony should push to join Betis on a permanent deal this summer.",
      "Meulensteen said in April: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are set to be ‘exploited’ as they face ‘paying millions’ to ‘offload’ three players this summer.",
      "A Man Utd star has ‘gained strength in recent hours’ in the Barcelona offices and no, it’s not poor old Marcus Rashford.",
      "According to reports, one key issue is preventing Manchester United from completing a double deal worth around £65m in a triple blow for the Red Devils.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has provided more details on Alejandro Garnacho’s future after he ‘informed’ Manchester United of his ‘wish to leave’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",

      "Ruben Amorim is pretty high in the betting, with only four Premier League managers deemed less safe.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is still a tiny part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it next season. It is based on essentially nothing, but it sits there nagging at us and just won’t go away.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",
      "19) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "16) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "14=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "A big overseas move can’t be entirely ruled out, but we’re still very much in rank outsider territory here.",
      "",
      "12=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s little chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five. And for some reason the bookies agree that he is nowhere near safe.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "9) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "7=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "7=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "5=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which is possible after the exits of Anthony Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "2=) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford if they sell Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "1) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success.",
      "The idea that Mikel Arteta must either win the Premier League title this season or be sacked by Arsenal next summer is flawed for a number of reasons.",
      "Mikel Arteta’s ‘cheating’ is tipped to push Arsenal down to fourth as the Gunners are defended over Thomas Partey and Liverpool fears are allayed.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal are in ‘do or die’ seasons for very different reasons as Mikel Arteta faces becoming ‘the new Brendan Rodgers’…",
      "Mikel Arteta is pushing Arsenal to complete a deal for Viktor Gyokeres today after the Sporting star entered a seventh day of ‘unexcused absence’.",
      "Mikel Arteta loves an excuse and can blame his sacking at the end of another trophyless season on Andrea Berta, Liverpool and fans of The Arsenal."

      "An independent commission hearing to examine 115 charges laid by the Premier League against Man City started in September and ended in December.",
      "The Premier League opened an investigation into Man City way back in 2018 and after a number of legal delays, charges were finally laid in February 2023 and the club were referred to an independent commission.",
      "The charges against the Citizens relate to the requirement to accurately report financial information, including around the value of sponsorship deals, the submission of details of manager and player pay information and to a club’s responsibility as a Premier League member to adhere to UEFA’s financial regulations and to the league’s own profitability and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "They are also accused of failing to co-operate with the league’s investigation. In all, there are charges relating to every season between 2009-10 and 2022-23.",
      "Man City issued a statement strenuously denying the allegations on the day the charges were brought, saying they they welcomed the opportunity for an independent commission “to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of our position.”",

      "The club added: “As such, we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.”",
      "During the period that the charges relate to, Mourinho’s Man Utd side finished second to Man City in the 2017/18 campaign before the Portuguese coach lost his job the following season.",
      "Speaking about his time at Man Utd, the current Fenerbahce boss told Portuguese outlet Canal 11: “There’s a critical moment at that club, not only with Sir Alex’s departure, but also with David Gill’s. David Moyes came in, but when my Netflix documentary comes out, the story will be told.",
      "“I’ll arrive later, and when I arrive, I’ll arrive at a club still going through that period. We won several things, we finished second in the league. I still say I don’t understand clubs that are punished with financial fair play and pay [in cash].",

      "Manchester United have been set a more ‘realistic price’ by RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko that Arsenal would have paid for their top target. Yikes.",
      "United have turned their attention to a new No.9 having finally completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, with the Cameroon international joining Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as the Red Devils’ new recruits this summer.",
      "A report last week claimed Sesko ‘wants Man Utd move’ despite the Red Devils being unable to offer European football to the Slovenia international.",
      "United are ‘understood to be admirers of Sesko’s all-round game and believe his style would suit the Premier League’ and the RB Leipzig star ‘would favour a move to Old Trafford over other destinations’.",
      "The Slovenian is ‘not the only name under consideration’ with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson also potential options.",
      "The report added that as Sesko is ‘open to the move and willing to forgo European football in the short term, United are weighing up whether to make a concrete push’.",
      "The Athletic‘s Ornstein then confirmed United have held ‘talks’ over a move for Sesko, along with Watkins and Jackson.",
      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "Bild journalist Christian Falk revealed on Wednesday that Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting, could be ‘key’ to Sesko’s transfer having previously worked at RB Leipzig, and was seen watching the striker in action for Leipzig in April.",
      "It was claimed earlier in the window that the Bundesliga club were looking for a fee of at least £70m for their prized asset amid strong interest from Arsenal, but Bild now believe Leipzig will settle for a more ‘realistic price’ of £59m for Sesko.",
      "That’s less than the Gunners could end up paying for Viktor Gyokeres, who was below Sesko in Mikel Arteta’s new No.9 pecking order but became the top target after Leipzig made it clear to Arsenal that they wouldn’t budge in their valuation of Sesko.",
      "They have now budged and we imagine Arsenal won’t be best pleased if United manage to secure his signing for the £59m that they were perfectly willing to pay for the Slovenian.",

      "Falk claims Leipzig – who won’t be playing Champions League football next season – have a ‘target’ figure in mind for player sales, with Xavi Simons set to make up around half of that figure as he nears a move to Chelsea, with Sesko the only other player in the squad they could sell to make up the rest.",
      "“It’s worth noting that Leipzig have to sell players this summer,” Falk told the Daily Briefing. “They have a target to bring in €100m (£86.6m, $117m), and they have just two players in this range who can make the club money.",
      "“Xavi Simons, of course, is one such footballer, with the other being Benjamin Sesko. So, it could be that the club has to sell both players in this summer’s transfer window. That’s why Manchester United will definitely be an option.”",
      "On comparisons to Erling Haaland, Falk continued: “Sesko is a fan of the Premier League and is prepared to make this next step.",
      "“He has a lot of self-confidence – he’s on record as telling reporters that he believes he’s similar in profile to Erling Haaland: ‘My teammates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I’m better than him.’",
      "“So, you see, he’s not afraid of big names or big clubs! I think this transfer can gather real pace now that Arsenal are no longer at the table.”",
      "Newcastle ‘want to go big’ to sign the ‘ideal’ replacement for Alexander Isak, but are the Magpies a “special” enough club to be eligible for the ‘gentleman’s agreement’?",
      "Newcastle are said to be targeting a Champions League striker after reports that they want his team-mate, as there are ‘fears’ in terms of their forward situation.",
      "Transfer insider Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Newcastle are ‘attentive’ to the situation of a European star striker amid ‘multiple deals’ after Alexander Isak made his desire to leave clear.",
      "Man Utd are “not actively pursuing” Sesko as he didn’t “tear it up” for RB Leipzig last season and have been told a second striker target is ‘not for sale’.",
      "Arsenal are signing Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool have signed Hugo Ekitike, but Alexander Isak has become the best striker available this summer.",

Six of those came in the last four Premier League matches of the season and went a very long way to keeping Forest in the top flight. In those final four fixtures, without former Union Berlin striker Awoniyi’s goals, the Reds would have got one point. They hugely benefited from his goals and picked up eight from a possible 12.",

      "He is loving life under Oliver Glasner, finishing the 23/24 season with 16 league goals after scoring two in his first 19 appearances in 22/23 and eight in 77 in total. He then bagged 14 in 24/25 and helped Palace win the FA Cup.",

      "Thursday 24 July 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as \"a club where dreams come true\".",
      "Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford said at his unveiling. \"It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here.",
      "\"It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.\"",
      "A Barcelona statement said: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until 30 June 2026. The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.",
      "\"The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta; the director of the Football Area, and other Board members.\"",
      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",
      "The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.",
      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",
      "It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.",
      "The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.",
      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.",
      "\"This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",
      "Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.",
      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",
      "\"I've nothing bad to say,\" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.",
      "The only slight hiccup Rashford made all day was timekeeping. He arrived 15 minutes late for the contract signing ceremony, but no one seemed to mind.",
      "The first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker posed near an old English telephone box as part of his official club video.",
      "Apt.",
      "Because at his media unveiling, Marcus Rashford rang the right tone and kept everyone engaged. He may well have found his calling.",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",

He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",

      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 14:33, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Already linked with Manchester United and West Ham, Parma's Zion Suzuki is one of the great young goalkeeping talents. Adam Bate speaks to those who have worked with the Japan international to find out why clubs are so excited about his potential...",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:19, UK",
      "It seems inevitable that Zion Suzuki will move to the Premier League one day. Already courted by Manchester United and West Ham, it is just a matter of when. The hype is justified. This 22-year-old Japan international is seen as a new breed of goalkeeper.",
      "It is by design. Japan have been throwing resources at football with a specific target in mind. Project 2050. The aim is to win a World Cup by then. Frans Hoek, the legendary goalkeeping coach, has been tasked with identifying the traits of the goalkeeper of the future.",
      "In Suzuki, back when he was sat among the substitutes for Urawa Red Diamonds, Hoek spotted all the ingredients required to do it all. \"I saw him in a camp and said, 'This guy has to go to Europe as soon as possible. It does not matter what league it is. He has to play.'\"",
      "And so, Suzuki embarked on the adventure that has taken him to Belgium with Sint-Truiden, onto Italy with Parma and now linked with some of the richest clubs in Europe. Still only 22, the only question is when to make the leap. Those who know him do not doubt his talent.",
      "\"He is a really quiet guy, a really calm character. That is him off the pitch.\" On the pitch, Suzuki becomes something else entirely. He dominates. \"He is really aggressive because he has massive physical strength.\" He is 6'3\" but looks bigger. \"He is so powerful, so dynamic.\"",
      "That physicality clearly underpins his potential. \"It is like his body is just made of muscles. And I have never seen in my life a goalkeeper who can jump higher. His physical tests were off the charts.\" But it is what this physicality enables him to do that is particularly intriguing.",
      "Rudel enjoys telling the story of one of his first sessions with Suzuki. As the goalkeeper coach, he was setting up a drill. \"I said to him, 'Okay, now show me how far you can throw.' I looked away and then saw this ball flying 20 metres over the halfway line,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I turned around and said to him, 'I told you to throw it not kick it.' He just smiled back at me and replied, 'But I did throw it.' I told him to show me again because I could not believe that someone had that much power in their body that they could throw the ball that far.\"",
      "Rudel rates Suzuki as \"above average\" with his feet but as has been seen with Ederson at Manchester City, the tactical significance of being able to pass short and long has increased. Suzuki ranked third for long passes in Serie A last season and second for throws.",
      "In Belgium, Rudel remembers some stunning saves away to Club Brugge, with one stop in particular becoming his trademark. \"It is those low saves because he is so dynamic and so quick to get down. He has unbelievable reflexes. For me, that is his biggest strength.\"",
      "There have been many examples of that for Parma. One down to his left to keep out Tijjani Reijnders' shot for AC Milan in the San Siro stands out, while the save away to Empoli against Ismael Konate was similar. Denying Como's Marc Kempf a headed goal was even better.",
      "The pick of the lot came against Roma in February when he produced an outrageous double save that defied belief. After keeping out Matias Soule's shot, he somehow scrambled to claw away Anass Salah-Eddine's follow-up. It was the save of the season.",
      "\"With those low power saves, his arms are so strong,\" says Rudel in reference to the technique behind it. \"Sometimes when goalkeepers go down fast and get their fingers to the ball, it still goes backwards. That never happens to him. He has crazy power in his hands.\"",
      "What makes Suzuki so fascinating is that he combines these reflex stops with a commanding presence. Think of the great goalkeepers and they tend to favour one or the other. But Suzuki does more than get down low to make saves, he gets high to snuff out the danger.",
      "He caught 55 crosses for Parma last season, 21 more than his nearest rival in Serie A. Across Europe's five major leagues, only Joan Garcia, snapped up by Barcelona this summer, claimed more crosses. Outside the area, Suzuki ranked second in Serie A for sweeping up.",
      "There are still things to work on, as one might expect of a goalkeeper who is still only 22 years old. He also dropped nine catches - a Serie A high - reflecting the fact that this desire to be proactive comes with risk. But he continues to progress, a theme of his short career.",
      "\"That is another of his strengths and why I am convinced that he can perform in the Premier League,\" says Rudel. \"He went from Japan to Belgium and then Belgium to Italy. Those are big adaptations but he did it really quickly. That is what separates the really good ones.\"",
      "Asked if Suzuki will go to the very top, Rudel has no doubts. \"One hundred per cent.\" The only question is how best to manage the journey. Some advise him to wait and play one more season with Parma. But sooner or later, Zion Suzuki will make a very big move.",
