      "Adam Wharton has a plan to play in the Champions League as Manchester United plot a big-money swoop for the midfielder. The Crystal Palace and England star is right at the top of the Red Devils’ short-list ahead of an overhaul of the United squad.",
      "Any deal does not look like it will be cheap, however. Wharton, 21, is anticipated to cost around £70m should he leave Crystal Palace in the near future.",
      "Speaking about the midfielder’s future, his agent James Featherstone has confirmed that Wharton has ambitions of playing at the highest level and there is already a plan in place to get him there.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT, he said: “When he was at Blackburn we sat down and spoke about shooting for the stars and playing for England.",
      "“So how do you get there? Personally I think to play for England you have to play Champions League, to play in the Champions League you have got to play for one of the top teams in one of the top leagues.",
      "“That jump to a Champions League team, I think you can get lost. The plan below that was to play for a Premier League team",
      "“We have got a plan. He is 21. I have to check myself to remember that every now and then. It doesn’t have to be achieved yesterday, today or this moment.",
      "“He has got his in-game, in-season targets and goals. He has got to do his bit and the rest will look after itself in a very structured, calm way to ultimately add value and maximise his ability.”",
      "Wharton has shone for Palace since his arrival from Blackburn Rovers last year. He has since made 62 appearances in all competitions for the Eagles, helping the side win the FA Cup and to a place in Europe.",
      "Wharton has also earned international recognition, having compiled three caps for the Three Lions under Thomas Tuchel. The midfielder still has three-and-a-half years to run left on his contract at Selhurst Park.",
      "He is not the only midfielder that United have identified as a potential signing. Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, as well Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher are also options for the Red Devils.",
      "Should any of the trio arrive at Old Trafford in the near future, that could potentially open the door to Kobbie Mainoo departing. The academy graduate is reportedly eyeing a January exit after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",

      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has called on his teammates to channel their \"anger and drive\" to fuel their performances.",
      "Following a disappointing draw against West Ham, Dalot expressed his frustration and urged his fellow players to become \"more obsessed\" with winning.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the mixed zone, Dalot didn't hide his disappointment. \"We are very disappointed. We cannot concede a goal, we have to control more the game. We should have done the same as we did for 60 minutes, and try to score the second. We had the game there,\" he said.",
      "\"And when we lose the ball, be in a good position so we don't suffer counter-attacks. Because we knew that today was going to be, for West Ham, the only way of creating danger was going to be second balls, transitions or set plays.\"",
      "Dalot was asked about the inconsistency and responded: \"First of all, I don't think they [West Ham] are at that [poor] level. Obviously, they have a lower block and you saw how hard it is to get in during 60 minutes.",
      "\"But as soon as we found a way to score a goal, we need to keep doing the same things because that's what put us in the position to control the game. I think we are dominant even though we conceded one or two transitions that we could have avoided.",
      "\"But in the end, they score a goal, it's not so hard to create chances and put the ball in the net. But then, with 30 minutes to go, we need to fight for the result.\"",
      "Dalot continued: \"It's always like this [needing to put together a run of decent results]. Even after winning three or four games in a row, people will expect you to win five or six or seven.",
      "\"So, we just have to focus on one game, one win at the time. Today, we had a good chance to get closer to the top positions and I think that's what hurts even more.\"",
      "Reflecting on the squandered opportunity to climb to fifth, Dalot continued: \"That's something that has to call us and has to be something that we need to look at. Because, in these moments, if we deliver, we'll probably be in another position and we'll be talking about other things.",
      "\"But that's part of the game also. But, at the same time, we have opportunities to improve. And, like I said, it's just a disappointing feeling because we had a game there.\"",
      "Dalot seemed to question his teammates when he hinted that subpar performances were down to \"sometimes not football qualities\", saying: \"I think we've shown this season that we can be a very good team and we can beat anybody. Then, it's something that we need to get into ourselves.",
      "\"Sometimes, it's not football qualities. It has to be from inside. It has to be from the anger and the drive that you have every day to win football games and to live your life like that.",
      "\"I think we need to become a bit more obsessed about playing for this club, winning games and winning trophies for this club. But it's a process. I'm not going to get into the 'we need time' thing.",
      "\"I think we have to win straight away because that's what the club demands. That's why it hurts sometimes even more when we have opportunities like this and we don't win.\"",
      "Dalot was dropped from the starting XI in favour of Patrick Dorgu ahead of the November international break, and found himself on the substitute bench when Everton visited Old Trafford. When Amorim was questioned about his left wing-back choices, he implied that neither player was replicating their training ground form on match days.",
      "Nevertheless, Dalot made his mark upon returning to the side against Crystal Palace, earning the set-piece that resulted in Mason Mount's decisive strike, before following that up with a goal of his own against West Ham. When quizzed about Amorim's remarks, Dalot responded: \"I think it's something in general. He could be talking about me, but I think he could be talking about everyone at the club. We always have to find ways to improve ourselves, be more consistent. We are in a team where you're as good as your last game.",
      "\"So, you just have to know that this is a type of pressure for a big club like Man United. Fortunately, I'm here long enough to understand how it works and find a way to help the team. I think that's the aim for everybody.\"",

      "There was a time when Rashford seemed destined for icon status at Old Trafford after he first emerged as a first-team star in early 2016. A lot has transpired over the past decade, and his bond appeared shattered when he first left on loan for Aston Villa almost one year ago.",
      "The relationship was only further complicated when his loan to Barca, complete with a very affordable purchase option, was confirmed in the summer. But United have shown their character by filing Rashford under the 'Legends' section on their official website.",
      "The 28-year-old joins exclusive company, with the likes of Sir Bobby Charlton, Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Wayne Rooney and Denis Irwin also in that section. The decision reflects United's perception of the player despite all that has transpired in recent years.",
      "It's understood Rashford's relationship with manager Ruben Amorim soured at one point as his career took a negative turn. But while he may not be shining for the Red Devils at present, it clearly doesn't diminish all he has achieved in red.",
      "Prior to leaving the club on temporary terms, Rashford helped the club secure two FA Cups, a Europa League title and two League Cups. So, while others in the Legends section may have succeeded in more prosperous times, Rashford is still recognised for helping ensure the club remained relevant in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.",
      "It's not quite the Camp Nou, but United prospect Toby Collyer was beginning to show some promise at the Hawthorns this season. The 21-year-old joined West Brom in the summer, with a view to gaining valuable minutes before he returned to Old Trafford next year.",
      "However, Collyer has returned to Manchester sooner than expected after suffering an injury Baggies boss Ryan Mason called \"quite serious.\" And it puts his future prospects with the Championship side in doubt.",
      "\"It's quite a big injury,\" Mason told BBC Radio WM. \"He's at United at the minute where they're assessing him and then in the coming weeks we'll decide his plan regarding his rehab.",
      "\"We've got him on loan for the season and normally any loan player that gets an injury that's a bit more than a small one, more a significant one, it's only right for the parent club to look at them, check them over, and we're in dialogue and hopefully he can do his rehab and come back better.\"",
      "Collyer has made 13 first-team appearances for United to date and was being tipped as one with potential to earn a place in Amorim's plans. He has racked up 12 outings for West Brom to date and enjoyed a brief spell in the starting line-up earlier this season prior to a separate setback.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sergio Reguilon's football exile is nearing its end, it has been claimed. The former Manchester United and Tottenham left-back has been without a club since leaving North London in June and has needed to be patient.",
      "Now, though, he's set to get his reward. Reports in the autumn suggested Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were keen on bringing the Spanish international to Major League Soccer, and an announcement is said to be close.",
      "According to Marca (via Sport Witness), Reguilon is Inter's 'Plan A' as they look to replace Jordi Alba. Champions League winner Alba is set to retire after this weekend's MLS Cup final against Vancouver Whitecaps, as is team-mate Sergio Busquets, and the Spanish outlet reports that Reguilon's arrival as a replacement for Alba is a 'done deal'.",
      "The same publication indicates Reguilon has been 'training extensively' on his own while unattached. The 28-year-old hasn't played a minute of senior football since May, when he earned a rare start for Spurs against Aston Villa - one of just six appearances he made last term.",
      "An announcement might not be immediate, but could come in the next few days. First, the club plan to give Alba a proper farewell as he bows out.",
      "“I can’t tell you how the experience will be because I’ll live it in the moment,” said Alba. The 36-year-old, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, has 11 goals and 29 assists in his 65 MLS games - as well as one goal and six assists in playoff appearances - after linking up with former Barca colleagues Messi, Sergio Busquets and Luis Suarez.",
      "“My last game with Barcelona was very emotional, exciting, because I knew it was the last time I’d wear that shirt that gave me so much. But this is everything. It’s not about going from one team to another. It’s leaving soccer. Obviously, it’s a bigger step.”",
      "Reguilon began his career with Barcelona's great rivals Real Madrid before winning the Europa League during a loan spell with Sevilla. That earned him a move to Jose Mourinho's Spurs in 2020, but he managed just 73 appearances for the club.",
      "He had three loan spells during his time in North London, picking up minutes for Atletico Madrid, Manchester United and Brentford. The United stint was particularly brief, with Reguilon playing just 655 minutes under Erik ten Hag before United triggered an option to cut the loan short.",
      "\"It has been great to play for Manchester United and I just want to say thank you to the club, the fans and my teammates,\" he said after the spell came to an end. \"It was a privilege to play for this huge club. I wish all the best for the Red Devils.\"",

      "Manchester United have honoured out-on-loan star Marcus Rashford by including him in the legends section of their official website - as he continues to shine on loan at FC Barcelona. Rashford joined United's academy at just seven-years-old.",
      "The forward made his senior debut in 2016 during a Europa League match against Midtjylland, scoring twice and becoming the club's youngest-ever goal-scorer in European competition at that time. Over the following decade, Rashford became a beloved figure at Old Trafford and one of the Premier League's top forwards.",
      "His 2022/23 season was particularly impressive, with a tally of 30 goals and nine assists across all competitions. However, since Ruben Amorim took over as United's head coach last November, Rashford's status with the club deteriorated, which led to an exit during the summer transfer window.",
      "Despite Amorim not seeing Rashford as part of his long-term plans, the club have now decided to recognise his contributions. United have added Rashford to the legends section of their website - placing him alongside some huge names and the most revered players in the club's history.",
      "Rashford now shares the status with such icons as Sir Bobby Charlton, Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Wayne Rooney, Denis Irwin and many other Old Trafford luminaries.",
      "He's one of only four players on the list who are still playing - along with Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and David De Gea. Of those, only Fernandes is, of course, currently playing for the club.",
      "While Rashford remains on United's books, his longer-term future hinges on Barcelona's decision over whether to make his loan move permanent.",
      "The Catalan giants have an option to buy the England international for approximately £26million but, despite his impressive displays, there are concerns within the club about whether a permanent transfer makes financial sense.",
      "Barcelona are currently paying his full salary after Rashford accepted a 25 per cent wage reduction - although he still pockets around £240,000 per-week - placing him among the club's highest earners.",
      "Manager Hansi Flick has been full of praise for the United loanee. Earlier this season, he revealed: \"I told Deco this summer; 'Please get me a player like Marcus Rashford'... Please!",
      "\"I'm very happy to have him here. Rashford was an opportunity in the transfer market and we had to take it.",
      "\"I'm glad we did. I spoke to him and said; 'I need you in my team'.",

      "Gabriel Jesus and Max Dowman were left out of the Arsenal squad as they played in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Manchester United at St. George's Park. The Gunners were expected to bring at least one of the two players to Villa Park for the clash against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Both players were absent from the clash at Villa Park as Leandro Trossard cancelled out Matty Cash's first-half opener. Jesus has recently returned to first-team training following an extended spell on the sidelines. The 28-year-old striker suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury during Arsenal's defeat to Manchester United in the FA Cup third round at the start of the year.",
      "He had been in a rich vein of form, scoring three goals in his previous four Premier League games. Jesus has since returned to action at the Sobha Realty Training Centre, earning himself a place in the matchday squad against Chelsea and Brentford but was afforded the opportunity for minutes under his belt against the Red Devils.",
      "At the end of November, Arteta provided an update on the Brazil international's situation. Speaking to reporters ahead of the 3-1 win over Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League, the Arsenal boss said: \"Very good.",
      "\"He's doing everything with the team at the moment for the last almost two weeks. We're going to give him some exposure as well internally with some games, so he gets that fitness. But he looks really good in training, and he's going to be a big addition to the team.\"",
      "A few days later, Arteta confirmed that he and Ethan Nwaneri had participated in a behind-closed-doors friendly. The Spanish manager revealed: \"It did happen. Gabi participated, and Ethan as well, because he wanted some minutes.\"",
      "He added: \"We took the opportunity; they wanted a bit of exposure to competition, and providing that was very positive.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dowman has been somewhat of a rare sight for Arsenal this season. The 15-year-old midfielder made a few brief appearances at the start of the campaign, becoming the second-youngest player in both the club's and Premier League's history.",
      "After Dowman made his senior debut – at 15 years, 235 days – against Leeds United, a proud Arteta told the BBC: \"Very proud. Big credit to the academy and to everyone who has contributed to that journey.\"",
      "He continued, \"The families, hopefully they lived a beautiful day. The maturity and confidence and the joy he provides to the rest of the team is magnificent.\"",
      "He concluded with: \"Let's do it naturally and organically. We have to look after him and make sure we protect him as well.\"",
      "Shortly after making history, Dowman was given another brief appearance off the bench in the 1-0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield. Since then, he hasn't featured in the English top-flight.",

      "Manchester United honoured Luke Shaw, presenting the defender with a gift to mark his 300th match for the club. The 30-year-old has been a fixture at Old Trafford since 2014, having made a name for himself with a series of standout performances at Southampton.",
      "Shaw has faced numerous hurdles since making the move, particularly with injuries. But he has now fought back from multiple setbacks to reclaim his place in the United squad.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, the England international has taken on a different role than earlier in his career. Instead of playing as a full-back who pushes on, he operates more as a left-sided centre-back.",
      "This change may help Shaw maintain his fitness for longer stretches of the season, with less physical demand placed on him than charging up and down the wings. Having returned to the starting line-up in recent weeks, Shaw made his 300th appearance for the club against Crystal Palace, contributing to a 2-1 victory at Selhurst Park.",
      "It was a milestone moment for Shaw, which the club celebrated by presenting him with a framed collection of photos and a shirt bearing the number 300. The presentation was made by director of football Jason Wilcox, who delivered a heartfelt speech in front of the rest of the staff in the canteen at Carrington.",
      "Whilst it proved to be a heart-warming occasion, Shaw reportedly felt embarrassed about the recognition, according to The Sun, who suggest he was unsure about the club creating such a fuss over the milestone.",
      "It was an achievement that has taken considerable time to reach, with the defender likely to have racked up far more appearances had it not been for his fitness problems.",
      "That was an observation made by United legend Denis Irwin, who praised Shaw on the Inside Carrington podcast. He said: \"He has been blighted with injuries, Luke, but I've got to say every manager, when he is fit, has picked him\".",
      "\"He has started every Premier League game this season so that tells you that Ruben is definitely backing him. He was brilliant [against Palace] and his recovery in a couple of tackles was needed by the way and particularly in the first half.",
      "\"It suits him to play in that left centre-half [role]. We know he can play the wing-back role, but relating it myself, I would have been more comfortable in that left centre-back role rather than being a wing-back. He has been fantastic for us this season.\"",

      "Paul Scholes' swipe at Ruben Amorim over his treatment of Kobbie Mainoo marks his latest tirade at a Manchester United boss. The United icon took umbrage with the manager's comments about Mainoo, who remained on the bench during United's draw with West Ham on Thursday.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder has yet to start a league game this campaign, being restricted to just 171 minutes in the Premier League. Despite this, Amorim had recently branded the England international a crucial player.",
      "\"I see him as a starter like the other players,\" Amorim said last Friday. \"I just have to make a choice and then in the end, it's not been Kobbie. In the future, I don't know. Again, I always think the same thing with Casemiro. [He] was not playing and then he plays. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing.\"",
      "Hitting back at Amorim on Instagram, Scholes wrote: \"Bulls***. The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Scholes has subsequently deleted his post about Mainoo. However, this is not the first time the 51-year-old has lashed out at a United manager, with Amorim's predecessors typically not surviving much longer after Scholes delivered a damning verdict.",
      "The pundit believed Erik ten Hag's tenure at the club was nearly over after United suffered a 4-0 defeat at Crystal Palace in May 2024, although the side triumphed in the FA Cup final weeks later. Ten Hag was given a fresh contract but the Dutch manager only survived until October before Amorim took his place.",
      "\"Tonight almost felt like a final nail in the coffin,\" Scholes said after the Palace loss. \"There was a lack of know-how in the team, a lack of effort, going to a team like Crystal Palace, who are a good team and doing well, but Manchester United shouldn't be going there and doing 4-0.",
      "\"I felt for a while he [Ten Hag] might get another year and work for a club that has calmed down a little by the new owners but it doesn't feel like that now.\"",
      "Scholes had been equally blunt during Ralf Rangnick's stint as interim boss during the 2021/22 season. Rangnick was appointed with plans to subsequently take an advisory role but he opted to leave the club that summer.",
      "The United legend encapsulated his views about Rangnick's period in charge after a draw with Southampton in February 2022: \"One team have got a proper Coach, the other team has a sporting director.\"",
      "Following United's Champions League elimination the following month, Scholes delivered his assessment of Rangnick's role. \"How [Ralf Rangnick] was chosen to be manager of this club for six months, I don't know. Getting a proper coach for this team is a massive thing,\" he told BT Sport.",
      "\"There is some real talent in this squad. The very first thing this club needs to do to get anywhere near winning the league again is getting in a proper coach who works for this team.\"",
      "Despite Scholes' habit of predicting when United managers might be on their way out, there are reasons for Amorim to remain hopeful. In October, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe hinted that Amorim, who marked his first year at Old Trafford last month, would be evaluated after three years in charge.",

The likes of Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane are all broadcasting mainstays, and haven't been afraid to speak their mind when it comes to Ruben Amorim's struggling side.",
      "United have still won more Premier League titles than any other club, with the likes of Neville, Scholes and Keane involved in a number of those 13 title wins. The last of those came more than a decade ago, though, and United have arguably never looked further from returning to the summit.",
      "According to The Mail, this has prompted \"battle lines\" to be drawn between some current and former players. Criticism has arrived during studio broadcasts around United's league and cup games, and it has been reported that some feel the pundits could show more sympathy.",
      "\"The players feel the weight of what these guys say very deeply,\" an agent close to United's first team is quoted as saying by The Mail. \"They see all the clips and it really p****s them off. Their view is that these guys know what it’s like to feel the pressure of being a United player so they want some level of understanding from them but feel they don’t get it.",
      "\"Some players think the Class of '92 actually don’t want them to succeed so their own legacy can be protected. So, yeah, the relationship has been bad. The lads certainly don’t want to be interviewed by them for TV. It’s gone way beyond that\"",
      "Neville and Scholes aren't the only 'Class of 92' heroes - players who served United well after coming through the academy - to pass comment on the current crop. However, they, as well as one-time captain Keane, are the most prominent on TV and other media.",

      "\"He has sounds but it’s only people that are close to him that will know what he’s saying. He has autism, but it’s like a really severe autism – because you can have it and go to school normally and such.\"",
      "United endured their worst ever Premier League campaign last season, with Erik ten Hag sacked after a poor start and successor Ruben Amorim leading the club to their first bottom-half finish in the competition. There have been green shoots of recovery this term, with Amorim's team eighth after 14 games, but there is still work to be done.",
      "Next up is a meeting with winless Wolves on Monday, and Amorim isn't underestimating the opposition. “Everything can happen, and that will change,\" he told reporters.",
      "\"There is no team in the Premier League history that didn't win one game. So, it can be any game. So, we need to try to improve, to rest the players, work really well, and prepare a tough match because, with us, it’s always a tough match.”",

      "\"I think we can look at every industry, every sector, we have that conversation about things and I think it's more about making sure that there's a product that's super elite that matches what's on the pitch and then everyone can feel that it's justified taking time out and working hard to go and get tickets.\"",
      "In response, Carragher replied to the clip with three laughing-face emojis and three money-bag emojis, highlighting perceived hypocrisy given Ferdinand's immense wealth. By the next morning, Ferdinand had hit back, posting a photo of himself holding a newspaper featuring a doctored front page with his face on it and the headline \"Man of the People,\" while playfully tagging Carragher.",
      "Spats between the pair are nothing new. Over the years, the two Premier League icons - both now well-established media figures - have traded both subtle and not-so-subtle digs, whether during live broadcasts or on social media.",
      "Their most recent clash centred on Carragher's controversial comments about the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Back in February, the 47-year-old sparked backlash by suggesting the competition was not a \"major\" tournament.",
      "He argued that Mo Salah's Ballon d'Or prospects would not be significantly boosted by winning the AFCON - unlike a European player winning the Euros - because of the tournament's perceived lower prestige. Ferdinand, though, publicly rejected that view.",
      "\"The majority of people out there would say [what Carragher said] and I don't think that's right,\" he said. \"I think that's an ignorant thought process because the [Africa Cup of Nations]... if you go to Didier Drogba, Abedi Pele, Samuel Eto'o, Riyad Mahrez, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane they will tell you we have to win this.\"",
      "He added: \"I understand what Jamie is saying but I don't agree with it. But I understand that is the majority's fault and it's not right.\"",
      "Carragher hit back on Instagram, calling Ferdinand a \"clown\" and accusing him of misrepresenting his comments. \"I didn't say that, you clown - stop playing to the gallery like you always do,\" he wrote.",
      "A few days later, Ferdinand took another jab at Carragher after tennis legend Boris Becker called the Liverpool legend \"uninformed\" about Bayern Munich manager Vincent Kompany. After Bayern drew Bundesliga rivals Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League round of 16 last season, Carragher claimed that Kompany's future at the Allianz Arena would be in jeopardy if Bayern were knocked out.",
      "\"Bayern have not convinced me at all yet,\" he said. \"Now they are playing against Leverkusen, who dominated Bayern in the Bundesliga recently. It's a 50-50 tie. In the end, I'm predicting Leverkusen (to advance). If Kompany does not win, there will be many question marks about his appointment.\"",
      "Bayern fan Becker snapped back on X, reminding him that Die Roten were in fact very content with Kompany at the helm as he said: \"Jamie is NOT well informed at all\". Adding fuel to the fire, Ferdinand interjected, saying: \"Boris… he's having a bad couple weeks. Let him off.\"",
      "A year earlier, Carragher had branded Ferdinand a \"poor man's Virgil van Dijk\" and suggested he didn't belong in the debate over the Premier League's greatest-ever centre-back. During Liverpool's 4–1 win over Luton, Micah Richards captured Carragher's animated reaction to Van Dijk's equaliser from the CBS Sports studio.",
      "\"Look at the colossus, look at him, look at him! A marvel of modern science,\" Carragher beamed. \"He is the best centre-back the Premier League has ever seen, by a mile.\"",
      "Richards then asked how Van Dijk compared to other legendary centre-backs like Ferdinand, John Terry, Sol Campbell and Tony Adams. \"JT could play alongside him, I would allow that,\" Carragher replied. \"Ferdinand was a poor man's Van Dijk.\"",
      "The dig followed earlier accusations of hypocrisy and grandstanding between the pair over Saudi Arabia's growing influence in modern football. In recent years, the Saudi Pro League has lured a string of high-profile players with enormous salaries and transfer fees, prompting widespread claims of sportswashing as the country seeks to reshape its controversial global image.",
      "Speaking on his FIVE program, Ferdinand took aim at Carragher for refusing to condemn former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard after he took the reins at Al-Ettifaq. \"Jamie. Jamie Carragher. Where are you man? I heard a lot of talk, a lot of negativity about Saudi. Oh, Bernardo Silva, I can't believe it. It's a disgrace, it needs investigating, this league, etcetera,\" Ferdinand said.",
      "\"Steven Gerrard's gone. You used to carry his boots and his bag at Anfield to games. Your boy's gone over there and I've not heard a peep out of you. I've not heard how disappointed you are. I want to see him say \"I can't believe Stevie's gone there\".",
      "However, Carragher would later hit back by accusing the 47-year-old of ducking questions over Qatar during the 2022 World Cup. \"I never criticised Silva, Benzema, Neves or SG [Steven Gerrard]. I don't like Saudi trying to buy football like they golf,\" he wrote in a post on X.",
      "\"I knew you'd be all over it @rioferdy5 [three money-mouth face emojis], like you were in Qatar! That's why you refused to do the opening game for @BBCMOTD [because you] didn't want to criticise your paymaster.\"",
      "Back in 2021, Ferdinand said he had to \"mute\" Carragher whenever the Liverpool legend discussed winning Premier League titles. \"Carragher shouldn't really talk about winning leagues,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"He's never done it. He doesn't know what it means. He doesn't know how to do it - he's never navigated a team to that point to win a league. So I find it very difficult when he speaks with such conviction about winning leagues. He should stick to cup competitions, the moment he starts talking about winning leagues, I just mute it.\"",
      "Hitting back at Ferdinand, Carragher posted: \"No [Premier League title] for me but Sky like my opinions! No [trophy] in your career without [Alex Ferguson] and when you stopped winning PL at [Manchester United] you tried to move to Chelsea so please stop giving it the big MU fan one!\"",
      "Ferdinand later claimed he was simply trying to provoke a response, posting an image calling Carragher's comeback the \"bite of the year.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ghana head coach Otto Addo believes Antoine Semenyo is ready to \"take the next step\" amid transfer links with Manchester United and Liverpool. The Bournemouth star faces an uncertain future on the South Coast with Premier League giants circling over a possible move.",
      "The Athletic previously reported that the Cherries were becoming increasingly resigned to losing the 25-year-old, who captained Andoni Iraola's against Everton last time out, in January with a £65million release clause set to become active. Both the Premier League champions and the Red Devils have been linked with his services, while Tottenham Hotspur expressed an interest in the summer before he signed a new deal.",
      "The attacker has been in fine form this season, sparking speculation over a move, with six goals and three assists in 13 Premier League outings.",
      "Addo believes it is a matter of time before Semenyo makes his big-money as he talked up the Ghana international's credentials.",
      "“He has done very well at Bournemouth, but with all the respect for Bournemouth and what they’re doing, surely it is natural for him to take the next step,\" he told The Athletic.",
      "“Whether its in the winter or summer, it is a difference question but it won’t make a difference for us. I’m looking forward to him showing more of what he can to the world.”",
      "Despite Bournemouth being decimated in the transfer window, losing the likes of Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool, they managed to retain manager Andoni Iraola and winger Semenyo, with the pair continuing to impress.",
      "\"I've grown so much at the club, both on and off the pitch, and I'm really happy to have signed ahead of returning for pre-season,\" said Semenyo after signing a five-year deal",
      "\"From the fans to the staff and my teammates, I can't speak highly enough of the people around the club.",
      "\"It's a great place to be and I'm excited to get back to Bournemouth and continue the hard work with the new season just around the corner.\"",
      "After last season's 11-goal return, Semenyo netted twice in their season opener against Liverpool before Arne Slot's side scored late on to spare their blushes after squandering a two-goal lead.",
      "He has been linked with a move to Anfield in January as Mohamed Salah faces an uncertain future on Merseyside, despite having signed a new two-year deal earlier this year.",
      "The Egyptian is set to head to the Africa Cup of Nations this month and has had a below-par start to the season, where he has faced criticism for failing to replicate the form that fired Liverpool to the Premier League title last campaign.",
      "Meanwhile, United were linked with Semenyo's services during their pursuit of attacking reinforcements.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side moved to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko as part of their plan to improve their attacking output.",
      "Semenyo's £65 million release clause is said to have a deadline but is in place in order to allow Bournemouth sufficient time to source a replacement.",

      "Any concerns regarding Kobbie Mainoo's future at Manchester United were only exacerbated following a disappointing draw against West Ham. The academy gem was an unused substitute for the fourth time this season as the Hammers struck late to take a point from Old Trafford on Thursday.",
      "Still waiting on his first Premier League start of the campaign, Mainoo continues to be all but frozen out Ruben Amorim. And one former United star has empathised with the youngster, suggesting he \"must be furious\" with his manager for how he's being treated.",
      "Another day, another United fixture in which Mainoo has watched largely as a spectator. And despite this being the kind of tetchy game in which the 20-year-old's composure on the ball could have been put to great use, he instead could only look on as his team dropped more valuable points.",
      "Once hailed as the brightest talent to emerge from United's youth ranks in some years, Mainoo appears almost written off by his manager. Murmurs have touted the midfielder for the exit for some time, with Napoli still being linked with a move for his signature next year.",
      "Ex-United defender Paul Parker could only sympathise with the player following his latest no-show. And the two-time Premier League champion could only theorise his relationship with Amorim must be at an all-time low as his chances of making the 2026 World Cup wilt away.",
      "\"I don’t think he is leaving because I don’t think the club can afford to let him go, but if he never gets minutes, he has to leave for his own sake,\" Parker told MyBettingSites. \"He must be feeling horrible at the moment, because he knows the manager has taken away his opportunity to go to the World Cup. He must be furious at Amorim. He has to be. There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned.",
      "\"It would be a very bad story for the club if he were to leave. Just look at [Scott] McTominay. I don’t think he would have made a massive difference at Man United at this moment in time, but you can’t have another one of those stories coming out. It would be terrible if Mainoo leaves and all of a sudden does very well, because then everyone will question Amorim and the club.",
      "\"He is a player and a person I hope the best for. He is a wonderful young lad, and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.\"",
      "That wasn't the only factor in the West Ham draw that drew a \"furious\" reaction. That's how set-piece coach Carlos Fernandes was described after Soungoutou Magassa levelled from a late corner at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "The Frenchman showed the sharpest reactions to convert a bobbling ball into the back of United's net in the 83rd minute on Thursday. And Fernandes' response summed up his emotions as he stormed back to his seat in angry fashion.",
      "Fernandes usually gets up from the dugout to take a closer look at set pieces, both in attack and defence. However, Magassa's late strike may have made him wish he hadn't bothered getting a better angle on this occasion.",
      "The hosts looked lethargic in responding as the ball bounced dangerously around the box in the build-up to Magassa's goal. And the end result was United missing their opportunity to move into the Premier League's top six following two more dropped points.",
      "The fruit of Fernandes' labour is evident in the fact United have drastically improved their threat from dead-ball situations this season. However, West Ham's goal at Old Trafford served as proof there's still work to be done defending those same scenarios.",

      "The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw grabbed worldwide attention - with supporters across the globe glued to their TV screens to find out which countries would battle each other for international football's biggest prize.",
      "The night was packed with surprises - although some drew criticism from viewers - who were left scratching their heads at the lengthy duration of the draw. That's also not to mention the numerous segments put together by FIFA president Gianni Infantino.",
      "One of the major decisions of the night was appointing former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand as one of the key presenters for the event, with him taking the spotlight for the crucial moments. The ex-England player guided viewers through the process, breaking down why specific nations ended up in certain groups based on the draw regulations.",
      "During breaks between each pot selection, Hollywood actor Danny Ramirez mingled with the audience, as well, chatting to ex-footballers including ex-Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure.",
      "The former Ivory Coast star was quizzed about his nation's draw, before Ramirez made an awkward observation about Toure and Ferdinand in front of the assembled crowd.",
      "Ramirez said: \"I know you and Rio, you used to play for rival clubs. Are you guys friends now?\" Toure said in reply: \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "Ferdinand appeared somewhat irritated by the question, though, with the United great saying: \"Haha, what you trying to do here Danny? I know you're trying to get in the middle here, what are you doing?\"",

      "It capped off an awkward reunion for the duo - who had clashed numerous times during their Premier League careers. Ferdinand went head-to-head with Toure on 12 occasions throughout his playing days - securing three victories, drawing twice and suffering seven defeats, demonstrating who dominated that particular battle",

      "Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo finds himself at a career crossroads, with the next two transfer windows potentially being pivotal for him. The 20-year-old midfielder experienced a meteoric rise at Old Trafford after breaking into the first team a few years ago, but his career has now stalled.",
      "Despite an injury-ravaged start to the 2023/24 season, Mainoo managed to secure a spot in the starting line-up under Erik ten Hag, making 24 Premier League appearances that campaign, most of them as a starter.",
      "Injuries once again marred his progress last season, but he still clocked up over 30 appearances across all competitions, even amidst a mid-season managerial change when Ruben Amorim took over from Ten Hag. However, after rumours of a potential move away surfaced towards the end of the summer transfer window, this season has taken a different turn for the England international.",
      "So far this season, Mainoo has only started one match, a Carabao Cup second-round tie against Grimsby Town at the end of August - a match that Amorim's side lost on penalties following a 2-2 draw in regular time.",
      "Mainoo has made appearances in nine out of United's 14 Premier League matches so far, but all have been as a substitute. Most recently, he was an unused substitute in the 1-1 draw at home against West Ham on Thursday evening.",
      "Following Mainoo's latest snub against the Hammers, a furious Paul Scholes took to Instagram to vent his frustration at the Reds head coach. \"Bulls***,\" Scholes posted in response to Amorim, who said last week he views Mainoo as a starter.",
      "\"The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Only four senior members of United's squad have yet to make a Premier League start this season. Tom Heaton, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and, most worryingly, Mainoo.",
      "For most on that list, warming the bench is neither unexpected nor alarming. Heaton is third in line for the goalkeeper spot, Malacia was rumoured to be leaving in the summer and was part of the so-called 'bomb squad' with the likes of Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford as they sought transfers, while Martinez has only recently returned from nearly a year out due to a knee injury.",
      "For Mainoo, there's no such justification. So, it's hardly surprising that whispers of a transfer are resurfacing as the January window looms. Mainoo was linked with Napoli in the summer, where his teammate Rasmus Hojlund was loaned out during the same period.",
      "The harsh truth for Mainoo is that his current situation at United seems unlikely to change in the near future, with Amorim simply favouring other players. The club also continues to be associated with potential midfield reinforcements after a move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba fell through in the summer, which would further relegate Mainoo down the pecking order.",
      "In a World Cup year, time is running short, and Mainoo is fast losing chances to work his way back into Thomas Tuchel's thinking. Following his maiden senior England call-up in the spring last year, the midfielder hasn't featured in a Three Lions squad throughout this calendar year.",
      "The England manager was questioned about Mainoo's prospects earlier this season, but predictably pointed to insufficient playing time as the main factor behind his recent exclusions. \"He's lacking minutes,\" Tuchel revealed during a press conference.",
      "\"I don't think he lacks anything else. He has the experience, the power, the quality, the talent to be on our list - he is on our list - but in his position No6, No8, No10 we have players in full rhythm and play key parts in their clubs.\"",
      "Following such a promising start to his United career, it's disappointing that yet another academy product from the club might need to depart to revive his trajectory. While still relatively youthful, Mainoo clearly faces a crucial choice regarding his future in the coming weeks, as he simply cannot continue being sidelined and disregarded.",

      "Manchester United are grappling with a tough decision regarding the future of Kobbie Mainoo. It comes as the midfielder contemplates a potential move in the January transfer window.",
      "The homegrown talent has found game time hard to come by under Ruben Amorim, who has favoured a double pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro this season. Mainoo has clocked up just 261 minutes on the pitch as a result, with only one start coming in the form of the Carabao Cup.",
      "With playing opportunities looking scarce, The Athletic reports that Mainoo is prepared to seek a loan move away from United in the January transfer window due to his frustration over lack of game time.",
      "The report also suggests that the club hasn't made a final decision yet and isn't expected to do so until after AFCON - which falls in the middle of the transfer window - due to the potential impact of players leaving for the tournament.",
      "This sets a timeline for when the academy star could depart, if United decide that an exit in the coming weeks is the best course of action. Mainoo remained on the bench during his team's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening, sparking fresh speculation about his future at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I see it [frustration]. I just want to win,\" Amorim said ahead of Monday's fixture against Wolves when questioned about whether Mainoo might feel disheartened by his selections.",
      "He added: \"I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case, was out, Bruno, he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "While Amorim has stood by his approach regarding Mainoo, United icon Paul Scholes has been far more critical of the manager following his recent remarks. Taking to Instagram, Scholes said: \"Bulls***. The kid's being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Whether Mainoo will be permitted to leave and develop his career elsewhere from January onwards remains uncertain, with significant decisions still pending.",
      "With ongoing speculation surrounding United and a potential midfield signing on the horizon, however, all signs suggest a possible departure for Mainoo.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Benjamin Sesko was absent from recent training imagery released by Manchester United, but the striker should be close to a return, provided his recovery from a knee injury has gone to plan. Last month, Sesko was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute against Tottenham, but he lasted just half-an-hour and was forced off after receiving treatment for a knee injury.",
      "Sources indicated the injury was not thought to be a major issue, which meant a few weeks was the expectation for his layoff. Amorim provided an update on Sesko's injury on November 21, saying: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but it’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether Sesko would return before United lose players to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). \"I think it’s going to be more or less at the same time,\" he said. \"I don’t want to say for sure, but when they are going to camp [for the tournament], I expect to have Ben back.\"",
      "When Amorim made that comment, the presumption was that United would lose players to AFCON after facing Wolves, but there is the possibility that they will keep Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to face Bournemouth before joining their nations at the tournament.",
      "Sesko should be nearing a return. He did not appear to be involved with the main group in recent training images, but the original timeline for his recovery suggests he'll be back in the next week or so. It feels unlikely that Sesko will be spotted making his way off the team bus at Molineux. If he isn't involved on Monday, he should still have a chance of being involved against Bournemouth.",
      "There was a conversation about Sesko needing to do more before he picked up his knee injury. Gary Neville was critical of his performance against Nottingham Forest and Amorim admitted he was \"struggling a little bit\".",
      "Discussing the impact of former United stars criticising players in the media, Amorim responded: \"Of course, nobody likes to hear, but he struggled a little bit, and that is a fact.",
      "\"So let's embrace that. It’s not personal, it’s not nothing. That is what I try to explain to the players. That is not personal. It's an opinion that is going to change in three weeks.",
      "\"Everything that is true today, in three weeks, could be a lie. So of course, it's hard to hear, but my advice to Ben is you are going to get used. And then it's going to be natural. We are going to help him and we are going to protect Ben because he works really hard and we want to succeed. So he's going to succeed.\"",
      "Sesko's display against Tottenham was picked apart. He had two chances to find the back of the net and showed his inexperience, but his return to fitness will be a much-needed boost.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has described himself as \"9.5 false striker\", and so Sesko is the only centre-forward in the dressing room. Zirkzee scored a brilliant goal against Crystal Palace, but there is a large bank of evidence that confirms he is not a natural goalscorer.",
      "Sesko has not looked like a natural goalscorer since his arrival from RB Leipzig, but he at least moves and thinks like a striker, which is what United need from their starter leading the attack. United struggled to pose a goal threat in home games against Everton and West Ham. They sent several crosses into the box in search of a goal against Everton, but they were unable to find a breakthrough.",
      "Sesko might have done better with those crosses and Amorim will be desperate for him to be available again, especially with Mbeumo and Amad set to report for international duty at AFCON.",
      "The likelihood is that United will have to make do without Sesko against Wolves, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see Amorim revert to the striker-less attack he picked in the opening three league games of the season.",
      "Sesko was dropped to the bench before he picked up a knee injury. He will be needed to start the majority of games during the Christmas schedule if fit and fans are hoping he will return from the sidelines with a bang.",

      "Diogo Dalot has urged the Manchester United dressing room to use \"anger and drive\" to spur them on. Dalot was visibly disappointed when he spoke after dropping points against West Ham and admitted his teammates need to become \"more obsessed\" about winning.",
      "Dalot appeared frustrated when he spoke to journalists in the mixed zone. \"We are very disappointed. We cannot concede a goal, we have to control more the game. We should have done the same as we did for 60 minutes, and try to score the second. We had the game there,\" he said.",
      "Speaking about what was said amongst players, Dalot added: \"Just that feeling - we cannot drop the intentions that we had to score a goal, to go out for the second one, to control even more with the ball.",
      "\"And when we lose the ball, be in a good position so we don't suffer counter-attacks. Because we knew that today was going to be, for West Ham, the only way of creating danger was going to be second balls, transitions or set plays.\"",
      "Dalot was asked about the inconsistency and responded: \"First of all, I don't think they [West Ham] are at that [poor] level. Obviously, they have a lower block and you saw how hard it is to get in during 60 minutes.",
      "\"But as soon as we found a way to score a goal, we need to keep doing the same things because that's what put us in the position to control the game. I think we are dominant even though we conceded one or two transitions that we could have avoided.",
      "\"But in the end, they score a goal, it's not so hard to create chances and put the ball in the net. But then, with 30 minutes to go, we need to fight for the result.\"",
      "Dalot added: \"It's always like this [needing to put together a run of decent results]. Even after winning three or four games in a row, people will expect you to win five or six or seven.",
      "\"So, we just have to focus on one game, one win at the time. Today, we had a good chance to get closer to the top positions and I think that's what hurts even more.\"",
      "Expanding on the missed opportunity to move to fifth, Dalot added: \"That's something that has to call us and has to be something that we need to look at. Because, in these moments, if we deliver, we'll probably be in another position and we'll be talking about other things.",
      "\"But that's part of the game also. But, at the same time, we have opportunities to improve. And, like I said, it's just a disappointing feeling because we had a game there.\"",
      "Dalot appeared to question his teammates when suggesting the reason for poor results is \"sometimes not football qualities\", saying: \"I think we've shown this season that we can be a very good team and we can beat anybody. Then, it's something that we need to get into ourselves.",
      "\"Sometimes, it's not football qualities. It has to be from inside. It has to be from the anger and the drive that you have every day to win football games and to live your life like that.",
      "\"I think we need to become a bit more obsessed about playing for this club, winning games and winning trophies for this club. But it's a process. I'm not going to get into the 'we need time' thing.",
      "\"I think we have to win straight away because that's what the club demands. That's why it hurts sometimes even more when we have opportunities like this and we don't win.\"",
      "Dalot lost his starting place to Patrick Dorgu before the November international break, and he was named on the bench again for Everton's visit to Old Trafford. Amorim was asked about his options at left wing-back and suggested that neither of them were performing on matchdays as they do during training.",
      "However, Dalot impressed on his recall to the team against Crystal Palace, winning the free-kick that led to Mason Mount's winner, and built on that with a goal against West Ham.",
      "Dalot was asked about Amorim's comments and said: \"I think it's something in general. He could be talking about me, but I think he could be talking about everyone at the club. We always have to find ways to improve ourselves, be more consistent. We are in a team where you're as good as your last game.",
      "\"So, you just have to know that this is a type of pressure for a big club like Man United. Fortunately, I'm here long enough to understand how it works and find a way to help the team. I think that's the aim for everybody.\"",

      "Manuel Ugarte should have had a head start on his Manchester United teammates when Ruben Amorim was appointed at Old Trafford in November 2024. After all, Ugarte played 85 games under Amorim at Sporting.",
      "His form was good enough in Lisbon to earn a move to Paris Saint-Germain and although his stay in the French capital lasted only one season, he was signed by United in the summer of 2024.",
      "Erik ten Hag wasn't entirely convinced the Uruguayan was the right man, but spoke warmly of him after his arrival for £50million. A relatively slow start to life at United was supposed to gain momentum under Amorim.",
      "That isn't how it has played out. He has started just 21 of Amorim's 41 Premier League games in charge and none since defeat to Brentford at the end of September. There have been just 77 minutes in eight league matches since then and he has been an unused substitute for three of the last five games.",
      "These are damning statistics for a £50million midfielder who had a prior relationship with his head coach. Given Amorim has a plug-and-play system that he used at Sporting, Ugarte should have picked it up quicker than any of his teammates. Instead, he has drifted to the fringes of the team.",
      "Amorim accepted a couple of weeks ago that Ugarte was finding it difficult at the moment, but insisted he wanted to help the 24-year-old come out the other side of it.",
      "\"You can sense a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle,\" he said. \"He is struggling at the moment but it is our job to try to help and help him to feel like I felt when he was a Sporting player.",
      "\"But it is a different world. He needs to adapt, and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "Amorim told Ugarte he wasn't at the level he showed at Sporting in a team meeting after the Europa League final defeat and the evidence continues to mount that he might not get back there.",
      "He is probably the most defensive midfielder in this squad, given Casemiro's penchant for getting forward and into the opposition box, but he isn't making the team look any more secure when he plays.",
      "Part of the reason for his introduction 13 minutes from time against West Ham on Thursday was to see out a 1-0 lead, but United conceded. That might not have been directly down to Ugarte, but the case against him is mounting.",
      "United have conceded 14 of their 23 goals this season when Ugarte has been on the pitch and that isn't a great reflection of his ability to offer protection to his defence.",
      "It looks increasingly likely that a United midfielder will leave on loan in January, with Kobbie Mainoo playing even less than Ugarte. The 20-year-old has managed just 171 minutes in the Premier League and hasn't started in that competition this season. It seems Amorim has no faith in him.",
      "Ugarte is faring only marginally better. There has to be a question as to his long-term future at Old Trafford and if a midfielder is to leave the club next month, there is an argument it should be Ugarte rather than Mainoo.",

      "For the second time this season, Manchester United got a goal from a wing-back on Thursday night. The manner in which the ball fell to Diogo Dalot was fortunate, but Dalot's finish was not and neither was his positioning.",
      "This was what Amorim so desperately wanted from the wide players in his team. With the ball on the right, left wing-back Dalot moved into a central area inside the penalty box. When Casemiro's deflected shot fell to him, he was ten yards out and had time to take a touch and finish.",
      "The problem for United and Amorim is that it isn't happening enough. The wing-backs in this system are supposed to provide an attacking threat, but they aren't doing it on a regular basis. Amad was lively at times against West Ham, but generally, the quality isn't there out wide.",
      "Dalot continues to give his all and can deliver at times, but the transition to wing-back doesn't come easily and he would probably look a lot more comfortable as a natural full-back with a winger in front of him. Patrick Dorgu is a more attacking wing-back, but he has yet to show he is good enough for this level.",
      "Amorim spoke last week about the anxiety he senses when Dorgu has the ball and the 21-year-old isn't a sufficient attacking threat down the left. The quality is lacking.",
      "During the answer about the anxiety you can feel when Dorgu has the ball, Amorim also expanded on his wing-backs, admitting they weren't good enough at the moment but insisting they were showing more in training.",
      "\"What I feel when I see them training, they are doing so much better than in games,\" he said.",
      "\"I think they (wing-backs) are far from the best, and they know it. So, like a lot of players in our team, like myself. So I just, I just look at them, and I think they have so much more to give. So let's see, let's see this week if we improve that.\"",
      "He was also asked last month if wing-back was an area he wanted to strengthen, but again said time was needed to \"improve the characteristics of the team.\"",
      "The problem is that Amorim has had a year to turn the wings into a positive area for United and he hasn't done it. It is also surprising that the £25million deal to sign Dorgu in January is the only attempt to strengthen the position in the transfer market, with the £215m summer spending spree focusing on a striker and two No. 10s.",
      "Things might be about to get worse as well. Amad will head to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) later this month, as will Noussair Mazraoui, who is only a very occasional fill-in at wing-back these days. Amad's absence will be felt keenly. He is easily the most attacking wing-back in this squad and the one who looks most likely to provide the incision from out wide.",
      "Unless Amorim decides to move Luke Shaw back out wide, then Dalot and Dorgu will be the only available wing-backs while Amad is away with the Ivory Coast. It's hard not to think that will reduce United's wide threat and put more of an onus on goals and creativity on Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "If this system is to ever click into gear and work on a regular basis, then either the wing-backs have to improve or better players have to be signed for the role.",

      "Senne Lammens was \"surprised\" by the spirit and togetherness in Manchester United's dressing room when he arrived in the summer. Lammens signed from Royal Antwerp on the final day of the summer transfer window and has made a strong impact since making his debut in October.",
      "The Belgian has retained first-choice status since keeping a clean sheet against Sunderland, and he has earned praise for delivering consistent displays in between the sticks at Old Trafford.",
      "Lammens recently sat down with Malaysian broadcaster Stadium Astro to conduct an interview at Carrington and he was asked who he is closest to in the dressing room. Lammens named two goalkeepers, but admitted he is close to everyone because all the players have a strong bond.",
      "He explained: “I would say maybe Tom Heaton or the fourth goalkeeper Dermot Mee or also, like, the Dutch guys, because it’s easier with the language as well. But I think just in general that’s what surprised me the most.",
      "\"It’s just the togetherness of the group and of the dressing room. Everyone was really nice. So I don’t really want to say one or two guys. It’s in general with everybody, to be honest.”",
      "Amorim has improved dressing room morale. The bad eggs were banished in the summer and sources admitted that a feeling of 'us against them' had developed after their departures.",
      "Lammens provided further personal insight when he revealed he journals before and after matches. \"I think it started when I started played at Antwerp two years ago,\" he said. \"I like to write things down before and after a game just to get my head into the right mindset. Sometimes if things don't go right, or you don't want it in your head, you just write it down to get it off your chest.",
      "\"I came up with it [journaling] a little bit myself, but also got it [the idea] from people talking about it as well, so I thought I would give it a try and it actually helped me a lot, so I still do it.",
      "\"Before a game, I write down a little bit about the opponent, about how they will play and put pressure on me. Also individual things, like key points I have to remember throughout the game.\"",
      "Lammens continued: \"Being a complete goalkeeper is something I take pride in. It's not just stop-stopping, it's coming out for crosses and helping the defence when the balls go behind them. My distribution as well, but what I'm most proud of is being able to play with my left foot and right.",
      "\"That makes it more difficult for the opponent to press me. Coming out for crosses is really difficult in the Premier League especially. I still like to do it a lot, but you need to protect yourself a little bit.\"",

      "There have been boos to greet the final whistle at the end of the last two games at Old Trafford and it feels like Bonnie Tyler's 'It’s a Heartache’ hasn't been heard quite as often in Manchester United ends recently, but it would be stretching it to say matchgoers have lost faith in Ruben Amorim just yet.",
      "It's clear concerns at the lack of progress are growing and the momentum built up a month ago has again been replaced by introspection, but United fans are generally reluctant to turn on a manager. They didn't really turn on Erik ten Hag in stadiums and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer only properly got abuse on his final day in charge after a 4-1 defeat at Watford. Amorim hasn't had anything like that yet.",
      "But from his adherence to a system that isn't working to concerns over a playing style that is hardly thrilling to watch, the pubs around the ground will be ablaze with fans who aren't convinced at what they are seeing. The issue that might finally drive a wedge between supporters and Amorim is a player we get barely to see, however. Kobbie Mainoo has managed just 171 minutes in the Premier League this season and as the weeks have gone by, Amorim's faith in him seems to decline.",
      "There is a similar precedent towards the end of Solskjaer's reign, when fans used his refusal to play Donny van de Beek as a stick to beat him with. The difference is that Solskjaer was right and Van de Beek hadn't shown enough for United, and never would do. With Mainoo, the feeling is different.",
      "Fans have already seen what the gifted 20-year-old can do. He burst onto the scene in 2023/24, has played in a major tournament final, scored some brilliant goals for United and been at the heart of an FA Cup final win against Manchester City. But now he is the last option in midfield for Amorim, the break glass in case of emergency player on the bench, and even then, Amorim would rather look elsewhere.",
      "With United needing a goal against West Ham on Thursday, the Portuguese head coach opted for Lisandro Martinez as his fifth and final substitute. It left Mainoo kicking his heels again, but it was clear to everyone else inside Old Trafford that he was the more likely source of a goal.",
      "To compound matters, Mainoo is the Stockport-born United fan who is the current poster boy of an academy being turned into a cash machine rather than a source of first-team footballers. Supporters are baffled at his lack of involvement and angry at Amorim's approach to homegrown players.",
      "It won't have helped matters that Amorim was so dismissive of Mainoo in his press conference ahead of facing Wolves this weekend. He gave the impression there were very few scenarios in which he would play the youngster and was clearly sick of being asked about him.",
      "Mainoo has no option but to pursue a loan move next month. His development is stalling for a lack of first-team football and whatever it is Amorim and his coaches are trying to improve in training, the approach clearly isn't working.",
      "But if Mainoo moves to the continent for six months and starts lighting up games again with his wonderful close control, ability to manipulate the ball near the box and find space in tight situations, the frustration at Amorim's approach to him will only grow.",
      "If United were flying under the 40-year-old, then this would be less of an issue. Supporters would still be frustrated, but they would be willing to trust Amorim and let it slide for now. But they are not flying. They are going nowhere at the moment.",
      "United would have no interest in letting Mainoo leave permanently in January and the midfielder wouldn't want to. He wants to make it at Old Trafford and right now he is probably looking at it and thinking he is far more likely to last the course than Amorim.",
      "The former Sporting boss is under pressure and his refusal to give Mainoo a chance is only raising the stakes. It might be the issue that finally sees patience snap for many fans.",

When we conducted a thorough review of the Carrington facilities and met with our men’s first-team players, it was clear the standards had fallen below some of our peers.\"",
      "The main building renovation was unveiled before the start of the season, and Mount is the latest member of the dressing room to heap praise on the modernised Carrington facilities. \"The training ground is amazing now,\" he told club media.",
      "\"It's got to the point where you don't want to leave, you want to stay here, do a bit of recovery and everything like that. It's really important for us as a club, but you can feel the morale within the building, it's improving, for sure.",
      "\"Spending a lot of time together at the training ground matters, for sure, because the more time you spend together, the more you learn about each other and bond as a group. I think you can see that on the pitch when times have been tough, we've reacted positively. The Forest game, we went 2-1 down after half-time, and we got back to 2-2 to draw the game.\"",
      "Discussing what Ruben Amorim is like during training, Mount said: \"He's great, really good. I think you can see it on the pitch, we always do everything we can for him and work as hard as we can for him. Show passion, fight and desire to win the game.",
      "\"He's exactly like that in training as well, you really feel that passion for the game and as a player, that's all you want to play for. If you look at the squad now, there's lots of competition for places.",
      "\"That's exactly what we need because the standard is always pushing higher and higher. And we need to keep setting those standards high because we want to achieve a lot. I think it's massively important for us as a group to be competitive, but as soon as we go on the pitch to face the opposition, it's a given.\"",
      "United moved from The Cliff to Carrington in 2000 and the training ground was a world-class facility when it opened, but it had fallen behind other facilities in recent years.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo publicly criticised Carrington in his interview with Piers Morgan in 2022. “Nothing changes. Not only the jacuzzi, the pool, even the gym. Even some points of technology, the kitchen, the chefs - who I appreciate, lovely people,\" he said. \"They stop in time, which surprised me a lot.\"",
      "Architectural firm Foster + Partners were responsible for designing the redevelopment of United's first-team building at Carrington, which the club described as \"a leading-edge, high-performance training environment designed to inspire collaboration, innovation and excellence\".",

      "'Best in class' was the buzzword used by Sir Jim Ratcliffe in several interviews during his courtship of Manchester United. Ratcliffe was adamant that only the best would be good enough, from boardroom hires to recruitment, to restore United to former glories. That plan is currently not working.",
      "There were boos at Old Trafford following the final whistle against West Ham, another disappointing result that has led many fans to suggest Ruben Amorim should face the axe. Wolves is a must-win for Amorim and the next few weeks will decide his future. United have an incredibly kind run of fixtures and Amorim should bite the bullet if he cannot string together a run of results.",
      "Amorim was Omar Berrada's appointment. Jason Wilcox has been the driving force behind recruitment since Ratcliffe's investment. It would reflect badly on United's chiefs if they do decide to sack Amorim. Berrada and Wilcox were supposedly 'best in class' hires, but they will be sweating if Amorim is kicked out of the classroom because the headteacher will demand answers from his staff.",
      "Sacking Amorim would cost around £10million. That would be a major waste of cash, without mentioning that United paid £9.2m to buy Amorim out of his Sporting Lisbon contract. If Amorim departed, Ratcliffe would be frustrated at the time United have wasted. He is a man in a hurry and wants to win the league by 2028, in line with the club's 150th anniversary, so sacking Amorim would set the Ineos project back, but there is no point in staying on a train heading in the wrong direction.",
      "After the Manchester derby defeat, Wilcox spoke at an event at Old Trafford for ex-players and it was illuminating to hear him speak about his challenging start to working at United. YouTube channel Man Utd The Religion recorded the interview.",
      "“It has been a rollercoaster,\" said Wilcox. \"I came in last April, around 18 months ago, and it’s been a real challenge, I can’t lie. I thought the club was in a much better place than it was. We had no football identity, we lacked alignment between ownership, the CEO, football and the academy.",
      "“And we’ve just been working so hard behind the scenes. There’s been a lot of work that’s gone on to change the staff. I know in the media, there's an awful lot of coverage around the redundancies.",
      "“But the football club needed to go through a period of transformation, without a doubt. Forget the redundancies. The whole structure of Manchester United needed to change… I would have done it from a sporting side. I did the same at Southampton, at Man City.",
      "\"It's important we have a leaner workforce that provides accountability and responsibility for people. It's really sad to see people lose their jobs, but it needed to be done.\"",
      "He continued: \"Now we’ve got a platform to rebuild. I didn't realise how big this club was, even though I've competed against this club as a player and as a coach. This club is a wonderful club.",
      "“I just pray we get the opportunity to turn it around. I really feel it's not 'will we win again', I think it's 'when will we win again'. It's going to take time and it's not a quick fix, especially now with the regulations.",
      "\"We needed to change the playing squad. We've made some really good additions this summer. Sometimes taking players out of the squad is as important as the players you bring in.",
      "\"We have to bring back the culture and respect back to Man United, whether you work for us, or play against us, you feel like you're part of something special. I'm extremely proud, I'm extremely privileged, but I am extremely frustrated as well because we can't fix it quickly enough.\"",
      "The positions of Wilcox and Berrada should not be immune from scrutiny in this mess.",

      "The two shared a warm embrace in the tunnel before the game at Estadio La Cartuja de Sevilla. Ferran Torres scored a first-half hat-trick to help fire Barcelona to a 5-3 victory.",
      "However, the Catalan giants were handed a scare when former United man Antony put the hosts ahead. But Torres, who was preferred up front to Robert Lewandowski, scored three times, with Roony Bardghji also on target as Barca went 4-1 up at half-time.",
      "Lamine Yamal then scored from the penalty spot just before the hour mark. And although Diego Llorente and Cucho Hernandez struck late on, the damage was already done.",
      "Rashford completed a season-long loan move to the Spanish giants during the summer transfer window. The deal includes an option for the La Liga leaders to sign him outright at the end of the season for around £26million.",
      "The forward's career at Old Trafford appeared over when Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort. After showing flashes of what he can do in the second half of last season while on loan at Aston Villa, Rashford has impressed for the Catalan side.",
      "In an interview with Barca's YouTube channel back in October, Rashford revealed he’s loving life in Spain. He said: \"I'm really enjoying my time in Spain. The weather is the best part. It's a very big change. I'm learning every day, I'm really enjoying it.",

      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything. I don't feel there is much change in me, I just feel it's a new environment and culture and one I looked forward to coming here. It's just about me adapting and fitting in as well as possible. I'm so hungry to keep improving.\"",

      "Wolves manager Rob Edwards believes Manchester United have \"loads of really good players\", and will arrive at Molineux with a \"clear way of playing\" when they make the visit on Monday night. United suffered another setback against West Ham earlier in the week, drawing 1-1 against the struggling London club, despite taking the lead through Diogo Dalot in the 58th minute.",
      "Ruben Amorim looked furious after the final whistle and many have questioned why United are unable to build a run of good results. The Reds have the chance to respond against Wolves on Monday, and they are heavy favourites to claim a victory against a team with just two points this season.",
      "Wolves have struggled and Edwards was appointed from Middlesbrough to replace Vitor Pereira last month. Edwards spoke to reporters at a press conference ahead of facing United and said: “They've got loads of really good players. Like every team, they'll have a clear way of playing, and we'll be able to have a really good look at it, but I need to focus on us, and I need to see us.",
      "\"We’ve got to turn up. We’ve got to expect the best Manchester United to turn up, and we have got to. I don’t want to see what we saw on Wednesday’s first half.”",
      "Edwards added: “We're in this bad, bad situation, but how do you want this to go? Do you want to fade away, or do you want to fight? There are things in our control that we can do.",
      "\"Fighting, running hard, winning duels, those sorts of things are in our control. You can't control a win, but you can control the other side, intensity, how often you run forward.",
      "\"Are you sprinting back? Are you trying to take risks? Are you trying to be brave? We saw that on the weekend, and we didn't see it on Wednesday. We’ve got to control the things we can control at the moment, and hopefully then results will come. That's the biggest message.”",
      "Edwards oversaw Luton Town's promotion to the Premier League in 2022/2023, but the Hatters were immediately sent back down to the Championship after collecting just 26 points.",
      "Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They have amassed two points from 14 games and could beat Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08.",
      "Amorim was asked about Wolves' failure to win a league game this season and said: \"Everything can happen and that will change. There is no team in the history of the Premier League that didn’t win one game.",
      "\"It can be any game. So we need to try to improve, rest the players, work really well and prepare a tough match because with us it’s always a tough match.\"",
      "Matthijs de Ligt was absent due to injury against West Ham. Amorim said \"I think so, we will see\" in response to a question about whether the Dutchman would be available to face Wolves.",
      "De Ligt was the only United player to have played every league minute this season until this week.",

      "Manchester United loanee Ethan Ennis scored a brace for Fleetwood against Luton Town in the second round of the FA Cup on Saturday. Ennis' second goal was a trivela shot, and a clip of the goal has gone viral on social media.",
      "Ennis opened the scoring in the 64th minute of the game with a strike at the back post, but Luton equalised shortly afterwards. Ennis then popped up with eight minutes remaining to score a trivela goal, striking the ball with the outside of his foot to find the top left corner from the right side of the box.",
      "United academy graduate Teden Mengi scored for Luton in added time to make it 2-2, but Fleetwood won the penalty shootout to secure their spot in the next round of the FA Cup. Ennis converted his penalty to seal a performance worthy of the man of the match award.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Fleetwood manager Pete Wild discussed Ennis' performance and praised the youngster for scoring two important goals against third-division Luton.",
      "He said: \"I don't want to single anyone out because everybody was fantastic, but Ethan scored two fantastic goals. He continues to learn and improve. What a solid young man and a bloke who will have a top career. And hopefully we are a part of that in his journey. Some unbelievable performances.\"",
      "Ennis recently sat down with Fleetwood's media team and said: \"I want to keep learning, keep contributing, and help the team as much as I can. Every loan, every experience is part of your journey, you take something from all of it.”",
      "The winger spent the last six months of last term on loan with Doncaster Rovers as they secured promotion from League Two. “It taught me a lot,\" he said, discussing that stint.",
      "\"Going from under-21 football to the men’s game is a big step, but Doncaster was brilliant. The intensity, the competitiveness, the pressure, it all helped me grow.”",
      "Ennis began his career with Liverpool, but he was signed by United in the summer of 2021 and he was the standout signing for the academy in an otherwise quiet window.",
      "The youngster signed his first professional contract immediately after celebrating his 17th birthday and only the most highly regarded academy talents are given pro deals so quickly.",
      "The Cheshire-born youngster scored 10 goals in 19 appearances for United's Under-18s in 2021/22, his first full season at the club, and his finishing ability is one of his finest qualities.",

This critical weakness will be further exposed when their most dynamic wing-back, Amad, departs for the Africa Cup of Nations. Read full story here>>>",
      "Amorim is facing growing pressure and risks losing support due to his persistent refusal to utilise Kobbie Mainoo. Fans are baffled and frustrated by Mainoo's lack of involvement, suggesting the manager's handling of Mainoo could become the tipping point for their patience. Read full story here>>>",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are facing intense scrutiny as the team's poor form could put Amorim's job in jeopardy. If United were to cut ties with Amorim, who was Berrada’s appointment, it would not only cost millions but would also reflect badly on the new executive team's competence. Read full story here>>>",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to grant Amorim time, believing structural issues are United's primary problem, but this patience may be challenged by the Glazer family. The Glazers have historically dismissed managers when Champions League qualification becomes impossible, and missing out again would be another financial blow. Read full story here>>>",
      "Manuel Ugarte is struggling significantly more than Mainoo and should be the player considered for a January exit. Despite having played under Amorim previously, Ugarte has drifted to the fringes of the squad and his lack of defensive security is underscored by the high volume of goals conceded when he is on the field.

      "The scenes during Euro 2022 will live long in the memory. The nation was gripped with Lioness fever as England made history by beating Germany to lift the trophy at a sold-out Wembley Stadium. But the legacy of that tournament – which saw 16 nations battle it out across a total of 31 games in 10 venues from Wembley to Rotherham – has been huge for the women’s game.",
      "Close to 575,000 fans watched the matches live, many of them attending a women’s football match for the first time, while more than 365 million people tuned in on TV from 195 countries. The sport boomed on social media as fans found their new heroes, while money began pouring into the sport.",
      "In the past three years since that tournament, the game has just continued to grow in terms of awareness, investment, publicity and interest. So the news that the UK is so far the only nation in the running to host the 2035 World Cup is something everyone associated with the sport should be excited and delighted about – and the December edition of the Mirror's Women's Football News is certainly that.",
      "If it is confirmed when the final decision on the hosts is made in April that football is coming home, it will see 48 teams competing in what will be a truly stunning festival of football. A list of 22 venues across all four nations have been put forward by the UK bidding team including the new Old Trafford, Wembley, Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, Glasgow’s Hampden Park, Belfast’s Windsor Park and Newcastle’s St James’ Park. And although that list will be whittled down once the decision on the host nation is confirmed, by the size of the stadiums put forward, organisers are expecting big crowds.",

      "Despite picking up a very good victory over Crystal Palace, there was a sense of trepidation ahead of Manchester United's clash with West Ham on Thursday evening. Last time United were under the lights at Old Trafford, they came unstuck as ten man Everton picked up a deserved victory.",
      "In the second half of that fixture, United had plenty of the ball but offered very little attacking threat. Joshua Zirkzee struggled to lead the line while build-up play, particularly down the left, often broke down. There were simply no solutions to turn to on the United bench, either.",
      "This is why what happened against West Ham was not a shock. On this occasion, United managed to score the opening goal through Diogo Dalot but instead of pushing for a second and killing off the game, the Reds made changes to consolidate their advantage. Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Lisandro Martinez were all brought on, the latter after the Reds had conceded.",
      "The only attack-minded substitution was Mason Mount. who replaced Zirkzee. The Dutchman has had his critics but at least he was offering good link-up play and having left the pitch, United were ill-prepared to refocus on attacking if West Ham found an equaliser, which they managed from a corner.",
      "After the game, Ruben Amorim was quizzed about his substitutions. He initially said his plan was to win more second balls after making the substitutions, but it was telling that Amorim also asked this question in reply: \"We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?\"",
      "This statement could be perceived as a message to the United boardroom. As he continues to overlook Kobbie Mainoo, who is more attack-minded than Ugarte but still obviously not an out-and-out attacking player, there were very few options Amorim would be willing to turn to.",
      "Since the international break, United have played three matches without Benjamin Sesko. In those matches, United have had a maximum of two players who are offensively-minded on the bench - during the Crystal Palace game it was just Shea Lacey.",
      "But the new norm at the minute is Mount and Lacey on the bench. Amorim simply does not have the options available to him to make attacking changes - even if he wanted to. Would throwing Lacey into the game on Thursday night have been helpful for the Reds? Probably not.",
      "He is a young player who has a bright future but he needs to be eased in to senior football. Lacey shouldn't be thrust into a game like that with an expectation to come up with a goal to kill the game off - not at this stage of his development, anyway.",
      "Amorim has uncovered a major priority heading into the January transfer window. If United pick up any more injuries or absence in their forward line, they will be even more stretched. Adding reinforcements to the squad - particularly a centre-forward - should be at the top of the manager's wishlist heading into 2026.",
      "There should be genuine concerns ahead of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad leaving for AFCON soon. Should Sesko be deemed unfit to return when Mbeumo and Amad leave, who does Amorim turn to then? Until this issue is addressed, United can expect to find goals difficult to come by.",

      "Manchester United loanee Toby Collyer has suffered \"quite a big injury\" on loan at West Brom. Collyer has returned to Carrington to be assessed, but West Brom are hopeful he can contribute to their promotion push in the second half of the season. Collyer received permanent and loan interest from over a dozen clubs in the Championship during the summer transfer window, but West Brom won the race for his signature.",
      "The youngster's loan at the Hawthorns hasn't gone to plan, though. Collyer picked up a muscle injury in October, which kept him out for four games, and suffered a more serious issue after his return. Collyer was absent from the West Brom squad last weekend. Their manager, Ryan Mason, spoke to the Express & Star on Thursday and confirmed he has returned to Carrington to be assessed.",
      "Mason explained: “It’s quite a big injury. He’s at United at the minute. They’re just assessing him, and then I think in the coming weeks we’ll just decide his plan regarding his rehab.”",
      "When asked if the injury could impact Collyer's loan, Mason said: \"We’ve got him on loan for the season. That’s the plan. Normally, any loan player who gets an injury that’s a bit more than a small one, more of a significant one, I think it’s right for the parent club to look at them to check them over.",
      "\"We’re in dialogue and hopefully he can do his rehab and come back better. We’re looking into it, both clubs. He’s disappointed, naturally. When you’re trying to build your career when you have setbacks that hold you back, it’s challenging. But I guess the reality is to get to the top in any industry there’s going to be challenges. I think if he’s clever, if he uses it wisely, then for sure it can make him stronger in many different aspects.\"",
      "Collyer made 13 first-team appearances in a breakthrough 2024/2025 season at Old Trafford. Last year, a source discussed Erik ten Hag's fondness for Collyer and another source said he records 'freakish' running stats in training that are only bettered by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Ruben Amorim has praised Collyer. \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity,\" said Amorim in January.",
      "Collyer's contract at United runs until the summer of 2027, with the option of another year.",

      "Ruben Amorim said he had no regrets over his second-half substitutes in Manchester United's draw with West Ham despite criticism they had been too negative. After replacing Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro at half-time, he brought Patrick Dorgu on for Diogo Dalot and in a bid to see out the game took off Joshua Zirkzee for Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha for Manuel Ugarte.",
      "With West Ham level in the 83rd minute, the United head coach then took off Luke Shaw for Lisandro Martinez and left Kobbie Mainoo on the bench, despite his team needing a winner. But Amorim said he had made the changes because his team were losing too many second balls and he felt they still had the firepower to score goals.",
      "\"No,\" he said when asked if he would change the replacements. \"We are losing because of the second ball. Sometimes there's not more men in front that you are going to win the ball. We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?",
      "\"It was the second ball. I was worried with Matheus. I know that Bruno has reached the box really well. Mason Mount is playing in his position. They were trying to push us. Bryan has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one position. So that was my idea.\"",
      "Asked how he felt after seeing his side concede a late equaliser that cost them a chance of going fifth in the Premier League, he said he was \"frustrated and angry\", but then rejected claims his team were failing to progress.",
      "\"It’s not going backwards, we had some moments,\" he said. \"That can happen. You were talking about when we had the [good] run we were perfect, we are not, we are really inconsistent.",

      "Manchester United are facing a difficult decision over the future of Kobbie Mainoo, as their England midfielder angles towards a potential during the January transfer window.",
      "The academy graduate has struggled for minutes under Ruben Amorim, who has preferred a double pivot with Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro - particularly this season.",
      "Mainoo has played just 261 minutes so far this term, making just one start, which came in the Carabao Cup. He hasn't had much tome off the bench in the Premier League, either.",
      "That has seen the 20-year-old fall out of favour in the England system, too, with his last appearance coming in September 2024, which comes as quite a blow, considering it is a World Cup season.",
      "With opportunities seeming hard to come by, it seems as though Mainoo is willing to take things into his own hands, as The Athletic report that the midfielder is ready to seek a loan move away from United in the January transfer window, owing to his frustration over game-time",
      "The report also indicates no final decision has been made by the club, who aren't expected to make one until after AFCON, which is in the middle of the market, due to the potential impact of players leaving during the competition.",
      "It puts a timeline on when the academy star could leave, if United decide that the best course of action is an exit during the coming weeks.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute in his side's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday night, with further questions arising over his future at the club.",
      "\"I see it [frustration]. I just want to win,\" Amorim said before Monday's clash against Wolves when asked whether Mainoo may be demoralised by his decisions. \"I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games,\" the Portuguese went on. \"One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "While Amorim has defended his stance on Mainoo, United legend Paul Scholes is less forgiving with the manager after recent comments he made.",
      "Scholes took to Instagram and said: \"Bulls***. The kid's being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether Mainoo will be allowed to depart and progress elsewhere - from January onwards - with some big calls still to make. However, with links continuing around United, and a midfield transfer in over the near future, everything points towards a possible exit for Mainoo.",

Back at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim's side had a great chance to move up to fifth but failed to capitalise on teams around them dropping points.",
      "An early second-half goal from Diogo Dalot put United ahead but Soungoutou Magassa equalised late on to claim a share of the spoils. Following the clash, Neville went on quite the rant about United's lack of intensity, but he did point out that only Fernandes looked to be trying to score a winner.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"We lost games here and we drew games here. We drew big games and sometimes what would be considered lesser games, but I don't think we drew or lost games in that way.",
      "\"I think we'd throw the kitchen sink at it, you'd see both full-backs flying forward, centre-backs in the box, goalkeeper coming up for corners.",

      "\"I have to say it does look like Bruno does that. At the end, it seemed like he was trying to get everywhere. I had to see that little bit of panic in him that we can't draw this game. I don't see it in enough of the others.",
      "\"They're walking towards throw-ins and taking things easy, that can't be what it is. I don't know what to say other than they are what they are.",

      "\"Ruben Amorim, you can see it in his eyes, a frown, he'll be absolutely livid but also gutted that his team can't deliver at the point where he needs them to.\"",
      "After the game, Ruben Amorim spoke on a number of topics and was far from pleased by some questions in his press conference.",
      "When asked if United were going backwards, he said: \"It's not going backwards. The results are going backwards. We had some moments. That can happen.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Arsenal are still hot favourites despite losing at Aston Villa, while the silliness literally everywhere else sees a mid-table madness in which three points separate fourth from 12th, and newly promoted Sunderland sat looking down on half of the Big Six a third of the way through the season, just like everyone predicted.",
      "Manchester United’s brief redemption took Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, but he’s back among the leading contenders after Vitor Pereira was a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have been a different beast under Sean Dyche.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",

      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now nine wins in ten Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",

      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",

      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, though.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",

      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom five have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now, but a win at Wolves on Monday would be handy.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs went to Newcastle – and got a barely deserved draw – this week before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which he really needed.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But , well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, which have gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and combeack draw against Liverpool, but this could still delay the inevitable.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United.",
      "Ruben Amorim insisted “I don’t care” after once again being asked about Kobbie Mainoo’s lack of game time for Man Utd after Scholes’ slam of the Red Devils boss.",

      "Man Utd are thinking about replacing under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim with former Barcelona boss Xavi, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has remarkably hit out at head coach Ruben Amorim, who has “ruined” one of the club’s most talented footballers.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",

Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "Barely a press conference goes by without Amorim being asked about Mainoo’s lack of game time under him in his time at Old Trafford, after the 20-year-old broke into the first team under Erik ten Hag in quite some style and played a key role for England at Euro 2024.",

      "Amorim announced publicly that Mainoo would be competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth this season, leading to the Man Utd midfielder looking for a way out before the summer transfer deadline.",
      "However, Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox managed to persuade Mainoo to fight for his place in Amorim’s side.",

      "After being an unused subsitute in their 1-1 draw against West Ham on Thursday night, Mainoo seems to have made up his mind but The Athletic adds: ‘United are, however, expected to wait until after the African Cup of Nations finishes in the middle of the winter window to make a decision on Mainoo, given the uncertainty of how the tournament will impact Cameroon’s Bryan Mbeumo and the Ivory Coast’s Amad.’",
      "When asked on Thursday if he could understand why Mainoo’s lack of football was a talking point, Amorim replied: “Of course I understand. My job is to answer but I am trying to answer always the same thing. And you ask me always the same thing.",

      "The Red Devils looked to be heading in the right direction when they won three Premier League matches on the bounce in October.",
      "However, Man Utd have won just one of their next five matches to revert to the inconsistent form which has plagued Amorim’s time in charge of the club.",
      "Their 1-1 draw against West Ham on Thursday night means the Red Devils are currently eighth in the Premier League and a couple of points off fourth-placed Chelsea.",
      "Man Utd are fortunate that, aside from Arsenal and Manchester City, there are few teams consistently winning matches with the Red Devils well in contention to get into the European places if they can turn around their form.",

      "The report adds: ‘Although there has been no direct contact yet, both Manchester United and Tottenham are determined that if results do not improve soon, they will speak with Xavi Hernández",
      "‘His profile is appealing because he offers a long-term project, an offensive approach, and a proposal centered around possession, qualities that fit well with what both clubs are looking for.’",
      "Former Scotland international Craig Burley insists that Amorim has not yet shown he can improve Man Utd like Unai Emery and Enzo Maresca have taken Aston Villa and Chelsea to another level.",
      "Speaking about their defeat to Everton and draw against West Ham in recent matches, Burley told ESPN: “If those results had gone their way, that would have been smoke and mirrors. Aston Villa have won something like eight in the trot, something like that.",
      "“And they’ve got a really good manager, and they’ve got a good squad. Haven’t got the best squad, but they’ve really good man, they’ve got a top manager in Unai Emery, right? He’s flexible. He has a clear plan. If you don’t do what Unai Emery wants, then you’re not in the team.",
      "“If United finish seventh or eighth or wherever it is around there, not many people are going to bat an eyelid. I mean, maybe the board will, but I’m just speaking  from the perspective of people who understand the game, if they were to finish around that seventh or eighth position, we’d sit here and say, ‘yeah, yeah, I can see that. I can see that, because that’s kind of where they are.’",
      "“But my point is, that’s not good enough for a club of that size and a club that has spent that amount of money and a manager who’s been brought in to improve the team.",
      "“We talk about improving a team. You talk about Unai Emery at Aston Villa. You talk about, although they had a bad result at Leeds, Enzo Maresca has certainly taken this Chelsea side to another level, whatever level that’s going to be at the end of it remains to be seen.",
      "“But the way they played against Arsenal, they’ve shown they can play better football, and there are several managers like that within the league.",
      "“Ruben Amorim has yet to show, if we’re being honest about it, he has yet to show that he’s got the ability to take United to another level, the level that they need to be back in amongst the elite. And so that, for me, that piles a lot of pressure onto the manager.”",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",

      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firmed up again. Then they switched off in the second half against Manchester United, with Joshua Zirkzee’s strike from an acute angle (0.03 xG) a bad look on the England keeper. But then came another clean sheet against Burnley.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (77.8%).",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season. Remarkably, conceding four against Aston Villa was bang on the PSxG for that game.",
      "",
      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheet v Bournemouth was more like it.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive. Back to being solid at Palace and it wasn’t his fault v West Ham.",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder.",
      "",
      "Came back into the Villa team for the Brighton game after Martinez suffered an injury in the warm-up. Conceding three goals was sub-optimal.",

      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton. The clean sheet v Wolves was very, very welcome.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1. He was rather more tested v Brentford.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses. Saved a penalty against Leeds only to see the rebound dispatched. Conceded four goals v Fulham and now looks a little lost.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa. But he was absolutely culpable v Forest.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have lost one in eight. Coincidence?",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five v Manchester City.",

Just look at how well the promoted teams can hold their own. Even Burnley – are you confident of your team going to Turf Moor and getting 3 points? Because I sure as shit am not!",
      "Oh you want some evidence and not just anecdotal ramblings of a mad man, you bunch of pedants? Look at how well English teams have been doing in Europe recently. Last season all 4 made it out of the group stages in the CL, with Arsenal and Villa going relatively deep. Spurs and Utd reached the final of the EL (can’t remember who won), and Chelsea breezed through the EC and won it. This season, Arsenal are flying in the CL with the other 4 teams in with a strong chance of qualifying; the same for the teams in the lesser comps (although Palace could be doing better to be fair).",

However, something that has been nagging at me for years is that the main influence on the league is actually the standard of manager (or coaches) and the evolution of tactics.",

Or did the better coaches follow the better players or vice versa, like the old chicken and egg conundrum. But the influx of better coaches (typically foreign – they took our jobs Randy!) and ideas has really ramped up the standard of the league, and improved domestic coaching too.",

Currently there’s only 3 genuinely weak teams, but if you’re slightly off it against anyone else particularly away from home you’re liable to get turned over no matter who you are and no matter what perch you’ve toppled off.",

      "Manchester United can smell the Champions League places, but they’re not going to finish in the top five of the Premier League if they don’t a) make some signings in January and b) win more than one game in a row.",
      "Will their finances allow a big spending spree in the winter transfer window? Probably not. Are we going to create a scenario where Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos spend around £250million? Yes. Absolutely.",
      "These five transfers would make for a perfect January for Manchester United and Ruben Amorim, with a Liverpool hijack, Vinicius Junior and Mason Greenwood all thrown into the equation.",
      "",
      "It’s obvious that Manchester United need and want to sign a new central midfielder. The question is: who?",
      "If this was Career Mode or Football Manager, it would be one or two of Federico Valverde, Sandro Tonali, Declan Rice, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong or Moises Caicedo. But this is the real world. And in the real world, it’s going to be Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton. Which is still absolutely fine, by the way.",
      "Ruben Amorim is never shifting from his beloved 3-4-2-1 formation, so looking at previously successful English clubs operating in the same way, the Red Devils need a player like Nemanja Matic, N’Golo Kante or Jorginho. So it really isn’t all that simple. The best option, that also happens to be realistic, is Anderson.",
      "The Nottingham Forest star’s 2025/26 statistics put him up there as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League. He has made 24 key passes (6th), 802 passes (5th), 111 progressive passes (1st), 111 ball recoveries (1st), 35 tackles (9th), 14 interceptions (23rd), won 29 fouls (2nd), and only received two yellow cards. And in Forest’s defeat to Brighton, Anderson became the first player in the last 10 Premier League seasons to record 100+ touches, 10+ ball recoveries, 10+ duels won, 5+ key passes and 5+ successful dribbles.",
      "He might not be Kante, but he could be Matic, and we’re confident he can become better than Jorginho, if he isn’t already.",
      "It would be a statement signing for Manchester United and there isn’t a better option out there among the players who would actually want to join. The fact he can do absolutely everything and has the engine to play midfield on his own makes him perfect for Amorim’s system. The only issue is the price. In January, you’re looking at £100m. In the summer, maybe closer to £80m. Better, but still very pricey. For England’s No.6, though? Probably worth it…",
      "",
      "Not only would Guehi massively improve United and walk straight in as a leader and their best defender, but signing him means Liverpool don’t, which is probably top of the list of positives, next to a blank column of negatives.",
      "There isn’t really much more to say about it. He would be an absolutely outstanding signing, but the odds are heavily stacked against United.",
      "Liverpool put all the groundwork into signing Guehi last summer and were hours away from getting it done, putting them comfortably ahead of the Red Devils in the race. He can negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from January 1, which gives Real Madrid a big advantage. They love a free transfer, need a centre-back and have dropped their interest in Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.",
      "But it’s still in United’s hands if they want it to be. Offer Palace £30m and they might struggle to reject it, considering he’s in the final six months of his deal. Just make a sufficient offer well before the deadline, lads.",
      "Liverpool are also in a much worse place than they were when Guehi agreed to join. They were reigning champions – and still are, technically – and looked set to dominate England and Europe after spending over £420m. Now they are mid-table, out of the title picture, and on an abysmal run of form. It’s not the place to be for someone like Guehi, though he could help fix the problem.",
      "And does Guehi even want to leave England? You’d have to ask him. Some players are reluctant to go abroad, especially if a top English club is offering a fat contract and guaranteed minutes. Real Madrid is the exception, though. You don’t turn down Real Madrid.",
      "",
      "It would be audacious to even try, and the noise surrounding Vinicius‘ situation at Real Madrid is probably a ploy to get a better contract. When he realises his only options are Manchester United or Saudi Arabia, he’ll likely return to Florentino Perez with his tail between his legs.",
      "But let’s say he actually does want to leave and refuses to renew. United would actually stand a chance. They are still, in the eyes of many, the biggest club in the world. They are an institution. Players are addicted to the idea of being ‘the one’ who finally fixes them after years of chaos.",
      "Out of all the big names United could chase, Vinicius would be the most ambitious and exciting. Leaving Real Madrid at 25, after being Ballon d’Or runner-up two years earlier, is not a normal career move. Joining United might be career suicide, but if anyone who is remotely gettable can single-handedly fix them, it’s Vinicius.",
      "",
      "Signing Anderson or Wharton, Guehi, and Vinicius is impossible without a significant sale or two. The best sale for everyone is Ugarte. Casemiro could work if the right offer arrives, but he’s actually been pretty good since Ruben Amorim came in. You could argue he’s been the Portuguese coach’s biggest success story so far. Then there’s Kobbie Mainoo, who is a ‘break glass in case of emergency’ pure profit option.",
      "Truth be told, only Saudi Arabia can bail Manchester United out when it comes to Ugarte. No Champions League contender will want him after back-to-back disappointing spells at two giant clubs. Sporting might want to re-sign him, but for nowhere near the £50m United paid Paris Saint-Germain in August 2023. That leaves the filthy-rich Saudis, who will surely be interested in a big name like Ugarte, who is still only 24.",
      "It’s unrealistic, but not completely delusional. And United will only sanction his sale if they’ve already signed a new midfielder, or have one lined up.",
      "The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules will probably still punish United anyway, but they can at least tell supporters they lived and enjoyed the dream while it lasted.",
      "",
      "Another significant windfall could come via the sale of Mason Greenwood from Marseille.",
      "Reports suggested United wanted to reintegrate Greenwood after his charges of attempted rape and assault were dropped, but after putting the feelers out, fan backlash was fierce. They quickly U-turned and pretended they always wanted to sell him. After a year on loan at Getafe, he joined Marseille for £26.7m, which was a low fee, but United’s hands were tied. In an uncharacteristically savvy move, they included a big sell-on clause, believed to be 50%.",
      "Transfermarkt says the 24-year-old is worth around £35m, but 10 goals and three assists in Ligue 1 this season, coupled with his potential and previous seasons, suggests he will go for much more – perhaps around £60m, giving United £30m.",
      "And when Greenwood does leave Marseille, Manchester United will finally be able to close a dark chapter.",
      "READ NEXT: Top 10 transfer flops of the season: Liverpool trio shamed as Premier League clubs waste £500m",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could be set for a significant windfall as an ‘offer’ has been submitted for Marseille forward Mason Greenwood.",
      "Man Utd are ready to splash out on one of two Real Madrid players in the summer, while they want Antoine Semenyo in January, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are set to break their transfer record next summer on one of two players as they look to bring in a new midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly decided to break the £100m barrier on their next addition, though four stars may need to leave first.",

      "The now honorary president of Bayern Munich called Newcastle’s £69m signing of Nick Woltemade “completely crazy”, suggested their record-breaking £13m loan deal of Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea was in fact good business, and can barely open his mouth without saying something salty about Liverpool landing Florian Wirtz ahead of the Bundesliga giants, most recently exposing Arne Slot’s “broken promise” over the playmaker’s shirt number.",
      "He’s a 73-year-old man struggling to come to terms with the Premier League’s gold-laden hands reaching out into a market that Bayern have cornered for decades, plundering the cream of the crop from the Bundesliga that they have historically hoovered up to dominate that division to the tune of 20 titles this century.",

      "Harry Kane to Chelsea\nA huge long shot for so many reasons, most of which are amusingly listed by the nameless ‘5 elite reporters’ working on the now infamous X account who got one thing right once, were credited by David Ornstein, and are now further buoyed to treat things overheard in a pub or proclaimed by an Uber driver as genuine transfer news.",
      "‘Kane’s age, his hefty wages, and the length of his contract are all hurdles,’ they admit, but insist the Tottenham legend (another ‘hurdle’ they didn’t consider) is Enzo Maresca’s ‘dream target’ who can be ‘the difference-maker in Chelsea’s quest for the Premier League and Champions League titles’.",
      "",
      "Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich\nAfter insisting Bayern only actually paid £11.8m as Jackson and his agent paid the rest, which is definitely actually a very good deal for a striker that would likely cost roughly £1m per goal based on his past goalscoring antics, Hoeness went on to explain why the conditions required to trigger the further £56m to make his loan deal permanent would “never” be met.",
      "“The big money only has to be paid if he starts 40 games. He never does that.”",
      "With just five starts to his name it doesn’t look hugely likely that clause will be met, but a Harry Kane injury or January move could do the trick.",
      "",
      "Michael Olise to Arsenal\nQuite why Arsenal are ‘prepared to submit a record-breaking offer close to €150m (£131m)’ for a guy who’s played 173 games in his career on the right wing when they already have Bukayo Saka and have just signed a very serviceable back-up in Noni Madueke, over signing someone for the left wing, where Olise has played just nine times, isn’t entirely clear.",
      "But we’re not here to question the validity of Fichajes’ claims, we’re here to imagine the steam cascading from Hoeness’ ears when Arsenal sign Bayern’s most valuable player just because they can.",
      "",
      "Lennart Karl to Manchester City\n“It’s like Monopoly: move forward to Schlossallee [the German Mayfair], then some sheikh will come along and then you can buy,” Hoeness said during his rant on Newcastle pinching Woltemade from under their noses.",

      "Manchester United are running out of turning points.",
      "They can’t keep taking one step forward and then two steps back, and that’s the incredibly unsexy dance they performed once again in their 1-1 draw at home to West Ham after beating Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "That was a huge win, an unexpected win, against a very good team. They had to back that up with another win against a pretty poor one. Alas, they didn’t.",
      "Ruben Amorim should be criticised for his substitutions, which ultimately cost them victory on Thursday night. He even managed to spark debate with his starting XI.",
      "The Manchester United head coach made the bold call to hand young defender Ayden Heaven his first start of the season, with Matthijs de Ligt – the club’s player of the month – out due to a minor injury. Heaven didn’t come in for De Ligt, but for Leny Yoro, whose dropping to the bench was a “tactical” decision.",
      "Heaven needed to settle quickly, and he did the opposite, smashing into Jarrod Bowen with a slide tackle and receiving a yellow card after only eight minutes. Not ideal, but it clearly didn’t rattle him because he didn’t have a poor first half. Still, he evidently wasn’t good enough in Amorim’s eyes as he was substituted at half-time for Yoro, with the booking clearly concerning the Portuguese.",
      "Heaven starting on Thursday reaffirmed what we already knew: Kobbie Mainoo is in Man United exile.",
      "After emerging as one of the club’s best players under Erik ten Hag, becoming an England regular and starting in the final of Euro 2024, Mainoo can’t get a kick anymore, and a January sale is looking more likely with every passing week.",
      "Another appearance on the bench while Heaven was in the starting XI left Mainoo in worrying company with Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martínez and Tyrell Malacia as United’s only first-team players yet to start in the Premier League this season. If you were unsure, that’s their third-choice goalkeeper, a guy who has been injured all season, and someone who was in Amorim’s pre-season bomb squad.",
      "While his standing in the Red Devils’ squad hierarchy is striking, it’s not like he’d have transformed a cautious United performance.",
      "Amorim has said that he’s competing for a starting spot with club captain and best player Bruno Fernandes, and from the minor minutes we’ve seen of them together, it actually makes sense. But for Mainoo, it’s a horrible situation; Fernandes is literally undroppable. His form needs to fall off a cliff to be benched, and he’s only missed nine Premier League games in five full seasons, largely due to suspension.",
      "Casemiro has also been pretty good in midfield for the Red Devils and is Amorim’s biggest success story. He has been criticised for his rashness in the past, but he is more disciplined in that position than Mainoo.",
      "Man United fans are desperate to see Mainoo play more because they love him and he’s an academy graduate with incredible potential, but during a disappointing performance against West Ham, there can’t have been many people watching and thinking the game was crying out for him.",
      "Their performance made for a very dull first half at Old Trafford, highlighted largely by Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s defensive contributions.",
      "The first genuine moment of quality came from Alphonse Areola, who acrobatically tipped Bryan Mbeumo’s cross-cum-shot over the bar, denying United another set-piece goal that would have seen them overtake Arsenal in that statistic in the 2025/26 Premier League season.",
      "In terms of attacking quality, that was really all she wrote in the opening 45 minutes. There was a brief flurry of shots that could have sparked Ruben Amorim’s men into life; Wan-Bissaka cleared a Joshua Zirkzee header off the line, Matheus Cunha had an overhead kick blocked, and Bruno Fernandes’ scissor volley clipped the post. It wasn’t the shot in the arm United needed, just three shots.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was player of the half, adding an incredible sliding tackle on Cunha in his own box before producing an expertly read headed clearance from a tantalising Fernandes cross.",
      "It was unfortunately much of the same when the game restarted, but in a match between two teams that can be excruciating to watch that was crying out for a goal, we finally got one just before the hour mark, and in fairness, it did improve proceedings.",
      "Diogo Dalot benefited from a bit of luck when Casemiro’s blocked shot fell straight to him, though he still had plenty to do. His first touch was perfect and the finish was that of an experienced No.9, shifting the ball past Wan-Bissaka and in the opposite direction of Areola’s momentum.",
      "Beating West Ham at home was the only acceptable outcome for United, and going up into the Champions League places would’ve been a welcome bonus. But after taking the lead, they didn’t push for a second, and as the second didn’t come and their opponents found an equaliser, Amorim’s substitutions will rightly be criticised.",
      "Patrick Dorgu on for the goalscorer, Manuel Ugarte for Matheus Cunha, and Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee suggested that Amorim thought it had to be a case of holding onto the one-goal lead rather than pressing on against one of the worst teams in the Premier League this year and putting the game to bed.",
      "Ironically, when Nuno Espírito Santo brought on Andy Irving, his first contribution was to instantly take a corner kick that led to Soungoutou Magassa’s 83rd-minute equaliser.",
      "United might feel aggrieved that Wan-Bissaka wasn’t shown the most blatant of second yellow cards you’ll see all season, but the fact of the matter is that they didn’t do nearly enough to win the game. Areola wasn’t tested enough and any half-chance they did get was rashly wasted, like Fernandes’ left-footed volley in the fifth minute of injury time.",
      "There was a serious lack of quality at Old Trafford. It was just a bad game of football. The United players looked dejected at the end, knowing it was an unacceptable performance and that West Ham at home should have been an easy three points.",
      "Questions will be asked about Amorim’s in-game management again. It cost United and epitomises their season so far: one step forward, two steps back. Just when you think they could get back amongst it, they do something stupid. It’s tiring for us, let alone someone who actually goes to the games.",
      "It’s bottom-club Wolves next. Another team in the relegation zone. No matter how poor they are, United can’t relax and act as if the game is won at 1-0. Or, knowing this team, even at 2-0.",
      "Amorim’s substitutions were so negative that they rubbed off on his players, who seemed to think it was game over and that they could just see it out. Nope. West Ham can still punish you. Even Wolves can still punish you.",
      "United can’t become too casual in these fixtures. They cannot follow an impressive win at Palace with a poor draw at home to West Ham. And we can’t keep looking at games and saying afterwards, ‘Well, Amorim will learn from this.’",
      "It’s clear that this team still has a long way to go. They’ve taken a step forward and a step back so many times they no longer have any idea which way they’re facing.",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend card...",
      "Freddie Potts has made a big impression since stepping into the West Ham midfield, adding much needed steel, aggression and tenacity to an area that was lacking under Graham Potter. The midfielder has been fouled eight times in his last four starts and across his last 31 club starts he's averaging 1.8 fouls won per-game.",
      "Only three teams have made more fouls since the start of last season than Brighton, who play a very high-tempo and aggressive game in midfield. Potts to be fouled at least twice at 5/4 with Sky Bet is a tasty prop to attack.",
      "This is usually part of the season where Marco Silva's team find rhythm and are peak performance level. Whilst other teams, like Crystal Palace, are flagging due to fighting on multiple fronts, Silva's team play with an added edge. In the period after the final international break and Boxing Day, Silva has a Premier League win strike-rate of 52 per cent from 19 matches. That's a huge figure for a club with the expectations of Fulham.",
      "One of their wins that has slipped under the radar was their 1-0 win over Sunderland at home. The metrics behind that win were so strong, winning the expected goals battle 2.16-0.17 and posting 24 shots, 18 of which came from inside the box. They dominated a team who have proved to be a very difficult opponent for Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool this season.",
      "And Palace are a team to bet against when the time is right during this hectic period. This is their fifth game in 16 days and Oliver Glasner has made the fewest changes to Premier League starting XI's this season (12). Palace are a fantastic team but this group can't keep going to the well and performing at the highest level. Fulham to win at 8/5 with Sky Bet does the job.",
      "Hold your breath, Wolves fans, this isn't going to be pretty.",
      "Wolves have joint-fewest points (2) after 14 games by any team in a top division season and have lost their last seven Premier League games, going 495 minutes without a goal. Rob Edwards has got the same amount of bounce as throwing a brick on the floor.",
      "But in football, these runs don't last forever. They snap. And when they do, it's often in a fixture where the market has started to write the goal-shy side off.",
      "A six-hour scoring drought isn't a reflection of a team with no threat, it's a reflection of a team due a correction and variance. And there are few defences better suited to gifting opportunities right now than Manchester United's away from home. Since April 1, it's no joke that United have gone 12 away games without a clean sheet, conceding 24 goals - only Bournemouth have conceded more in that period. Also, their expected goals against of 1.72 per 90 is the worst of any ever-present Premier League side during those 12 games.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals is the play at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",

      "Manchester United blew the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League on Thursday when West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford; Roy Keane slammed a 'frightened' performance and questioned the standards of the home side after conceding again from a corner",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 07:27, UK",
      "Roy Keane accused Manchester United of being too \"frightened\" to see out victory over West Ham after blowing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League, and called the performance \"desperate\".",
      "West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford when Soungoutou Magassa's 83rd-minute equaliser cancelled out Diogo Dalot's opening goal.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have only taken 27 points from 20 games at Old Trafford, and only managed one win from their last five in the league - drawing three of those, despite being ahead in each.",
      "\"After they get the goal, you are playing against a team in the bottom three, they take their foot off the gas,\" said Keane. \"Take nothing away from West Ham and they just about deserved the equaliser.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappoint. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"Same old problems. The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group of players? I've watched the games closely, the lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team. There is expectation at this club, you have to deal with that.\"",
      "Keane also questioned the standards of the home side after they switched off from a set-piece to concede the leveller. Since the start of last season, only West Ham themselves (17) have conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (15).",
      "\"The reason you are playing for Manchester United is that you deal with these situations,\" Keane added.",
      "\"If they are anxious, you worry why they are playing for Manchester United and what they are fearful of. Fearful of West Ham, why?\"",
      "\"I don't get it, I don't get the lack of urgency, and the lack of intensity. I don't get the slow play. I don't get the lack of risk in the game.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he's not going back into the changing room saying 'guys, play slowly tonight'. He's saying 'let's get the ball moving quicker, let's run forward, let's play with real threat and vigour'.",
      "\"It doesn't transpire out on the pitch, so I don't know, why does that happen? I've got no understanding.",
      "\"I don't see the actual appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game, and everything you've got, and throw it forward and take risks. They're showing us what they are, the seventh, eighth or ninth team in the league.\"",
      "Defender Diogo Dalot said his side became \"anxious\" after opening the scoring at Old Trafford, and must look at themselves after squandering another lead.",
      "\"We cannot get as anxious as we get. We were a bit more sloppy with the ball in possession. Obviously disappointed with the draw, we had the game there.",
      "\"It's a solution we need to find. In the end, we have to look to ourselves. It's more our fault.\"",
      "It was established far further back than Thursday night that Manchester United lack resolve under pressure. Diogo Dalot says his team-mates are hindered by anxiety. Really, it's just about concentration levels.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have not registered a clean sheet in seven games - since early October. They establish a foothold in games and then inevitably hand it back. They win a game and then suffer a setback in the next. There is no continuity here.",
      "United dominated every attacking metric against inferior West Ham, creating higher xG, landing more shots on target and generating three big chances - two of those were missed. They had 42 touches in the opposition box. That's a staggeringly high amount if the yield is only one goal.",
      "Ultimately, this United team have very little conviction. Amorim bemoaned a lack of second-half control post-match and blamed \"second ball losses\". If you don't compete, or can't compete, for a whole 90 minutes that is what will happen.",

      "United, who lost at home to 10-man Everton in their previous home fixture, do move above Liverpool into eighth but this was a missed opportunity. Nuno Espirito Santo will take the point, his side still among the bottom three but only two points from safety.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (6), Mazraoui (7), Heaven (6), Shaw (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (6), Dalot (7), Cunha (6), Mbeumo (6), Zirkzee (6).\n\n\nSubs: Yoro (6), Dorgu (6), Mount (n/a), Ugarte (n/a), Martinez (n/a).\n\n\nWest Ham: Areola (6), Wan-Bissaka (8), Todibo (7), Mavropanos (7), Diouf (7), Potts (7), Magassa (8), Fernandes (6), Soucek (6), Bowen (7), Wilson (6). \n\n\nSubs: Irving (n/a), Kante (n/a), Kilman (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Soungoutou Magassa.",
      "West Ham, who have now picked up eight points from their last five games under Nuno, showed some attacking intent in the first half an hour of the contest, Casemiro having to slide to block Matheus Fernandes' low shot. But United pushed thereafter.",
      "Alphonse Areola tipped over Bryan Mbeumo's cross-shot, Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line from Joshua Zirkzee and Bruno Fernandes' effort on the follow up shaved the post. United finished the first half with a season-high 25 touches in the opposition box.",
      "Ayden Heaven, making his first start since the debacle against Grimsby, was withdrawn at half-time having picked up an early booking, but the United boss maintained his 3-4-3 structure, of course. And it was his left wing-back of all people who opened the scoring.",
      "Wandering into the box unmarked, the ball fell kindly to Dalot and the Portuguese defender slammed the ball into the net to lift the mood inside Old Trafford. But the fact that they were unable to capitalise on it highlighted why Amorim's team still frustrate.",
      "Andy Irving swung in a corner with his first touch after coming on, Jarrod Bowen won the flick on ahead of Fernandes and though Noussair Mazraoui cleared off the line, Magassa's slotted away the rebound. West Ham even threatened to score a winner.",
      "Since Nuno Espirito Santo’s first game in charge of West Ham, only Aston Villa (9) have won more Premier League points from losing positions than the Hammers (8).",
      "That would have been pushing it but they do not look like a team that will be facing relegation under Nuno in the spring. Where Amorim's United find themselves is less clear. Champions League qualification is a possibility. But not with this sloppiness.",
      "\"The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group players? I've watched the games closely. The lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team.",
      "\"Tonight, you give United praise before the game and they can go fifth. This team is not ready to go fifth. Fifth in the league!",
      "\"They've got Wolves next, they are one of the worst teams I've ever seen in the Premier League. Let's see.",
      "\"I don't get how the players or manager don't sense it. That there could be a twist. They have to do better than that.\"",
      "We had good moments and we lost a little bit of control after the goal.",
      "\"We should have closed the game when we scored the first one.",
      "\"The game was in control, we knew it. Any set pieces can be a problem. We couldn't maintain the ball after the goal.",
      "\"Losing second balls, running with the ball, they were winning the first ball. We can control that kind of game. We should be better with the ball after the first goal.",
      "\"The characteristics with the players inside the box were sometimes not enough.\"",
      "\"It's important because it's a tough place to come. We are proud that we achieved something. It could have been three [points].",
      "\"We are trying to build urgency with results, looking for a better performance.\"",
      "\"I thought all the game, especially second half, we created many problems for Man Utd.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
