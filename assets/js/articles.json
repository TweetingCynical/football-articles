      "After a long and arduous international break, the Premier League is back this weekend – and there are plenty of juicy narratives to enjoy alongside the football.",
      "England did give us something to snap out of the boredom of the international break by smashing five goals past Serbia on Tuesday night, but most fans have been desperate for the return of club football after two weeks in the wilderness.",
      "The end of the summer transfer window coming on the eve of the break has only served to build the excitement for game week four, with many debuts coming this weekend. The standout fixture undoubtedly comes at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, when the out-of-form Manchester City host Manchester United – a side that recently lost to Grimsby – but there is more to look out for too.",
      "Alexander Isak spent all summer desperately trying to force through a transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool. After lots of frustration, accusations and counter-accusations, he got his wish on transfer deadline day, with a £125million move going through. Now he has to deliver.",
      "The problem for Isak is that he is lacking match sharpness, having barely trained in the final months as a Newcastle player. “Since he only had three training sessions and no pre-season and of course no match time, the risk was too great to use him today,” Sweden manager Jon Dahl Tomasson said last week after he sat out of a 2-2 draw with Slovenia.",
      "Liverpool have posted clips of Isak finding the back of the net in training, but it will likely take time for the Premier League’s record signing to get back to his level. Expect Arne Slot to start him from the bench against Burnley.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo became the first managerial sacking of the season during the break after falling out with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis and recruitment chief Edu Gaspar. In came Ange Postecoglou and what promises to be a required viewing for the next few weeks.",
      "Postecoglou is the tactical antithesis of Nuno, his non-negotiable attacking instincts replacing his predecessor’s pragmatism overnight. Forest have lots of good players, but how will they cope with such a handbrake turn of an appointment?",
      "Tottenham finished 17th under Postecoglou last season, so one thing we know is that there will be difficult days. They start away at Arsenal this weekend in what promises to be box-office viewing.",
      "The Manchester Derby is on Sunday afternoon and there will likely be two new goalkeepers between the posts at the Etihad.",
      "City have swapped Ederson for Gianluigi Donnarumma, who is expected to usurp James Trafford in goal, while United have waved goodbye to Andre Onana – exiled to Trabzonspor on loan – after the £18m signing of Senne Lammens.",
      "The 23-year-old Belgian may get the nod ahead of the unconvincing Altay Bayindir for what could be a baptism on fire. However, it could be a good time to play City, who are reeling after back-to-back defeats against Spurs and Brighton in the league.",
      "Nevertheless, with Donnarumma no stranger to massive matches, the odds would favour Lammens being the one to drop a clanger.",
      "Isak is finally gone. Eddie Howe will no longer have to answer questions about his wantaway striker. Now the focus turns to the new arrivals Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa.",
      "There is the potential for a classic little and large strike partnership, although Newcastle’s usual 4-3-3 shape suggests it is more likely to be one or the other. The Magpies spent big to land the £69m Woltemade and £55m Wissa and those fees – however inflated due to circumstances – come with expectation.",
      "The service should be good at St James’ Park, where Howe has a tremendous midfield three and exciting wingers, so chances should come their way as Newcastle host Wolves, who will come armed with Jorgen Strand Larsen – a player who they saw two major bids rejected for.",
      "Everton host Aston Villa on Saturday in their second Premier League game at Hill Dickinson Stadium, who already have a new hero. Jack Grealish has won near-universal approval as a reborn superstar since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City and can provide the template for Jadon Sancho, who is hoping to do something similar at Villa after escaping Manchester United once more.",
      "Grealish already has four assists in three league games for Everton and is feeling good after just celebrating his 30th birthday (hopefully not too heavily). He has made it plain that he wants to be in Thomas Tuchel’s squad for the 2026 World Cup, so will need to continue on a similar path to make that dream a reality.",
      "Sancho will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of fellow United exile Marcus Rashford by resparking his career at Villa. He showed in patches how talented he is at Chelsea last season, but can he sustain it?",
      "Marc Guehi was furious after his deadline-day transfer to Liverpool collapsed at the last-minute due to a change of heart by Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish. In the heat of the aftermath, there were suggestions he could step down as Palace captain having been so annoyed by what he saw as punishment for his own professionalism.",
      "The centre-back scored for England against Serbia and now returns to his club, who host Sunderland on Saturday. Guehi will no doubt just get on with his job, but speculation will be a continuous part of his life in the lead up to the January transfer window.",
      "Palace manager Oliver Glasner threatened to resign if Guehi was sold. He has got his way and now needs to make the most of him while he’s still there.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are all in on Ruben Amorim and the impending departure of Andre Onana proves it. That's the opinion of United legend Rio Ferdinand, who's glad to see the club backing their manager's decisions.",
      "Amorim made a 'big statement' by dropping Onana, 29, at the beginning of the season, installing Altay Bayindir as his new first-choice goalkeeper. But following Bayindir's string of mistakes in the Premier League, United decided to bring in a new goalkeeper on transfer deadline day, hoping to solve their problems once and for all.",
      "Senne Lammens arrived from Royal Antwerp, as the Red Devils agreed to pay an initial £18.2million plus £3.5million in potential add-ons. In the wake of Lammens' arrival, Onana has decided to leave.",
      "The Cameroon international is due to land in Turkey within the next 24 hours to finalise a season-long loan to Trabzonspor. According to Ferdinand, the way things have panned out is sufficient evidence that the Old Trafford hierarchy fully support Amorim.",
      "\"I was happy that the manager is being able to make his mind up on things and the recruitment team are executing behind that,\" Ferdinand told the Mail. \"They are backing the manager.",
      "\"If people were thinking there were any doubts about the club backing the manager or Amorim being at the football club, it's only going to be his decision whether Onana stays or Lammens comes in. It's a great sign in that respect.",
      "\"Whether you think Onana should have stayed or not is irrelevant. The manager has made his mind up. He played Bayindir early on and said he's in because of football reasons. That was a big statement from the manager and his intentions of what he wanted to do with Onana.\"",
      "Ferdinand went on to say that United have done 'magnificently well' this summer to offload the vast majority of players who aren't part of Amorim's plans. \"In years gone by, say we wanted six players to leave the football club - Onana being one of them - I would argue that minimum three to four of them would have stayed,\" the former defender explained.",
      "\"That wouldn't have helped anybody, the player or the club. As important as the ones that came in and upped the levels, it was as important to get out the players who were deemed not right for the club for whatever reason.",
      "\"They've done magnificently well. Yes, they are only loans, most of them, but to clear the decks of those players was as powerful as bringing in good players.\"",

      "Gary Neville has revealed how he has lost a significant amount of money after a failed pension investment. And former Manchester United team-mate Roy Keane sympathised by acknowledging his own monetary missteps during his career.",
      "The comments came in response to a recent BBC documentary, 'Football's Financial Shame: The Story of the V11'. The show uncovered how a group of footballers who rose to prominence in the 1990s and 2000s, including Danny Murphy, Brian Deane and Rod Wallace, felt they were the victims of financial abuse after investing with Kingsbridge Asset Management.",
      "After watching the programme, Neville relayed his own experience in being let down after a friend's tip-off led him astray. And Keane, 54, has urged today's footballers to \"get a good accountant\" to look after their financial affairs before placing too much trust in someone with their own interests.",
      "\"I've been able to withstand it, but I got advised from a player to invest in a pension, and move my PFA pension into this different pension,\" said Neville on the Stick to Football podcast. \"Because I was frustrated by the PFA pension, because it was just stuck there [and] wasn't doing anything.",
      "\"I was quite entrepreneurial [and] thought, 'Okay, is there another pension I could go to?' So this player came up to me and said invest in this pension. I'm not talking any player, a player I really trusted. I put my money in this pension, where you could actually then go and invest in commercial property, [which] means you can actually see some benefit at least.",
      "\"The whole thing - [this was] about 10 years ago - locked up to this day. So I've got three properties I can't even touch, can't go in, can't get any money out of. I've lost all the money in it.\"",
      "It was revealed in 2022 that United legends Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand were part of a footballer group that lost £25million after investing with Kingsbridge. However, allegations against the firm ran by David McKee and Kevin McMenamin, who deny any wrongdoing, date back years prior.",
      "Upon being probed for more information by Arsenal icon Ian Wright, Neville explained the trustees are in control of the money. Keane sympathised with those who had lost out.",
      "\"I think all of us will have stories,\" he added. \"I've gone into one or two things [and] lost a lot, a lot of money. Again, people you trust. That's why I go back to it, any young sportsperson, get a good accountant!\"",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher echoed that same sentiment and joined the chorus by suggesting he too had lost out in the past. However, he suggested athletes should stick to what they know without getting involved in affairs outside their wheelhouse.",
      "Of course, it hasn't all been bad for Neville, who has been celebrated for his business acumen over the years and is estimated to be worth tens of millions. The former England full-back is a part-owner in two Manchester hotels, the Stock Exchange and Hotel Football, and also has his own production company.",
      "Neville was even featured as an honorary Dragon on several episodes of Dragons' Den in 2024, recognising his entrepreneurial spirit. As for Keane, his work ethic has clearly rubbed off on his children after daughter Caragh debuted her superfoods brand in response to being diagnosed with lupus.",

      "Kai Rooney has been shooting up the ladder at Manchester United, with the aim of following in his dad's footsteps at Old Trafford. The 15-year-old is the son of Red Devils icon Wayne Rooney, who won a multitude of major trophy at the club during his legendary career.",
      "He was recently called up to United's under-19s squad after impressing in the under-18s, scoring a heroic volley that attracted the attention of the more senior squads. The eldest son of Wayne and Coleen joined the United academy in 2016, and has been a force to be reckoned with on the pitch.",
      "The young right-winger has only made two appearances in the U18 Premier League, scoring one goal in 35 minutes of playing time - but he did score 56 goals in one season for the youth set-up. However, any hope of a sharper ascent to the top will be paused for now, as he'll be spending some time out of action.",
      "This is thanks to an unknown leg injury that Kai recently sustained. The severity of the leg issue or how long it will stop him playing is unclear, but his own feelings suggest it may be a while before he steps foot onto the pitch again.",
      "He uploaded a mirror selfie where a protective boot can be seen on his right foot, alongside the caption \"life can't get worse\" with a crying emoji. While Rooney fans will be saddened by the news, Kai's parents, Wayne and Coleen, will likely be supporting him well given the insider knowledge his father has of dealing with injuries while playing at a top level.",
      "Despite Wayne being a Premier League icon and the perfect role model for his son, it was revealed that he is actually banned from attending his child's matches. This rule wasn't put into place by the club or any manager, but rather by Kai himself, as explained by Coleen during her stint on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! last year.",
      "During her time in the jungle, the 39-year-old discussed her son's difficult yet selfless choice with her fellow campmates and how it was made to benefit his career in the long run. Coleen said: \"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out.",
      "\"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game. How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?'",
      "\"Adults, it's different, you could speak to them, so he just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "However, it isn't just Wayne's presence that affects Kai while he is playing, as the 15-year-old often dodges verbal abuse from opposition players regarding his dad. During an appearance on the Stick to Football podcast, Coleen recalled a moment where Kai missed a penalty in a tournament - and blamed it on his dad.",
      "She said: \"A few years ago, I remember my son Kai took a penalty at St George’s Park, where we were for a tournament. It went to penalties, Kai stepped up and just skied it.",
      "\"Afterwards I asked him how he could take a penalty like that, and he told me he was just fuming as the goalkeeper was saying, 'Your dad’s s***', and he got dead angry.",
      "\"It doesn’t happen to him very often, but it did then, and you can see in some games where they give you a little push. He’s strong-minded though and usually shrugs it off.\"",
      "While it is clear that being the son of such a Premier League powerhouse could be a lot of pressure for a teenage football starlet, Kai has proven in recent times that he is able to handle it with ease. It's likely he'll be itching to return from injury and continue on in the same path he has carved out so far.",
      "United fans will assume that if his father's achievements are anything to go by in terms of premonitions, then they have a real talent on their hands in the Carrington academy.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "If Ruben Amorim thought his goalkeeping issues would be solved by sending Andre Onana out on loan, he would be advised to think again. Error-prone Onana flew from Paris to Trabzon to complete his season-long loan move from Manchester United to Trabzonspor on Thursday, after two lamentable seasons at Old Trafford",
      "When it comes to costly flops at United in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, Onana is up there with the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Jadon Sancho and Antony, all of whom have permanent residency in the Old Trafford hall of shame.",
      "United bought Onana from Inter Milan for £47million, despite him having been a free agent a year earlier at Ajax. Due diligence and shrewd investment are, it seems, still hard to come by in the corridors of power at United.",
      "Onana's two years as United's No.1 were marked with high-profile blunders, his long overdue departure a relief for players and fans who had known for some time he was more of a liability than an asset.",
      "But even with Onana now out of the picture, Amorim still faces a conundrum between the posts, in terms of who to pick in goal for Sunday's Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium – Altay Bayindir or new signing Senne Lammens.",
      "Throwing £18.2million deadline day signing Lammens into the heat of a Manchester derby for his Premier League debut is a risky move, one sources close to Amorim say the United head coach is unlikely to make.",
      "If Amorim did pick Lammens on Sunday and the 23-year-old keeper were to make a mistake, the United boss would be criticised for not giving him time to settle in and adapt, after just a handful of training sessions.",
      "Yet Bayindir, 27, has not looked convincing this season and was guilty of errors against Arsenal and Burnley. But he will know what to expect at City, given his greater experience, in contrast to Lammens.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't, whoever ultimately gets the nod on Sunday. Yet one thing is certain and that is that Lammens is viewed as United's No.1 keeper in the years ahead.",
      "United sources have disclosed that he was not identified and signed with the expectation that he would go straight into the starting line-up, but his potential was recognised amid a belief he can grow into the role long-term.",
      "The major strength Lammens brings is his shot-stopping ability. No keeper across Europe's top 10 leagues has saved more penalties – five from seven faced – than the Belgium Under-21 star since the start of last season.",
      "Lammens is also arguably stronger in the air than Bayindir and more comfortable in congested areas, when teams try to target the opposition goalkeeper, blocking him from trying to come for the ball. Lammens stopped 44 crosses last season, more than any other keeper in Belgium, underlining his confidence in coming out for the ball.",
      "There would appear to be many long-term positives from United's acquisition of Lammens and the offloading of Onana, but that does not provide an immediate solution to Amorim's problems.",
      "Establishing a recognised No.1, as United had in the past with Peter Schmeichel, Edwin van der Sar and David De Gea, all of whom became club legends, will be the first step towards doing that.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "As we look ahead to Sunday's Manchester derby, both camps have a goalkeeping dilemma. Both Mancunian clubs brought in new shot-stoppers on transfer deadline day, signalling their shared uncertainty between the posts.",
      "Manchester City signed Gianluigi Donnarumma after striking a £27million deal with Paris Saint-Germain, who decided to cut their losses when the Italian failed to agree a new contract. Over at Manchester United, Senne Lammens arrived for an initial £18.2million plus £3.5million in potential add-ons.",
      "Pep Guardiola will almost certainly install 26-year-old Donnarumma as his new No.1 but for Ruben Amorim, he's got a decision to make. Lammens, 23, comes to the Premier League with everything still to prove, having made his name at Royal Antwerp and impressed Red Devils scouts.",
      "United decided to sign a new goalkeeper in light of Altay Bayindir's shaky start to the season. That was after Amorim made the bold call to put his faith in the Turkey international and drop Andre Onana, who's now set to join Turkish side Trabzonspor on a season-long loan.",
      "So, does Amorim chuck Lammens into a baptism of fire at the Etihad? Does he stick with Bayindir? Or could veteran Tom Heaton even be called upon?",
      "I was at Old Trafford for Andre Onana's Premier League debut. It was obvious from that night what a liability he would become and although he avoided giving away what was the most obvious penalty in history, the dye was cast.",
      "Onana was never able to shrug off that reputation and his confidence was immediately shot. Amorim will be desperate for that not to happen to Lammens, who would face a daunting baptism of fire against City.",
      "But if the alternative is Bayindir, the United boss has no choice to make. If Lammens was the choice over Emi Martinez - he has to be ready straight away.",
      "Bayindir wouldn't start for any other Premier League team. Lammens should prove to be significantly better, but it will still be a nervy Sunday for the debutant.",
      "Which goalkeeper would you start? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "It's sink or swim for anyone who plays in goal for Manchester United. Bayindir has already sunk and Heaton has had his chance - so why not give the new boy a go?",
      "Bayindir has been a disaster for United and doesn't even start for Turkey, so he is a no-go as far as I'm concerned. Senne Lammens, meanwhile, hasn't been backed by too many people either.",
      "Many pundits have claimed he is too inexperienced for arguably the most pressurised goalkeeping position in world football. But United have just spent £18m on him and opted to sign him instead of Emiliano Martinez, so they must be pretty confident in their purchase.",
      "We'll never know how good Lammens is until we see him in action against the best teams, so Ruben Amorim should throw him into the deep end. Some of the best goalkeepers have started shaky and grown with confidence (looking at you, David de Gea).",
      "It surely can't get worse than Andre Onana and Bayindir… can it?",
      "Manchester United have got themselves into a mess of their own making in the goalkeeping department and it is a far from ideal situation this weekend.",
      "While Pep Guardiola will likely have no gripes about throwing Gianluigi Donnarumma into the firing line, given his vast experience of big games, the same can't be said of Ruben Amorim and Senne Lammens, who is 23 and only has played in Belgium (where he isn't considered one of the three best 'keepers in the country).",
      "Tom Heaton is out of the question, so that leaves Altay Bayindir as the most sensible pick in my mind. The Turkey international hasn't been convincing at all, but at least he has trained and played with United's back line before.",
      "His real weakness has come at set pieces and - in theory at least - that isn't one of Man City's big strengths. For me, Bayindir gets the nod simply by default due to the nature of the game and the lack of time on the training ground since deadline day.",
      "For me, it's simple: Senne Lammens should be straight in. Altay Bayindir has already cost United enough points this season and if the Red Devils really believe that Lammens was a better buy than Emiliano Martinez, they should trust him on a big stage like the Etihad two weeks on from his deadline-day move.",
      "Bayindir felt like a bizarre buy from United; he wasn't highly rated at Fenerbahce and Erik ten Hag was reluctant to play him regardless of the competition. I'm glad he got his moment at Arsenal in the FA Cup last season after putting together an excellent string of saves, and he looks a great character to have in the squad, but Bayindir should be watching from the bench on Sunday.",

      "Manchester United's Manuel Ugarte has been dubbed a 'damp squib' by former Chelsea and Celtic ace Craig Burley, who has cast doubt on the Uruguayan international's suitability for Old Trafford.",
      "The ex-Paris Saint-Germain player joined the Red Devils a year ago in a deal potentially worth £50.5 million, but he's yet to make his mark despite being at the club for over a season. Only Leny Yoro commanded a higher fee than Ugarte during Dan Ashworth's summer stint overseeing United's transfers, with the former sporting director stating: \"Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer.",
      "\"He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level. His qualities, experience and passion will be a great complement to our strong group of midfielders.\"",
      "Burley has been far from impressed with what he's seen. The former Scotland international didn't hold back on ESPN, stating: \"Manuel Ugarte is just absolutely nothing. He's just like a wet blanket. Put him in with the kids and even the kids would be going, 'Who the hell is this guy?' Seriously.\"",
      "The 53 year old pundit also had strong views on United's goalkeeping situation. Burley doesn't think Altay Bayindir can continue between the sticks, especially with Andre Onana's expected departure, and believes Senne Lammens could face a tough introduction to the Premier League.",
      "\"He looked the real deal when he was in Italy,\" Burley said of Onana. \"I thought he was going to come in and have a Schmeichel-esque aura about him. Remember he was bossing about Harry Maguire and he had a go at him.",
      "\"If this young lad from Belgium comes in and is flapping about all over the place, it's going to be a mess isn't it? Altay Bayindir, they can't play him. He might be okay at shotstopping but he's absolutely useless at balls into the box.",
      "\"The lad who has come in [Lammens] needs to be able to communicate, marshal a back four, be good with the ball at his feet, make saves and he needs to have authority and make a statement when teams are rattling the ball into the box. That is what every team will do now, they're going to pile it on into this goalkeeper.",
      "\"He's going to sink or swim. They went halfway down the road to Martinez at Villa and I think that would have been the perfect scenario because he's got arrogance. But they've gone the other route again and we've no idea how the young lad is going to handle the scenario.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Nicky Butt has warned Ruben Amorim that history may repeat itself at Manchester United with Benjamin Sesko, unless he finds him a support player. The Portuguese mastermind is expected to deliver in the Premier League this season after receiving the backing of the board this summer.",
      "The 40-year-old has brought a wealth of top-tier talent to Old Trafford over the past three months, spending more than £200million on the likes of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, as he looks to bounce back from last term's 15th-place finish.",
      "But club legend Butt believes that United fans can't expect £74m man Sesko to hit the ground running in the league right away, given he is still far from a finished product. And the former midfielder, who racked up 387 appearances for the Red Devils between 1992 and 2004, has shared a concern that the Slovenian could suffer a similar fate as Rasmus Hojlund, who has failed to live up to his own £72m price tag since arriving from Atalanta two years ago.",
      "\"He had a couple of players in [Marcus] Rashford and certain other players at the start of it who were out of form and they weren't performing right, so the onus was on him, the young players, to go and score goals. And in a football club that's got the eyes all over the world on them, and that's not performing, it's really difficult.",
      "\"I just hope they're not making the same mistake with this player, because he's only young, had no experience in the Premier League, and I think that's where I would have liked maybe Ollie Watkins or someone coming in to Man United, who's been there, seen it, knows the league, can help a young player.",
      "\"So I hope they don't expect him to come straight into the football club and go and hit the ground running and scoring goals. Certainly, obviously, everyone wants him to do that, but it's a really tough ask to go into that football club and have a young player who has no experience to go in.",
      "\"It's easy when we come through, because when you're coming into a football club that's performing well and has experienced world-class players, and you can come in as a young player, it's so much easier. But when you go into a struggling team with the eyes of the world on them, it's really tough, so it's going to be a tough start to the season for him, I think.\"",
      "While Hojlund showed glimpses of world-class talent during his first season with Manchester United, scoring 10 goals in 30 games, the 22-year-old's form dipped last term. Despite leading the line in 32 outings for the club, Hojlund managed to find the back of the net just four times before his future at the club was cast into speculation.",
      "While the Dane was initially insistent on fighting for his place in Amorim's starting XI, he secured a deadline day loan back to Serie A to play under Antonio Conte at Napoli. Speaking about the move, he said: \"I come with a lot to prove, I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good.",
      "\"I always work hard, I like to say I want to die on the pitch, to give everything for the team, to score goals, create, and fight for everything. I’ve been looking forward to this opportunity. I’m very, very grateful and I’m going to do my best to make us win something this year again, and to do the fans and club proud.\"",
      "It appears as though the Red Devils are being cautious with how they deploy Sesko early into his Manchester United tenure, with the 22-year-old entering the fray from the bench in the club's opening three Premier League matches against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley.",
      "He meanwhile played the full 90 minutes in his side's Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town last month, failing to find the score sheet before the club were omitted from the tournament via a tense penalty shootout. It comes as Amorim may turn to the star to start when the Premier League returns this weekend, with United set to clash with bitter rivals Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium come Sunday, September 14.",
      "While Cunha has been deployed as Amorim's trusted striker in the Premier League this term, the Brazilian picked up a hamstring injury during United's 3-2 win over Burnley ahead of the international break. And at the time of writing, it is uncertain as to whether Cunha will be fit to feature in the Manchester derby.",

      "Anthony Martial's career is set to take another twist, as he continues his fall from grace one year after leaving Manchester United. Martial, 29, was once tipped to be a Ballon d'Or winner, so much so that a clause was inserted into his contract when United signed him from Monaco for an initial £36million in August 2015.",
      "The deal would've risen to £57.6m had all three bonuses clauses been met. One of those stipulated that if the French forward won the Ballon d'Or while playing for United, Monaco would be owed a further £7.2m.",
      "Ultimately, Martial was never in contention for the prestigious award during his nine-year stay at Old Trafford. In June 2024, after scoring 90 goals in 317 appearances for the Red Devils, the 30-capped France international left United upon the end of his contract.",
      "Three months later, Martial ended his stint as a free agent and signed for Greek giants AEK Athens. The 29-year-old scored nine goals and registered two assists last season, helping AEK finish second in the Super League 1.",
      "But their form fell off a cliff in the Championship play-offs, losing all six games to finish bottom of a four-man table. Manager Matias Almeyda, who'd brought Martial to Greece, left following the disappointment and was replaced by Marko Nikolic.",
      "The appointment of Nikolic has been bad news for Martial, who's played just 31 minutes of football this term. The ex-Monaco starlet was left out of AEK's squad to face Anderlecht in the Conference League play-offs, as the Greek side won 3-1 on aggregate to qualify for the league phase.",
      "Now Martial is surplus to requirements, with his club willing to send him out on loan. According to reports in Mexico, Liga MX outfit Pumas are exploring a move.",
      "The deadline for new signings to be registered is Friday but, as things stand, Martial is unwilling to reduce his salary. If he doesn't get the move, Martial could find himself kicking his heels in Athens until at least the January transfer window.",
      "His time at Old Trafford ended on a sour note, with injury restricting him to just 19 appearances in all competitions during his final season. In an emotional farewell message, Martial said: \"Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you.",
      "\"I'm leaving to take on new challenges, I'll always be a Red Devil and I'll continue to follow the club's results with passion. Thank you again for everything, and see you soon. With all my affection, Anthony Martial.\"",

      "Joleon Lescott has cast doubt on Ruben Amorim's squad choices this season. The 43-year-old warned that Manchester United's new goalkeeper Senne Lammens should not make his debut against Manchester City.",
      "The Red Devils' shaky start to the season has been characterised by some uninspiring performances between the sticks. Turkish shotstopper Altay Bayindir was given the nod in their opening match against Arsenal, where he was at fault for the solitary goal in a 1-0 defeat.",
      "Andre Onana was then selected for the Carabao Cup tie against Grimsby Town. His pair of blunders handed the hosts two goals, and despite United managing to level the score at 2-2, Onana did little to aid his team as they were knocked out of the competition via a penalty shootout.",
      "Onana now appears to be on his way out of the club, heading to Trabzonspor on loan, with promising young Belgian No. 1 Senne Lammens snapped up for £18.2million on deadline day. However, Lescott believes Bayindir should remain in goal for United's trip to the Etihad on Sunday, warning that a defeat could dent Lammens' confidence regardless of his performance.",
      "Pep Guardiola's team might also introduce a new goalkeeper after securing the services of Gianluigi Donnarumma on the final day of the transfer window. While Lescott acknowledges both Lammens and the Italian could make their debuts, he has urged United to refrain from making a potentially lose-lose decision similar to the one that may have cost them the Grimsby match.",
      "Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, said: \"It wouldn't surprise me if both the new goalkeepers [Donnarumma and Lammens] start. But what is there to gain with the new United goalkeeper playing?",
      "ALL OUT FOOTBALL ON YOUTUBE: Subscribe now to be the first to watch the latest episodes of In The Mixer and other original shows, brought to you by Sky Bet. Follow All Out Football on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and X.",
      "\"They could still lose by four, and he could have a great game. What that does for his confidence would radiate for weeks. Is there a benefit? You risk that happening.",
      "\"If Bayindir goes in and they lose, there is a question mark over him regardless. They should just keep him [Lammens] until there is an easier opportunity than City away. The manager, the club and he as an individual may benefit from that more.",
      "\"I just think the risk is bigger than the reward for him to start for United. I thought that against Grimsby. I'm like, why have you picked Onana? I don't understand the decision.",
      "\"There was no benefit for the manager. If he did well in that game, then you've got a decision to make at the weekend. If he doesn't do well, then you're out of the competition. So I just didn't grasp that as a rational decision, and I'm the same this weekend. I'm thinking keep it the same and give [Lammens] a different opportunity than City away.\"",
      "He added: \"I expect Donnarumma to start. Who knows what condition he'll come back from his national team, which will have an impact. But the expectation of City is higher. There is more pressure on them to win. [Trafford] is top, I definitely believe he felt he was ready to compete with whoever came in, and he should. He's top. As long as they give him a fair opportunity.",
      "\"If Trafford's out now, and Donnarumma's in, given an opportunity to play, if he makes a mistake, then it's back and forth. That's what players want. I just want it to be fair. 'If you're judging me by one thing, then judge the opposing player by the same thing.'\"",

      "Michael Owen believes Ruben Amorim will succeed at Manchester United if given time, blaming their struggles on more 'deep-rooted' problems. United boss Amorim was appointed in November 2024 and has since won just eight of his 30 Premier League games in charge.",
      "The Portuguese was under huge pressure ahead of the international break before his side snatched a 3-2 win at home to Burnley thanks to Bruno Fernandes' 97th-minute penalty. Off the back of the Red Devils' worst-ever Premier League finish last term which saw them miss out of European football, Amorim was backed with £216.8million worth of signings in the summer transfer window.",
      "\"I do,\" Owen replied. \"I would be pro Amorim. I like what I hear and what I see. I'd like to see quicker progress. And I'm not saying he's exempt from any criticism at all. I expected him to be doing better sooner.",
      "\"United have churned so many great managers that people need to realise that it's not the managers. There's something more deep-rooted within the club, the players, the staff, the ownership, the manager, the whole thing has got to grow and improve. That will take a bit of time.",
      "\"Changing the manager every two minutes is going to put them back rather than forward. So I would stick with him. Absolutely. He's got the right head on his shoulders. It'll take time, but I think he will get it right in the future.\"",
      "Owen went on to argue that barring their humiliating defeat to fourth-tier Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, United have had a 'solid enough start' to what Amorim hopes will be his first full season at Old Trafford. \"Grimsby was pretty grim, wasn't it?\" the former England star acknowledged.",
      "\"But apart from that, I think it's been a solid enough start. Being the better team against Arsenal, drawing away at Fulham and beating Burnley, on the face of it, they're reasonably positive results.",
      "Will Ruben Amorim be successful at Manchester United? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"Listen, I'm not saying it's been great, but four points out of three games, it's not the worst. It's not the worst start. The Grimsby game was a killer. That was just not pretty at all. That was something that obviously the club didn't need at all.",
      "\"But I like some of the signings that they've made and think they'll be a better team this year. I think there will be progress. It will be slow progress, but they seem to have gone for a few proven players in their business this year and this season.\"",

The 22-year-old sealed a season-long loan deal to the Serie A champions on deadline day, with Antonio Conte's squad agreeing an option to purchase the forward if he shines this season.",
      "United and Ruben Amorim could pocket around £38million if Napoli secure a Champions League spot. The Danish striker will be keen to make a good first impression as he returns to Serie A after 832 days. away.",
      "Hojlund travelled 800 kilometres from Greece after Denmark's 3-0 victory in their World Cup qualifying match. He scored Denmark's third goal in the 81st minute, assisted by ex-United teammate Patrick Dorgu.",
      "After leaving Denmark's international camp on Monday night, Hojlund was spotted training with Napoli's first team on Tuesday afternoon at the Castel Volturno training centre, as reported by Tuttomercatoweb.",
      "Napoli are due to play Fiorentina this weekend, with Hojlund set to make his debut for I Partenopei before a midweek journey to face Manchester City in the Champions League.

      "“I come with a lot to prove, I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good. I always work hard, I like to say I want to die on the pitch, to give everything for the team, to score goals, create, and fight for everything,” he said.",

      "Wayne Rooney's 15-year-old son Kai has said 'life can't get worse' after suffering a painful injury while playing in Manchester United's development team. Rooney, 35, won numerous titles at Old Trafford and is hoping his eldest child can follow in his footsteps.",
      "Unfortunately, the only steps young Kai will be taking in the coming days will be on crutches. Before the setback, Kai was enjoying a lightning fast ascent at Rooney's old club.",
      "He was recently called up to the United-19s squad where he was playing with other prospects who are four years older than him. His call-up was then followed by a sweet goal he scored for the Under-18s, which saw him fire a left-footed volley into the top corner.",
      "Sadly, any positive momentum he has amassed will have to be rediscovered as he is set for a period on the sidelines. Kai uploaded a mirror selfie of himself showing off the protective boot he has on his right foot. In a caption overlaying the photo, he wrote: \"Life can't get worse\" alongside a crying emoji.",
      "It's a post which will invoke empathy from all footballers who have suffered a bad injury in their career. The nature of his injury or how long it will stop him from playing is currently unclear.",
      "However, the tone in his post suggests it may be a long time until he is playing for United again. While he is yet to wrestle the spotlight onto himself in the same way as his iconic father, there has been plenty of promise around Kai.",
      "He usually features in a central position for United, just like Rooney Sr, but he has also starred in the wider areas. Kai was particularly impressive while playing for the Red Devils in the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland earlier this summer.",
      "Wayne also starred in a similar tournament when he was a young and hungry prospect at Everton. Rooney cheered on his son's displays alongside wife Coleen and his youngest sons Kit and Cass.",
      "The former England skipper was recently asked to explain any influence he has had on Kai's youthful football career so far. Instead of peppering him with advice, the Reds all-time highest goal-scorer is allowing Kai to play the game in the way he sees fit.",
      "In a previous interview, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist. So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing.",
      "\"I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.",
      "\"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand off approach. I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",
      "Kai has been with the United academy since the age of 11. He joined the Red Devils youth set-up in 2020, where he his playing style has evoked memories of his famous father strutting his stuff at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana's recent struggles continued on Tuesday night as he was unable to prevent Cameroon from suffering a 1-0 defeat to Cape Verde.",
      "The two African nations faced each other on Tuesday night as they battled for top-spot in their World Cup qualification campaign. Onana, who is set to join Turkish outfit Trabzonspor, was in the headlines once again for the wrong reasons.",
      "In the 53rd minute, forward Rocha Livramento broke free of Cameroon's defence before driving towards Onana's goal. The United shot-stopper opted to stay on his line before diving the wrong way to concede.",
      "The defeat now means that Cameroon are in second place in Group D with two games remaining. They face having to settle for a possible play-off spot to earn their place at next summer's World Cup.",
      "After the game, a video circulated on social media of Onana seeming to shove a fan away following a pitch invasion. The spectator appeared to approach the goalkeeper as he made his way off the pitch, trying to record him.",
      "Seconds later, another fan appeared to throw a water bottle at the goalkeeper as he exited the shot. The Sun have reported that a source close to Onana has confirmed that the action was driven by concerns for his own safety.",
      "Onana, who cost United £47million, is expected to leave Old Trafford for Turkey in the next week after losing his place in Ruben Amorim's team. The United boss has opted to start Altay Bayindir in the first three Premier League games with Senne Lammens' deadline day arrival placing him further down the pecking order.",
      "Former United stopper Ben Foster believes bringing in Lammens is a risky move from Amorim. Foster said on his Fozcast podcast: \"Manchester United have got a kid from the Belgian league, who's never played for the Belgian first team.",
      "\"He's played about 60 first-team games in his career and they're expecting this guy to be able to adapt to not only the Premier League, but adapt to Manchester United as well. It just reeks of sticking a band aid (plaster) on it.",
      "\"I wouldn't expect any Premier League team to sign a goalkeeper from the Belgian league who's never played for the national team, not even a newly promoted team, and not as a starter. It's such a risk.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes is reportedly open to leaving Manchester United next summer despite turning down a lucrative offer from the Saudi Pro League. The Red Devils captain was heavily linked with a move to Al-Hilal this summer, with the Saudi giants considering a £100million bid and a £700,000-a-week pay package for the Portugal international.",
      "Fernandes, who joined the Red Devils in January 2020, also turned down an approach from another Saudi team in Al-Ittihad, who held talks with Fernandes' representatives. But the 30-year-old midfielder rejected a three-year deal to stay in Manchester, prioritising playing in the Premier League ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "But the Middle-Eastern giants remain intent on signing him. And, according to talkSPORT, Fernandes is open to making the move to Saudi, America or another major European league at the end of this season, when he will have just a year left on his United contract.",
      "United may use the opportunity to cash in on their ageing star, having just forked out £130m on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to play in Fernandes' favoured No. 10 role.",
      "\"I know for the club it was tough to decide. Because on one hand I'm the club captain, I'm important for them, even if at times I've not been great, I've been performing and everything. I know that in the public eye it will be bad if things go wrong.",
      "\"But it would be very good if things go well – if they sell me and they get more players and whatever. But in my mind I've always said that this is the place I want to be.",
      "\"The dream of coming and playing in the Premier League, because for me it is the biggest league in the world and I want to fulfil my dreams of staying here and winning more things with the club. Obviously I know people will have different opinions – he's 30 years old, he's getting old…”",
      "He continued: \"It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course. Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career.",
      "\"She was someone who always supported me a lot. It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship. But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, and I feel capable of it.\"",
      "United legend Gary Neville was vocal in his praise for Fernandes following his decision to turn down a pay rise to represent the club once more. The pundit said: “Manchester United's star player - only player at times - for the last four, five, six years, has been Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"He's so important. The fact that he wants to stay, the fact that he wants to go through this and come out the other side, will endear him towards Manchester United fans even more.",
      "\"To turn that money down at a point where Manchester United are at their lowest ebb and say, 'No, I want to fight through this, I want to see it through the other side, I want to come out and achieve things,' I think it says a lot about him as a person, as a character. The club needs people who are going to run through a brick wall for them.\"",
      "Neville’s former team-mate Paul Scholes had a different view, however, believing the club should have cashed in on the player because the sum offered for him was too great. The 11-time Premier League champion said on The Overlap Fan Debate: “They are talking about £100m for him. Man United cannot say no to that.",
      "“You know when you talk about this system as well, I know he has been brilliant and carried the team on his back but where does he play? What is his position? Do you see him as a number 10? Do you see him as a holding midfielder?",
      "“He almost confuses the whole system because he doesn’t have that one position for him. I mean he has been brilliant don’t get me wrong. But when you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.”",
      "\"I understand it's a business. But I think he looks at this as pure, 'I've got unfinished business at United. There's stuff I want to do here. Yes, I've been paid well here. The fans love me.' But I think he's in the game of wanting to give back after all he's received. So I've got nothing but respect for him.",
      "“I would have understood him leaving if he left, 100%. But the fact that he stayed and said there's stuff for me still to do here. I think it's a testament to him as a person, but also another reason why managers comfortably give him the armband.",
      "\"If I was him, I think I'd have found it difficult to say no [to Al Hilal]. I've got to be honest.\" However, after rejecting Saudi advances in the summer, Fernandes could well leave United at the end of the season, which would no doubt upset some club legends if their previous comments are anything to go by.",

      "However, the 33-year-old remained one of Europe’s most high-profile players without a club, even beyond the start of domestic seasons. Without a new employer, Eriksen decided to train with Swedish club Malmo to maintain his fitness.",
      "But compatriot Thomas Gravesen wasn’t impressed with his plan and accused him of a lack of ambition. But just a few days later, his wait seems to have come to an end, with multiple reports saying he has signed a deal with Wolfsburg.",
      "Tipsbladet have revealed that Eriksen has already made the trip from Denmark to Germany, with just the formalities left to complete the move. He will play in the Bundesliga for the first time, having also been linked with Bayer Leverkusen in recent days.",
      "Ambitious Championship club Wrexham were also previously said to be in the mix for the player, while newly promoted fancied keeping him in the English top flight.",

      "It will also be music to the ears of Gravesen, who was left perplexed at Eriksen's decision to train with Malmo. \"It is incomprehensible to me that he chooses Malmo,\" he said in a recent interview with Fotboll Skanalen.",
      "\"It is not a club that he can go to because he cannot sign a contract with them and we have some clubs in Denmark that are much, much better than Malmo.",
      "\"This looks like a friendly thing, where Christian Eriksen is over and having fun with some friends. Where is the ambition to play football?",
      "\"We talk about him being without a club for three months, but he has been without a club since January because he has been able to sign a contract with a new club ever since. He has been dragging his feet on it for a long time.",
      "\"If he wants to play for the national team, what signal does this send? What signal does going up and having fun with friends in Malmo send?”",
      "Eriksen signed with the Red Devils on a free transfer at the start of the 2022/23 season having rebuilt his career with Brentford following his cardiac arrest in 2021. In three campaigns, he appeared more than 100 times for United, winning the EFL Cup in 2023 and the FA Cup the following season.",

      "Roman Kemp first came up with the idea two years ago. Now, on World Suicide Prevention Day, after a lot of hard work and endless meetings and phone calls, the Sky presenter and broadcaster has seen it come to fruition.",
      "Arsenal fan Kemp has been profoundly affected by suicide as his best friend, radio producer Joe Lyons, took his own life in 2020. Kemp made a BBC documentary about the experience and has also revealed he had suicidal thoughts as a teenager.",
      "That has led him to being a campaigner to raise awareness and get people talking. It was two years ago when Kemp first talked to Vinai Venkatesham - who was at Arsenal then but has since become Tottenham ’s chief executive - about the plan.",
      "Latest data shows that one person in the UK takes their own life every 90 minutes and that a quarter of all people have had suicidal thoughts.",
      "All 20 clubs are backing the Premier League's “Together Against Suicide” initiative and 11 clubs are providing different forms of support for fans with messaging on advertising boards, match programmes and and on big screens at this weekend’s games.",
      "But a huge part of the plan is that it is not just a one-off but ongoing support as Tottenham have teamed up with Haringey Mind - they are the only club to join with a local community project - and Arsenal are organising a match day drop-in centre.",
      "Kemp is such a good ambassador because he is down-to-earth, is a genuine football fan who connects with those going to games and his own personal experience means it is very personal and powerful.",
      "Kemp said: “Football can make a difference. We are talking about the group of people who might be going through their own crisis but, once a week, they go to the football and they are focused on the pitch, looking forward and that’s the one thing they have in their minds.",
      "“If we can make that connection - and football fans are the demographic we are talking about of under 50s - then it can make all the difference.”",
      "Kemp also makes the campaign all the more powerful and relatable because of his friendship with Joe Lyons who continues to inspire him. “He was a huge Spurs fan,” smiled Kemp. “I never held it against him! But I’d go to visit the grave and I’m not someone who would go there and talk to the headstone or anything like that.",
      "“But I would always wind him up and say: ‘They’ve never won anything for years!’ Then suddenly they win in the summer and I went there and I said: ‘You’ve done it at last.’ That’s football. That’s the connection and maybe if it helps one person stay then it’s made the difference.",
      "“That’s why I am so proud to work on an initiative that puts compassion and connection at the heart of football and on something I really believe will make a difference to the fans that need it.”",
      "Other clubs doing initiatives are Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, West Ham United, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Southampton.",
      "It is very much seen as a pilot scheme to see what works best as all clubs are doing different things. Venkatesham is a brilliant football executive because he engages with fans, cares about a club’s community and also found the Premier League were so keen to help.",
      "Venkatesham said: “I’m sure that, as chief executive Richard Masters, gets about 50 ideas a day put his way and yet the Premier League were so supportive, every club is on board and, at this stage, it’s only 11 teams while we discover what works best in each scheme.",
      "“But it was very important that this was something not just as a one-off but for the long term and I am someone who believes football has got such a big role to play. We constantly ask so much of fans in terms of fixture changes, schedules and the demands of following your team home and away. We need to make sure we can help them when they need us.",
      "“We want fans to understand that one conversation can make all the difference, and that they can turn to their clubs for support when they need it most.”",
      "Tottenham will be one of 11 clubs delivering the pilot project during the 2025/26 season, working alongside Mind in Haringey. Staff from the charity will be based at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium during all Premier League matches across the season, beginning with the match against Wolves on Saturday 27 September, reachable at the end of a text service (available on WhatsApp 07399 928274) and available to meet confidentially with anyone who requires support on the day.",
      "The service will also be available outside of home matchdays, with fans directed to a dedicated hub on Mind in Haringey’s website for out of hours support. Mind in Haringey uses recognised psychological scales to ensure all interventions are recorded and to assess the mental state of an individual. This includes a follow up or check in to ensure that the individual has received relevant support and that the intervention has reduced their suicide risk.",

      "It felt like Amad's coming-of-age moment. The 23-year-old single-handedly inspired a spectacular comeback victory against City at the Etihad, and he built on that display by scoring an equaliser against Liverpool at Anfield and a hat-trick against Southampton in the next month.",
      "Amad was in contention to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award. Fernandes described him as \"unstoppable\", which is why he had earned undroppable status in the dressing room.",
      "It has been just nine months since Amad's heroics in the Manchester derby, two of which were pre-season, and it's possible he will be benched for United's clash with City on Sunday.",
      "Amad and Fernandes were the only players to start in each pre-season friendly this summer, which reflected their importance, but Amad was named on the bench for the opening Premier League game.",
      "Ruben Amorim introduced Amad in the second half against Arsenal. Amad subsequently started at right-wing back against Fulham at Craven Cottage, but he was replaced in the 52nd minute.",
      "Amad played his first full 90 minutes of the season against Burnley before the international break and he won the penalty in added time to win the game. Amad performed much better against Burnley, but Amorim may feel it's best to start him on the bench against City for tactical reasons.",
      "Amorim predominantly used Amad at right-wing back throughout pre-season. The role wasn't new to him, as he sometimes played in that position last term, but there are doubts about whether he is effective there.",
      "There have been teething issues with his partnership with Bryan Mbeumo down the right, and there are question marks about Amad's defensive qualities.",
      "It wasn't a surprise to see Amad hooked at Craven Cottage last month and he was poor against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup (he was relocated to the right side No.10 role at Blundell Park).",
      "All the evidence from the opening few weeks will play into Amorim's dilemma for the derby: should he play Amad at right wing-back or go with the tried-and-tested option in that role?",
      "Patrick Dorgu is likely to start on the left, leaving Amad and Diogo Dalot as the options for the right. Dalot withdrew from Portugal's squad during the international break with a minor muscle injury, but he is practically always available and it would be a surprise to see him fail a fitness test to be involved.",
      "Dorgu and Dalot were selected to start against Arsenal on the opening day of the season. Amorim went with the pragmatic option, Dalot, instead of selecting Amad, who is more attack-minded down the right.",
      "The decision will be taken out of Amorim's hands if Dalot is ruled out of the derby, but Amorim has often adopted for a risk-adverse approach against 'better' opposition, which suggests Dalot might get the nod.",
      "It would be a blow for Amad to miss out on starting at the Etihad, the scene of one of his finest moments in his United career. However, he may have to settle for a role from the bench.",
      "That could also be in Amorim's thinking ahead of Sunday. Amad's fresh legs from the bench could have a game-changing impact, and he is an excellent option considering he would start for most top-flight teams.",
      "Amad would be disappointed to be named on the bench, but Amorim might feel it's for the best.",

      "The Manchester derby needs no introduction but this weekend's offering feels one of the most pivotal in recent memory.",
      "Neither side is in great shape after the opening three games of the Premier League season, with City heading into the contest on the back of successive defeats as questions linger over whether the Blues can challenge for the title.",
      "For United, the victory over Burnley last time out provided a much-needed fillip for Ruben Amorim heading into the international break and means United head into the derby above City in the table.",
      "United won the corresponding fixture last season with two late goals in a dramatic 2-1 win and a repeat outcome would give Amorim and his squad a shot in the arm.",
      "The United chief faces several intriguing selection calls for the cross-city trip, not least over who to start in goal.",
      "With Andre Onana set to secure a loan switch to Turkish side Trabzonspor in the coming hours, Altay Bayindir will compete with new arrival Senne Lammens for the No. 1 spot.",
      "Bayindir has started all three league games so far this campaign but has failed to convince, while throwing Lammens in for a derby would be a big call.",
      "Amorim has shown he is not afraid to make significant decisions and if Lammens is the future, then making him the present has to be the move.",
      "Perhaps the other big call for the weekend comes at wing back, even if the biggest issues are in midfield. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes have been the first-choice partnership in the middle this season and it's hard to see Kobbie Mainoo or Manuel Ugarte coming into the side unless Fernandes is moved further forward amid injury concerns to Mason Mount and Mathues Cunha.",
      "The latter has teased the prospect of being fit for the weekend on social media and if one of him or Mount is available, you feel Fernandes stays in a deeper role. Even without either, Joshua Zirkee or Amad could fill in.",
      "The latter was the matchwinner at the Etihad last term but has been pushed into a wing back role for United this season. Having his ability and work-rate on the pitch feels imperative.",
      "Yet Amorim may well prefer the security of Diogo Dalot - who is an injury concern himself after pulling out of the Portugal squad last week - with Patrick Dorgu on the other side.",
      "Leaving Amad out for a big game would feel unfair on the 23-year-old, and would raise questions as to whether the Ivorian will find minutes in high profile games this season.",
      "Derby day will provide a clear indicator of Amorim's trail of thought. It's a thinking process the United boss has to get right.",

      "Antony enjoyed a successful loan at Real Betis in the second half of last season and he held out for a permanent move to Seville throughout the summer transfer window, but negotiations went down to the wire.",
      "The winger travelled to Spain on a private jet alongside his agent, Junior Pedroso, to complete a move to Betis with hours of the transfer window remaining. United received a fixed fee of €22million (£19m), with a potential €3m (£2.6m) in add-ons, and included a 50 per cent sell-on clause in the deal.",
      "Speaking to ABC Sevilla, Real Betis' CEO provided an insight into the negotiations. Ramon Alarcon admitted it was a difficult transfer to get over the line and revealed Betis were forced to wait for the Glazer family to sign off the deal.",
      "Earlier this year, sources confirmed the Glazers retain the right to sign off and veto deals, even though co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has control of football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "“There was a moment when we saw it was lost because United’s position was difficult,” Alarcon said of the discussions to sign the winger.",
      "“We had a difference of €5m/€6m and had already reached our limit. In the end, we all made an effort, we did our part, and so did the player and United.",
      "“On Sunday, during the match against Athletic, the relationship was very tense. Around noon, United sent the draft contract and asked us to make the changes. It was clear that they were going to comply with our requests.",
      "“In the early hours of Sunday morning, at 2am, we received confirmation. In the morning, we closed the accounting for Antony’s future capital gains because we wanted to have the ability to recover the investment.",
      "\"It was one of the most problematic points, but we resolved it. Sunday at 2am is when the situation was unblocked, and we started looking for a plane so he could come on Monday afternoon.",
      "\"There was still a bit of stress because everything was agreed upon, but we had to wait for the Manchester United owners in the United States to sign, and they did so at 3pm on Monday.”",
      "Betis struggled to finance a deal for Antony and Alarcon had to get creative to get the deal done.",
      "“We’ve launched a clothing line with Antony, we’re participating with him through royalties, and he’ll also have some non-sporting income from that merchandising,\" he explained.",
      "“If he ends up being the world star he has been, we at Betis hope to recover the investment and even what it cost us the previous year. It carries a certain risk because this is locked in for five years and at a high cost, but you can potentially reap benefits.",
      "“It’s the most difficult signing I’ve made as CEO because there was a lot of pressure from all the Betis fans. It was taken for granted that he was coming, everyone was asking when he was coming.”",
      "United signed Antony in an £86m deal from Ajax on a five-year contract in the summer of 2022. The winger scored just five Premier League goals during his time at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United defender Noussair Mazraoui appreciates Ruben Amorim's \"harsh\" way of communicating.",
      "Mazraoui came on from the bench against Burnley to make his first appearance of the season. He had been absent since suffering a small injury in the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Sweden.",
      "The Morocco international is now in his second season at Old Trafford. Mazraoui was signed from Bayern Munich for €15million (£12.8m), with a possible €5m (£4.2m) in add-ons, in the summer of 2024 and he made an impressive 57 appearances in all competitions in his debut campaign.",
      "Mazraoui was signed by Erik ten Hag, who he previously worked with at Ajax, but he continued to be an important member of the dressing room following Ruben Amorim's appointment.",
      "Speaking to The National, Mazraoui was asked about Amorim and said: \"He is a great manager, a great person. I really love to work with him. I like him a lot.",
      "\"His way of thinking, his way of managing, his way of talking. He's like a manager with a lot of values, which I have the same. So, yeah, that works great together.\"",
      "Explaining Amorim's values, he added: \"Being always respectful, being always honest. Never lies, says how it is without any edge. Sometimes it can be harsh, but I'd rather have that it's the truth and a little bit harsh than a lie. And that it's, you know, it kind of sweetens things up.\"",
      "Mazraoui admitted it was difficult when Ten Hag was sacked. \"Yeah, of course, because he was also a reason I came to the club. You come to a club because for the club itself, but also for the manager,\" he said.",
      "\"I worked some good years with him at Ajax, so that's also one of the reasons I came here. And then if he's gone after two or three months, that's never nice, because you feel also responsible for that. Because if the players perform, the manager stays, it's that simple.\"",
      "Mazraoui went on to discuss the different positions he has played in at United. \"I've been playing now a very long time as the right full-back. And lately also the right centre-back,\" he said.",
      "\"Right full-back is my favourite position, my best position as well. That's where everything goes automatic. When I get the ball, I know my options. I know what I can do, what I can't do. I know how to defend. It's less thinking, it's more enjoying.\"",
      "The 27-year-old also revealed the toughest opponents he has faced in the Premier League.",
      "\"[Mohamed] Salah, [Kaoru] Mitoma, [Anthony] Elanga, so you just keep going,\" Mazraoui said.",
      "\"It was [the toughest so far], I guess, Mitoma. In the second game [vs Brighton], so the first game, I think I really had him, I had him. The second game, he scored two goals, so I really blamed myself.\"",
      "Mazraoui was omitted from Morocco's squad during the international break. Morocco head coach, Walid Regragui, explained: “Mazraoui’s absence? Perhaps it’s for the best.",
      "\"During the periods he was out due to injury, I had the opportunity to try other players. Now El Karouani will return after a strong start to the season. There will be a lot of competitiveness at full-back.\"",

      "Ahead of his imminent transfer to Trabzonspor in Turkiye, Onana started his nations 1-0 World Cup qualification defeat to Cape Verde. The goal they conceded came after some rather calamitous defending but Onana certainly did not help himself.",
      "As Dailon Rocha Livramento bore down on goal after escaping several challenges, Onana was seemingly caught in two minds. Ultimately, he opted to stay on his line which allowed the striker to break into the box and pick his spot with relative ease.",
      "Following that defeat, Cameroon are at risk of not qualifying for the World Cup with Libya just one point behind them in the standings.",
      "Tyrell Malacia finally looks set to seal a Manchester United exit after seeing his loan to Elche called off on deadline day.",
      "The Dutch left-back is the final member of United's 'Bomb squad' with Jadon Sancho, Antony and Marcus Rashford all being moved on. But he is now also seemingly about to join a new club.",
      "According to Turkish journalist Resat Can Ozbudak, Eyupspor have reached an agreement with United for the temporary transfer of Malacia."

      "Ruben Amorim finally has something Erik ten Hag didn't have at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim, who is preparing for his third Manchester derby this weekend, will have options aplenty to choose from, something Ten Hag often struggled with throughout his tenure.",
      "A big boost for the 40-year-old is the return of ever-present defender Noussair Mazaraoui, who appears to be fit and raring to go after a lengthy period on the sidelines at the start of the new season.",
      "The Moroccan turned out to be an instant success during his first season at Old Trafford, racking up an impressive 57 appearances in all competitions and subsequently earning wholesale praise from United's fanbase in the process.",
      "What that now leaves Amorim with is a headache in terms of who he picks to start at the Etihad Stadium, despite recent scares surrounding the fitness of Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mazaraoui played games at LWB, RWB and even CB when required last term, proving his versatility and adaptability to suit the Red Devils in times of need.",
      "But with Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven, Matthijs de Ligt and Tyler Fredricson all fighting for a starting space in Amorim's three-at-the-back system, Mazaroui's position throws up plenty of intrigue.",
      "Some have often criticised Amorim for deploying talented forward Amad at right wing back, with Bryan Mbeumo deployed further forward in the right number ten role.",
      "Mazaroui is seen as a more defensive option, but is known for being comfortable with both feet, tough in the tackle, and aggressive as well. Whether Amorim sees his role out wide or as part of a back three remains to be seen, but the former Sporting boss cannot afford to complain now about his options across the pitch.",
      "Ten Hag struggled in his 4-2-3-1 due to not having a left-back after injuries to Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia halted his progress at Old Trafford.",
      "What was baffling was the non-inclusion of Alvaro Fernandez, who was shipped out to Benfica and then sold on again this summer to Real Madrid.",
      "For whatever reason, Amorim now has a team he believes can play his system. Work over the summer has proved United still need a midfielder to complement and complete his required play style, but with Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte at his disposal, finding the required duo is his problem.",
      "Nevertheless, the 197th Manchester derby will again give insight into his thinking, especially with defensive options coming out of his ears.",
      "It's been a summer of change, and with Andre Onana gone and Sene Lammens in the building now too, it's time Amorim's players started showing some of their might before patience again runs thin with the United hierarchy.",

      "While the summer transfer window is now closed, eyes will already be turning to possibilities for the upcoming January window. United could look to add more talent to their squad when the window re-opens.",
      "According to EFL Analysis, United, along with Chelsea, Tottenham and Newcastle have all been watching Lawlor this season. They face competition from abroad in the form of RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund, who are also said to be monitoring the 19-year-old.",
      "The centre-back broke into Cardiff’s first team picture last season. He has started every League One game for the club so far this campaign, with his performances earning him a first call-up to Craig Bellamy’s senior Wales squad.",
      "The teenager was named in the starting line-up for the nation’s World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan last week. He played the full 90 minutes and helped the team to keep a clean sheet in a 1-0 victory.",
      "Following the match, former Premier League forward Bellamy was full of praise for the defender. “Beyond impressed. What a player,” he said, via Guardian Series.",
      "“He was so just so impressive, and we needed him to be because we were fully aware of the pull-outs. Joe Rodon was gone, and there’s times you look and think, ‘how are we going to cope without Joe because he’s such an immense player for us?’",
      "“This helps. We have the sort of player underneath him now, (who is) going to rival everyone. He’s a big plus to come out of this, we gained a big player from this.”",
      "Cardiff are in a strong position in terms of a transfer with Lawlor having recently signed a new long-term contract with the club. The Bluebirds will be keen to keep hold of the player for as long as they can, especially with their aim being returning to the Championship at the first time of asking at the end of the season.",
      "Lawlor is expected to be back in action for Cardiff when they take on Stockport County away from home on Saturday afternoon (3pm kick-off).",

      "Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani was linked with a Manchester United takeover before Sir Jim Ratcliffe bought the club.",
      "While the Qatari sheikh was hoping to takeover United from the Glazers, Ratcliffe won the race by purchasing a 27.7% stake in the club, parting with around £1.25bn. United beat Manchester City to lift the FA Cup around four months after his purchase was completed.",
      "However, with United having slumped to a 15th-placed Premier League finish under the Ineos chief, some fans have been left disillusioned by the British billionaire.",
      "While the good times are certainly yet to come under Ratcliffe's leadership, many decisions he has made were not even mentioned by Sheikh Jassim. When the latter was pitching to take total control of United, significant investment and a pledge to clear the club's debt was at the forefront of his charm offensive.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, the Middle Eastern billionaire's vision on the boardroom side was vague. With no experience in running any football team, let alone one with the sheer magnitude and reach of United, Jassim's pitch was to hand out backroom roles to club legends.",
      "His populist pledge may have charmed the more nostalgic supporters, but it would have been a red flag for others. Handing out certain roles to individuals whose best work was on the pitch rather than in the boardrooms would have been a huge risk.",
      "Ratcliffe veered away from the nostalgia and immediately sought the best in class. Omar Berrada was brought over from Manchester City and appointed as the CEO, while Dan Ashworth was named as sporting director.",
      "While the latter proved to be a disaster who spent more time on gardening leave than in situ, Ashworth was at least appointed on his track record as the FA director of elite development, rather than on nostalgia and vibes.",
      "Ashworth was eventually replaced by Jason Wilcox, who was appointed as sporting director in June. Wilcox arrived from Southampton as a technical director, two months before Ashworth stepped into the building.",
      "His promotion was made as Sir Dave Brailsford stepped back from his duties at Old Trafford. Wilcox has an excellent reputation for developing young talent at Manchester City and Southampton.",
      "His appointment chimed with the overall ethos of United, which prides itself on its jaw-dropping record of having at least one academy-developed player in every squad since 1937. As important as boardroom appointments are, Ratcliffe will only be judged by results.",
      "Before the international break, the important, but albeit unconvincing, 3-2 victory over Burnley at least gave United a platform to put together a run of form. City, who have endured a worse start to the campaign than United, will be waiting at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.",
      "Victory would see Amorim extend his unbeaten streak over Pep Guardiola to four matches. It would also be the first time United have put back-to-back league victories together in his reign.",

      "United then spent more than double that amount on Benjamin Sesko. They had previously sounded out Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa and Viktor Gyokeres before Arsenal signed the Sweden international for £64million.",

However, that is also almost the same price as they list for Rasmus Hojlund, whom Napoli have an obligation to sign for £38million next dependent on certain conditions on top of a £5.2million loan fee.",

      "Kean has since then signed a four-year contract extension through to 30 June 2029. Sky Sport, however, reported at the time that there is a new release clause in that deal, up from £45million to £53million.",

      "After returning to action in the 3-2 win over Burnley last time out, Mazraoui is now a serious option for Amorim's backline. In a recent interview with The National, the 27-year-old has opened up about his first season in England and the physical demands of the Premier League.",

      "\"It’s funny with Sancho because he got the reputation with Borussia Dortmund,” said Carragher.",
      "“When you say he’s the worst Manchester United signing because of his ability… I’m not sure there’s much ability there. I think he’s okay, but I don’t understand what his thing is.",
      "\"I’ve been critical of Marcus Rashford, but if I picture him playing well, then I can picture his pace and his shooting. I don’t know what Sancho’s thing is. Every player has something, but I can’t think in my head about what he [Sancho] does. I’ve never seen it in my life. I haven’t.”",
      "Carragher was right and wrong with his Sancho assessment. He is entitled to his opinion and can refer to leaving him out of his hypothetical England squad as proof that he never rated him, but the numbers, data and eye test all confirmed Sancho had significant potential during his time at Dortmund.",
      "United can be criticised in 2025 for splashing £72.9million on Sancho, but that transfer fee felt like value at the time, especially with Manchester City signing Jack Grealish for £100m in the same summer.",
      "By his own admission, Carragher made his initial assessment of Sancho by watching small clips, and you can't form a true opinion of a player without watching them closely for a run of games.",
      "Anyone who watched Sancho properly in Germany saw a teenager brimming with talent, a fascinating English player who bravely decided to leave City to pursue a career in Europe.",
      "In the three seasons before Sancho signed for United, Raheem Sterling (110) was the only English player to record more goal involvements (goals and assists) than Sancho's 109). Harry Kane (106) and Marcus Rashford (94) came next.",
      "Of course, Sancho was producing those numbers in the Bundesliga, but he was a threat in the Champions League and seemed destined for the top.",
      "It's a massive shame that Sancho's career hasn't unfolded like everyone hoped it would. The 25-year-old has been majorly disappointing, but that doesn't undo his previous achievements.",
      "It is fair to criticise Sancho for the last few years. He faced the embarrassment of Chelsea breaking their obligation to sign him this summer, which cost the London club a £5m penalty charge, and he was fortunate that Aston Villa were in panic mode in the final days of the transfer window.",
      "Carragher argued he doesn't know Sancho's strengths. That is a fair comment based on his performances in the Premier League and United fans wondered the same when they took their seat at Old Trafford.",
      "That wasn't the case when Dortmund fans watched Sancho at Signal Iduna Park. He possessed flair, was exceptionally creative in tight spaces around the box and intelligently combined with teammates.",
      "With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps Sancho's skillset wasn't going to be a match for the Premier League, and he might still be on an upward trajectory if he'd continued plying his trade in Europe.",
      "Sancho's career has been on a downward spiral. He has regressed on the pitch and there have been concerns about his application at times. Sancho has been a shadow of his former self for a while.",
      "Proper recognition of the first part of Sancho's career is why his decline is so sad.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Manuel Uguarte has been labelled a 'wet blanket'.",
      "The Uruguay international has been slammed by former Chelsea and Celtic star Craig Burley, who has questioned the ex-Paris Saint-Germain player's credentials to play at Old Trafford.",
      "Ugarte joined United 12 months ago in a deal worth up to £50.5million but has yet to set the field alight, having been at the club for more than a season.",
      "Only Leny Yoro cost more than Ugarte in Dan Ashworth's summer at the helm of United's transfers, with the former sporting director saying: “Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer.",
      "\"He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level. His qualities, experience and passion will be a great complement to our strong group of midfielders.\"",
      "The 24-year-old, who played under Ruben Amorim to great success at Sporting CP, has struggled to prove himself worthy of a starting spot at the Theatre of Dreams thus far.",
      "Ugarte finds himself down the pecking order and has played just 46 minutes across three Premier League matches in 2025/26, with a combination of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes preferred in the centre of the pitch.",
      "And Burley has been seriously unimpressed by what he has seen. The ex-Scotland international said on ESPN: \"Manuel Ugarte is just absolutely nothing. He’s just like a wet blanket. Put him in with the kids and even the kids would be going, 'Who the hell is this guy?' Seriously.\"",
      "The 53-year-old pundit wasn't afraid to offer his forthright opinion on United's goalkeeping situation either. Burley does not believe Altay Bayindir can continue in goal even with Andre Onana's expected departure and reckons Senne Lammens is in for a tough baptism in the Premier League.",
      "\"He looked the real deal when he was in Italy,\" Burley said of Onana. \"I thought he was going to come in and have a Schmeichel-esque aura about him. Remember he was bossing about Harry Maguire and he had a go at him.",
      "\"If this youngish lad from Belgium comes in and is flapping about all over the place, it's going to be a mess isn't it? Altay Bayindir, they can't play him. He might be okay at shotstopping but he's absolutely useless at balls into the box.",
      "\"The lad who has come in [Lammens] needs to be able to communicate, marshal a back four, be good with the ball at his feet, make saves and he needs to have authority and make a statement when teams are rattling the ball into the box. That is what every team will do now, they're going to pile it on into this goalkeeper.",
      "\"He's going to sink or swim. They went halfway down the road to Martinez at Villa and I think that would have been the perfect scenario because he's got arrogance. But they've gone the other route again and we've no idea how the young lad is going to handle the scenario.\"",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has left the club in yet another nightmare scenario despite his imminent exit.",
      "The Cameroonian is on the verge of making a season-long loan switch to Turkish side Trabzonspor.",
      "The move will bring to an end a poor two-season spell with United. Onana’s displays having been blighted by a series of high-profile errors.",
      "And while he might be hoping for a fresh start, Trabzonspor might have some serious doubts if they’d have tuned into his latest display.",
      "Onana was named in the Cameroon side to take on Cape Verde, who were ranked 73rd in the world ahead of kick-off, in World Cup qualifying on Tuesday.",
      "But they ended up losing 1-0 courtesy of Dailon Livramento’s second-half strike.",
      "The forward had run from his own half after Carlos Baleba had sloppily given the ball away.",
      "And instead of coming off his line to narrow the angle for Livramento, Onana remained hesitantly planted, giving the Cape Verde star the opportunity to simply fire past him and give his nation a memorable win.",
      "While United might reflect on his latest howler as justification for his exit, it has actually left Ruben Amorim’s side with a fresh headache.",
      "In losing, Cameroon now look likely to face an energy-sapping route to a potential World Cup place.",
      "They will likely face a play-off against fellow African sides to determine which of the four best group runners-up will go into an inter-confederation play-off scheduled to be played next March.",
      "And Cameroon will certainly need their best players - including United forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Back to Onana, he will certainly hope that’s the last error he makes for a while as he prepares to embark on his Trabzonspor career.",
      "There is optimism that he can make his debut this weekend as the side take on Fenerbahce.",
      "United boss Amorim has a dilemma over who to start in goal for this weekend’s Manchester Derby.",
      "Altay Bayindir has been his starting goalkeeper in the league but has endured an indifferent start to the season.",
      "Senne Lammens is also ready and available following his deadline day move from Royal Antwerp.",

      "The international break is pretty much done and dusted and attention can now turn to the big one: the Manchester Derby.",
      "Pep Guardiola and Ruben Amorim will not have taken their eyes from Sunday's game at the Etihad Stadium with neither side having got off to the perfect Premier League start.",
      "City currently lie one point behind United after the opening three matches, with the Catalan coach's team having uncharacteristically already recorded two defeats.",
      "And the international break has offered Guardiola few favours with Omar Marmoush being forced off of the field just nine minutes into Egypt's World Cup qualifier against Burkina Faso.",
      "The attacking star was on the receiving end of a strong challenge and initially attempted to play on but eventually succumbed to his issue and was assessed to have suffered a \"knee ligament bruise\".",
      "An Egyptian FA statement said: \"Dr. Mohamed Abou El-Ela, the doctor of Egypt’s national football team, confirmed that Omar Marmoush sustained a knee ligament bruise during today’s match against Burkina Faso in the eighth round of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers. The player will undergo scans upon his arrival in Cairo on Wednesday morning.\"",
      "A further update, released by City, read: \"Manchester City FC can confirm that Omar Marmoush has sustained a knee injury whilst on international duty with Egypt. The City striker suffered the injury in the early stages of Egypt’s World Cup qualifying match with Burkina Faso on Tuesday evening.",
      "\"Initial results on a scan performed in Egypt indicate he will not be available for the Manchester derby on Sunday, and he will now return to Manchester for more assessment and to begin his rehabilitation.\"",
      "That could just be the beginning of City's issues, depending on whether the swathes of injured stars are fit to return in time to face United following their own problems.",
      "Abdukodir Khusanov missed Uzbekistan's internationals with a calf injury that was set to keep him sidelined for two weeks, while John Stones trained with England before pullling out of the group on Friday after failing to overcome a minor muscle injury.",
      "Rico Lewis and Nico O'Reilly both withdrew from England Under-21 duty, and Rayan Ait-Nouri didn't travel to play with Algeria.",
      "Guardiola's press conference will see updates on Josko Gvardiol, Savinho, Marcus Bettinelli and Phil Foden, who could make their returns but will need to prove their readiness for one of the more intense fixtures of the season. Rayan Cherki and Mateo Kovacic remain long-term absentees, while Kalvin Phillips is unlikely to feature.",
      "Amorim is not without his own concerns however. Diogo Dalot pulled out of Portugal's international camp as the nation's federation reported the defender was suffering from \"muscle discomfort\".",
      "Matheus Cunha became unavailable for Brazil after suffering a hamstring injury against Burnley but there is some hope the issue may not be as bad as feared.",
      "\"What an incredible environment, it’s great to be here,\" Cunha wrote on Instagram last week. \"I'll be back soon, always with joy and gratitude. Thanks for all the messages.\"",
      "Mason Mount also picked up a problem in the win over the Clarets, with an update likely to be forthcoming before the weekend's match as the 26-year-old has started each Premier League match thus far.",
      "Lisandro Martinez remains out and unlikely to return before the end of October as he continues to rehabilitate from the knee injury suffered last season.",

      "Manchester United's hopes of signing Crystal Palace and England midfielder Adam Wharton face being put on hold until next summer, according to reports.",
      "Wharton is one of the most in-demand central midfielders after impressing at Selhurst Park. The former Blackburn Rovers ace has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford for about 12 months now.",
      "United didn't improve their midfield in the summer despite a number of concerns. Instead, Ruben Amorim's men spent over £210million on three forward players and a possible new number one.",
      "The rebuild at United is expected to continue in January and next summer. Alongside Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba, Wharton is one of the Reds' long-term midfield targets, though Palace are understood to want a fee of £80m-£100m.",
      "Wharton is anticipating a big season in south London ahead of the World Cup next summer. Many have tipped the 21-year-old to start alongside Declan Rice in Thomas Tuchel's midfield despite not featuring for the Three Lions since June last year.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano has claimed that Wharton's future isn't set to be decided until after the World Cup with some of Europe's biggest clubs circling. \"I think if something happens, it's going to be after the World Cup, but for sure, the focus of the player is on Crystal Palace,\" he said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"He didn't want to move this summer, and he was not pushing for a move, because he's fully focused on Palace.",
      "\"Then in 2026, I would not be surprised if something happens, because Premier League clubs, but also clubs in Spain, including Real Madrid, are monitoring the boy, and so let's see what's going to happen.\"",

      "Manchester United will return to Premier League action with the first Manchester derby of the 2025/2026 season against Manchester City on Sunday afternoon (4.30pm).",
      "Ruben Amorim's team have enjoyed two weeks off for the first international break of the new campaign. The Reds have endured a mixed bag of results so far, beating just Burnley in the league and crashing out of the Carabao Cup to League Two outfit Grimsby Town via a penalty shootout.",
      "This week, United travel to the Etihad Stadium to take on City with Amorim looking to make it two wins from two on the blue side of the city. Last season, the former Sporting CP head coach orchestrated a 2-1 comeback win after late goals from Bruno Fernandes and Amad.",
      "However, United go into the game sweating over the fitness of Matheus Cunha. The summer signing is yet to score for his new club but has been one of the Reds' most dangerous players in the first three games.",
      "Cunha picked up a hamstring issue in the 3-2 win over Burnley before the international break. He has been active on social media to keep fans updated, the latest suggesting he will be back soon - but it's unsure whether he will be okay for Sunday afternoon.",
      "Mason Mount, who has joined Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in United's front three, is also a doubt after suffering an injury last time out. Amorim confirmed after the win that the playmaker had played 30 minutes injured against the Clarets.",
      "\"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury,\" said the head coach after the win over the Clarets on August 30.",

      "Diogo Dalot is also a player United will have to decide late on after he withdrew from the Portugal squad. The full-back returned to England due to a 'muscle discomfort'.",
      "In better news, Lisandro Martinez is edging closer to returning. The Argentina international, 27, has been side-lined since February with an ACL injury but it now back on grass at Carrington.",
      "United have a number of players still to play for their national teams in midweek. Bruno Fernandes is expected to play for Portugal at Hungary on Wednesday night, while Amad is also set to feature for Ivory Coast against Gabon.",

      "City are currently blighted by injuries with Mateo Kovacic, Josko Gvardiol, Marcus Bettinelli and Kalvin Phillips all set to miss the clash with United. Meanwhile, nervous waits are expected on Savinho, Abdukodir Khusanov, Rico Lewis, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Nico O'Reilly, John Stones and Phil Foden.",
      "As for United, their injury issues are much less severe and have been handed a boost in recent days. Casemiro, in a bid to be fully fit for the derby, has returned to Carrington early after picking up a suspension for an accumulationof yellow cards ahead of Brazil's clash with Bolivia in the early hours of tomorrow morning.",

      "Malacia has made just 47 appearances at United since his switch to the club in 2022, with the majority of those coming in his first season under Erik ten Hag. He made just four appearances in total last season before spending the second half of last season on loan with PSV in the Eredivisie.",
      "When he returned from that loan, Malacia was one of five players told to train away from the first-team group - with England forward Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho all securing moves away from the club before the English transfer deadline closed on September 1.",
      "The defender had been linked with a deadline day move to La Liga club Elche, but a transfer would not come to fruition in time, with reports claiming a deal broke down due to a permanent clause deal in the contract.",

      "As for Senne Lammens, we will get an idea whether he will be an inspired signing or another dud if/when he starts against Man City this weekend.",
      "However, their failure to sign a suitable No.6 to play alongside Bruno Fernandes/Kobbie Mainoo is already coming back to haunt them as they opted to be patient with a long-term pursuit of Carlos Baleba, though this signing feels far from guaranteed as other Big Six clubs linger.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings: 14 places between Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "And there was equal importance on exits as Man Utd desperately needed to clear out the bad eggs to give Ruben Amorim a better opportunity to thrive.",
      "For the most part, this was done successfully as Antony and Alejandro Garnacho were sold, while Rasmus Hojlund (once Napoli qualify for the Champions League) and Jadon Sancho (when his contract expires) will be gone next summer.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s situation is less cut and dry as Barcelona are reportedly planning to ‘send him home’ on one condition, while Andre Onana is set to join the England international in leaving on loan.",

      "The deadline day arrival of Lammens permitted Man Utd to sanction Onana’s exit, though the club’s hierarchy were clearly not stern negotiators when it came to sorting the goalkeeper’s move to Turkish side Trabzonspor.",

      "It is clear that the Red Devils wanted rid of Onana by any means necessary and have struck a deal with the first club willing to take the goalkeeper and vice versa.",
      "Though the terms of this “no buy option clause or loan fee” deal is a worry for Man Utd, who have repeated a trick pulled by the previous regime as they have kicked a problem down the road and let Amorim down.",
      "After clearly buckling to get Onana out, Man Utd will have the same problem with the goalkeeper, who is under contract until 2028, when he inevitably returns to give Amorim (or his successor) a headache.",

      "We were baffled by the response when we had Newcastle that high less than two months ago. Fair enough, we’re less baffled now. Because what we actually were was wrong. Desperately, badly wrong.",
      "Sometimes it takes a big man to admit they’ve made a mistake. And sometimes the mistake is writing ‘No apparent need to or significant risk of selling any of their many very excellent players – most notably of course Alexander Isak’ and you are so bang to rights you have no choice but to admit you’ve f*cked it.",
      "It was hilariously soon after those fateful words that the whole Alexander Isak Saga kicked off and so dominated the final six weeks of the transfer window.",
      "The good news, at least, is that we are no longer baffled by Newcastle fans feeling down in the dumps, and that surely must lift their spirits significantly. Guys? Guys? No? Fair enough, suit yourselves.",
      "As bad as the drawn-out and bitter Isak saga was the ritual humiliations Newcastle endured in trying to source a suitable replacement, and the fact that when they eventually did in bringing Yoane Wissa to St James’ Park, it played out in such a way that they all had to look awkwardly at their shoes or abandon all semblance of self-awareness after spending the previous weeks declaring Isak’s open disloyalty had brought indelible and grave shame on him and his legacy for the rest of days.",
      "Newcastle did also manage to sign Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, but – while we’re loathe to jump to any conclusions – we’re not sure there’s ever been a more conspicuous and desperate example of the Bundesliga Tax. Suffice to say this was one deal where Newcastle were in absolutely no danger of being hijacked or gazumped at the last by a rival bid.",
      "On the field, it’s been a largely grim start to the season. The goalless draws against Villa and Leeds exposed the already very obvious weakness in Newcastle’s squad to a sarcastic degree, while the admirable heart and fight shown with 10 men against Liverpool only ended up exposing them to the most sickening of sucker-punches.",

      "Why are you always like this? Hmm? It feels like some kind of deep-rooted self-sabotage at this point. Managers come and go, players come and go, Wolves start the season looking absolutely sh*tbone awful.",
      "Three defeats from three for a side who really did look to have landed on something in the spring is just so dispiriting, yet so on brand.",
      "They didn’t win a Premier League game until November last season, won one of their first six in 23/24, one of their first nine in 22/23, and like this season lost the first three in 21/22.",
      "There’s a glass half-full element to this, of course, in that none of those seasons ended with actual relegation. Wolves are always apparently able to drag themselves out of the trouble they’ve created for themselves in the end.",
      "But this one feels especially galling. Most clubs outside the elite suffered player drain this summer, and Wolves were no exception with Rayan Ait-Nouri and Matheus Cunha heading to Manchester, but it still surely needn’t have become this bleak this quickly.",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who now once again finds himself top of the list nobody wants to top.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either. But against Arsenal they showed the ‘mettle of champions’.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brings back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of the season. The latter months of the season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "Feels both absurdly high to be on this list before a ball is kicked, yet also perfectly fair. Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly.",
      "",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that, even if Potter is far from out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim sees the departure of Andre Onana this week as essential to his rebuild of the squad over the summer, according to reports.",

      "Casemiro has been one of the very few success stories at Man Utd under Ruben Amorim, with his future more secure than expected.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble."

      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’.",
      "There was a significant overhaul at Man Utd in the summer. They spent around £230m on signings, with Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha their most notable signings.",
      "The Red Devils also offloaded unwanted talents to balance the books, as Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony moved elsewhere.",
      "Despite this, it seems that Ruben Amorim‘s side remains way short of their Big Six rivals, and it’s unclear whether the head coach’s system can work with his squad.",
      "Man Utd are still far too easy to play through as they are yet to find the right blend with a suitable centre-midfield partnership after they failed to land Brighton standout Carlos Baleba in the summer.",
      "READ: Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers from Chelsea ace to Liverpool flop",
      "United were priced out of a move for Baleba amid reports suggesting that he could have cost as much as £100m.",
      "Despite this, it has also been reported that they will return for Baleba in 2026, with journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claiming that the Red Devils have a ‘huge double signing planned’.",
      "It is noted that their focus is on strengthening in midfield, with one signing ‘in January and another in the summer’.",
      "The report claims Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson is ‘first up in January’, while Baleba is their ‘dream signing’ for the summer.",
      "Man Utd reportedly ‘admirers of Anderson and he figures highly on their shortlist’, and while ‘luring him from the City Ground won’t be easy’, a ‘sudden change’ could boost their chances.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Forest are unwilling to lose one of their most important players at all, particularly halfway through the season.",
      "‘But the sudden managerial change at the City Ground, with Ange Postecoglou replacing Nuno, means United are to keep a close watch on Anderson’s situation.’",
      "Earlier this week, former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown explained why Man Utd “have been looking at Anderson”.",
      "“Man United have been looking at Anderson,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "“He’s done a tremendous job at Nottingham Forest and then he’s come into the England side and turned in a man-of-the-match performance.",
      "“United see him as exactly the type of midfielder they would like to bring in. He gets up and down the park, he’s confident and secure in possession of the ball, and he’s not afraid to put in a tackle which is something they need.",
      "“Anderson would solve, or certainly help with, a lot of the issues they’ve had under Amorim. Everybody knows they wanted a midfielder in the summer but they couldn’t find the right one who was available at the price they wanted.",
      "“I don’t know what Anderson would cost, but he is somebody who’s been on their radar. He would be the ideal player to fill the gaps they’ve had in the squad.”",
      "Manchester United’s potential ‘first’ signing of 2026 would leave Newcastle United sick to the stomach and could be their worst embarrassment yet…",
      "Man Utd will look to make a new signing in the January transfer window with INEOS ‘desperate’ to bring in a defensive midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Declan Rice has heaped praise on his new England team-mate, who “made it look so easy” in the World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have already been dealt a ‘huge’ blow as they consider whether to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton in January.",

      "It is not often in recent years that City approach a Manchester derby with as much trepidation as United. But the hosts at the Etihad on Sunday have just as many reasons – if not more – to fret over a game both managers could really do without.",
      "The timing is rotten for Pep Guardiola and Ruben Amorim. Coming on the back of a post-transfer window international break, the preparation for derby no.197 will be sub-optimal for both sides even before you begin to consider the wider contexts. And those wider contexts give Guardiola more grounds for concern than Amorim.",
      "Pep’s big worry: a title race in which City are already struggling with the pace in the wake of the worst start to a season in his managerial career.",
      "It is not an unrealistic prospect that City could be nine points behind Liverpool and seven off Chelsea by Sunday evening. The Reds and Blues face opponents fancied by many to struggle this season. That those teams, Burnley and Brentford, are on the same number of points as Guardiola’s men is a damning indictment on City, even at this early stage.",
      "That is what Guardiola will have spent most of the last fortnight stewing over. The City boss flew to New York for the US Open but he must have been preoccupied at Flushing Meadows by the thought of City pulling the chain on their title prospects with a derby repeat of the performances that reaped no points from Tottenham or Brighton.",
      "City were not especially wretched in either defeat. But more worrying for Guardiola than those performances in isolation is the absence of the aura that made them so dominant for so long.",
      "Guardiola would have hoped that last season was but a blip and that a summer reset, even around the FIFA Club World Cup, would give City a more familiar air of superiority, if not yet infallibility.",
      "But Tottenham and Brighton proved that the rest of the Premier League won’t simply get down on their knees again.",
      "Spurs are City’s weird kryptonite, but there was still an added zip and swagger about Thomas Frank’s side at the Etihad, especially on the break, that portrayed an absolute confidence that the hosts were vulnerable.",
      "At the AmEx, City assumed the control that Guardiola so craves before they relinquished it whole. And all it took was a quadruple substitution. After that, Brighton unleashed a storm on their visitors that the City of old would usually weather with little inconvenience. But this version of City, one evidently still traumatised and in transition, wilted.",
      "“We forgot to play,” as Pep put it and his four changes – two doubles – to counter Brighton’s, initially to steady the ship and then to stop it sinking, failed to have the desired effect.",
      "More lasting changes came in the following days, with Ilkay Gundogan, Manuel Akanji and Ederson waved off, the trio following Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Jack Grealish through the exit. It is a turnover that City planned for – most of it, at least – but one that sees a lot of stoic experience leave a dressing room already on the back foot.",
      "Such an overhaul prompts immediate questions over how Guardiola reacts to two defeats before a game that looks more than ever like a must-not-lose affair.",
      "Does Gianluigi Donnarumma make a derby debut after barely a few days in Manchester, immediately putting James Trafford’s nose out of joint? Donnarumma arrives in England after conceding four to Israel while getting away with punching a corner into his own net amid scathing reviews of his performance.",
      "Might it be an overhauled defence in front of whichever under-pressure keeper Guardiola goes with? There are question marks over the right-back and at least one of his centre-backs.",

      "What form does City’s midfield take? And can Jeremy Doku be trusted to supplement Erling Haaland’s goal threat with Omar Marmoush injured?",
      "Guardiola is accustomed to making big decisions, but these are strange times for the City boss amid unfamiliar uncertainty over his options. And not often have there been so many to ponder at once.",
      "Which ought to empower Amorim and United to go to the Etihad on Sunday to follow Spurs and Brighton’s lead. The United boss won and drew his first two Manchester derbies, with 180 minutes of wretched mediocrity punctuated only by City caving in on themselves in the final minutes on their own patch.",
      "Amorim has plenty to ponder himself. Which goalkeeper gets the gloves? Are Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount fit? The outcome of those health checks will likely hold considerable sway in whether Bruno Fernandes remains in a deeper role alongside Casemiro.",
      "Whatever decisions Amorim takes, the United boss should be picking up the scent of blood wafting on the air from east Manchester. The Red Devils remain vulnerable enough to justifiably feel that a point would be a satisfactory outcome, but on Sunday, they have the opportunity to secure some respite from the harsh spotlight and thrust it upon their neighbours.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United failed with a ‘crazy attempt’ to sign a Liverpool target ‘in the last two days’ of the summer transfer window.",
      "Man Utd were very active in this summer’s transfer window. They were largely focused on overhauling their attack as they signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also signed Senne Lammens to be their new No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "The Red Devils also looked to offload deadwood as Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho moved elsewhere.",
      "Lammens was their last summer signing, but they were also linked with other potential signings as it was reported that their next priority was to sign a centre-midfielder.",
      "Despite this, a new report from Foot Mercato claims Man Utd made a ‘crazy attempt’ to sign winger Malick Fofana from Lyon at the eleventh hour.",
      "READ: Marmoush out of Manchester derby: What his injury means for Man City against Man Utd (very little)",
      "20-year-old Fofana has been heavily linked with several Premier League clubs in recent months, with it reported that he has been on Liverpool’s radar as a long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah.",
      "Fofana grabbed five goals and four assists in 29 Ligue Un appearances for Lyon last season, with the report claiming Man Utd tried to ‘snatch’ him ahead of Liverpool and others.",
      "The report claims Man Utd moved for Fofana ‘in the last two days of the window’ in a reaction to Garnacho’s exit and Cunha’s injury.",
      "Fofana was reportedly ‘tempted’ to join Man Utd, though a deal did not go through for one reason.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘Under the impetus of Jorge Mendes who played the intermediary between Manchester United and the player’s father, the Red Devils tried their luck.",
      "‘While the Belgian international was tempted by the idea of ​​joining MU, the English club was just waiting for a signal from the player’s father to start hostilities. A signal that never came and which sealed Fofana’s future between Rhône and Saône.’",
      "Interestingly, Kevin De Bruyne has likened Fofana to one of his former Man City teammates.",
      "“If you look at how modern football is played, there are more man-to-man situations,” De Bruyne said.",
      "“If you have players who can dribble past opponents or create space for others, then that’s only a good thing.",
      "“It’s all the better for us that another youngster like Malick is joining us. A Jeremy Doku type? Yes, they’re both wingers, quite small, quick.",
      "“Of course, Jeremy has been with us for five or six years. He also plays for Manchester City, which — with all due respect — is a level above Lyon. Malick is younger and is still picking things up.”",
      "Liverpool wants to seal a move for Lyon winger Malick Fofana as soon as possible as they eye a successor for Mohamed Salah, according to reports.",
      "A Liverpool target has ‘decided to stay’ at Lyon this summer despite Nottingham Forest seeing a bid accepted earlier in the window, according to reports.",
      "Romano has revealed that Liverpool have held ‘internal talks’ over a Luis Diaz replacement but insists Alexander Isak is the ‘priority’, with ‘talks progressing well’.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has confirmed Liverpool interest in Lyon winger Malick Fofana in the summer transfer window.",
      "Liverpool are looking to bring in Lyon winger Malick Fofana as a potential replacement if Luis Diaz leaves for Bayern Munich, according to reports.",
      "Forest have agreed a deal with Lyon for Malick Fofana, but the winger is holding out for a Champions League club amid interest from Chelsea and Bayern."

      "According to reports, a transfer involving Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo in the winter could ‘resurrect’ on two conditions.",
      "Mainoo has suffered a major fall from grace over the past year as he has slipped in the pecking order at Old Trafford.",
      "The England international’s career at Man Utd got off to a great start as he enjoyed a brilliant breakout season in 2023/24, while he also shone at the 2024 European Championships.",
      "However, injuries, a loss of form and the appointment of Ruben Amorim have negatively impacted Mainoo, who may not fit into the head coach’s preferred system.",
      "Mainoo was only a bit-part player for Man Utd under Amorim and it was reported in January that club chiefs were willing to sanction his exit as they looked to raise funds through a pure profit transfer.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘top target’ to replace Amorim revealed amid ‘growing unrest’, one reason for INEOS verdict",
      "The talented midfielder has attracted interest from Chelsea and several European clubs in recent months, with it revealed before the summer transfer window closed that he had requested to leave on loan.",
      "This request was submitted after Mainoo was an unused substitute in Man Utd’s opening two Premier League games of this season.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd refused to let their academy product leave as they have limited midfield options and did not have much time to secure a replacement.",
      "Earlier this month, Fabrizio Romano revealed co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe was “involved” in the decision on Mainoo’s future.",
      "“Kobbie asked to go on loan, he never asked to go on a permanent,” Romano said.",
      "“Never been a possibility, either for Man United or for Kobbie Mainoo. But he did want to go on loan. It was a priority for Kobbie Mainoo to go on loan.",
      "“Man Utd said no, they decided internally, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe involved, that they couldn’t sell Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“This was a decision made with all the people involved: directors, CEO, coach and owner. ‘We can’t let Kobbie Mainoo go,’ that was the position.”",
      "Now, a report from ESPN claims Mainoo ‘first started having concerns’ about his future ‘in January’, with it noted that he ‘sought advice from one former player after stories emerged that the club would be open to offers for both him and Alejandro Garnacho’.",
      "And while United blocked his exit in the summer, it is claimed that a deal could be ‘resurrected’ in January on two conditions.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘Sources close to Mainoo have rejected suggestions he asked to leave permanently and insist he was only seeking a temporary move that could help force his way back into Tuchel’s England thinking.",
      "‘A loan move to Napoli was mapped out and United said no, though there’s a possibility it could be resurrected in January if Mainoo’s situation hasn’t changed. United would need a replacement, which is always tough to do mid-season.’",
      "‘There is still plenty going on at Old Trafford’ apparently, and that includes the Manchester United news that big Benjamin Sesko has shown his ‘true colours’.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s decision on Kobbie Mainoo after he looked to leave Manchester United last month.",
      "A ‘significant U-turn’ suggests Manchester United already regret a £100m transfer decision, which has exposed ‘furious’ Ruben Amorim…",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has every right to “not like” Ruben Amorim as the Man Utd manager is very clearly “the problem” in his case.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted to bring in Conor Gallagher before the transfer window shut but the Man Utd board insisted on keeping Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "According to reports, Man Utd received three ‘enquiries’ from Premier League clubs for Kobbie Mainoo after the midfielder asked to leave on loan."

      "He continued: “Honestly, for what it would have cost, I would have gone and brought in someone like Ollie Watkins, someone to help and pull the young strikers out of a bad patch.",
      "“When young players are just coming into the club, when the onus is on them to score goals, if they’re having a few bad games they have to have the safety net of being pulled out of the firing line. Ollie Watkins, or someone like that, would be who I would have been looking to bring in.”",

      "Sporar said: “What does he bring to United? Everything. He has speed, power, intelligence, good football IQ.",
      "“I believe he can be a complete striker in the next two or three years. But he’s still young. He will help Manchester United a lot, they just need to be patient. I believe he’ll score the goals and every year he will be better and better.”",

      "‘The City striker suffered the injury in the early stages of Egypt’s World Cup qualifying match with Burkina Faso on Tuesday evening.",
      "‘Initial results on a scan performed in Egypt indicate he will not be available for the Manchester derby on Sunday, and he will now return to Manchester for more assessment and to begin his rehabilitation.",

      "The extent of the issue is not disclosed, but whenever you see it’s a knee injury, you can’t help but fear the worst.",
      "Losing a player of Marmoush’s quality should be a blow to any team, but thankfully for Guardiola, he has plenty of options in attack and the Egyptian wasn’t even guaranteed to start against United.",
      "Erling Haaland and Marmoush are the only players listed as ‘forwards’ on the Man City website, which indicates that they’re viewed as strikers and not wingers, which is obviously the case with the former, while the latter has more versatility.",
      "On matchday one against Wolves, Guardiola’s front three was Oscar Bobb, Jeremy Doku and Haaland, while Bernardo Silva, who is capable of playing wide, was in a midfield three.",
      "Despite winning 4-0 at Molineux, the Spanish manager switched things up for the visit of Tottenham, starting Haaland up front by himself in a 4-1-4-1, with Marmoush and Bobb out wide.",
      "Spurs won 2-0, which led to further changes for City’s trip to Brighton, mainly in shape, but not attacking personnel as Marmoush played left wing, Bobb was on the right with Haaland through the middle.",
      "Judging by the first three matches of 2025/25, Marmoush is Guardiola’s preferred option on the left, which means Doku is the most likely to start against Ruben Amorim’s men.",
      "However, Savinho and Phil Foden could also be in contention, with Bobb capable of moving over to accommodate one of those two players.",
      "Foden has only played 15 minutes this season as he continues to be hampered by an ankle problem, while Savinho hasn’t been included in a matchday squad amid transfer interest from Spurs.",
      "Guardiola has told reporters that the Brazilian has been dealing with a knock suffered in pre-season, but we’re not convinced.",
      "If the Spaniard, for whatever reason, wants my opinion: Bobb should start on the left and Foden on the right. Young Phil loves a goal against United after all.",
      "If Foden isn’t fit enough to start, it has to be the same front three that smashed Wolves to pieces: Bobb, Haaland, Doku."

      "Arsenal legend Martin Keown was left fuming by former Man Utd goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel’s comments about the Gunners’ playing style.",
      "The Gunners made a good start to the new season with two wins from their opening two fixtures against Man Utd and Leeds before their narrow 1-0 defeat to Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "Their loss to the Reds was down to a Dominik Szoboszlai wonder strike in the second half, which gave Liverpool all three points, but Arsenal‘s playing style was criticised after the match.",
      "Some critics want to see Mikel Arteta give his players more attacking freedom, while Man Utd legend Peter Schmeichel called it “an ugly brand of football”.",
      "Schmeichel said on Viaplay after the match: “I have never in my life, ever, wanted a team to win a game of football more than Liverpool today.",
      "“Arsenal bring an ugly brand of football to our game. Arteta… let your team play football! Let them loose, let them be free!",

      "But Arteta took the cautious approach by starting Gabriel Martinelli and Mikel Merino over a more attacking line up involving Eberechi Eze and Martin Odegaard.",
      "Keown agrees that he wants to see Arsenal show more attacking intent in some matches but hit out at Schmeichel for his “deranged” comments that the Gunners play an “ugly” style of football.",
      "He told talkSPORT: “We want more. Arsenal I feel now are at the stage where it’s a mentality change.",
      "“They need to change gear, they’ve really got to go after it. You’ve got to have the eye of the tiger to really go and win these games.",
      "“Looking back, I hope we don’t regret it, but it’s too early in the season to write Arsenal off.",
      "“I don’t know if it’s been calm in the media, I’ve listened to some people, sometimes these ex-players like Peter Schmeichel has said that Arsenal bring something ‘ugly’ to the Premier League.",
      "“I think that’s deranged, what’s he talking about.”",
      "Keown added: “Was it ugly when they changed the back-pass rule in 1992 because it was him [Schmeichel] that was one of the advocates of that?",
      "“Everyone kept passing it back to him, that was ugly as well. But look, Arsenal are a long way down the line to being successful.",
      "“We can compare clubs, Arsenal and Manchester United, maybe I’m rising to the bait…",
      "“But I think Arsenal look good right now, it’s not lucky Arsenal anymore, by the way, with all these injuries.",
      "“That will clear up and they’ve now got a squad to go the distance, but Liverpool are still ahead.”",
      "Football pundit Martin Keown has questioned the viability of head coach Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and come up with an absolutely bananas suggestion for a replacement.",
      "Arsenal legend Martin Keown has made a shock prediction for the Europa League final, claiming one Manchester United star won’t “turn up” vs Tottenham.",

      "Thursday 4 September 2025 08:37, UK",
      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on Deadline day.",
      "There were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",

      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",
      "Dublin's iconic Croke Park will welcome the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings on Sunday September 28, before the latter stick around to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham the next week.",
      "The Denver Broncos then take on the New York Jets at Tottenham followed by the Los Angeles Rams against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley, before the Indianapolis Colts host the Atlanta Falcons at the Olympiastadion and the Washington Commanders meet the Miami Dolphins at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.",
      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles return as defending Super Bowl champions after dethroning the Kansas City Chiefs in a 40-22 victory in New Orleans in February, denying Andy Reid's side a third straight championship.",
      "Josh Allen's Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens resume their pursuit of a Super Bowl berth in the face of Kansas City's monopoly on the AFC, while Jayden Daniels leads a new era for the Washington Commanders. The Detroit Lions loom as one of the league's most prolific offenses as the Minnesota Vikings seek to maximise a Championship-calibre roster, while Micah Parsons prepares to alter the NFC entirely after his blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers.",
      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""

      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund all departed Manchester United on final day of summer transfer window; after fortnight of negotiations, Senne Lammens joined club in deal worth £18.2m as goalkeeper chosen over Aston VIlla's Emi Martinez",
      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 13:06, UK",
      "Manchester United finally offloaded most of their 'bomb squad' as Antony completed a permanent move to Real Betis, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho joined Napoli and Aston Villa on loan respectively.",
      "The club had begun Transfer Deadline Day with Antony, Hojlund, Sancho and Tyrell Malacia exiled from Ruben Amorim's squad - with only the latter remaining at Old Trafford until January at least.",
      "Antony's return to Betis ended a summer of speculation over whether he would end up back in LaLiga, having spent the second half of last season at the club and racking up seven goal contributions in 17 games.",
      "He joined them for £21.7m, a loss of £64m from when Man Utd paid Ajax £86m for him in 2022.",
      "Jadon Sancho, who had been a target for Roma, joined Villa as one of a number of late additions to Unai Emery's squad, with Rasmus Hojlund making a temporary move, which could become permanent, to Napoli, who have been seeking further striking reinforcements all summer.",
      "Few incomings were expected after Brighton rejected an offer for Carlos Baleba last month, with Senne Lammens the only arrival in an attempt to solve the ongoing goalkeeping issues at Old Trafford.",
      "Andre Onana has not featured for Man Utd in the league all season and was at fault for one of Grimsby's goals in their shock Carabao Cup defeat last week, with Altay Bayindir also faltering in his place in United's opening three Premier League games.",
      "Lammens joined from Royal Antwerp on a five-year deal for a fee of around £18.2m, including add-ons. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez had been discussed, but it was decided internally that Lammens was a better option.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10 respectively and it is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for any of Man Utd's other 'keepers, it would be considered.",
      "Antony had made no secret of his desire to avoid returning to Old Trafford at the end of last season, including a tearful interview while on loan at Betis where he said he had fallen out of love with football at United.",
      "In the end, he got his wish - but he had to wait right up to the end of the transfer window for it to happen. He leaves Old Trafford having played 62 Premier League games across three seasons, but contributed just eight goals and assists.",
      "He arrived at the club in 2022 as one of the major signings of the summer, following former boss Erik ten Hag from Ajax, but never managed to recreate his Eredivisie form for United.",
      "A number of clubs had been interested in bringing in Sancho this summer, including Chelsea, where he spent last season on loan and featured heavily in their run to the Conference League title. But, having failed to agree terms with the Blues, he returned to Old Trafford - and they paid a £5m fine as per the terms of his loan.",
      "AS Roma had expressed an interest in the final days before the deadline before Aston Villa's last-minute swoop, with the club taking a second Man Utd forward on loan in as many windows after signing Marcus Rashford in January.",
      "Hojlund had impressed in pre-season and looked like he may end up as Man Utd's starting striker for a second season in succession, especially after expressing his wish to remain at Old Trafford - and Ruben Amorim's positive words about him.",
      "But, after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko, it became clear his days were numbered at the club and he did not feature in any of their four competitive fixtures before completing his temporary move.",

      "Manchester United have completed a £18.2m deal to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens; the Belgian shot stopper is now one of four goalkeepers at Man Utd, though they could sell any of the other goalkeepers to Saudi Arabia or Turkey as their windows close later",
      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed the Deadline Day signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "United have agreed a deal for the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper for around £18.2m plus add-ons.",
      "The club looked at other options, including Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, but after much deliberation and negotiation, they feel Lammens is the right choice for the club moving forward.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper impressed United. No 'keeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United will move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Altay Bayindir, Andre Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10, respectively.",
      "It is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for their other goalkeepers, it would be considered.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim had previously said he was happy with his goalkeeping department, despite several high-profile errors from Onana and Bayindir across the early stages of the season.",
      "Lammens is now the fifth signing of the summer for Amorim, taking their summer spend to £232m, following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The keeper was signed two years ago from Club Brugge and the sale represents nearly 100 per cent profit for the Belgian club.",
      "He made 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League last season for Antwerp, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "Speaking on the club's official channels after signing, Lammens said:",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben [Amorim] and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, added: \"Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential.",
      "\"We are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.\"",
      "\"Manchester United have signed Senne Lammens with an eye to the now as well as the future.",
      "\"The 23-year-old keeper, tipped to be Thibaut Courtois' successor in the Belgium national side, is seen as the best solution to strengthen an underperforming goalkeeping department after a shaky start to the season by the likes of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "\"It's no secret they looked at other options, such as tried and tested Emiliano Martinez at Aston Villa, but with all factors considered, United felt Lammens was the direction they wanted to go in.",
      "\"Although Lammens has limited experience - only one season as a first-choice No 1 at Royal Antwerp, United are confident in Lammens' potential to compete immediately as well as having room to grow with a side that has the ultimate aim to win the Premier League title in three years time.\"",
      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",
      "\"An interesting thing is that when Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, they were tracking him then. So there's obviously been a like there for quite some time.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
      "\"It's not about never making mistakes - it's about how you recover from them, your body language, and whether you look authoritative. [Onana and Bayindir] don't fill that role.\""
