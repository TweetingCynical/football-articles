      "Barcelona and Manchester United are getting close to a deal which will see Marcus Rashford join the Spanish giants on loan with an option to make the move permanent.",
      "The United academy graduate, 27, is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and spent the second half of the 2024-25 campaign on loan at Aston Villa after falling out with Ruben Amorim. The talented forward was always likely to move again this summer and it's no secret that Barcelona has long been Rashford's preferred destination.",
      "And after weeks of speculation, it seems as though Rashford - part of Amorim's five-man 'bomb squad' at United's Carrington training ground - will finally get his wish.",
      "Talks over an initial loan move between the clubs have begun, with the outline of an agreement reached - although the finer details still need to be sorted. Rashford's signing has already been approved by the Barca boss, Hansi Flick, after talks with the England international.",
      "Rashford would initially head to the Nou Camp on loan with an option included for the arrangement to be made permanent at a later date.",
      "Although United would prefer to offload Rashford permanently, a loan move will still benefit them in their bid to raise funds for further incoming transfers and they have agreed to the terms of the proposed deal, with talks now in the final stages.",
      "Rashford is one of the club's highest earner on £325,000-a-week; Villa paid two-thirds of that package plus bonuses when they signed him on loan back in January.",
      "The deal will also benefit Barcelona, whose financial difficulties in recent years have been well documented.",
      "The Spanish giants have been seeking a new left winger all summer and had agreed personal terms with Nico Williams over a transfer before the Athletic Club star had a late change of heart and opted to stay put.",
      "Barca have also pursued Luis Diaz but Liverpool insist the Colombia star is not for sale.",
      "When he was asked about signing a new winger this summer back in May, Flick said: “This is what we have talked about with the club. In the last matches maybe we did not have a lot of options in that position… so we have to bring more options to the team and more quality. This is the job from Deco, is clear, and I will support him.”",
      "When he was asked about interest in Rashford and Diaz specifically, Flick added: “I don’t want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players. I like them and we’ll see what happens.”"

      "Shortly before Manchester United faced Leeds United in their first pre-season friendly in Stockholm, Marcus Rashford took to social media. Rather curious timing, you might say.",
      "Rashford is not part of the 29-man United squad in Sweden for the fixture. The England international, back with the club after falling out with Ruben Amorim and spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, is one of five senior stars who make up part of the so-called 'bomb squad'.",
      "He and the other four - Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia - have all been told they won't train with the first team as they explore opportunities to leave Old Trafford. The fivesome are able to use the club's Carrington training ground, but have been asked to do so when the first-team and head coach Amorim have headed home.",
      "Rashford is keen to find a move abroad. Barcelona is his preference and the two clubs are in negotiations, with Hansi Flick keen on a deal being done after speaking to the 27-year-old.",
      "An offer has been made over a potential loan deal with an option to buy at the end of the season. That suits Rashford and may be the best that United can get. As it stands, they've agreed, with talks now between all sides looking to nail down terms.",
      "Rashford has been very keen in recent weeks to share images on social media of himself putting in the hard graft in the gym. His latest, on Saturday shortly before the Leeds fixture, was simply entitled: \"The lab\".",
      "It marks the third such upload featuring clips of Rashford's workout regime since the beginning of last week. Several United teammates have responded to these posts - and the latest was no different.",

      "United say Zirkzee, the £34million summer signing 12 months ago, is dealing with a \"small issue\".",
      "Several of the club's former players have also shown Rashford their support. They include Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Brandon Williams, Donny van de Beek, Facundo Pellistri and Jesse Lingard.",
      "Andre Onana, Bruno Fernandes, Jadon Sancho, Lisandro Martinez, Matheus Cunha, Matthijs de Ligt and Rasmus Hojlund have liked previous posts too.",
      "Rashford has been sharing clips of his off-season training, including sprints and padel sessions. \"The work don't stop! Let's go,\" he wrote alongside a video on the track.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo's future was uncertain and Edinson Cavani had left the club. In a surprising development, Arnautovic emerged as a target for United, having enjoyed a prolific season with Bologna aged 33.",
      "The Austria international had made an impressive return to Europe after two years in China following his time at West Ham and Stoke City in the Premier League. United moved on their interest and submitted a £7million bid which was rejected and they ultimately abandoned their pursuit.",
      "Fans also wrote to Red Devils CEO Richard Arnold after Arnautovic had been accused of using an anti-Albanian slur during Austria's game against North Macedonia at the European Championship two years prior. UEFA issued him with a one-match ban after the incident, prompting Arnautovic to deny that he was a racist following another accusation in 2009.",
      "His brother has now revealed what caused the move to break down. During a recent interview with Austrian outlet ORF, agent Danijel Arnautovic said: \"My favourite at the time was always Manchester United, I had three of four offers for him back then.",
      "\"I wanted to do that at the time because I thought he would fit in well there and also when he was at Bologna, it was already like... I don't think it's ever really been mentioned, but I can also say now that Marko was very close to a transfer to Manchester United.",
      "\"In 2022, he could have come to Manchester United. We already reached an agreement back then, everything. But Bologna didn't let him go back then.\"",
      "Arnautovic gave his side of the story a few months after the failed move, describing United as the 'top of the universe'. \"Manchester United tried to sign me several times,\" the ex-Inter Milan star, who's now a free agent, told Laola1.",
      "\"And it was a difficult decision to stay in Italy because my family wanted to return to England. For me it's clear that the Red Devils remain at the top of the universe.",
      "\"And Bologna, as a name, are not. But that's fine. Here everything is calm, you have time for yourself and no stress. This is only good for me.\"",
      "Arnautovic is looking for his next club after being released by Inter in June, having spent two years at San Siro. The 36-year-old has been tipped to sign for Serbian giants Crvena Zvezda, formerly known as Red Star Belgrade, after initially holding talks over a return to his home city with Rapid Vienna."

      "Elanga was allowed to leave Old Trafford back in the summer of 2023 and flourished with Forest. The report adds that there is a feeling amongst the club that Sancho could embark on a similar redemption arc at The City Ground if a deal can be struck for his signature.",
      "United want to offload Sancho for good this summer after seeing the versatile attacker return from his stint at Stamford Bridge.",

Hernandez, 37, claims that women are making society 'hypersensitive' and told them to focus on 'multiplying, cleaning and maintaining the home'.",
      "Chicharito, as he was affectionately dubbed throughout his career, spent five years at United after joining from Guadalajara, lifting two Premier League titles and scoring 59 goals. The Mexican went on to play for Bayer Leverkusen, Real Madrid and West Ham among others.",

      "Meanwhile, England youth international Alfie Dorrington, 20, has returned to Aberdeen on loan for the 2025/26 season.",

      "“Brad’s been outstanding from the moment he walked in the door, he’s been a key player on the pitch, and he’s been amazing off the pitch as well. He’s taken on a lot more responsibility since Coll Donaldson has been out injured, and has stepped up.",

      "The French striker is ready to move to Anfield. He's agreed a six-year deal already, having jumped at the chance to join the champions in a way he never did Newcastle.",
      "Frankfurt rejected three Toon bids for the striker. Liverpool are taking a softly, softly approach, trying to negotiate in good faith to get an agreement everyone likes, rather than going back and forth with bids.",
      "Ekitike has an £86million release clause in his deal - it'd be a surprise if the fee hits that straight up.",
      "Arsenal and Sporting Lisbon are still negotiating over the finer details of how payments will be made for Viktor Gyokeres.",

      "Almeria chief Goncalves has now revealed he's willing to move forward in negotiations with other clubs, telling CNN Portugal:",
      "\"Luis has had his best season, he's in the best moment of his career. 31 goals is a number any forward wants to achieve.",

      "The Belgian stopper has been the club's No.1 since arriving from Chelsea in 2018.",
      "And, as reported by Marca, he's now signed an extension to his contract - which had just 12 months left to run - to stay at the Bernabeu until 2027.",
      "He's 32 now Courtois. That deal will take him until he's 34.",
      "Could we then see Madrid move for a replacement? Or is it just a matter of the veteran stopper taking it as it comes, going year-to-year and potentially still being between the sticks in the Spanish capital when he's 40?",
      "We'll have to wait and see.",
      "So, Arsenal completed Noni Madueke's deal last night as their fourth summer signing.",

      "Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said: “I am really pleased that we have brought Shin to the club. He is a strong player who can score goals and create goals for others and I think he is someone who can definitely add an important dimension to our forward line.",
      "\"I know he is really keen to make his mark here in European football and deliver for Celtic and I think he is someone who has the power, athleticism and intensity in his play to do really well for us. I look forward to working with him.\"",
      "At his first press conference as Spurs head coach on Friday, the new Spurs boss described the Argentine as \"very, very important\".",

      "“But it’s like a theory. Right now he’s here, that’s what I’m focusing on,\" he said. \"As long as players are here, I’m training them, I’m playing with them.",
      "\"He’s definitely here and very committed. I know he’s looking forward to the season.\"",
      "Modou Kéba Cissé has agreed to join Aston Villa from LASK Linz in Austria.",
      "The 19-year-old has signed a pre-contract deal to join the Villans next summer, keeping him with his current club this term.",
      "He broke into the LASK side last year, making 10 senior appearances, scoring once.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has been desperate to get his exit from Sporting sorted and he is now close to getting his wish. Arsenal have finally agreed terms with the Portuguese club over a €73.5million (£63.5m) transfer fee - and Gyokeres is packing his bags.",
      "A removal van was shown outside Gyokeres' house on Portuguese television on Thursday, with Record confirming the authenticity of the images and reporting that the Swede sent a friend to oversee the process.",
      "Talks are continuing between the two clubs and Gyokeres' representatives over the finer details of the transfer, but it is clearly close. Once the deal is completed, the 27-year-old could fly out to join his new team-mates on their pre-season tour.",

      "Now, as first reported by the Daily Mail, their frustrations are set to see them give up and turn attentions elsewhere.",
      "In their place, City are looking to swoop, two years after letting Trafford move to Turf Moor and are looking to pay less than their £40m buy-out clause.",
      "An interesting twist. Never really understood why Newcastle were so keen with Nick Pope already in situ.",
      "Noni Madueke completed his £52m move from Chelsea to Arsenal on Friday night.",
      "The Gunners have splashed £48m - plus £4m in add-ons - to sign the England winger to provide competition down both flanks.",
      "But ex-Arsenal star Paul Merson says he's \"shocked\" by the move.",
      "\"I'm shocked. If Arsenal went and bought any player from Chelsea, he'd have been the last one I thought they'd sign. I just don't see it. It's a lot of money for a player who is not a prolific goalscorer. He's the sort of player that has a good game here and a good game there, but that'll be it.",
      "\"The consistency of performance isn't there. I hope he proves me wrong, but he'll have the good games, just like he did for England last month. But then you won't see him for a few weeks.\"",
      "On Friday Manchester United agreed a £70million deal with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It'll see United pay £65m for the Cameroon international, with a further £5m in add-ons.",

      "Manchester United kick off their pre-season schedule against Leeds United at Stockholm’s Strawberry Arena on Saturday afternoon and Ruben Amorim will be hoping Bryan Mbeumo can join the party that travels to the United States soon after.",
      "Brentford have agreed a deal worth up to £71m for the Cameroon international and he will join the tour to the US which begins next week.",
      "But the 29-man squad named by United for the meeting with rivals Leeds in Sweden features only Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as new arrivals, with a quintet of big names looking to be sold left at home including Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Here is what to look out for and how to watch as the new season moves a step closer.",
      "While the wait to see Mbeumo will drag on until the American series, Matheus Cunha is in line to make his debut having already been handed the No10 shirt vacated by Marcus Rashford. And excitement is high that the Brazilian will thrive from the off after a £62.5m move from Wolves.",
      "Amorim’s squad had problems running through it last season but chief among them was the lack of firepower up front.",
      "Cunha can bring both goals and the intensity required to shine in Amorim’s system.",
      "Reports suggest Diego Leon is already impressing on the training pitch and considering the club indicated he would flit between the first team and underage set up as he gets up to speed with English football.",
      "A good display here could see him veer much closer to remaining with the former once the season proper gets going.",
      "There are 10 youngsters in the squad including Toby Collyer, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson and Ethan Williams.",
      "And with Joshua Zirkzee still recovering from injury and Rasmus Hojlund’s future at the club in doubt amid interest from clubs in Serie A, there appears a chance of Obi to make a big case for a much bigger opportunity.",
      "Amorim was quickly criticised from some quarters for his determination to stick to his system rather than adapt to specific situations.",
      "Will he show any signs of moving away from his structure here or will he stick with his tried and tested and believe that his squad can improve their ability to carry out his specific instructions as the next four weeks before the new Premier League season begins progresses?",
      "Rare is the club game that gets heated in mid-July so it will be interesting to see whether these two rivals get stuck in.",
      "When they face off in early January in the first league meeting of the season it will get very tasty. Do not rule out a meaty tackle or two here, though.",
      "The game gets underway at 2pm and will be shown live on MUTV.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Antwerp have slapped a £17million price tag on the Belgian star amid interest from the Premier League giants. Onana's injury means he will miss the entirety of pre-season and he is in a race against time to feature in the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "United had been linked with a change in between the sticks as Onana continues to struggle for consistency. Ever since joining from Inter Milan for an initial fee of £44million in 2023, he's been error-prone with several of his mistakes leading directly to goals.",
      "There was talk of the club scouring the market for a new No 1 but the fitness issues with Onana mean that Ruben Amorim has little choice but to go after another goalkeeper and talkSPORT reports they are ready to pursue Lammens.",
      "The goalkeeper himself admits he was overawed when he learnt of the interest from the Manchester side but believes the way he plays would suit English football.",
      "\"The first time I heard I thought, 'Wow',\" he said. \"Immediately a world [renowned] team that follows you. That is special. Of course, I was also spoken to about it a lot and when I made a save in training, it was United this, United that [from colleagues]… It's only positive.",
      "\"Especially because it's the best competition in the world and my profile, my stature and way of playing, is similar to English football. You have to physically hold your own there and that suits me.\"",
      "It has been reported previously that United would be willing to take a £20m hit on Onana to ensure he gets a move away. The Cameroonian goalkeeper sees his future up in the air following a tricky couple of campaigns at Old Trafford.",
      "AS Monaco and Saudi clubs have shown tentative interest but neither would be able to match United’s demands. Onana himself has no desire to quit the club and wants to prove that he can cut it.",
      "Nevertheless Red Devils chiefs would be willing to sell him for around £30m in an effort to get him off the wage bill if the opportunity arose. Amorim dropped Onana for a game last term at Newcastle, which came just days after a poor display at Lyon."

      "The five players have been told they have no future under Amorim at United and are therefore seeking transfers to other clubs. Rashford, Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have been isolated from the first-team squad, forced to train separately in order to draw a line between the two groups.",
      "The Athletic reports that the bomb squad approach is contentious inside the club, with some worried it sends the wrong message. There is also the fact that making it obvious the players are unwanted risks lowering their transfer value, especially as the September 1 transfer deadline approaches.",
      "Aston Villa are the latest club to signal their interest in Manchester United outcast Alejandro Garnacho. The winger is expected to depart the Red Devils before the end of the transfer window and is not part of Ruben Amorim's plans.",

As a result, Garnacho has not been part of United's pre-season plans.",

      "The Cameroon international had also had keen interest from Tottenham Hotspur, a move that would have seen him follow the path taken by head coach Thomas Frank last month.",
      "But he has always preferred a move to United, despite the club not being in Europe this season and Spurs returning to the Champions League, and made his intention clear to all parties while continuing to train as normal at the start of pre-season.",
      "United's initial bids of £45m and £55m upfront were swiftly rejected by Brentford, whose view was that they should hold out for more than what United paid Wolves for the Brazilian Matheus Cunha at the beginning of the transfer window. United have also signed young full back Diego Leon from the Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 goals and added eight assists having played in every league game for Brentford last season. He joined the club in 2019 and was a vital part of their promotion from the Championship.",
      "United begin their pre-season campaign with a friendly against Leeds United in Stockholm on Saturday afternoon before heading to America. While Stateside they will face West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton before hosting Fiorentina a week before the new season kicks off.",
      "Ruben Amorim is not expected to include several players who have been given permission to find new clubs in his travelling party. That includes Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and winger Antony.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Bryan Mbeumo was once backed to leave Brentford for a Premier League giant by his old manager, Thomas Frank. Mbeumo has been at the centre of a protracted transfer saga this summer, with Manchester United desperate to secure the services of the 25-year-old forward.",
      "United have now tabled a third offer for the Cameroonian international, believed to be £65million plus £5m in performance-related add-ons. United have previously failed with two bids for Brentford's star man but are hoping to strike lucky with their latest offer.",
      "Mbeumo has already agreed personal terms with United. He has also informed Brentford, and the other clubs chasing him, that he doesn't want to move anywhere else, having rejected both Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "Brentford have yet to respond to United's latest bid. However, comments in 2024 made by the Bees' ex-coach Frank, who has since joined Spurs and made a play for his ex-striker, will give Mbeumo a huge confidence boost should he make the move to Old Trafford. The Dane claimed last year: \"I'd buy him if I was at a bigger club.\"",
      "Frank has been backing Mbeumo to succeed for some time. After the striker missed a chunk of action two seasons ago due to injury, his manager's remarks spoke volumes that he believes the goalscorer can cut it anywhere. Mbeumo's contributions were sorely missed at the time while he was on the treatment table.",
      "\"He [Mbeumo] was our biggest miss for four months last year, even with [Former Brentford striker, Ivan] Toney out,\" Frank said. \"He was our key player and has added another layer this season with five goals in six games.\"",
      "He continued: \"That's incredible and he's creating chances. He's a top player. I'm convinced he will play for a bigger club. I'd buy him if I was at a bigger club.\"",
      "The ongoing saga has not been ideal for United. Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted all his new recruits signed up before he and his squad fly to the USA next week for their pre-season tour.",
      "Matheus Cunha is United's only new arrival so far. The club's previous bids for Mbeumo - £45m plus £10m in add-ons and £55m plus £7.5m in bonuses - were rejected, as Brentford believe Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season, should command a higher fee than the £62.5m United paid Wolves to sign Cunha.",
      "Yet the optics around the deal are harming United, so says former Red Devils defender Rio Ferdinand, who was speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "\"[Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he's told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United. So Man United and Brentford have to come together and find a way of... well, Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation,\" Ferdinand said.",
      "\"I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen.",
      "\"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative? So, I'll be surprised if this deal doesn't go through, because Man United have been adamant.\""

      "Manchester United are hoping to have completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo before they head off to the United States on their pre-season tour. United submitted a third bid for the Brentford forward on Thursday and are confident of concluding the prolonged negotiations in the coming days.",
      "There is now a £70million bid on the table for Brentford, made up of £65m plus £5m in add-ons. United consider it a take-it-or-leave-it offer that they have made after growing frustrated with the Bees’ hard ball negotiating tactics.",
      "The main reason behind the sudden escalation in bidding is that United want Mbeumo to be a part of their pre-season tour to the US. Ruben Amorim and his players will jet over the Atlantic on Tuesday, after playing Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday in their first pre-season friendly.",
      "Matheus Cunha is the only summer signing currently being integrated into the squad during training sessions at Carrington, having completed his £62.5m move from Wolves early in the window. Diego Leon, an 18-year-old Paraguayan left-back, is another new arrival, although his deal went through in January.",
      "Leon is among one of the players hoping to catch Amorim’s eye ahead of the trip to the US, where matches against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton await. The Athletic reports that a decision is yet to be made over Leon’s status in the squad, or whether he will drop down to the under-21s, given there is competition at left-back from Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Harry Amass.",
      "Meanwhile, there are four other young players in the same position as Leon. United academy graduates Bendito Mantato, Shea Lacey, Sekou Kone and Elyh Harrison have all been training with the first team at Carrington recently and are hoping to earn a place on the plane to the US.",
      "Harrison, a 19-year-old goalkeeper, has a good chance with Andre Onana still on the comeback from an injury. The others are currently in limbo, with club staff in talks with the representatives of various academy players over possible loan moves for the 2025/26 season.",
      "Amorim is still yet to decide who he wants to keep and who would be better served by leaving for game time. It is understood that Dan Gore, Ethan Wheatley, Tyler Fredricson and Toby Collyer could all leave in the coming weeks, either on loan or permanently, with United keen to clear the pathway from academy to first team.",
      "United begin their pre-season against Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday before the squad travels to the USA, where they will take part in the Premier League Summer Series. They will face West Ham in New Jersey on July 27, before games against Bournemouth and Everton in Chicago and Atlanta.",
      "United will then play Fiorentina at Old Trafford in their final pre-season game on August 9, before starting their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on August 17."

      "Ruben Amorim’s hard line stance over Manchester United’s unwanted players does not have complete approval from the club’s staff. United have placed Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia in the ‘bomb squad’ while they try to sell them – but the decision has caused divisions.",
      "The five players have been told they have no future under Amorim at United and are therefore seeking transfers to other clubs. Rashford, Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have been isolated from the first-team squad, forced to train separately in order to draw a line between the two groups.",
      "They are ordered to arrive at Carrington after 5pm, when the rest of the players have left for the day. While not unheard of in elite football, it is a brutal way of dealing with unwanted players and it is yet to bear fruit, with United struggling to sell the five players.",
      "Rashford is holding out for a move to Barcelona, Garnacho’s £70million valuation has put off Napoli, Real Betis want Antony but can’t afford him, Sancho has been shopped around without luck so far and Malacia is unattractive after a series of injuries.",
      "The Athletic reports that the bomb squad approach is contentious inside the club, with some worried it sends the wrong message. There is also the fact that making it obvious the players are unwanted risks lowering their transfer value, especially as the September 1 transfer deadline approaches.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m, and given him Rashford’s No.10 shirt, but negotiations for Bryan Mbeumo have dragged on. The club needs to offload Rashford, who earns £325,000-a-week, Garnacho and Sancho in order to free up space in the squad and provide more funds for transfers.",
      "“It's just the players and the mentality of some of them, who simply have to leave. You need players who will run through brick walls and who won't question, but will just get on with it.",
      "“You can question certain things, but go and see the manager if you've not played, have it out in his office. Don't do it in the press or on social media. You see some of the stuff that's out there and it's so disrespectful, what some of the players are doing.",
      "“You look at some of the players and their body language, and I think I'd much rather have 10 average players who will work their socks off than these prima-donnas who don't care.”"

      "AC Milan enquired about the possibility of landing Rasmus Hojlund from Manchester United, soon after after the Red Devils renewed their attempts to sign Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been chasing the Brentford frontman for weeks, but has seen the saga drag on. Now the club have returned with a fresh package worth £70million, which they hope will be enough to get the Bees to finally cash in on their leading light.",
      "The Dane previously played and impressed in Italy, which convinced United to spend more than £70m on the unproven striker who was then at Atalanta. He's been unable to deliver consistently at Old Trafford and now a move back to Serie A could be on the cards.",
      "Hojlund has been linked with Inter Milan, but their San Siro rivals could now join the party. United will have to accept a considerable loss on their striker, but just how much they demand remains to be seen.",
      "Milan finished a disappointing eighth last term, meaning they are without European football. Christian Pulisic top scored for them with 17 goals but Tijjani Reijnders, who chipped in with 15 goals, has left for Manchester City and the Rossoneri are yet to sign a striker this summer.",
      "United's desire to add more firepower stems from the lack of goals in their team last term. They struggled in the final third and didn't have anyone in attack they could rely on to consistently come up trumps in front of goal. Hojlund scored just four Premier League goals last term.",
      "Amorim accepted that the player was short of expectations, but acknowledged he was bereft of confidence and claimed it was on the entire team to service him and help him out of his rut.",
      "\"I think if you look at the games we have several players that miss big chances, not just Rasmus,\" he said. \"Of course, Rasmus, the game is to score goals because he's a striker, but it's a team thing. I already said that. Our team should score more goals, it's not just Rasmus missing chances.\"",
      "Amorim also added: \"It's a team thing. Of course, we have an idea of what this team needs but also the guys we play with, we play at least three guys in front to score goals and we have midfielders that can. All the team needs to score more goals and you have opportunities with the midfielders and the striker. We need to improve as a team because if you don't score goals in this league it's impossible to win games.\""

      "Kick-off for Manchester United's pre-season opener against Leeds United at the Strawberry Arena in Stockholm has been delayed by ten minutes.",
      "The start time has been pushed back by ten minutes after reports of heavy traffic outside the stadium. The contest will not kick-off at 2.10pm BST instead of 2pm.",
      "For the second time in three years, United are opening their pre-season campaign against their Premier League counterparts in Scandinavia, after beating the Whites 2-0 in Norway in 2023.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has taken a 29-man squad with him to the Swedish capital and could hand out unofficial debuts to summer signings Diego Leon and Matheus Cunha this afternoon.",
      "The latter arrived from Wolves for £62.5million last month and will be keen to make his mark on United's attack from the off. He scored 17 goals across all competitions last season.",
      "United starting XI: Bayindir; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Casemiro, Collyer, Leon; Fernandes, Cunha; Obi.",
      "Follow the LIVE blog below for regular updates...",
      "That's a couple of fouls on Cunha now, which he has to take as a compliment. He will have to watch his discipline more closely at United than at Wolves, where he missed six games last season after a couple of impetuous scraps against Ipswich and Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha executes a few stepovers, evoking cheers from the crowd, and is brought to the ground. It wouldn't be a surprise if some fans have bought tickets just to watch him. Mazraoui was just encouraged to shoot from the edge of the box by the crowd, but he took the sensible option and retained possession.",
      "Then Cunha was fouled again. I think we'll write that a lot this season.",
      "United are still feeling their way into this game. They are yet to have a meaningful spell in possession or get their creators involved.",
      "Leon was just caught out of position and Leeds came close to scoring. The cross flashed across the box and was eventually cleared. United were let off the hook. Gnonto is a dynamic forward and is already causing problems down Leon's side.",
      "Have said it before and will say it again: United would be better off with Heaton in goal whenever Onana is unavailable. Bayindir was shaky again there, though he was not helped by how open United were down the left. Quite why Luke Shaw is starting is anyone’s guess. He should be at the back of the centre-back pecking order as a point of principle.",
      "Collyer told me on tour last year he needed to improve on how he uses the ball. It's quite a shift for him to go from a deep role to one so advanced. I'm not sure whether that's beneficial for him but Fernandes should certainly be operating as a midfielder more often now.",
      "United have a surfeit of 10s and are not as well stocked in midfield, where Fernandes has played brilliantly on a number of occasions.",
      "Toby Collyer has started in the right hand-side No.10 role, which means Bruno Fernandes is deeper alongside Casemiro. Well done to Samuel for getting that right (have a look earlier in the blog).",
      "And we're off. There was a minute's silence held for Diogo Jota before kick-off and Bruno Fernandes handed over the traditional pre-season gift. Some reports suggested that wouldn’t happen.",
      "United's pre-season campaign is up and running.",
      "A minute's silence is taking place ahead of kick-off in memory of Diogo Jota and Andre Silva, who both died in a car accident earlier this month.",
      "The two sides are out at the Strawberry Arena and kick-off is just moments away.",
      "Some tinpot Leeds fan music is being played and their supporters are enjoying themselves on the left side of the press box. There are white shirts dotted around the remainder of the stadium but it's mostly a sea of red.",
      "The countdown to kick-off at the Strawberry Arena is very nearly over, following a small delay. You can follow regular updates and analysis on this matchday blog.",
      "There is no need to refresh the page, updates will appear automatically.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim has outlined what he wants to see from new signing Matheus Cunha on his first outing for the club this afternoon.",

He deserved to have his contract extended and was unfortunate to suffer a few small injuries last season.",
      "The players took their time to come out for their warm-up - something appeared off - and United have just confirmed kick-off will be delayed by 10 minutes at the Strawberry Arena.",
      "United have just confirmed kick-off at the Strawberry Arena has been delayed by ten minutes due to heavy traffic around the ground.",
      "We are now scheduled for a 2.10pm kick-off BST.",
      "Read the full story by clicking here.",
      "It's been suggested Toby Collyer will play as a No.10 with Bruno Fernandes next to Casemiro in midfield. Perhaps there'll be a giveaway in the warm up before the game starts.",
      "They've just handed out an interesting team sheet, which includes the coaching staff. Newly appointed Acacio Valentim (Jackie Kay's replacement) is supposedly on the bench. Valentim is set to work closely with the players within the dressing room and oversee team operations.",
      "An interesting team sheet, which includes the coaching staff. Newly appointed Acacio Valentim (Jackie Kay’s replacement) supposedly on the bench, as @mjcritchley just pointed out #mufc pic.twitter.com/76Y7gAY6YZ",
      "Diego Leon's inclusion is one of the few vaguely interesting calls as he is considered a contender for a senior squad berth. The feeling at United is that he is at a more advanced level, physically, than the waifish Sekou Kone was when he arrived last year.",
      "Jack Fletcher's squad inclusion is positive after he was troubled by a knee problem towards the end of last season.",
      "Very much a rotational side from Ruben Amorim with little to read into it. It's clearly not United's strongest available to him and the inclusion of Chido Obi, which some might consider significant, is offset by the presence of Toby Collyer and Casemiro in midfield. That is not a long-term partnership and you suspect some of the calls are based on where players are at with their fitness.",
      "Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu and Ramus Hojlund, for example, arrived a little later after international duty but then so did Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes.",
      "We should get a better idea of Diego Leon's level this afternoon. The defender has impressed coaches in training at Carrington since his arrival from Cerro Porteno and the decision to send Harry Amass on loan suggests Leon could stay and contribute to the first-team squad.",
      "Leon promised to \"kill it\" in pre-season and it will be impressive if he can win a role in the squad for this season.",
      "As expected, Ruben Amorim's starting XI has a rotational feel to it. It is not the XI that will start the season opener against Arsenal in a month's time.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw are making up the back-three this afternoon and the chances are De Ligt may be the only member of that trio to start on August 17.",
      "Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are on the bench and could all feature at some point.",
      "It's interesting that Bruno Fernandes starts in one of the No.10 roles. The expectation is Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo will start in those positions, with Fernandes playing in a deeper role.",
      "Ruben Amorim regularly used Fernandes in the pivot last season, but the 30-year-old is most effective when he's in prominent areas of the pitch. Having said that, Fernandes tends to deliver wherever he plays.",
      "Matheus Cunha starts his first game for United. Fans in Norway last summer didn't get much of a spectacle, but supporters today have been treated to a strong starting team. Cunha emerged onto the pitch just before the teams were confirmed and he was given a loud cheer.",
      "Casemiro also received loud applause and he starts in midfield alongside Toby Collyer, who has probably been forgotten about by some after a few small injuries. Chido Obi leads the attack and Rasmus Hojlund is on the bench.",
      "Obi performed well on the post-season tour and will be hopeful of finding the back of the net again before he is replaced, presumably at half-time.",
      "Matheus Cunha emerges from the tunnel pic.twitter.com/PlorHEFajp",
      "Leeds United boss Daniel Farke has named his team for this afternoon's game.",
      "Today's #LUFC Starting XI... pic.twitter.com/P5BCxLW9B9",

      "Substitutes: Heaton, Mee, Dalot, Dorgu, Fredricson, Heaven, Kukonki, Maguire, Munro, Yoro, J. Fletcher, Kone, Mainoo, Mount, Ugarte, Hojlund, Mantato, Williams.",
      "The all-important team news from the Strawberry Arena is due to be confirmed at 12.45pm.",
      "Sean Longstaff's transfer to Leeds is a blast from the past. United wanted him six years ago and were quoted £50million by Newcastle.",
      "Daniel James, who did join United that summer, is well embedded at Leeds. Former Swansea winger James eventually got back to his level after a purple patch at United, dropping back down into the Championship with Leeds.",
      "As largely meaningless as pre-season games are, the players can't treat them as such. They can feel like they're in a lose-lose situation as if they don't perform, there's criticism and if they do perform, the caveat is that it is only pre-season.",
      "But Rasmus Hojlund needs to score today. He was actually worse in the post-season tour than he was during last season and it could not have ended early enough for him. His best contribution in the final five months of 2024-25 was to draw that panicky foul from Emiliano Martinez on the final day.",
      "Hojlund scored in Scandinavia back at his old club Copenhagen in the 2023 Champions League group stage and he needs to regain faith from his manager and supporters. We can dismiss pre-season form and results but the players can't and Hojlund has to turn up today."

      "Bryan Mbeumo finally looks to be on his way to Old Trafford after Brentford accepted United's latest bid with his medical expected to take place this weekend.",
      "With that deal close to being finalised, focus can shift elsewhere and it looks as though another attacking signing will be targeted. A number of top clubs are looking at strikers and that has left Ruben Amorim and Co. with limited options as Viktor Gyokeres looks to be joining Arsenal while Liverpool are in advanced discussions for Hugo Ekitike.",
      "However, Benjamin Sesko is still available and the RB Leipzig striker is certainly being considered by those at United. Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson is another option but their asking price could make any deal hard to complete.",
      "Sanctioning exits is another priority with Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Marcus Rashford all free to depart. The latter's dream move to Barcelona, while unlikely, is still possible but the latest claims have seen him linked with a move to bitter rivals Liverpool.",

      "It is claimed there is an agreement billed as an 'anti-Italy' clause which prevents Galatasaray from selling their star striker to another Italian team until 2027. Should they break this clause, the Istanbul club would likely have to double the price of the deal to a Serie A team to make it worth their while.",

      "It is understood that Barca's manager Hansi Flick has spoken to Rashford and has agreed to the club pushing ahead for the 27-year-old. MEN Sport understands that the goal for Rashford has always been to join Barca and that he has employed the efforts of a Spanish agency to try and push through a move to the club.",
      "The forward wanted to move to La Liga in January when it became clear that his relationship with Ruben Amorim had reached breaking point. However, he ended up moving to Aston Villa instead.",
      "From United's perspective, the departure of Rashford this summer was seen as being a foregone conclusion. Following his loan stint at Villa, the West Midlands club decided not to activate the forward's £40m option to buy.",
      "He would then inform United, along with Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, that he wished to move on this summer. Despite being handed an extended break to push through a move elsewhere, Rashford has returned to Carrington in recent weeks to undertake an individual training plan.",
      "While there had been a desire to sell Rashford permanently, a loan move was always seen as the best option for Barcelona. Their financial position has been heavily scrutinised by La Liga and a loan with option to buy is seen as the quickest way to get this deal done.",
      "Barcelona's sporting director Deco mentioned earlier this summer that his team wanted to purchase Rashford. Flick's side have been looking for a winger who can also play as a centre-forward when needed and Rashford fits that bill.",
      "Their initial top target was Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams. However, the forward signed a ten-year contract extension at the Basque club to end Barca's hopes of signing him."

      "Matheus Cunha signed last month, Bryan Mbeumo will sign this month and Sir Dave Brailsford is being phased out. The road to recovery has begun smoothly for Manchester United.",
      "The club is making decisions they should be making. Mbeumo fit the bill two years ago and the smart move (and money) would have been to go for him last year when most eyes were fixed on his Brentford teammate, Ivan Toney.",
      "A source who has dealt with Mbeumo billed him as a \"terrific guy and a proper professional\". One of his close relatives was already a United fan, which helped matters despite Mbeumo's close relationship with Thomas Frank, who lobbied new club Tottenham to move for him.",
      "Brentford verbally accepted United's offer on Thursday and the news emerged on Friday. The only 'deadline' was United's flight to Chicago on Tuesday. Mbeumo should now be on it.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "Andre Onana had advised Mbeumo to choose United over Tottenham and sources confirmed he is \"so happy\" that his fellow Cameroonian is now United-bound. That sentiment is shared by the rest of the United dressing room.",
      "Cunha is a spikier character and one source at Wolves said he would \"turn on the charm\" in certain scenarios. Any squad worth its salt needs some edge and United's best player of the past 12 years has been Bruno Fernandes, one of the most truculent players in the Premier League.",
      "Cunha auditioned for United with his virtuoso matchwinning performance on Boxing Day. It wasn't a one-off. He got 15 Premier League goals last season and he was an appealing target during his first full campaign in Wolverhampton in 2023-24.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are the latest United additions who scored against them. Both are Premier League quality, albeit at clubs with expectations a fraction of United's. A cynic might question whether United can thrive with the best players bought from clubs lower down the Premier League food chain.",
      "No signing is foolproof but recruiting from the league is a significant shift from United. They cut corners as recently as last summer with Joshua Zirkzee, a Dutchman with a release clause playing in a league that has been in decline for nearly 20 years.",
      "The corner-cutting was often expensive under Erik ten Hag, whether it be reuniting him with an overpriced Ajax alumni or someone who suddenly joined his agent's stable. Granted, there were a couple of English players Ten Hag coveted (Declan Rice and Harry Kane) but his hit rate was undermined by the sheer volume of Dutch-schooled signings.",
      "Until this summer, Mason Mount was the only player United bought from a Premier League club since Harry Maguire in 2019. Whatever United's strategy, they have always made a pig's ear of it or swiftly reneged on it.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are deals that will generate plenty of nods of approval. They strengthen the first team, offer goals, versatility and vibrancy. United have been at pains to stress they are not recruiting players for Ruben Amorim's singular 3-4-2-1 system and that is true of Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "United should feel pretty bullish when they emerge from the Stretford End tunnel against Arsenal four weeks on Sunday. Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad, Bruno Fernandes and Leny Yoro could be in their line-up. Mbeumo and Cunha are more than £130m of attacking talent going into a team that recorded an unforgivable -10 goal difference last season.",
      "There is still the glaring issue of the No.9. Amorim might be reduced to his haunches sooner than usual on the opening weekend if he sees Viktor Gyokeres with a cannon stitched onto his shirt and glances across at Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "If there is no new striker by then, Amorim has to omit Zirkzee and Hojlund from that first XI as a point of principle. The resale value argument has gone out the window with five United players already in the bomb squad and United know if they are to shift Hojlund it will almost certainly be on a season-long loan.",
      "Amorim benched Hojlund and Zirkzee as far back as February. United did not score and lost 2-0 at home to Crystal Palace. Amorim always picked a striker after that experiment.",
      "The sudden return of Zirkzee, more effective in a withdrawn role, for the Europa League final was a desperate measure and hardly a ringing endorsement for Hojlund, who fired blanks again in Bilbao before he made way. That was the 16th game United failed to score in.",
      "Mbeumo was on target four days later, in his final appearance for Brentford. Cunha was on the opposing side."

      "Reluctant to sit around and wait for an opportunity that might have never come, Grimshaw, who was born and raised in nearby Burnley, joined Preston North End in January 2016, joining the club on a two-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee.",
      "\"You could see a few of the changes in the club that were set in motion then that might still be affecting the club today. As soon as Sir Alex left, you could tell there was a change of atmosphere in the club.",
      "\"It had gone from having a real family sort of feel. You can look back with rose-tinted glasses, can't you, but I think I was privileged enough to be there in a very special era and that was in the twilight years of that period.",
      "\"I suppose I was just privileged to be there then. I can't speak too much for what has gone on over the last ten years or so, but I think times have changed, and I was just happy to spread my wings and was realistic enough to recognise that if you have not made it by about 20, you're probably not going to.",
      "\"You have to go elsewhere and try to forge a career for yourself elsewhere.\"",
      "Grimshaw arrived at Deepdale nursing an injury that sidelined him for six months. It meant his Preston debut was delayed until the opening weekend of the 2016/17 campaign.",
      "His time at the Championship club was difficult, limiting him to just eight appearances. He joined Chesterfield on loan for the second half of the 2016/17 campaign.",
      "Having left United to drop into the Championship to try and make a name for himself, Grimshaw could have easily felt a sense of disappointment at finding himself in League One just 12 months later. However, he is adamant he has no regrets about how his United career came to an end.",
      "\"I suppose at the time I got to an age where I had played plenty of reserve team football and had trained plenty enough with the first-team as well,\" he explained. \"But I got to an age when I got fed up of playing in the reserves and I wanted to go and test myself.",
      "\"You want to prove yourself in senior football and I had the opportunity to go to Motherwell on loan [in September 2015] and I took it. I took it with both hands, to be honest.",
      "\"I fancied getting out there and testing myself and I played 15 games at Motherwell while on loan and did relatively well and Preston then signed me from Man United. It would have been nice to have had an appearance for the first-team, but at the same time, I was more than realistic enough to know that those who make it into the first-team are few and far between.",
      "\"I definitely have no complaints. It would have been nice. A few of my pals who were in digs with me stayed and did get a couple of appearances, so you never know if I would have stayed. But there are certainly no regrets.\"",
      "Grimshaw, who has been without a club since leaving Dundee United in August last year, has fond memories of his time at United. He was in the company of household names throughout his time at Old Trafford, not least Ferguson.",
      "The legendary United boss, who retired at the end of the 2012/13 campaign, made a lasting impression on Grimshaw, who was often impressed by the high standards he set for everyone associated with the club.",
      "Grimshaw recalled: \"I do remember going into his office, him sitting me down and United offering me a two-year deal. It is a very special memory.",
      "\"His persona and his aura was incredible, but he was just so down to earth, really. Whenever I had any dealings with him around the club, he would always be speaking to anyone in the club like he spoke to Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "\"He would be speaking to the kit staff or the chefs like he did to his first-team players. I think that is certainly one reason why they had so much success over his time at Man United.\"",
      "After returning to Preston following his loan spell at Chesterfield in the second half of the 2016/17 season, Grimshaw, who has also flexed his muscles at right-back during his career, departed Deepdale again at the end of the 2017 summer transfer window, returning to former loan club Motherwell on a permanent basis.",
      "It was the beginning of a successful marriage between himself and the Scottish Premiership outfit. Grimshaw spent five years at Fir Park, playing more than 100 games for the club.",
      "Motherwell are one of three Scottish clubs Grimshaw has played for in his career, also representing Dundee United and Greenock Morton.",
      "\"It might sound a bit daft, but I think the Scottish game itself, and I don't know if it is now, was like how the English game was 20 or 30 years ago,\" said Grimshaw when asked why he was able to thrive in Scotland. \"It was very up and at them.",
      "\"Even though the quality might not always be there in some of the games, they are always high energy games and that suited the way I played. I just got on well with the people up there; they were very down to earth and similar sort of people to where I'm from back home.",
      "\"Motherwell was the perfect club for that. They were a very community-driven club. I have still got a lot of my pals up there now, and that is not just football players - it's people in the community as well, such as Motherwell fans.",
      "\"I just settled really quickly, and my wife and I spent the vast majority of our adult lives there after leaving Burnley when we were about 19 or 20. We were up there for the best part of ten years.",
      "\"I have nothing but good things to say about Scotland and the people. They are very friendly. I also think the Scottish game doesn't get the credit it deserves. I know a lot of folk in England poke a bit of fun.",

      "After leaving Dundee United in August last year, Grimshaw is yet to find himself a new club. He is now spending a lot of time travelling with his wife and young daughter.",
      "His travels give him an excuse to enjoy one of his favourite hobbies: writing. The former United youngster has a passion for putting his experiences and thoughts down on paper, and his personal blog - Thoughts from the Foothills - is his platform to do so.",
      "Outlining his passion for writing, Grimshaw said: \"I was always into my writing at school; I loved writing. I never did it outside of school, but I suppose it came quite naturally in English classes and that sort of stuff.",
      "\"I probably didn't write for ten years after school, maybe longer, to be honest, in any sort of capacity. In fact, I tell a lie, I did a couple of bits for a family in Motherwell when I was first up there when I was 19.",
      "\"My brother is a professional cricketer in the Lancashire League for Rishton and he had a really good season for Ramsbottom. They won the Worsley Cup which is a big cup for the Lancashire league and they had an incredible season.",
      "\"He scored more runs than anyone has ever scored in that cup competition in history. Michael Clarke, an Australian batter, is below him, a few West Indians, top names, and he was top of that. He got 149 in the final and I wrote a poem about it.",
      "\"I don't know why, but it was a great day, a brilliant day and hundreds of people were there. From then on, I just carried on with my writing because I enjoyed doing it and I thought 'why not, I'll keep writing'.",
      "\"I suppose I just needed somewhere to post a few of my bits, really, so I set up my website which I post on semi-regularly; I should post on it more, and I am going to try and post on it more. I suppose with travelling at the minute, I have got a bit more content themes, in terms of explaining what I'm doing. I have a bit more inspiration for my writing at the minute with being away.",
      "\"I was trying to raise some money for charity and I wrote a poem about Burnley. Burnley is my team; I'm a Burnley lad.",
      "\"I worked with a local illustrator on that and we were raising money for a local charity. It didn't do as well as I'd hoped, but I still managed to raise about £500 or £600 for two local families who had just had deaths in the family, so they were two grieving local families and we raised some money for their local charities, so that was good, and it is still available on the website now.\"",
      "Grimshaw created his blog with the idea of sharing his passion for sport, history, poetry and travel.",
      "\"Basically, it is just a platform for me to write down my thoughts on a range of things,\" he continued. \"I like writing about sport. I am very keen on history and travel.",
      "\"I have quite a passion for travel. If I am in a new city, I try to get to a sporting event or obviously try and find out about its history.",
      "\"For example, while we're in Melbourne, we are going to as many things as we can. We are going to see Rugby League and go to the races; I love my racing.",
      "\"I have a big passion for sport and history, and getting it down on paper is a hobby of mine. I have been paid to do a few articles for Nutmeg Magazine in Scotland, which is a really good football magazine. I think I have done about eight articles for them, and one of them got picked up for The Herald in Scotland.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "\"I have done a few bits and bobs, but it is definitely something I would like to try and investigate more and put a bit more time into it as well.\"",
      "Summarising his love for writing, Grimshaw concluded: \"That is exactly it. I have always enjoyed doing different things outside of football, but early on in my career, with the pressures of coming through at a place like Man United and moving on, you are always striving for the next thing and sometimes my focus would have 100 per cent been on football.",
      "\"That never wavered, don't get me wrong, but I think over time, I just learnt to use other things alongside my football. Sometimes you have to take a step away and relax and I think my writing was one of those things that helped me do it.",
      "\"Some lads would go and play golf or have a beer, but I think writing was certainly one thing for me. I would also enjoy watching live sports. It is a bit of a hobby and I have been lucky enough to have had a couple of pieces picked up off different places.",
      "\"I think I should definitely continue with it, and you never know where it might lead.\""

      "Kobbie Mainoo will be hoping to remind everyone of his talent this season and already looks in good condition. Mainoo could start alongside Bruno Fernandes in the pivot.",
      "Amad and Joshua Zirkzee seem likely to start in attack, although the majority of Scandinavian supporters will be most excited to watch Cunha after his £62.5million transfer from Wolves. Cunha is an entertainer on the pitch and has the potential to become an immediate fan favourite.",

      "School Sport Magazine published a weekly diary from the player in January 2021 that shares these details. In it, he acknowledges training a year group up with the under-15 and under-16 schoolboy scholars at United.",
      "In the particular week in question, Munro played matches for the under-14s and under-15s on the same Saturday, the latter of which was against Leeds of all teams. Munro also details that he played in central midfield at the time and was part of a tennis club with his family."

      "Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho's transfer exit has reportedly taken a new twist as Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest are thought to be preparing an offer for him.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea after a public fallout with Erik ten Hag in September 2023. Following a loan stint at Borussia Dortmund in the second half of that campaign, it was claimed that the winger and Ten Hag had resolved their differences.",
      "Yet on deadline day, United agreed a loan with an obligation to buy deal with the Blues for Sancho. After an underwhelming spell at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea were reportedly not able to agree a salary with Sancho and the obligatory transfer fell through with Enzo Maresca's side forced to pay £5m in compensation to United.",
      "Since then, the Englishman has made it clear he wants to leave Old Trafford permanently and he has been heavily linked with a move to Juventus. However, The Sun understands that Forest are willing to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "It is claimed the East Midlands club are working hard to replace Anthony Elanga who joined Newcastle for £55m this summer - a deal which the Reds benefitted from. One option that Forest have shortlisted to fill that gap in their squad is Sancho.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo's team are believed to be confident that Sancho could follow a similar redemption arc that Elanga managed at the City Ground. This is not thought to be the first time that Forest have been interested in the winger.",
      "They were believed to be keen on a Sancho loan last summer but, of course, Chelsea won the race. However, with European football guaranteed in some capacity this season, a move to Forest could be seen as more appealing this time round.",
      "Sancho has also been linked with a move to the Turkish Super Lig with former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said to be keen on signing him at Besiktas. Earlier this week, Sancho's Instagram post was hijacked by Turkish fans telling him to make the move to Turkey."

      "First up is Amad, a solid crowd favourite thanks to his performances last season. The Ivorian was impressive in the No.10 role but was also utilised at wing-back in Ruben Amorim's preferred 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "And it is on the wings where the 23-year-old starts in Stockholm and shows where Amad is likely to get most of his playing time in the 2025/26 campaign. The arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who is set to be a Red before the trip to the States, have made the battle for a spot in attacking midfield congested.",
      "A solid performance against Leeds would be a good way for Amad to stake his claim in this United team with Diogo Dalot clearly the biggest threat to the wide player's playing time. The other notable new role which is likely to become permanent this season is also in defence.",
      "Luke Shaw has played on the left of a back three for his country and could have featured more times there for United last season if it was not for injuries. Thankfully, he is fully fit for the start of pre-season and that is where he is positioned against the Whites.",

      "United have been locked in talks with Brentford for just over six weeks, meaning they will now be hoping it will be third time lucky in their quest to lure him to Old Trafford. Mbeumo made it crystal clear several weeks ago that he wants to move to M16.",
      "After scoring 20 Premier League goals last season, Mbeumo would be a second statement signing of the summer for United. They have already splashed out £62.5m on bringing Matheus Cunha, who scored 17 goals last term, to the club from Wolves.",
      "Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in head coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and there is a strong chance Mbeumo could be installed as the right-sided playmaker. His versatility, though, means he could be deployed elsewhere.",
      "Primarily a winger throughout his time at Brentford, Mbeumo is renowned for cutting in from the right and making full use of his trustworthy left foot. It means he could be an option as either the right-sided No.10 or right wing-back for Amorim.",
      "Amad, who regularly blossomed for United last term, is also equally capable as a right-sided No.10 or right wing-back. With that said, the worst that can happen is that Amad and Mbeumo create healthy competition for each other and a selection dilemma for Amorim.",
      "With Cunha a guaranteed starter and Mbeumo expected to be given the same treatment if he finalises a switch to M16 without any further setbacks, Amorim's first-choice starting XI for the 2025/26 will be closer towards completion.",
      "As things currently stand, United are still in the market for a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper, meaning they will soon have to flex their muscles in the seller's market to fund those prospective additions.",
      "Despite currently being unavailable because of a hamstring injury, Andre Onana is expected to remain United's first-choice goalkeeper this season. United want to recruit a shot-stopper who can compete with and push the Cameroonian, but Onana is under the impression he will remain Amorim's No.1.",
      "United are well-stocked at centre-back and pre-season performances could dictate who starts the season opener against Arsenal in a month's time. Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are the future of United's backline and will believe they are worthy of becoming staples in the wide centre-back roles, while Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire will be fighting to start in the middle.",
      "On the presumption Mbeumo is deployed in attack, Amad is the logical pick at right wing-back after regularly catching the eye on the right flank last season. Meanwhile, Patrick Dorgu is a shoo-in on the opposite flank and will be keen to improve after arriving from Lecce earlier this year.",
      "Following Cunha's arrival, Bruno Fernandes is expected to complete a permanent switch to midfield and occupy one of the two No.8 spots. He regularly operated from the engine room in the second half of last term and rarely looked out of place.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer and Casemiro are all currently jockeying to join Fernandes in midfield, but the club remains keen on signing a new midfielder. Who that could be is currently impossible to predict.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha will build two thirds of Amorim's attack, occupying the two No.10 spots. The United chief struggled in his search for consistency in those two roles last season, meaning it is highly likely those positions could be occupied by new faces.",
      "United's need for an out-and-out centre-forward has been well-documented throughout the summer, and they attempted to solve that particular mission quickly by swooping for Liam Delap last month. However, Chelsea pipped them to his signature.",
      "The Reds have since been heavily linked with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen but are increasingly likely to miss out on both of them. Fortunately, the prospect of adding Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha should ease the attacking burden on whoever leads United's attack come the start of the season.",
      "United's dream XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, new midfielder, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; new striker.",

      "\"He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: Moving to Bayer Leverkusen would be a brilliant move for not just Antony but United too. Currently, the winger's heart is set on returning to Real Betis, which is fine, but they do not seem capable of paying the sort of figure that United are demanding. If Leverkusen were to enter the race, there is a likelihood that they would be able to match United's asking price. The Reds cannot afford to allow every player to go on the cheap just to get them off the books so there would definitely be a few in the recruitment team hoping the Bundesliga club change their mind.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko would be interested in signing for United should they come in for him this summer. The Slovenian entered talks with Arsenal earlier in the window but it now seems the Gunners' priorities are elsewhere.",
      "As for Sesko, who is valued at £78m, he is reportedly willing to give United priority even though they cannot offer him Champions League football.",
      "What MEN Sport says: It is clear that Ruben Amorim would prefer to sign Viktor Gyokeres in an ideal world this summer. However, that ship looks to have sailed and the attention must now switch to other targets. Sesko would be an impressive second choice. He has a very similar profile to Gyokeres - he is quick, strong and has an eye for goal. What potentially makes him an even better option than the Swede is his age. He is five years younger than Gyokeres which makes him a more enticing prospect for Ineos who favour signings with potential resale value. It will be interesting to see if this progresses further."

      "Manchester United appear to have been handed a transfer blow for one of their rumoured targets this summer.",
      "United have been linked with several potential new signings this summer across the vast majority of the squad. Matheus Cunha remains the only new addition to Ruben Amorim's squad that has been completed this summer, with Diego Leon also arriving after a deal was agreed earlier in the year.",
      "Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo continues to be a target for United, with a third bid being submitted to the Bees for the Cameroon international. United will hope to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo in the near future, which will then allow them to look at signing their remaining targets this summer.",
      "One player who has been linked with a move to United is Valencia star Javi Guerra. The Reds have been credited with an interest in signing Guerra this summer, but will now seemingly face competition for his signature.",
      "Transfer specialist Matteo Moretto has reported that AC Milan are now showing an interest in signing Guerra this summer. The 21-year-old's future at Valencia continues to be in doubt, with the report claiming that he is still waiting for the La Liga outfit to offer him a new contract.",
      "Amid the uncertainty, Milan are reported to be looking to capitalise on Guerra's contract situation by expressing an interest in his signature. Valencia and Milan are not yet in talks over a deal for Guerra, the report claims, but the Serie A giants are apparently already looking to present a contract offer to the midfielder in an effort to tempt him into a move to the San Siro.",
      "United could be in the market for a new midfielder this summer following Christian Eriksen's departure as a free agent. Guerra has been joined by the likes of Ederson at Atalanta and Corentin Tolisso of Lyon, who are also being linked with a summer transfer to Old Trafford."

      "Those five players have told United that they wish to explore opportunities elsewhere this summer.",

      "The aforementioned players were also allowed into Carrington before Ruben Amorim left.",

      "Garnacho attracted interest from Chelsea and Napoli in the January transfer window. His relationship with Amorim deteriorated last season but he retains strong market value.",
      "Chelsea broke their obligation to sign Sancho permanently after his Stamford Bridge loan spell last season, but Juventus have been heavily linked with a move for the 25-year-old.",
      "Antony impressed on loan at Real Betis and the Spanish side are keen to sign him permanently this summer. United would have to sell him for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR loss.",
      "Ruben Amorim will not speak to journalists after facing Leeds in Stockholm this weekend, which means fans must wait until his first press conference in the United States to hear his thoughts on transfer business.",

      "According to reports, FC Barcelona are ‘advancing’ to sign Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford, with David Ornstein revealing two key details.",
      "Barcelona have been heavily linked with Rashford in recent months and he finally appears to be nearing a move to the Spanish giants.",
      "At the end of 2024, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd after butting heads with head coach Ruben Amorim, who failed to kickstart a return to form for the forward at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford had been heavily criticised due to his poor form and attitude over 18 months and his struggles continued under Amorim before he decided that he needed a fresh start.",
      "However, Rashford’s woes at Man Utd and his huge salary provided stumbling blocks as Barcelona and other European giants opted against a move for the England international.",
      "Aston Villa ended up taking a risk on Rashford, signing him on loan with an option to buy for around £40m after selling Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr.",
      "This risk paid off as Rashford enjoyed a great spell at Villa Park, grabbing four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances.",
      "Villa were keen on a permanent move, but Rashford has been holding out for a bigger move following their failure to qualify for the Champions League, with Barcelona consistently mooted as a dream destination.",
      "Barcelona are in the market for a winger this summer and have been linked with Rashford, though their financial issues have caused problems in talks.",
      "However, The Athletic‘s David Ornstein has revealed that Barcelona have decided to ‘advance’ for Rashford after missing out on Nico Willians and Luis Diaz.",
      "Barcelona are said to have ‘made an offer’ for Rashford, with two key details being that this is a loan with an ‘option to buy’.",
      "It is also revealed that ‘this idea has been agreed to by United and although it is not yet a done deal, talks between all parties are now at the final stages’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Barcelona have been looking for an attacker who can operate in wide areas and up front, which makes Rashford an attractive option. Left-wing has been considered a priority for the club after they felt they were short of options in that position towards the end of last season.",
      "‘Head coach Hansi Flick has spoken to the 27-year-old England international and approved his arrival.’",
      "More to follow…",
      "Marcus Rashford should be the most sellable member of the five-man Manchester United bomb squad. But he’s not…",
      "Man Utd have reportedly reserved some money to buy Gabriel Sara from Galatasaray this summer, while there is an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Man Utd have agreed a £71m fee with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo but once Sir Jim Ratcliffe remembers he ‘won’t be held ransom’ they will need to find an alternative.",
      "Man Utd have ‘reached an agreement’ to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with the Red Devils set to pay £71m, according to reports.",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed that Man Utd have increased their offer to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford this summer.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly suggested that Barcelona could use one player if they wanted to reduce their asking price for Marcus Rashford."

      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "While no deal completed this summer can challenge the biggest overpays in Premier League history, plenty have already been made well in excess of a player’s reported market value.",
      "A few factors go into that assessment. Age, performance level and experience are inevitably taken into account but the number of interested teams, general market trends and the reputation and status of the leagues the selling and buying clubs belong to can also heavily dictate that that market value.",
      "And when it comes to those increasingly expensive intra-Premier League transfers there is basically a £10m surcharge applied before talks even commence.",
      "It is no coincidence that five of the seven biggest supposed overpays – going by the numbers crunched by the fine folk at Transfermarkt – involve a pair of Premier League clubs both trying to orchestrate PSR-friendly deals.",
      "Nor that Real Madrid account for the other two when they signed Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono.",
      "But those five Premier League overpays, made by four of the Big Six plus Newcastle, do beg the question as to who has been most royally screwed.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal)",
      "Fee: £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £34.7m",
      "If you listen to Arsenal supporters, which is medically inadvisable at the best of times, the Madueke signing is not only an egregious use of club funds but an act so deeply objectionable as to prompt petitions, protests and defaced murals.",
      "That the line for those deeply ‘entitled’ fans is drawn at their favourite football club making what they deem to be an underwhelming signing, rather than the shameful handling of the Thomas Partey debacle, is a cripplingly damning indictment on the modern world.",
      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",
      "As the most recent scorer of a Champions League knockout stage goal for Manchester United, Elanga even brings a degree of experience to a stage Newcastle are still adjusting to.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Spurs)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £39m",
      "There is always a quirk in the system and the idea Spurs overpaid for Kudus seems curious.",
      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",
      "Thomas Frank pinpointed Kudus as his main transfer target because of the “unpredictability” the Ghanaian can provide in attack at “almost the perfect age to perform and hit the next level”.",
      "While moving a player with those characteristics across enemy lines was always going to require some intricate negotiations, Spurs pushed it through at a price both parties could sell as a win.",
      "",

      "Marcus Rashford should be the most sellable member of the five-man Manchester United bomb squad. But he’s not…",
      "When they entered the summer, United were apparently hopeful of raking in around £160million for the five players everyone knows they want rid of.",
      "That, obviously, was ludicrous. The only club daft enough to pay top whack for these lads would be United themselves.",
      "So as the summer rolls on, United remain at an impasse with the transfers, unable to strengthen much further before they get rid of their drifters.",
      "How much can they hope to bank now? Is it possible they will start the season with all five still on their books? Here’s how we rank the unwanted stars based on how likely they are to earn some money for United…",
      "",
      "5) Tyrell Malacia\nPSV opted against taking up their option to sign Malacia for £9million because they’re not daft. The Netherlands defender started only three Eredivisie games after joining in January but at least he proved to any potential suitors that he’s not completely broken having spent over a year on the sidelines.",
      "Ruben Amorim didn’t aid United in their mission to sell Malacia when he revealed the 25-year-old hasn’t got it in him to play as a wing-back because he struggles to go forward. Which feels like something United ought to have spotted earlier but, as we know, they haven’t been the most observant bunch.",
      "So what now? United will apparently accept something like £3million just so Malacia doesn’t show as a loss on the books. Will anyone who can afford his £75,000-a-week salary stump up? Probably not.",
      "",
      "4) Jadon Sancho \nUnited need to hope there is some truth in reports Juventus want both Sancho and Francisco Conceicao since it seems the Old Lady has done a deal to sign the Portuguese winger from Porto.",
      "Regardless, whether it’s Juve or anyone else, United will have to accept they aren’t going to get anything like the £25million they hoped for. Frankly, they’ll be fortunate to bank anything while escorting Sancho off the premises one last time.",
      "The winger is on something ridiculous like £250,000 a week which he is due for another year. Chelsea offered him the chance to get away for less, but that wasn’t for him. Juve certainly won’t pay the same salary – reports suggest he’s being offered half. And we doubt Sancho is motivated enough to give up half of what he’s contractually owed to take up a great opportunity in Turin.",
      "And, to be fair, why should he? It makes sense for Sancho to sit tight, wait for a loan move at the end of the window, when United will have to accept paying only a portion of his salary for the reward of having him out the door. Then, in a year, after another season trousering an undeserved wedge, he gets to go as a free agent.",
      "So, if anyone is daft enough to offer actual money for Sancho, United ought to snap their hand off.",
      "",
      "3) Antony\nAside from Malacia, around whom all is deathly quiet, the least noise among the bomb squad is coming from Antony’s direction. Because it was thought Real Betis would find a way to bring back a winger who regained some credibility while on loan in Spain during the second half of last season.",
      "Can Betis afford to buy? Maybe, probably not. And they are cool with that being known. Because it will squeeze United ever more over a player who clearly has no future under Amorim.",
      "Of course, Betis would prefer Antony back on loan but United insist they won’t do that. At least not without guarantees and the Spaniards are toying with some workarounds. There are reports of interest from elsewhere but nothing firm enough for Betis to panic into making United an offer they might be satisfied to accept. Certainly not yet. And they are content in the knowledge Antony fancies being back in Andalusia.",
      "Apparently, United have already dropped the asking price from £40million to £30million, but they won’t get that either. Certainly not in the form of cold hard cash they can put towards their stalled summer recruitment.",
      "🔴⚪⚫ MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n👉 Amorim sacked for Xavi as Postecoglou returns: Predicting nine Premier League successors\n👉 Only West Ham more miserable than Man Utd in Premier League mood rankings",
      "",
      "2) Marcus Rashford\nRashford is probably United’s most sellable asset of the five. But that also means he can afford to be pickier when choosing his next move.",
      "Ideally, he would go to Barcelona. A few weeks ago, that appeared something of a pipe dream while Nico Williams was being teased by the Catalans. But Barca’s failure to close a deal for Williams highlights the financial constraints they remain under.",
      "If they can’t buy Williams, they probably can’t buy Rashford. But they can wait until the back end of the window before offering a loan deal with options or obligations, which at least gets the forward’s salary – or most of it – off United’s books.",
      "Barca can bide their time here because they know Rashford’s desire. Without something coming from nothing, the only obvious threat we see here is Bayern Munich, given the Bavarians and Liverpool are way, way off in their valuations of Luis Diaz. And even then, Leandro Trossard could be a cheaper option.",
      "",
      "1) Alejandro Garnacho\nThe Argentina winger probably represents United’s best chance of banking some cash. But certainly not the £70million they initially hoped for. Nor £60million after their first reduction. If they get anything more than half the price they were initially quoting, that’s a result.",
      "Why should they be grateful for that? Because Garnacho would be a risk for anyone taking on the his full rights this summer.",
      "As a player, we know he is limited. He has bursts, moments. For a winger, he’s not rapid and as a right-footer on the left, he struggles to go down the outside.",
      "If that doesn’t make buyers beware, his character ought to. There were red flags around Garnacho’s attitude even before he made his first senior start and all the evidence suggests little has changed.",
      "So the smart suitors will insist on trying before they buy, but someone of the not-unreasonable belief that United is more the problem, not the player, could be tempted by Garnacho. Probably Chelsea.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona are ‘advancing’ to sign Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford, with David Ornstein revealing two key details.",

      "7) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £122.1m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £127m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",

      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",

      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "",
      "26) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "25) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "24) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",

      "",
      "22) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",

      "21) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",

      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",

      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "A new report has revealed the ‘most realistic solution’ for Manchester City and England star Jack Grealish amid interest from Premier League rivals.",
      "Jack Grealish looks destined to leave Man City this summer but a £300k-a-week wage has made it hard for clubs to take the risk.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Every Cruyff turn is a footprint. Some players leave lasting impressions; others barely register. Was peak Eden Hazard the very best?"

      "20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seems as though Liverpool have taken Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead douses our suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan are looking into the feasibility of signing Hojlund as they search for a striker. United paid Atalanta £72million two years ago and the Rossoneri would struggle to give the Red Devils half of their money back. And even if Hojlund has struggled, from a numbers perspective, United simply cannot afford to shed any strikers since Hojlund is the only senior specialist centre-forward they currently have.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Juventus\nSky in Italy reckon Juve have ‘begun to explore the conditions’ around a deal to sign Rashford. Which is presumably when they discover they can’t afford him without one or two parties making serious concessions. Like Barcelona, the Old Lady would have to wait until United get desperate and start considering loans.",
      "",
      "17) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao which, presumably, will supress the Old Lady’s appetite for Sancho. And with the talk of Juve interest in Rashford, what now for Sancho?",

      "15) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Chelsea\nRogers is said to be Chelsea priority for the remainder of the window and while Villa are reluctant to sell, any big offer would have to be considered. If Rogers is to join Chelsea, likely triggering a Villa move for Jackson, it won’t be long before the end of the window.",
      "",
      "14) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko is back in the 20 after losing out to Gyokeres in Arsenal audition but, apparently, United are ‘serious’ about signing the Slovenian. Maybe they are, and Christ knows they need a striker, but they will have to start selling sharpish if they are to afford what Leipzig are demanding.",

      "10) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",

      "9) 🆕 Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags.

But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too.",

      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy.

      "4) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. And since Liverpool were prepared to go way above that for Isak, Eintracht will try to squeeze Liverpool for all they are worth, even if Ekitike is keen to move to Anfield.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion. Gyokeres’ representatives were apparently in London at the start of the week, and removal vans have been seen shifting furniture from his home in Portugal. If Arteta wants the striker on the plane for the pre-season tour, this needs to progress significantly in the next 24 hours.",

      "15-year season tickets, 40% of the capacity going to the corporates and an ‘American-style matchday experiences’ are all part of the new stadium proposals Man Utd have put to their fans.",
      "In March, the club announced plans to build a new stadium which will see the current Old Trafford knocked down. Now, with a date of 2030 set for opening, the club has asked for their fans’ verdicts on a number of measures that could come into effect when the new stadium is up and running.",
      "As revealed by Cheeses Of Nazareth, a Twitter account focused on United ticket details, the club reached out to supporters to take part in discussions about proposals for the new stadium.",
      "Although attendance was reportedly low, the club did set out a number of discussion points.",
      "First up, there was the idea of a long-term season ticket contract which involves paying a large upfront fee to secure your seat for 15 years or more. Purchasing this would also secure your seat from being reallocated should the club decide that was needed.",
      "Another proposal was that 40% of the 100,000-seater stadium would be for hospitality, including ‘premium viewing areas’ on the halfway line.",
      "Speaking of premium, that was a suggestion for a new model of season ticket which would give fans better chances of securing away tickets, access to concerts at the ground and premium stadium areas.",
      "But perhaps the suggestion that would most go against a typical English view of football is the ‘American-style Matchday Experience.’ This would see the concourse extended to include 360-degree screen bars, multiple smaller merchandise outlets instead of a single large megastore and the ability to move around the concourse with your ticket.",
      "This idea is not unique to United with clubs like Tottenham already having such a system in place.",
      "At the time of the stadium’s announcement, co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted it to be not just the “the world’s greatest football stadium” but also “the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area.”",
      "“Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world’s greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford,” Ratcliffe said.",
      "“Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport. By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience, only footsteps from our historic home.",
      "“Just as important is the opportunity for a new stadium to be the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area, creating jobs and investment, not just during the construction phase, but on a lasting basis when the stadium district is complete.",
      "“The Government has identified infrastructure investment as a strategic priority, particularly in the north of England, and we are proud to be supporting that mission with this project of national, as well as local, significance.”",

Contract agreed weeks ago with Mbeumo as he only wanted Man United move. After Cunha, Mbeumo next for #MUFC.’",

      "‘Not everybody at United agrees with the decision to limit their access to evening hours, however, given the relationships they have with people at the club. There is also the fear that ostracising them lowers their value in the transfer market, an awkward look at a time when ordinary workers are being laid off to cut costs.’",

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Djordje Petrovic – £22m/€28.8m (Chelsea to Bournemouth, July 2025)\nThe Chelsea transfer ethos in action: a player they signed for £12m on a seven-year contract and who played as many games for the Blues as Strasbourg was sold for almost twice as much within two years.",
      "",
      "18) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "19) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",
      "",
      "20) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",

      "Manchester United have agreed a £71m fee with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo but once Sir Jim Ratcliffe remembers he ‘won’t be held ransom’ they will need to find an alternative.",
      "After starting the bidding at £50m rising to £55m in early June and privately stressing the need to be patient, Manchester United have found an agreement with Brentford worth an initial £65m with £6m in add-ons.",
      "It is exceptional work as ever from the recruitment team, who might soon get cold feet and need to look at some alternatives.",
      "We took a look at FBRef for options across Europe’s top five leagues that have very similar characteristics to Mbeumo, which amusingly features one current Manchester United player they’re desperate to be rid of and one a club has just made a £40m profit on after signing him from United two years ago.",
      "",
      "Alex Berenguer (Athletic Club)\nProbably not the Athletic Club forward the fans would be dreaming of signing this summer, but if Barcelona and Arsenal can’t persuade Nico Williams to join them there’s not much hope for United. And they in turn are in absolutely no position to be sniffy about a 30-year-old winger who got more league goal contributions (14) last season than any of their players aside from Bruno Fernandes (18).",
      "",
      "Mattia Zaccagni (Lazio)\nThere’s interest from Nottingham Forest in the Lazio captain as they prepare for inevitable defeat to Tottenham in the not-so-secret Morgan Gibbs-White release clause saga, and without the funds to build a squad which aligns with the fanciful INEOS strategy of developing young talent with significant sell-on value, moves for relatively inexpensive but experienced footballers like Zaccagni make a lot of sense. It’s a ploy that’s worked famously for Inter Milan.",
      "",
      "Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig)\nHe’s a player we’re sure United would have been making a move for had they qualified for the Champions League – he would be ideal in the 3-4-3. As it stands, their Europa League vanquishers Tottenham are interested, as are Bayern Munich. Probably Bayern Munich then.",
      "",
      "Anthony Gordon (Newcastle)\nThe supposed similarity between Gordon and their primary target should perhaps raise United alarms as to the suitability of Mbeumo to the inverted winger role as Gordon is a proper winger’s winger – paint on the soles of his boots and all that.",
      "That said, we’re pretty sure Amorim wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to sign Gordon should he miraculously become an option.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi (Everton)\nHe was low-key excellent last season, with his nine Premier League goals and six assists comfortably beating his best previous return of 11 goal contributions in 2018/2019 for Arsenal. Primed for a £20m late-window bid before Fulham ask for an added £20m in United tax.",
      "",
      "Inaki Williams (Athletic Club)\nCan’t be easy living in his brother’s shadow, though we’re guessing the £220,000 Inaki gets a week to play football eases the pain somewhat. He’s not about to leave a club in the Champions League and even United won’t fork out those wages.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nJust brilliant. Not just because United are doing everything in their power to get him out of the club but also because he was deemed unsuited to Amorim’s system in the short time he was playing for him.",
      "And yes, we get the argument that Amorim has shown strength of character in showing ‘bad apples’ the door no matter their talent, but there won’t be a Red Devils fan out there not wondering – even briefly – whether a softer approach may have led to Rashford thriving at his boyhood club rather than at Aston Villa in the second half of last season and wherever he finds himself next term while United pay half his wages.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Newcastle)\nWe’re 99 per cent sure United would have rivalled Newcastle for Elanga’s £55m signing this summer had it not required an embarrassing climbdown after they sold him to Nottingham Forest for £15m two years ago.",
      "A report emerged after his stunning goal against United in April that while ‘there was an appreciation at the club for his phenomenal physical talents’, the club let him go due to ‘reservations over how he would parlay those skills into breaking down stubborn defences’.",
      "United do not now hold what we would suggest would have been the very same ‘reservations’ back then over a move for Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "Justin Kluivert (Bournemouth)\nHe’s someone we could genuinely see United genuinely pivoting to if they miss out on Mbeumo. A 26-year-old who’s perfect for one of those roles behind the central striker, coming off the back of a standout season playing for a club not in European competition with no more than an outside chance of achieving that feat in the coming campaign. A prime candidate.",
      "",
      "Cody Gakpo (Liverpool)\nBayern are supposedly keen and we’re currently at a point where we wouldn’t be particularly surprised by any forward either leaving or joining Liverpool. We would be surprised if any of them joined Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are set to make a ‘significant move’ for their next signing after Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Marcus Rashford should be the most sellable member of the five-man Manchester United bomb squad. But he’s not…",
      "Manchester United have reportedly reached a ‘verbal agreement’ for their fourth summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the next signing Man Utd will make once they have formally completed deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly reserved some money to buy Gabriel Sara from Galatasaray this summer, while there is an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Man Utd have ‘reached an agreement’ to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with the Red Devils set to pay £71m, according to reports."

After Cunha, Mbeumo next for #MUFC.’",

      "Aston Villa did a Chelsea by selling their women’s team to themselves to avoid a PSR breach and remove the need for unwanted player trading before June 30.",
      "But Villa’s ambitions on the pitch and in the transfer market mean they will likely need to stomach at least one high-profile departure this summer to create enough wiggle room in the current transfer window and beyond, with the amortisation of player registration costs meaning it pays to sell players and sign new ones.",
      "A stupid rule but one we’re all stuck with for now. Anyway, we’ve ranked Villa’s top ten most valuable players according to Transfermarkt by the likelihood of them being sold this summer, and have even reassigned them to willing beneficiaries.",
      "",
      "10) Boubacar Kamara (£36m) – Manchester United\nLoved by Villa fans and underrated by the rest, they’re so, so much better when Kamara’s in the team. He’s worth more to Villa than just about any Premier League side other than United, who haven’t officially admitted to Manuel Ugarte being a stunning waste of £42m but essentially have by accepting that Casemiro in central midfield incredibly remains their reality for next season.",
      "",
      "9) Ezri Konsa (£30m) – Manchester City\nWe really like Konsa and think he’s got as good a chance as anyone of starting the World Cup for England in Thomas Tuchel’s starting XI, though that perhaps sounds like higher praise than it actually is given the dearth of quality in that particular area of the pitch for the Three Lions.",
      "Anyway, he’s great and Villa shouldn’t sell him.",
      "But no-one’s untouchable in their circumstances and we’ve got a strong suspicion that City are walking into a season with a dodgy mix of young and injury-prone centre-backs.",
      "Neither Abdukodir Khusanov nor Vitor Reis convinced after arriving in January, and while the former showed signs he could develop into a quality defender, he may not be granted the luxury of easing into Premier League football when all of Manuel Akanji, John Stones and Nathan Ake are nailed on to be out of action for at least half a season.",
      "And even without widespread injury problems, we reckon Konsa would stand a very good chance of being first choice should he make the switch to the Etihad.",
      "",
      "8) Youri Tielemans (£33m) – Real Madrid\nWith Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni as his defensive midfield options, “Xabi is missing his ‘Xabi’,” sources close to the Real Madrid coach told ESPN. A’ deep-lying midfielder who can serve not only as a defensive asset but also a playmaking monster’ is essentially a description of Tielemans, who was linked with a move to the Bernabeu towards the end of his Leicester days.",
      "Villa will be loathe to lose him and we are just as uncomfortable at the thought of him not gliding across Premier League pitches next season.",
      "",
      "7) Pau Torres (£28m) – Real Madrid\nAlonso’s other Madrid priority is a new centre-back as David Alaba and Eder Militao continue to struggle with injuries while Antonio Rudiger looked at the Club World Cup as though age and years of sh*thousery are catching up with him.",
      "That leaves Alonso with young pair Dean Huijsen and Raúl Asencio, and after Torres very nearly moved to the Bernabeu in 2021, reports in April claimed Madrid were again keeping tabs on the 28-year-old.",
      "Our guess is Torres would be somewhere near the bottom of this ranking if it were up to Emery, who counted on the Spain international at Villarreal before signing him for Villa. But a decent offer for a player whose value is only going in one direction should be welcomed.",
      "",
      "6) Ian Maatsen (£24m) – Borussia Dortmund\nHis was far from the most suspicious PSR-swerving deal last summer. About four weeks before his move to the Midlands, Maatsen started the Champions League final for Borussia Dortmund and was named in that season’s team of the tournament. As an isolated deal, there could be no complaints.",
      "But we all smelled a rat given his deal was tied inextricably to Omari Kellyman’s opposite move to Chelsea.",
      "Just ten Premier League starts and a season of playing second fiddle to Lucas Digne provided decent further evidence of the transfer not being one Emery was calling out for last summer, which suggests he would be very much open to Maatsen once again being used as a pawn in this grim game of FFP chess they’re playing with whoever’s amenable.",
      "Short of a PSR pal both willing to sign Maatsen and able to attract him, a return to Dortmund it is.",
      "",
      "5) Amadou Onana (£43m) – Tottenham\nA bit of a shock for him to be Villa’s second-most valuable asset but that’s as much to do with him being 23 as it is his footballing quality, which is only good enough for the bench in Emery’s first-choice XI, with Kamara and Tielemans the undoubted best partnership at the base of midfield.",
      "That surely makes Onana a standout candidate to be shipped out, and without an obvious team outside of the Premier League willing to pay the usual premium for an as yet unproven midfielder at the very highest level, the Arsenal avenue presumably now closed following their signings of Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard and typically willing patsies for such signings Manchester United too cash-strapped to consider a bid, a move to Tottenham makes the most sense.",
      "They haven’t really got any defensive midfielders having not bothered with that sort of thing for a while, mate. And while Archie Gray is presumably still the long-term plan, he’s still a bit young and daft.",
      "",
      "4) Morgan Rogers (£48m) – Chelsea\nWhat absolutely none of us want is for Rogers to sign for a club that’s not going to play him in the season before a World Cup. The ideal would be for Rogers to be playing regularly for a team competing in the Champions League and challenging for trophies in a tournament campaign.",
      "Either of those things could happen at Chelsea, who have reportedly made him their ‘top target’ as they seek one more forward in preparation for the departures of Christopher Nkunku, Joao Felix and possibly Nicolas Jackson, whom Villa themselves are supposedly interested in.",
      "Villa have slapped an £80m price tag on him, presumably to ward off suitors rather than encouraging them as the 22-year-old – on the back of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio leaving after their loan spells – is the only clear hope for the future in Unai Emery’s attack. Then again, £80m is a lot of PSR wiggle room.",
      "",
      "3) Ollie Watkins (£36m) – Manchester United\nIt’s hard to imagine this summer transfer window not ending with Manchester United paying over the odds for Watkins having made a few quid on a couple of the bomb squad members when desperation to be rid of them sees lowball offers welcomed with open arms.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund struck what we would suggest is a HUGE BLOW by revealing he wants to stay at Old Trafford and fight what will presumably be a losing battle to start as United’s No.9 whether he actually has anyone to compete with for that position or not. Watkins’ reported interest in a move to United is likely as much to do with him being absolutely assured of a starting spot as much as anything else.",
      "Emery’s never been entirely convinced by Watkins, often starting Jhon Duran and then Rashford ahead of him, and given he turns 30 in December it feels like a good time to cash in, even if not quite at the full £60m they’re asking for.",
      "",
      "2) Leon Bailey (£24m) – Fenerbahce \nIt’s never quite worked for Bailey at Aston Villa but he’s by no means been terrible to the point where his value has plummeted – they bought him in 2021 for around £27m.",
      "Reports suggest Fenerbahce want a loan but Villa will hold out for his permanent transfer and a fee close to his valuation. Our guess is they may end up accepting a fair bit less to get him out of the door and off the wage bill.",
      "",
      "1) Jacob Ramsey (£28m) – Nottingham Forest\nForest want Ramsey as a replacement for Tottenham-bound Morgan Gibbs-White and this is the one with the most legs it seems, mainly and depressingly thanks to the two-word scourge of football – pure profit.",
      "We won’t get started on the ball-aching insanity of football clubs being encouraged to sell homegrown talent above all others to meet PSR demands, but it’s f***ing bullsh*t and looks set to force a transfer which we’re guessing neither Ramsey nor Villa actually want to happen.",

      "Man Utd made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, and have been pursuing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 12:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.",
      "Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, with agreement having now been reached over a £71 million deal for the Cameroon international.",
      "On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.",
      "But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson, Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko are the other situations United are monitoring.",
      "While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",

      "Juventus have enquired about Manchester United's Marcus Rashford.",
      "The Italian giants have begun to explore the conditions of a potential deal for the forward amid uncertainty over the future of Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "Juve's priority at centre-forward has been the return of Randal Kolo Muani, but if Vlahovic leaves, the club may look to sign another striker and they have been asking for information about Rashford.",
      "Barcelona are also keen but have made no approach at this stage.",
      "The forward has returned to Carrington despite being offered extra time off and is training away from the first team, using the medical and rehab facilities.",
      "The 27-year-old is among five Man Utd players who can explore a potential move away after expressing a desire to leave.",
      "Matheus Cunha has taken the No 10 shirt from Rashford, who said he wanted a \"new challenge\" before joining Aston Villa for the second half of last season.",
      "There have been no official offers for Rashford after he returned from his loan at Villa.",
      "Juventus are pushing for Manchester United's Jadon Sancho.",
      "Talks are open between Juve, United and Sancho's representatives as the Italian club look to have both Sancho and Porto's Francisco Conceicao on the wings.",
      "Juventus are currently finalising a permanent deal for Conceicao, who was on loan there last season, worth almost £28m (€32m) and paid in four instalments.",
      "It is thought there would have to be departures at Juve to fund a move for Sancho, and both Timothy Weah and Nico Gonzalez could leave the club.",
      "Marseille are in talks to sign Weah, who turned down Nottingham Forest earlier in the summer, while Atletico Madrid and Inter are both interested in the Argentina international Gonzalez.",
      "Juve have been interested in Sancho throughout the summer window so far and United value him at £25m.",
      "Inter Milan have also been mentioned with Sancho in the last 24 hours, but only if they are unable to sign Ademola Lookman, while Napoli had been interested in earlier in the window.",
      "Teddy Sheringham does not believe Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford deserves to join Barcelona after what he feels has been a \"soul-destroying\" episode.",
      "\"If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you're there, you appreciate it,\" the ex-United player told Sky Bet. \"You don't throw it away and say you want to leave.",
      "\"I find the whole episode very soul-destroying, compared to the way I was back in the day and how I strove to get the privilege to play for such a huge football club.",
      "\"To hear someone talking the way he is talking, saying he wants out - I didn't like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doing that at Arsenal, I thought it was soul-destroying, and I hope Rashford doesn't get the move that he's hankering for.",
      "\"From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that's a step up that he hasn't deserved.\"",
