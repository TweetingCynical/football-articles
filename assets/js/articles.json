      "Manchester United have confirmed a 29-man squad for Saturday’s pre-season friendly against rivals Leeds in Stockholm - and none of the Carrington “bomb squad” are on the plane.",
      "And while t he £71m deal to bring Bryan Mbeumo in from Brentford has moved much closer on Friday afternoon, the squad list indicates that Ruben Amorim’s desire for several new faces to be in place in time for the tour of the United States has not become reality.",
      "Confirmed arrivals Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon are part of the travelling party but Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been left behind.",
      "So too injured goalkeeper Andre Onana and forward Joshua Zirkzee but both will be crossing the Atlantic for a tour featuring fixtures against Bournemouth, West Ham and Everton.",
      "Amorim will also take a look at several youngsters in Stockholm with United confirming a first outing for their new away kit against Daniel Farke’s newly promoted side.",
      "Onana's absence should mean a start for Altay Bayindir between the posts and while all the expected names are involved, including captain Bruno Fernandes, the notable youngsters set to feature include Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson and Ethan Williams, all of whom featured in the post-season trip to Asia.",
      "The game against Leeds, who could give an outing to new signing and former Manchester City youngster Lucas Nmecha, kicks off at the Strawberry Arena at 2pm BST and will be shown live on MUTV.",
      "Goalkeepers: Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton, Dermot Mee.",
      "Defenders: Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Patrick Chinazaekpere Dorgu, Leny Yoro, Luke Shaw, Ayden Heaven, Diego Leon, Tyler Fredricson, Reece Munro, Godwill Kukonki.",

      "Newcastle and Tottenham may have to abandon any plans to sign Yoane Wissa this summer now that Brentford and Manchester United have finally agreed terms for the transfer of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The Cameroon star, 25, has been the subject of interest from United, Newcastle and Spurs this summer after breaking the 20-goal barrier in the Premier League for the first time last season, though the player's preference has always been a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Talks over a transfer have dragged on for weeks with Brentford rebuffing two different bids for their star attacker.",
      "During that same period, both Newcastle and Tottenham have set their sights on prising Wissa away from the Bees instead of Mbeumo.",
      "But with Mbeumo now on his way to Manchester United in a deal which could reach £71m with add-ons, the chances of Wissa moving this summer would appear to be slim.",
      "Wissa chalked up 20 goals in all competitions last season for Brentford alongside Mbeumo to put the likes of Newcastle and Spurs on alert.",
      "But it's understood that Brentford will not entertain the idea of selling both of their top attackers in the same transfer window, meaning Wissa is now highly likely to stay put.",
      "That will come as a big blow to both of his suitors; Spurs are now managed by Thomas Frank, who had been keen to reunite with Mbeumo and then Wissa in north London.",
      "Newcastle, on the other hand, have been exploring a deal for Wissa after walking away from negotiations with Eintracht Frankfurt over Hugo Ekitike, who is now expected to join Liverpool after agreeing personal terms with the newly minted Premier League champions.",
      "The Magpies, like Spurs, are in the market for attacking reinforcements after qualifying for the Champions League. They have bolstered their forward options with the capture of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest: another club who have been courting Wissa.",
      "Brentford have already identified Omari Hutchinson of Ipswich Town as their primary target to replace Mbeumo. The Bees had a £35m offer for the former Arsenal and Chelsea attacker turned down earlier this week but are expected to return with a new offer."

      "Mbeumo's representatives had already agreed personal terms with the Old Trafford hierarchy, paving the way for a move to be completed in the next couple of days pending the completion of a medical.",

United have also signed young full back Diego Leon from the Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno.",

      "United have now tabled a third offer for the Cameroonian international, believed to be £65million plus £5m in performance-related add-ons. United have previously failed with two bids for Brentford's star man but are hoping to strike lucky with their latest offer.",
      "Mbeumo has already agreed personal terms with United. He has also informed Brentford, and the other clubs chasing him, that he doesn't want to move anywhere else, having rejected both Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "Brentford have yet to respond to United's latest bid. However, comments in 2024 made by the Bees' ex-coach Frank, who has since joined Spurs and made a play for his ex-striker, will give Mbeumo a huge confidence boost should he make the move to Old Trafford. The Dane claimed last year: \"I'd buy him if I was at a bigger club.\"",
      "Frank has been backing Mbeumo to succeed for some time. After the striker missed a chunk of action two seasons ago due to injury, his manager's remarks spoke volumes that he believes the goalscorer can cut it anywhere. Mbeumo's contributions were sorely missed at the time while he was on the treatment table.",
      "\"He [Mbeumo] was our biggest miss for four months last year, even with [Former Brentford striker, Ivan] Toney out,\" Frank said. \"He was our key player and has added another layer this season with five goals in six games.\"",
      "He continued: \"That's incredible and he's creating chances. He's a top player. I'm convinced he will play for a bigger club. I'd buy him if I was at a bigger club.\"",
      "The ongoing saga has not been ideal for United. Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted all his new recruits signed up before he and his squad fly to the USA next week for their pre-season tour.",
      "Matheus Cunha is United's only new arrival so far. The club's previous bids for Mbeumo - £45m plus £10m in add-ons and £55m plus £7.5m in bonuses - were rejected, as Brentford believe Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season, should command a higher fee than the £62.5m United paid Wolves to sign Cunha.",
      "Yet the optics around the deal are harming United, so says former Red Devils defender Rio Ferdinand, who was speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "\"[Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he's told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United. So Man United and Brentford have to come together and find a way of... well, Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation,\" Ferdinand said.",
      "\"I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen.",
      "\"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative? So, I'll be surprised if this deal doesn't go through, because Man United have been adamant.\""

      "The main reason behind the sudden escalation in bidding is that United want Mbeumo to be a part of their pre-season tour to the US. Ruben Amorim and his players will jet over the Atlantic on Tuesday, after playing Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday in their first pre-season friendly.",
      "Matheus Cunha is the only summer signing currently being integrated into the squad during training sessions at Carrington, having completed his £62.5m move from Wolves early in the window. Diego Leon, an 18-year-old Paraguayan left-back, is another new arrival, although his deal went through in January.",

The Athletic reports that a decision is yet to be made over Leon’s status in the squad, or whether he will drop down to the under-21s, given there is competition at left-back from Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Harry Amass.",

      "Amorim is still yet to decide who he wants to keep and who would be better served by leaving for game time. It is understood that Dan Gore, Ethan Wheatley, Tyler Fredricson and Toby Collyer could all leave in the coming weeks, either on loan or permanently, with United keen to clear the pathway from academy to first team.",

United have placed Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia in the ‘bomb squad’ while they try to sell them – but the decision has caused divisions.",
      "The five players have been told they have no future under Amorim at United and are therefore seeking transfers to other clubs. Rashford, Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have been isolated from the first-team squad, forced to train separately in order to draw a line between the two groups.",
      "They are ordered to arrive at Carrington after 5pm, when the rest of the players have left for the day. While not unheard of in elite football, it is a brutal way of dealing with unwanted players and it is yet to bear fruit, with United struggling to sell the five players.",
      "Rashford is holding out for a move to Barcelona, Garnacho’s £70million valuation has put off Napoli, Real Betis want Antony but can’t afford him, Sancho has been shopped around without luck so far and Malacia is unattractive after a series of injuries.",

There is also the fact that making it obvious the players are unwanted risks lowering their transfer value, especially as the September 1 transfer deadline approaches.",

      "The Dane previously played and impressed in Italy, which convinced United to spend more than £70m on the unproven striker who was then at Atalanta. He's been unable to deliver consistently at Old Trafford and now a move back to Serie A could be on the cards.",
      "Hojlund has been linked with Inter Milan, but their San Siro rivals could now join the party. United will have to accept a considerable loss on their striker, but just how much they demand remains to be seen.",
      "Milan finished a disappointing eighth last term, meaning they are without European football. Christian Pulisic top scored for them with 17 goals but Tijjani Reijnders, who chipped in with 15 goals, has left for Manchester City and the Rossoneri are yet to sign a striker this summer.",
      "United's desire to add more firepower stems from the lack of goals in their team last term. They struggled in the final third and didn't have anyone in attack they could rely on to consistently come up trumps in front of goal. Hojlund scored just four Premier League goals last term.",
      "Amorim accepted that the player was short of expectations, but acknowledged he was bereft of confidence and claimed it was on the entire team to service him and help him out of his rut.",
      "\"I think if you look at the games we have several players that miss big chances, not just Rasmus,\" he said. \"Of course, Rasmus, the game is to score goals because he's a striker, but it's a team thing. I already said that. Our team should score more goals, it's not just Rasmus missing chances.\"",
      "Amorim also added: \"It's a team thing. Of course, we have an idea of what this team needs but also the guys we play with, we play at least three guys in front to score goals and we have midfielders that can. All the team needs to score more goals and you have opportunities with the midfielders and the striker. We need to improve as a team because if you don't score goals in this league it's impossible to win games.\""

He is up against Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Amass in Amorim’s squad, a situation that appears to require some attention, especially if the rumours of interest in Brighton left-back Pervis Estupinian come to fruition.",

      "One of Ineos' main issues with the training ground prior to its revamp was the number of offices on the second floor. As a result the new building is open plan. Senior members of departments other than football, such as commercial, will be transferred from Old Trafford to Carrington.",
      "The hope is that the training ground will become the club’s base of operations.Ruben Amorim and his players will also get to return to their own space having been using the facilities of the academy teams over the past year which the building received its revamp."

      "The Red Devils have seen several bids for the Cameroon forward rejected, the last being £60m. The two parties remain millions apart in their respective figures and the change in the dugout has not helped. Andrews is another internal hire at Brentford, replacing Thomas Frank. The new Tottenham boss was thought to be keen on Mbeumo, but the north Londoners now look to have gone in a different direction.",
      "It leaves United with a free shot at the Brentford star, who himself wants the move, but they have struggled to agree on a fee. The MEN also understands that Andrews' arrival as the new head coach has further complicated matters with the Irishman wanting to keep his top players.",
      "Juventus are looking to sign Rashford and end his Manchester exile. Barcelona have long been the favourites to sign Rashford after Aston Villa decided not to take up their option to buy at the end of his loan spell. But the La Liga champions are yet to make a move.",

      "He cost more than £80m when he joined in 2022 and the expectation is he will be sold. According to Brazilian news outlet UOL the Red Devils are demanding around £50m for the winger. They claim that RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen, Brighton and Newcastle have all inquired about a potential move."

      "We have seen a few sagas develop over the past few months – we’re looking at you Viktor Gyokeres – while other stories have emerged more recently. Clubs have until September 1 to complete deals, but managers desperately want them done before the season starts, so the race against the clock is on.",

At the age of 27, he wants to make the jump, just two years after leaving Coventry City for Portugal. \"What I managed to do at Sporting, I am convinced I can achieve anywhere,” he has said. “You haven't seen the best Gyokeres yet.\"",
      "Arsenal turned their full attention away from Benjamin Sesko to Gyokeres and sporting director Andrea Berta has gone through somewhat fractious negotiations with the Portuguese club.",
      "But now, after strike threats and presidential fury, a deal has been agreed between the two clubs, personal terms with the player are sorted, and it’s a matter of time before his £63.6million deal is all ticked through and he becomes an Arsenal player.",

      "Like Arsenal before them, Liverpool declared their interest in signing Newcastle’s goal machine. They approached the Magpies over the subject on Tuesday, floating the idea of a blockbuster £120m transfer.",
      "Having already spent around £170m this summer to sign Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez and co, there was understandable shock among rival fans: How would Liverpool afford such expenditure in the age of profit and sustainability rules?",
      "The Reds believed a deal would be viable, with the sale of Darwin Nunez offsetting the cost, but the bigger stumbling block proved to be Newcastle’s stance: Isak is not for sale. And that has led them to the next player on our list.",
      "Newcastle and Liverpool are joined together in their transfer business this summer. Eddie Howe’s side bid £70m for Ekitike earlier this week, only to see the offer rejected – and now Liverpool are not just chasing the Frankfurt striker, but are fast closing in.",
      "Liverpool have come to this conclusion after determining that Newcastle won’t budge over Isak. The fact that their alternative also happens to have been a top target for the Magpies is a coincidence, which makes the whole situation more intriguing.",
      "Liverpool want to sell Nunez, who has not lived up to his billing. The Uruguayan had been set to join Napoli, having agreed to the move, but things ground to a halt over the transfer fee, with Liverpool holding out for £70m, while the Serie A champions would only pay £50m.",
      "That could still change, but with Napoli signing Lorenzo Lucca from Udinese, that avenue may be closed. Instead, it could be Saudi Arabia for Nunez, with sides pushing for his services. It's been claimed that new Al-Hilal boss Simone Inzaghi has identified the former Benfica star as a target if they fail to sign Victor Osimhen.",
      "Rashford isn’t wanted by Manchester United and has been placed in the bomb squad by Ruben Amorim while he tries to find a new club. The problem is that Rashford only has eyes for one club : Barcelona.",
      "He has rejected approaches from Saudi Arabia, despite their lucrative nature, and is waiting for Barca. There are many hurdles though: Rashford is paid £325,000 per week at United and is under contract until June 2028. He is willing to lower his wages, but United want a sale and Barca want a loan deal, due to their financial situation.",
      "It looks like this one could rumble on for some time, with a compromise needing to be reached.",
      "Garnacho is in the same boat as Rashford, training separately from their United team-mates while they await a transfer elsewhere. He attracted interest from Napoli, but is understood to prefer a move to a Premier League rival.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea and Tottenham have been monitoring his situation, but United’s £70m valuation is an obvious barrier to a deal, while his attitude towards the end of last season may have put off some suitors. The 21-year-old is under contract until June 2028 with United, but doesn’t appear to have any future under Ruben Amorim. United have so far failed to shift any of their unwanted players – a group which includes Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia – and will get increasingly desperate as September 1 approaches.",
      "One of the reasons they want Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and co gone is so there is space in the squad, and further funds, to sign Mbeumo. Brentford are standing firm over their valuation for the Cameroon international, who banged in 20 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "United had an initial proposal of £45m plus £10m in add-ons rejected, while a follow-up offer of £55m plus £7.5m in bonuses was also rejected. Mbeumo wants to move to Old Trafford and there is a sense that the deal will happen because Brentford are loathed to keep players who don’t want to be there.",
      "But they are also more than happy to drag their feet and get the very best deal possible. Brentford's director of football Phil Giles is the man who has been holding up the process - now we'll learn if United's final take-it-or-leave-it third offer is enough.",
      "Guehi is no stranger to a transfer saga, having been the subject of interest from Newcastle last summer. That ended when Crystal Palace rejected a £70m bid for the England centre-back, but the rumours are back this summer.",
      "Liverpool want a centre-back after letting Jarell Quansah leave for Bayer Leverkusen and amid rumours of Ibrahima Konate leaving for Real Madrid. Guehi has entered the final year of his contract with Palace and reports suggest that he is willing to wait it out. Palace now value Guehi at £40m and the ball is in Liverpool’s court.",
      "Things have become ugly here. Tottenham bid £60m for the playmaker, only for Nottingham Forest to react by considering legal action over what they believe may be an illegal approach.",
      "The £60m bid triggered Gibbs-White’s release clause and Spurs tried to line up a medical for the England star. Tottenham are understood to still be confident they will get their man, having opted for Gibbs-White over Palace star Eberechi Eze.",
      "Forest are perturbed that Spurs knew the exact details of their star player’s release clause and could complain to the Premier League, potentially holding up his exit.",
      "This one has come out of the left field. The idea that Chelsea might sell Jackson is not surprising, given they have signed Liam Delap and Joao Pedro this summer, but the potential destination is intriguing.",
      "Chelsea are said to value Jackson at £100m after hearing of interest from AC Milan – and now United are sniffing around.

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana is winning his race to be fit for the start of the new Premier League season. United's No.1 suffered a hamstring injury in the first week of pre-season training, which threatened to rule the 29-year-old out of the start of the new campaign.",
      "Onana's injury also raised the prospect of United having to go into the market to buy a new keeper as cover for the Cameroon international until he made a full recovery. But it is understood Onana's injury - a strain, not a tear - is not as bad as first feared and he is responding well to treatment from United's medical and physio team.",
      "Although Onana will miss United's pre-season opener against Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday, he will travel with the rest of the squad for the three-game tour of the US. Ruben Amorim and his squad leave early next week for the States, where they will play West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton as part of the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "Onana will not feature in the opening two games, in New York and Chicago, but United are hopeful he will have recovered sufficiently to potentially play a part in the final game in Atlanta.",
      "United then return home to play Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9 in their final warm-up game, before hosting Arsenal in their Premier League opener on August 17.",
      "Despite failing with two bids for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, United have not given up hope of landing the forward before the start of the new season. Brentford are understood to want up to £70million for Mbeumo, who netted 20 Premier League goals last season, with United only willing to go to £65m.",
      "Even with the disparity in valuation between the two clubs, United are hopeful a compromise can be reached, with Mbeumo, 25, desperate to make the move.",
      "The Red Devils announced last week that third-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton had signed a new one-year contract at the age of 39. No.2 Altay Bayindir is set to receive the bulk of the minutes in the US, having deputised for Onana on multiple occasions last season.",
      "United's other goalkeeping options include Radek Vitek, the 21-year-old Czech who impressed on loan at Austria side FC Blau-Weiss Linz last season. Amorim can also call on Elyh Harrison, 19, and Dermot Mee, 22.",
      "All three of the youngsters were named of the bench for United during the final weeks of last season but are each yet to make their debuts."

      "After signing Matheus Cunha to strengthen their attack last month, United immediately identified Mbeumo as their next top target. The club has prioritised attacking signings this summer after finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, has been keen on a move to Old Trafford throughout the summer, meaning both he and United have been keen to strike an agreement.",
      "United submitted an opening offer for the former Troyes man worth £55m, which was rejected, and their second proposal was worth in excess of £60m just over three weeks ago.",
      "For a time, it looked as though United's second offer would be enough to extract Mbeumo from the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "The attacker, who was directly involved in 28 Premier League goals last season, will bring plenty of versatility to Old Trafford. As well as being an option at right-wing and for the right-sided No.10 role, he is also capable of playing through the centre of the attack.",
      "United will fly to Chicago next Tuesday before facing West Ham United in their opening game of the Premier League Summer Series on July 27 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.",

      "Ruben Amorim and the club are believed to still be confident in signing Mbeumo before their pre-season tour of the United States. United have now reportedly sent a new offer that matches Brentford's valuation.",
      "A new striker is also being linked with a move to Old Trafford. After looking like they will miss out on Viktor Gyokeres, new names have been thrown into the mix with Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Seskso recently linked.",

      "I'd buy him if I was at a bigger club. He [Mbeumo] was our biggest miss for four months last year, even with [Former Brentford striker, Ivan] Toney out. He was our key player and has added another layer this season with five goals in six games. That's incredible and he's creating chances. He's a top player.

      "The change of manager at Brentford was always bound to cause a hold-up. Brentford also needed time to line up their duck to replace Mbeumo. Hutchinson is a left-footed right winger with a release clause. Ipswich Town rejected Brentford's package as it was not an up-front payment.",
      "And so, when push comes to shove, United seem likely to get Mbeumo in time for him to be in the squad against West Ham United in New Jersey next Saturday. Mbeumo will have missed out on a full week's worth of pre-season training. Hardly an issue for a player who has spent four successive seasons in the Premier League.",
      "There has been a shift from United. A target they initially valued at £50m-odd could end up costing them £70m. Sources say Brentford refused to budge on an overall £70m fee and United eventually relented.",
      "After going the entirety of last summer without breaking the £60m barrier for any of the five signings, United are about to do so with both incomings this summer. Club figures stressed as recently as Wednesday that Mbeumo's fee had to be \"sensible\".",
      "His cost will doubtless drive the price up of that elusive new No.9, unless there is a satisfactory option with a release clause. Some form of a compromise feels inevitable there, whether it is a short-term fix or United settling with their existing options. All of the evidence suggests Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are not good enough.",
      "At least Cunha and Mbeumo have been plying their trade on these shores. There is a modicum of progress in that United have settled on such fees for players with Premier League experience, rather than for a brash Brazilian in the Netherlands or a callow and underwhelming striker in Italy.",
      "It is needs must, too. United recorded a minus goal difference in 2023-24. Last season, it was ten times worse. Cunha and Mbeumo were towards the top of the Premier League goalscoring charts in 2024-25.",
      "Should they contribute 35 league goals between them for United, nobody will mention their fees. Expectations should be reined in, though. Wolves finished 14th and 16th in Cunha's two campaigns at Molineux. Mbeumo has been playing at a stadium with a capacity of 17,250. The Sir Alex Ferguson Stand alone is much bigger than that.",
      "The pair are in for a culture shock though United are confident the players have the wherewithal to cope with the great expectations and the greater scrutiny. Cunha was always destined for another big move and Mbeumo is one of the most affable and attentive characters in the league.",
      "Mbeumo had a more than respectable first season in the Premier League as Brentford finished 13th yet the winger was so self-critical he embarked on an intensive training programme that entailed posture training. Those close to him are adamant that it marked the turning point in his career.",
      "United should not overburden Mbeumo. They cannot entertain the notion of playing him up front when everyone knows they want an out-and-out striker. Cunha, Amad and Bruno Fernandes are the playmakers who can make United play. Mbeumo has to go into the starting XI on the wing.",
      "The team would be a starting striker shy of completion for the forthcoming season. Centre back is United's strongest area in their squad, Manuel Ugarte has to start repaying the club's investment and is set to have Fernandes as his partner. A more established left winger is bound to be a priority next year but Patrick Dorgu is one of United's most recent investments, albeit at a price (£25m) with little risk.",
      "A new goalkeeper could be needed this time next year, too, unless Andre Onana rediscovers the form of his Champions League semi-final and final campaigns with Ajax and Inter Milan. That would be more good news for United."

      "Mbeumo's talents are obvious with a record of 20 goals in the top-flight last season. The Cameroonian will provide United with the Premier League experience they have been looking to attract this summer after acquiring Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "But it's his record from the spot which should draw the most attention. Mbeumo has taken 12 penalties in the Premier League since joining Brentford in 2019 - scoring 11 and missing just one.",
      "That sole miss came in what is set to be his final home game for the Bees - a 3-2 defeat to Fulham on May 18. It's to his credit though that he still managed to score that day and in his final game for the club - a 1-1 draw at Wolves.",
      "And his almost spotless record from the spot will now present United with a welcome but immediate dilemma heading into the new campaign. Reds captain Bruno Fernandes has been United's regular penalty taker since joining from Sporting in January 2020.",
      "Fernandes has scored 22 Premier League penalties for the Reds - missing just four. It seems unlikely that United boss Ruben Amorim will change his regular penalty taker but it certainly gives him some room for thought.",
      "It's a good problem to have for Amorim and he will be pleased to have at least one thing going for him heading into a vital campaign for him and the Reds.",
      "Mbeumo's arrival won't fix much of United's problems but his signing alongside Cunha's addition last month will at least add some much-needed firepower to a team which badly needs it."

      "Predicting how Manchester United could line up against Leeds United for their pre-season opener in Stockholm on Saturday is about as easy as trying to find a needle in a haystack.",
      "Pre-season marks an ample opportunity for United head coach Ruben Amorim to assess his squad and attempt to figure out his strongest starting XI for the Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford in a month's time.",
      "While some occupants of some positions are quite easy to identify, others are not quite so clear-cut, meaning some members of Amorim's squad will be feeling the pressure more than others over the next few weeks.",
      "The clash with Leeds will mark the first of five friendlies United will navigate their way through this summer. After facing the Whites, they will play three games in the United States before returning to England to face Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9.",
      "Amorim is expected to use pre-season to run the rule over every member of his squad. A crop of youngsters are also highly likely to store minutes under their belts.",
      "Despite the thirst for new signings, particularly in attacking areas, United are not planning to strengthen their defence. They are well-stocked at the back, particularly at centre-back.",
      "After signing Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt last summer and then Ayden Heaven in the mid-season window, Amorim is not light on options. Noussair Mazraoui, who arrived from Bayern Munich last August, can also play as a centre-back.",
      "With Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Tyler Fredricson, Godwill Kukonki and Luke Shaw also options to be considered at centre-back, Amorim might have his work cut out deciding who will make up his preferred defensive trio.",
      "Yoro, who arrived from Lille a year ago, should be a shoo-in after overcoming his injury-hit start to end last season with a crop of strong performances. Despite impressing as the left-sided centre-back, it is widely considered his long-term position at Old Trafford is on the right of the back-three.",
      "His athleticism, excellent reading of the game and his composure on the ball makes him an ideal fit to occupy the wide centre-back role on the right. Maguire enjoyed a strong campaign last term, convincing United to trigger the option to extend his contract by a further year, meaning he will be targeting the middle spot in the back-three.",
      "However, he will face competition from De Ligt to occupy that role. The Dutchman, despite experiencing an up and down first season at Old Trafford, is still only 25 and will believe he can bring much more to the defence.",
      "There is also a debate to potentially be had about who occupies the left-sided centre-back spot. Martinez was United's chief left-sided centre-back at the start of the year, but an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury he sustained against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in February has put his place as a starter at risk.",
      "He is progressing well in his recovery, continuing to work on an individual rehabilitation programme, but he is still some time away from being fit enough to play. It means the door has opened for Heaven to make that spot his own at the start of this season.",
      "Recruited from Arsenal earlier this year for a £1.5million fee, the defender made an immediate impact in M16, producing a crop of performances that left United fans drooling over his potential. Despite only being 18, he already looks like a centre-back destined for the very top.",
      "He has an excellent understanding of the game, is defensively sound, is very accomplished on the ball and is left-footed. There is a strong chance he will start the season opener against his former club.",
      "However, Shaw will be in pursuit of the same role. United's transition to a wing-back system under Amorim means the England defender's most likely route into the starting XI is via the left-sided centre-back role.",
      "He doesn't have the athleticism to operate as a wing-back in Amorim's system, making the left-sided centre-back spot the most logical role for him in Amorim's XI.",
      "Shaw has experienced a torrid time with injuries over the last couple of years, and many United supporters are of the opinion he should have been moved on by now. However, the fact he started in the Europa League final suggests Amorim is refusing to give up on him.",
      "That could result in Heaven and Shaw going head-to-head in pre-season in pursuit of a place in Amorim's first-choice XI.",

      "A host of strikers have been linked with a move to United this summer, including Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres, Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike and Chelsea's Liam Delap.

      "Hojlund scored just 10 goals for United last season in his second campaign at Old Trafford following his £72million switch from Atalanta in the summer of 2023. It's that form which has led to United being linked with a new striker and rumours that Hojlund could leave the club this summer.",
      "There were rumours earlier in the summer claiming that Inter Milan had an interest in signing Hojlund before the September 1 deadline.

      "It has been suggested that Bayern are the club most likely to sign Simons, due to them already actively looking at a deal for the 22-year-old. United are still said to be interested in a transfer, with the Dutch international reportedly keen to leave Leipzig before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Despite United being handed this boost, the report claims that Leipzig's price tag for Simons is stopping a deal from progressing any further at this stage. Various reports this summer have claimed that the Bundesliga outfit value Simons at around €80million (£69.2million).",
      "United have already signed a playmaker who can play in the No.10 position following the £62.4million arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.

      "United have been locked in talks with Brentford for just over six weeks, meaning they will now be hoping it will be third time lucky in their quest to lure him to Old Trafford. Mbeumo made it crystal clear several weeks ago that he wants to move to M16.",
      "After scoring 20 Premier League goals last season, Mbeumo would be a second statement signing of the summer for United. They have already splashed out £62.5m on bringing Matheus Cunha, who scored 17 goals last term, to the club from Wolves.",
      "Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in head coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and there is a strong chance Mbeumo could be installed as the right-sided playmaker. His versatility, though, means he could be deployed elsewhere.",
      "Primarily a winger throughout his time at Brentford, Mbeumo is renowned for cutting in from the right and making full use of his trustworthy left foot. It means he could be an option as either the right-sided No.10 or right wing-back for Amorim.",
      "Amad, who regularly blossomed for United last term, is also equally capable as a right-sided No.10 or right wing-back. With that said, the worst that can happen is that Amad and Mbeumo create healthy competition for each other and a selection dilemma for Amorim.",
      "With Cunha a guaranteed starter and Mbeumo expected to be given the same treatment if he finalises a switch to M16 without any further setbacks, Amorim's first-choice starting XI for the 2025/26 will be closer towards completion.",
      "As things currently stand, United are still in the market for a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper, meaning they will soon have to flex their muscles in the seller's market to fund those prospective additions.",
      "Despite currently being unavailable because of a hamstring injury, Andre Onana is expected to remain United's first-choice goalkeeper this season. United want to recruit a shot-stopper who can compete with and push the Cameroonian, but Onana is under the impression he will remain Amorim's No.1.",
      "United are well-stocked at centre-back and pre-season performances could dictate who starts the season opener against Arsenal in a month's time. Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are the future of United's backline and will believe they are worthy of becoming staples in the wide centre-back roles, while Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire will be fighting to start in the middle.",
      "On the presumption Mbeumo is deployed in attack, Amad is the logical pick at right wing-back after regularly catching the eye on the right flank last season. Meanwhile, Patrick Dorgu is a shoo-in on the opposite flank and will be keen to improve after arriving from Lecce earlier this year.",
      "Following Cunha's arrival, Bruno Fernandes is expected to complete a permanent switch to midfield and occupy one of the two No.8 spots. He regularly operated from the engine room in the second half of last term and rarely looked out of place.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer and Casemiro are all currently jockeying to join Fernandes in midfield, but the club remains keen on signing a new midfielder. Who that could be is currently impossible to predict.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha will build two thirds of Amorim's attack, occupying the two No.10 spots. The United chief struggled in his search for consistency in those two roles last season, meaning it is highly likely those positions could be occupied by new faces.",
      "United's need for an out-and-out centre-forward has been well-documented throughout the summer, and they attempted to solve that particular mission quickly by swooping for Liam Delap last month. However, Chelsea pipped them to his signature.",
      "The Reds have since been heavily linked with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen but are increasingly likely to miss out on both of them. Fortunately, the prospect of adding Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha should ease the attacking burden on whoever leads United's attack come the start of the season.",

      "\"He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: Moving to Bayer Leverkusen would be a brilliant move for not just Antony but United too. Currently, the winger's heart is set on returning to Real Betis, which is fine, but they do not seem capable of paying the sort of figure that United are demanding. If Leverkusen were to enter the race, there is a likelihood that they would be able to match United's asking price. The Reds cannot afford to allow every player to go on the cheap just to get them off the books so there would definitely be a few in the recruitment team hoping the Bundesliga club change their mind.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko would be interested in signing for United should they come in for him this summer. The Slovenian entered talks with Arsenal earlier in the window but it now seems the Gunners' priorities are elsewhere.",
      "As for Sesko, who is valued at £78m, he is reportedly willing to give United priority even though they cannot offer him Champions League football.",
      "What MEN Sport says: It is clear that Ruben Amorim would prefer to sign Viktor Gyokeres in an ideal world this summer. However, that ship looks to have sailed and the attention must now switch to other targets. Sesko would be an impressive second choice. He has a very similar profile to Gyokeres - he is quick, strong and has an eye for goal. What potentially makes him an even better option than the Swede is his age. He is five years younger than Gyokeres which makes him a more enticing prospect for Ineos who favour signings with potential resale value. It will be interesting to see if this progresses further."

      "Matheus Cunha evoked gasps at Molineux Stadium against Manchester United last season.",
      "Cunha scored directly from a corner to open the scoring in the second half, but it was his sublime and outrageous touch earlier in the game that made jaws drop around a foggy Molineux.",
      "The Brazilian brought a speculative pass from his goalkeeper down to the ground with a majestic piece of skill, performing a classy turn and simultaneously taking the ball beyond a flat-footed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "Wolves defender Matt Doherty reacted: “He’s on another level — it’s top quality, when he’s confident, like that. It’s hard to play against. I was saying to the other lads, it’s difficult to make the game look that easy at times.",
      "“There’s maybe more than a handful in this league who can make it look that easy. And he’s one of them. We’re fortunate to have him. Against Manchester United, he was just on it all game.",
      "“He was taking balls out of the sky, he was Cryuff-like — doing things you would normally be expecting Manchester United players to do. It’s not showboating. That’s his way of getting out of any pressure. You’re not showboating at 0-0 — that’s just his brain working better than everyone else.\"",
      "Doherty's quote about Cunha performing like a Manchester United player from yesteryear during his time at Wolves is why the forward should be an outstanding addition this season.",
      "Cunha has confidence and the ability to back it up. The 26-year-old is a player who gets fans on the edges of their seats and he is expected to be a breath of fresh air at Old Trafford.",
      "Creativity and flair seem to be coached out of players in the modern game, with an emphasis instead placed on retaining possession and waiting for the perfect moment to take a risk.",
      "The Premier League has become worse due to that change, but Cunha is an entertaining player and he is worth paying to watch, something you can't say about many other players in the United dressing room.",
      "United announced their deal to sign Cunha from Wolves on the opening day of the transfer window and the gloss has been slightly taken off his arrival by no other signings following him through the door.",
      "Fans wanted to see Bryan Mbeumo wrapped up shortly after Cunha's transfer was completed, but Brentford have hung tough in negotiations and United are still actively working on the deal.",
      "The mood among supporters has begun to drop, which has been exacerbated by Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal conducting transfer business in a swift manner.",
      "There are concerns about how United's squad looks with their pre-season friendlies beginning against Leeds on Saturday. That has dampened enthusiasm, but it will be exciting to see Cunha in United colours for the first time and it wouldn't be a surprise to see him put on a show for Swedish fans.",
      "Cunha has the potential to quickly become a fan favourite because of how he plays the game. He is a stereotypical Brazilian on the pitch and, more importantly, is capable of finding the back of the net.",
      "Cunha scored 17 goals and tallied six assists in a struggling Wolves side last season and will provide firepower to a United side that looked hopelessly toothless throughout a grim campaign.",
      "Ruben Amorim billed Cunha as \"real quality\" on the eve of the 1-0 defeat to Wolves in April.",
      "Cunha should indeed be a quality addition and he is guaranteed to entertain while performing."

      "Should everything go the way that Manchester United want it to in the next few days, Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo will become their player.",
      "The Reds submitted a third bid for the Cameroonian on Thursday afternoon and MEN Sport understands that there is confidence in the United camp that this offer will be accepted. If this were to be the case, there would be understandable relief from many at the club but when the dust settles, question marks will remain over two players in this United squad.",
      "With two new No.10s in the building, the expectation would be for both men to start in the Reds' opening Premier League fixture against Arsenal. Matheus Cunha alongside Mbeumo has the potential to be a lethal partnership.",
      "After that, the third of the four midfield positions surely has to go to Bruno Fernandes. Ruben Amorim is a huge fan of the United captain and arguably the only way to get him into the starting XI, alongside the two new signings, is to drop him deeper.",
      "That leaves just one more place which would go to a defensive midfielder - perhaps Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte. It begs the question, where do Kobbie Mainoo and Amad fit into this new team?",
      "The immediate concern will be for Mainoo. While he has been played as a false nine, this was an experiment which has not been repeated on many occasions at all.",
      "Arguably his best role is in what would become the Fernandes role and it is there where he impressed under Erik ten Hag. However, his game time has been eaten into under Amorim and that could only become worse this coming season with less matches on the horizon.",
      "If Mainoo is to be seen as a back-up option this season, you wonder if he will be looking at other clubs where he could become a star. We already know that the 20-year-old can compete in the Premier League and it seems unlikely the Stockport-born academy graduate will settle to be a regular second-string player.",
      "For Amad, the scenario is less urgent but could still require some pondering. Like Mainoo, the Ivorian's favoured role of No.10 appears to have been replaced by Cunha and the impending arrival of Mbeumo.",
      "Unlike Mainoo, Amad cannot play in a deeper midfield role. He could be reintroduced as a wing-back, but options on the right flank are currently swamped by Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "However, the 23-year-old has the potential to be a much better option in this position considering his attacking capabilities so long as he improves defensively. Trying to accommodate all of these attacking players is a good problem for Amorim to have in one respect.",
      "But the United head coach also has a scenario where he has to juggle a bunch of players who are used to being first-choice options. None will settle for being backups, and that is when some uncomfortable conversations will need to be had."

      "Osimhen, who has recently entered the final year of his contract in Naples, featured 30 times in the Süper Lig this season, scoring 26 goals and providing five assists. Playing a key role in Okan Buruk's squad, the Nigeria international fired the club to a third successive title.",
      "He also helped Galatasaray clinch the domestic double, netting a brace against Trabzonspor in the Turkish Cup final. Osimhen was once mooted as a potential target for Manchester United, but now he looks set to stay in Istanbul.",
      "According Sacha Tavolieri, Galatasaray have reached an agreement with Napoli to sign Osimhen. The report claims that the Turkish giants have 'never been so close' to securing the Nigerian's signature, with a €75m (£65m) payment plan in place.",
      "Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano has reported that negotiations are still ongoing between the two clubs. It's said that Napoli have recently sent a counter-proposal to Galatasaray, who are ready to make a decision on the 'new conditions'.",
      "According to German outlet Bild, Newcastle have shortlisted Osimhen and Darwin Nunez as potential targets after dropping out of the race to sign Hugo Ekitike. The report claims that the Eintracht Frankfurt striker has decided that he wants to join Liverpool, who have signalled that they're willing to pay his €100m (£85m) price tag.",
      "It's said that the Premier League champions have already agreed personal terms with Ekitike, who wasn't convinced by a move to St. James' Park. Bild reckons that the Magpies have bid €80m (£69m) for the 23-year-old striker, but the offer was rejected.",

      "It's said that United were 'reluctant' to pay the €75m (£65m) release clause in his contract, so they 'studied' how to finance a bid. La Gazzetta dello Sport added that Osimhen rejected an offer from Al-Hilal at the time.",
      "Towards the end of May, the Galatasaray boss provided an update on Osimhen's future. In an interview with 'I Just Spoke', as quoted by Turkish outlet NTV Sport, Buruk shut down rumours linking the striker with a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"Osimhen will look at the conditions,\" he said. \"He's very happy here at Galatasaray. He's living the best days of his life. The player will decide about his future, as he's made an incredible contribution here. We need to respect him, but we are hopeful that he will stay with us.\"",
      "Buruk added: \"He's a professional player. There are talks about it, but Osimhen will make the choice. He will look at the conditions. The part about Osimhen agreeing with the [Saudi] Arabian side is not true.\""

Contract agreed weeks ago with Mbeumo as he only wanted Man United move. After Cunha, Mbeumo next for #MUFC.’",

      "‘Not everybody at United agrees with the decision to limit their access to evening hours, however, given the relationships they have with people at the club. There is also the fear that ostracising them lowers their value in the transfer market, an awkward look at a time when ordinary workers are being laid off to cut costs.’",

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Djordje Petrovic – £22m/€28.8m (Chelsea to Bournemouth, July 2025)\nThe Chelsea transfer ethos in action: a player they signed for £12m on a seven-year contract and who played as many games for the Blues as Strasbourg was sold for almost twice as much within two years.",
      "",
      "18) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "19) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",
      "",
      "20) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",

      "Manchester United have agreed a £71m fee with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo but once Sir Jim Ratcliffe remembers he ‘won’t be held ransom’ they will need to find an alternative.",
      "After starting the bidding at £50m rising to £55m in early June and privately stressing the need to be patient, Manchester United have found an agreement with Brentford worth an initial £65m with £6m in add-ons.",
      "It is exceptional work as ever from the recruitment team, who might soon get cold feet and need to look at some alternatives.",
      "We took a look at FBRef for options across Europe’s top five leagues that have very similar characteristics to Mbeumo, which amusingly features one current Manchester United player they’re desperate to be rid of and one a club has just made a £40m profit on after signing him from United two years ago.",
      "",
      "Alex Berenguer (Athletic Club)\nProbably not the Athletic Club forward the fans would be dreaming of signing this summer, but if Barcelona and Arsenal can’t persuade Nico Williams to join them there’s not much hope for United. And they in turn are in absolutely no position to be sniffy about a 30-year-old winger who got more league goal contributions (14) last season than any of their players aside from Bruno Fernandes (18).",
      "",
      "Mattia Zaccagni (Lazio)\nThere’s interest from Nottingham Forest in the Lazio captain as they prepare for inevitable defeat to Tottenham in the not-so-secret Morgan Gibbs-White release clause saga, and without the funds to build a squad which aligns with the fanciful INEOS strategy of developing young talent with significant sell-on value, moves for relatively inexpensive but experienced footballers like Zaccagni make a lot of sense. It’s a ploy that’s worked famously for Inter Milan.",
      "",
      "Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig)\nHe’s a player we’re sure United would have been making a move for had they qualified for the Champions League – he would be ideal in the 3-4-3. As it stands, their Europa League vanquishers Tottenham are interested, as are Bayern Munich. Probably Bayern Munich then.",
      "",
      "Anthony Gordon (Newcastle)\nThe supposed similarity between Gordon and their primary target should perhaps raise United alarms as to the suitability of Mbeumo to the inverted winger role as Gordon is a proper winger’s winger – paint on the soles of his boots and all that.",
      "That said, we’re pretty sure Amorim wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to sign Gordon should he miraculously become an option.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi (Everton)\nHe was low-key excellent last season, with his nine Premier League goals and six assists comfortably beating his best previous return of 11 goal contributions in 2018/2019 for Arsenal. Primed for a £20m late-window bid before Fulham ask for an added £20m in United tax.",
      "",
      "Inaki Williams (Athletic Club)\nCan’t be easy living in his brother’s shadow, though we’re guessing the £220,000 Inaki gets a week to play football eases the pain somewhat. He’s not about to leave a club in the Champions League and even United won’t fork out those wages.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nJust brilliant. Not just because United are doing everything in their power to get him out of the club but also because he was deemed unsuited to Amorim’s system in the short time he was playing for him.",
      "And yes, we get the argument that Amorim has shown strength of character in showing ‘bad apples’ the door no matter their talent, but there won’t be a Red Devils fan out there not wondering – even briefly – whether a softer approach may have led to Rashford thriving at his boyhood club rather than at Aston Villa in the second half of last season and wherever he finds himself next term while United pay half his wages.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Newcastle)\nWe’re 99 per cent sure United would have rivalled Newcastle for Elanga’s £55m signing this summer had it not required an embarrassing climbdown after they sold him to Nottingham Forest for £15m two years ago.",
      "A report emerged after his stunning goal against United in April that while ‘there was an appreciation at the club for his phenomenal physical talents’, the club let him go due to ‘reservations over how he would parlay those skills into breaking down stubborn defences’.",
      "United do not now hold what we would suggest would have been the very same ‘reservations’ back then over a move for Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "Justin Kluivert (Bournemouth)\nHe’s someone we could genuinely see United genuinely pivoting to if they miss out on Mbeumo. A 26-year-old who’s perfect for one of those roles behind the central striker, coming off the back of a standout season playing for a club not in European competition with no more than an outside chance of achieving that feat in the coming campaign. A prime candidate.",
      "",
      "Cody Gakpo (Liverpool)\nBayern are supposedly keen and we’re currently at a point where we wouldn’t be particularly surprised by any forward either leaving or joining Liverpool. We would be surprised if any of them joined Manchester United.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the next signing Man Utd will make once they have formally completed deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly reserved some money to buy Gabriel Sara from Galatasaray this summer, while there is an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Man Utd have ‘reached an agreement’ to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with the Red Devils set to pay £71m, according to reports.",
      "Hugo Ekitike has not actually submitted what would have been the least necessary transfer request of all time, nor will Newcastle ‘now sell Alexander Isak’.",
      "Man Utd could stung by Newcastle’s interest in Yoane Wissa with a transfer potentially impacting their deal for Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United ‘will walk away’ from their deal for Bryan Mbeumo on one condition after submitting an ‘improved’ offer."

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seems as though Liverpool have taken Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead douses our suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan are looking into the feasibility of signing Hojlund as they search for a striker. United paid Atalanta £72million two years ago and the Rossoneri would struggle to give the Red Devils half of their money back. And even if Hojlund has struggled, from a numbers perspective, United simply cannot afford to shed any strikers since Hojlund is the only senior specialist centre-forward they currently have.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Juventus\nSky in Italy reckon Juve have ‘begun to explore the conditions’ around a deal to sign Rashford. Which is presumably when they discover they can’t afford him without one or two parties making serious concessions. Like Barcelona, the Old Lady would have to wait until United get desperate and start considering loans.",
      "",
      "17) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao which, presumably, will supress the Old Lady’s appetite for Sancho. And with the talk of Juve interest in Rashford, what now for Sancho?",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Aston Villa\nJackson was rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United but Unai Emery is said to be keen to be reunited with the striker with whom he worked at Villarreal. Villa’s interest in Jackson is heavily linked to…",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Chelsea\nRogers is said to be Chelsea priority for the remainder of the window and while Villa are reluctant to sell, any big offer would have to be considered. If Rogers is to join Chelsea, likely triggering a Villa move for Jackson, it won’t be long before the end of the window.",
      "",
      "14) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern have made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool won’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, but £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, but it feels very unlikely the two clubs will compromise while they stand £30million apart in their current valuations. Diaz may have to force the issue.",

      "13) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "12) Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Bayern Munich\nWith Arsenal looking to sign players in the positions Trossard plays, it makes sense that they cash in on the attacker. Who just so happened to change his representatives this summer to a fella well connected with the German big-hitters. Trossard has two years remaining on his contract and would be around half the price of Diaz.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere.",
      "10) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "9) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags. Man Utd seem to have finally got their mitts on Bryan Mbeumo, which makes it less likely the Bees will entertain interest in Wissa too.",
      "",
      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement. Lord knows they’ve been discussing it for long enough.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there. And Mosquera’s farewell message suggests it is heading in the right direction.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. And since Liverpool were prepared to go way above that for Isak, Eintracht will try to squeeze Liverpool for all they are worth, even if Ekitike is keen to move to Anfield.",
      "",
      "3) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nWe have progress! United have submitted their third and final offer of £65million plus £5million in add-ons. If they hadn’t fannied about for a month, they could have saved themselves those bonus payments. Still, the widespread belief is that Brentford will accept this new bid. Even though it would be hilarious if they don’t.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion. Gyokeres’ representatives were apparently in London at the start of the week, and removal vans have been seen shifting furniture from his home in Portugal. If Arteta wants the striker on the plane for the pre-season tour, this needs to progress significantly in the next 24 hours.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger will be unveiled by Arsenal any time now after a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

Other clubs know United’s position. They’ve made it known that they’re looking to sell around five players, which signals to other clubs to make them ridiculous offers.",
      "“I would assume that’s what football clubs are doing around Europe, and Manchester United are turning them down at the moment.",
      "“The longer that goes on, I reckon those offers might be a little less ridiculous, but United want these players off the books – they’ve made their bed, and they’ve got to lie in it. They’ll probably take anything from a quarter to a fifth of their asking price for some of them.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the next signing Man Utd will make once they have formally completed deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd have agreed a £71m fee with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo but once Sir Jim Ratcliffe remembers he ‘won’t be held ransom’ they will need to find an alternative.",
      "Man Utd have ‘reached an agreement’ to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with the Red Devils set to pay £71m, according to reports.",
      "With Liverpool expected to sign the Frankfurt striker, Thierry Henry has some doubts over his consistency.",
      "Hugo Ekitike has not actually submitted what would have been the least necessary transfer request of all time, nor will Newcastle ‘now sell Alexander Isak’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United ‘will walk away’ from their deal for Bryan Mbeumo on one condition after submitting an ‘improved’ offer."

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, and they are on course to do so…",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Como – £76.7m\nThe richest club in Serie A are determined to spend money to secure European football for next season. Jesus Rodriguez is the most expensive of those to arrive so far.",
      "",
      "9) Leipzig – £79.6m\nTheir worst Bundesliga finish since promotion – and potentially the thought of a Benjamin Sesko windfall – has inspired some loose spending at Leipzig.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Bayer Leverkusen – £88m\nArmed with money from Liverpool for Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, new coach Erik ten Hag has been busy, with US international Malik Tillman coming in for a club-record fee.",
      "",
      "7) Atletico Madrid – £92.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada and Matteo Ruggeri have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again.",
      "",
      "6) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "5) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £122.1m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Aston Villa did a Chelsea by selling their women’s team to themselves to avoid a PSR breach and remove the need for unwanted player trading before June 30.",
      "But Villa’s ambitions on the pitch and in the transfer market mean they will likely need to stomach at least one high-profile departure this summer to create enough wiggle room in the current transfer window and beyond, with the amortisation of player registration costs meaning it pays to sell players and sign new ones.",
      "A stupid rule but one we’re all stuck with for now. Anyway, we’ve ranked Villa’s top ten most valuable players according to Transfermarkt by the likelihood of them being sold this summer, and have even reassigned them to willing beneficiaries.",
      "",
      "10) Boubacar Kamara (£36m) – Manchester United\nLoved by Villa fans and underrated by the rest, they’re so, so much better when Kamara’s in the team. He’s worth more to Villa than just about any Premier League side other than United, who haven’t officially admitted to Manuel Ugarte being a stunning waste of £42m but essentially have by accepting that Casemiro in central midfield incredibly remains their reality for next season.",
      "",
      "9) Ezri Konsa (£30m) – Manchester City\nWe really like Konsa and think he’s got as good a chance as anyone of starting the World Cup for England in Thomas Tuchel’s starting XI, though that perhaps sounds like higher praise than it actually is given the dearth of quality in that particular area of the pitch for the Three Lions.",
      "Anyway, he’s great and Villa shouldn’t sell him.",
      "But no-one’s untouchable in their circumstances and we’ve got a strong suspicion that City are walking into a season with a dodgy mix of young and injury-prone centre-backs.",
      "Neither Abdukodir Khusanov nor Vitor Reis convinced after arriving in January, and while the former showed signs he could develop into a quality defender, he may not be granted the luxury of easing into Premier League football when all of Manuel Akanji, John Stones and Nathan Ake are nailed on to be out of action for at least half a season.",
      "And even without widespread injury problems, we reckon Konsa would stand a very good chance of being first choice should he make the switch to the Etihad.",
      "",
      "8) Youri Tielemans (£33m) – Real Madrid\nWith Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni as his defensive midfield options, “Xabi is missing his ‘Xabi’,” sources close to the Real Madrid coach told ESPN. A’ deep-lying midfielder who can serve not only as a defensive asset but also a playmaking monster’ is essentially a description of Tielemans, who was linked with a move to the Bernabeu towards the end of his Leicester days.",
      "Villa will be loathe to lose him and we are just as uncomfortable at the thought of him not gliding across Premier League pitches next season.",
      "",
      "7) Pau Torres (£28m) – Real Madrid\nAlonso’s other Madrid priority is a new centre-back as David Alaba and Eder Militao continue to struggle with injuries while Antonio Rudiger looked at the Club World Cup as though age and years of sh*thousery are catching up with him.",
      "That leaves Alonso with young pair Dean Huijsen and Raúl Asencio, and after Torres very nearly moved to the Bernabeu in 2021, reports in April claimed Madrid were again keeping tabs on the 28-year-old.",
      "Our guess is Torres would be somewhere near the bottom of this ranking if it were up to Emery, who counted on the Spain international at Villarreal before signing him for Villa. But a decent offer for a player whose value is only going in one direction should be welcomed.",
      "",
      "6) Ian Maatsen (£24m) – Borussia Dortmund\nHis was far from the most suspicious PSR-swerving deal last summer. About four weeks before his move to the Midlands, Maatsen started the Champions League final for Borussia Dortmund and was named in that season’s team of the tournament. As an isolated deal, there could be no complaints.",
      "But we all smelled a rat given his deal was tied inextricably to Omari Kellyman’s opposite move to Chelsea.",
      "Just ten Premier League starts and a season of playing second fiddle to Lucas Digne provided decent further evidence of the transfer not being one Emery was calling out for last summer, which suggests he would be very much open to Maatsen once again being used as a pawn in this grim game of FFP chess they’re playing with whoever’s amenable.",
      "Short of a PSR pal both willing to sign Maatsen and able to attract him, a return to Dortmund it is.",
      "",
      "5) Amadou Onana (£43m) – Tottenham\nA bit of a shock for him to be Villa’s second-most valuable asset but that’s as much to do with him being 23 as it is his footballing quality, which is only good enough for the bench in Emery’s first-choice XI, with Kamara and Tielemans the undoubted best partnership at the base of midfield.",
      "That surely makes Onana a standout candidate to be shipped out, and without an obvious team outside of the Premier League willing to pay the usual premium for an as yet unproven midfielder at the very highest level, the Arsenal avenue presumably now closed following their signings of Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard and typically willing patsies for such signings Manchester United too cash-strapped to consider a bid, a move to Tottenham makes the most sense.",
      "They haven’t really got any defensive midfielders having not bothered with that sort of thing for a while, mate. And while Archie Gray is presumably still the long-term plan, he’s still a bit young and daft.",
      "",
      "4) Morgan Rogers (£48m) – Chelsea\nWhat absolutely none of us want is for Rogers to sign for a club that’s not going to play him in the season before a World Cup. The ideal would be for Rogers to be playing regularly for a team competing in the Champions League and challenging for trophies in a tournament campaign.",
      "Either of those things could happen at Chelsea, who have reportedly made him their ‘top target’ as they seek one more forward in preparation for the departures of Christopher Nkunku, Joao Felix and possibly Nicolas Jackson, whom Villa themselves are supposedly interested in.",
      "Villa have slapped an £80m price tag on him, presumably to ward off suitors rather than encouraging them as the 22-year-old – on the back of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio leaving after their loan spells – is the only clear hope for the future in Unai Emery’s attack. Then again, £80m is a lot of PSR wiggle room.",
      "",
      "3) Ollie Watkins (£36m) – Manchester United\nIt’s hard to imagine this summer transfer window not ending with Manchester United paying over the odds for Watkins having made a few quid on a couple of the bomb squad members when desperation to be rid of them sees lowball offers welcomed with open arms.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund struck what we would suggest is a HUGE BLOW by revealing he wants to stay at Old Trafford and fight what will presumably be a losing battle to start as United’s No.9 whether he actually has anyone to compete with for that position or not. Watkins’ reported interest in a move to United is likely as much to do with him being absolutely assured of a starting spot as much as anything else.",
      "Emery’s never been entirely convinced by Watkins, often starting Jhon Duran and then Rashford ahead of him, and given he turns 30 in December it feels like a good time to cash in, even if not quite at the full £60m they’re asking for.",
      "",
      "2) Leon Bailey (£24m) – Fenerbahce \nIt’s never quite worked for Bailey at Aston Villa but he’s by no means been terrible to the point where his value has plummeted – they bought him in 2021 for around £27m.",
      "Reports suggest Fenerbahce want a loan but Villa will hold out for his permanent transfer and a fee close to his valuation. Our guess is they may end up accepting a fair bit less to get him out of the door and off the wage bill.",
      "",
      "1) Jacob Ramsey (£28m) – Nottingham Forest\nForest want Ramsey as a replacement for Tottenham-bound Morgan Gibbs-White and this is the one with the most legs it seems, mainly and depressingly thanks to the two-word scourge of football – pure profit.",

      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "The club had explored a deal with Eintracht Frankfurt but have now ended their interest in the French striker. According to TBR Football, no formal bid was made, with sources at Newcastle suggesting the valuation was too high.",
      "The Carabao Cup winners have been forced to explore their options, with Liverpool courting Alexander Isak despite his £130m price tag.",
      "Sesko, who scored 21 goals and added six assists across 45 appearances for RB Leipzig last season, is now one of several options under consideration, according to the same report.",
      "The 22-year-old had been a key target for Arsenal earlier in the summer, but their attention has shifted to Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres following a breakthrough in talks.",
      "That shift has created an opening for other clubs. Intermediaries are understood to have offered Sesko to a number of Premier League sides, with Man Utd, Chelsea and Liverpool all linked in recent weeks.",
      "Newcastle are now thought to be assessing whether a deal is possible, particularly with limited value elsewhere in the current striker market.",
      "Leipzig reportedly demanded around £78 million when Arsenal were in discussions, and it’s unclear whether that valuation has changed.",

      "Sesko is said to be open to remaining in Germany but would consider a move to the Premier League if the right opportunity arose. He joined Leipzig from Red Bull Salzburg in 2023 and has quickly established himself as one of the most talked-about young forwards in the Bundesliga.",
      "The Slovenian forward recently took to Instagram to share snaps of himself modelling Leipzig’s new kit for the coming soon, suggesting a willingness to stay.",
      "Newcastle remain active in the striker market and are continuing to assess several possible additions, with reports today confirming Yoane Wissa as an option.",
      "Wissa continues to be tracked following Brentford’s rejection of an approach from Nottingham Forest. The club also missed out on Joao Pedro, who has gone on to impress for Chelsea at the Club World Cup.",
      "Anthony Elanga has already arrived from Forest to strengthen the wide areas, but further business is expected before the window closes.",
      "A new centre-forward remains a priority, with rather speculative and unfounded links around the continent linking them to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson, among others.",

      "According to reports, four reasons are behind Arsenal’s decision to sign Sporting Lisbon’s Viktor Gyokeres over RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Arsenal gave up on Benjamin Sesko to opt for Viktor Gyokeres over the lack of reasonable negotiation from RB Leipzig, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal need a striker. Viktor Gyokeres is the standout, but who else is there? From fantasy picks like Isak to the realistic Watkins, we rank 10 options.",
      "According to reports, Leipzig are ‘desperate to sell’ Benjamin Sesko to Arsenal, while another Gunners striker target ‘likes the idea of living in London’."

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has suggested that Barcelona could use one player if they wanted to reduce their asking price for Marcus Rashford, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have made just one major signing in the summer transfer window so far with Matheus Cunha arriving from Wolves in a deal worth £62.5m, while Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon has also joined from Cerro Porteno.",
      "A deal for Bryan Mbeumo is proving trickier than Man Utd would have hoped with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe refusing to reach the £70m that Brentford want to allow the Cameroon international to leave.",
      "And now Man Utd are looking to accelerate some exits from the club with Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho among the players the Red Devils are looking to offload this summer.",
      "Rashford is attracting a lot of interest this summer but many of his admirers have been put off by the £40m fee plus the huge wages he is currently on at Man Utd.",
      "And reports in Spain claim that talks between Man Utd and Barcelona ‘remain at a standstill’ over a permanent transfer for Rashford – but ‘a new element has appeared on the table in recent hours, causing surprise and immediate rejection from the Catalan club’.",
      "READ: Mediawatch: Brentford ‘U-turn’ on Mbeumo as three Man United transfers solve everything",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim ‘has suggested Fermin Lopez as a possible bargaining chip in the deal, something Barca has categorically ruled out’.",
      "Amorim has given the ‘green light’ for Rashford to leave but he ‘not willing to accept a loan, which is the option Barca is proposing due to their financial constraints’.",
      "The report adds: ‘As things stand, Fermin’s inclusion in the conversation has been seen as a non-negotiable red line , further complicating an already seemingly difficult deal. The message from Barcelona is clear: Rashford yes, but not at any price, and much less if it means losing a jewel of the club like Fermin Lopez .’",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham doesn’t think Rashford deserves a move to Barcelona after failing to perform for the Red Devils in recent times.",
      "Sheringham told Sky Bet: “If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you’re there, you appreciate it. You don’t throw it away and say you want to leave.",
      "“I find the whole episode very soul-destroying, compared to the way I was back in the day and how I strove to get the privilege to play for such a huge football club.",
      "“To hear someone talking the way he is talking, saying he wants out – I didn’t like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doing that at Arsenal, I thought it was soul-destroying, and I hope Rashford doesn’t get the move that he’s hankering for. From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that’s a step up that he hasn’t deserved.”",
      "On the need to sell before Man Utd can buy, Sheringham added: “Manchester United did a lot of business at the start of the window – they got Matheus Cunha in and there was also talk about Bryan Mbeumo joining from Brentford. It was an exciting time, and it sounded like they’d have a right go this summer, but then it stagnated.",
      "“This stagnation has probably got a lot to do with the players that need to get out of the door this summer. When you’re trying to get players out of your football club that don’t want to be there, that’s probably one of the hardest parts of management, especially when they are on big money.",
      "“There is a lot of money they need to get off the wage bill before they start buying more players. The owners probably thought it would be easier to offload these players to other clubs, but they’re finding it hard – that’s the problem.”",
      "Man Utd have reportedly reserved some money to buy Gabriel Sara from Galatasaray this summer, while there is an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Man Utd have agreed a £71m fee with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo but once Sir Jim Ratcliffe remembers he ‘won’t be held ransom’ they will need to find an alternative.",
      "Juventus are also interested in bringing Marcus Rashford to Serie A this summer after edging closer to a deal for Jadon Sancho, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Marcus Rashford’s ‘entourage’ are considering taking drastic action to ensure the forward leaves Manchester United this summer.",
      "Liverpool have ‘floated’ the idea of bringing in a Man Utd player if they miss out on signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle, according to reports.",

      "It’s a Manchester United-heavy Mediawatch today, with absolutely everything (absolutely nothing) changing in their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "Learn to turn\nThe Mirror bring us the latest update from Manchester United’s frankly interminable quest to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "MBEU-NO! Brentford star’s protracted Man Utd transfer takes fresh U-turn as new Bees boss Andrews puts his foot down with Red Devils wanting to wrap up deal",
      "That’s the almost Mail-length headline that parps out at you from the Mirror’s football homepage this morning.",
      "The story itself has a slightly less parpy version, but it says much the same thing.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo to Man Utd transfer U-turn as manager privately changes things",
      "Mediawatch has largely given up on its dispiritingly futile campaign Words Have Meanings but we can’t help but reopen it for one day only.",
      "We’ve learned to be wary of assuming anything, but we are reasonably confident that the idea of a U-turn is widely understood. It represents at the very least a significant change in policy or point or view and ideally a complete reversal from that previously held position.",
      "As the Mirror themselves state, the problem for United getting the Mbeumo deal done has been that Brentford have stuck to their initial valuation and refused to budge.",
      "The Red Devils have seen several bids for the Cameroon forward rejected, the last being £60million, with the Bees sticking robustly to their valuation. The two parties remain millions apart in their respective figures and the change in the dugout has not helped.",
      "So what’s changed from the Brentford side here to represent a U-turn? Over to their director of football Phil Giles.",
      "‘We’ve made our point clear. If Bryan earned a massive move now and it was right for us financially, we’d be open to it. But if he ended up here with us next season, I wouldn’t be massively surprised. We’d be delighted. And it would save me a massive headache, frankly.’",
      "So Brentford’s position has U-turned all the way from ‘We are willing to sell him but only at a price that’s right for us’ to ‘We are willing to sell him but only at a price that’s right for us’.",
      "It’s all driving us round the U-bend.",
      "",
      "Tag nuts\nThe Mbeumo nonsense doesn’t end there, we’re afraid. It’s off to The Sun next on this magical mystery tour.",
      "Man Utd ‘refusing to be held to ransom’ as Brentford increase price tag for 20-goal star Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Have they? Have their increased their asking price? Let’s see.",
      "According to The Guardian, at the end of June Man Utd director of football, Jason Wilcox, believed a package of £65m would be enough to strike a deal.",
      "But since then, Brentford have raised their price for the attacker – who reported for pre-season training this week – closer to £70m.",
      "Not quite, is it? Clearly, £65m isn’t a number Man United have plucked out of thin air, but their believing it would be enough doesn’t mean Brentford’s actual asking price being ‘closer to £70m’ constitutes an increase in price tag.",
      "While we’re here, we’re also going to point out that wanting to buy a footballer for one price and his current football club insisting the actual price is slightly higher actually does not in any way constitute being ‘held to ransom’.",
      "Now Mediawatch has pointed that out, we know we can sit back comfortably, secure in the knowledge we will never ever see it again. It’s always worked that way before when we grind our teeth to dust about this kind of thing.",
      "Still, though. There’s undeniably an interesting dynamic that is present in almost all the reports around Mbeumo and Brentford and United today, and that’s the framing of Brentford as being the problem.",
      "Their position with regards to any potential sale of Mbeumo has been almost entirely consistent and thoroughly reasonable (‘We’ll sell, but only at our price’) throughout the summer, yet they are the ones portrayed as moving the goalposts with non-existent or wildly exaggerated U-turns and price-tag chicanery.",
      "Mediawatch cheerfully admits to being a massive cynic yet also tries to avoid ever descending too far down Tinfoil Hat Alley. But it’s impossibly tempting this morning to see the hand of one club attempting to steer the media towards a certain narrative here, if one is so inclined.",
      "",
      "One of Manchester United’s weakest squad areas is now their strongest after three transfers",
      "One area of the Manchester United squad that almost certainly will not be addressed this summer is central defence.",
      "United have signed at least one centre back in seven of the past nine summer transfer windows. Three came in last season alone.",
      "That’s where the headline came from, anyway.",
      "After Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt joined in the summer, Ayden Heaven followed in the winter. In between, the one-year extension in Harry Maguire’s contract was triggered.",
      "Once Lisandro Martinez has recovered from his anterior cruciate ligament injury, United will have five specialist centre halves with an average age of 24. Two are homegrown and three from overseas.",
      "That’s a fairly liberal coating of gloss applied to a brutal injury. Not United’s fault, of course, but the idea that the centre-back cupboards are overflowing while such a key defender is recovering from such a significant injury feels slightly over-optimistic.",
      "But it’s that average age we’re interested in. The devil is in the detail when it comes to average age, because 24 sounds absolutely ideal doesn’t it? That’s a great age for a player, carrying as it does the idea of having reached a particular level of experience and ability to be a reliable senior first-team player, while also still potentially approaching the peak with many years still ahead of you.",
      "Of course you want lots of 24-year-old players. But an average age of 24 doesn’t actually mean lots of players who are 24. And in the case of the five players here, you’re actually looking at players who are 18, 19, 25, 27 and 32. That’s suddenly two very inexperienced teenagers, one player nearing the end of his career and only two at or approaching their potential peak, one of whom is also on the road back from a very, very serious injury.",
      "Centre-back is absolutely not be the most pressing area of Man United concern right now, but we’d humbly contend that this is because other areas are more conspicuously f*cked than United having locked this particular area down for the next decade by being so brilliant.",
      "",
      "Strike it lucky\nAnd this Daily Express headline caught Mediawatch’s eye this morning",
      "Man Utd can strike clever Pervis Estupinan swap deal and solve Ruben Amorim headache",
      "Given everything we know about Manchester United and swap deals, we’re going to just go right ahead and say it: no, they can’t.",
      "Oh, and it’s Antony, by the way. If you’re interested. Because one news site in Brazil says they might have expressed some interest at some point in signing a player who is desperate to join Real Betis.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the next signing Man Utd will make once they have formally completed deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "The start of a new Premier League season means one thing.",
      "Well, that’s not true. It means several things. But among those things is managers being under pressure, sacked and replaced. It is a tale as old as time.",
      "So we decided to have a little look at the current Sack Race market and then predict who the under-pressure managers might be replaced by should such replacements be needed.",
      "It was going to be a top five, but then there were two managers joint fifth so it became a top six. Then we noticed that the three managers joint seventh were at Newcastle, Manchester United and West Ham all of which felt interesting in one way or another, so it became a top nine.",
      "So nine it is. Always the best number for a feature, in our experience.",
      "We’re not saying all, or even most, of these nine managers will fall. But we’d be staggered if at least a few of them aren’t out on their ear by Christmas. And these are their guaranteed (not a guarantee) replacements…",
      "",
      "Newcastle\nOUT: Eddie Howe\nIN: Jose Mourinho",
      "We’ve been slightly thrown by this one. After years of desperate and very childish attempts from us to manifest some kind of Howe Sack narrative from thin air, we’d reluctantly accepted that delivering the longest-awaited silverware and finishing in the top five to bag a return to Champions League football would end any hope of that for at least several months.",
      "And now a Howe Sack narrative appears to have manifested from thin air. We don’t believe it for a second. Surely not.",
      "But football is football and unthinkably harsh and/or stupid things happen all the time. The sense remains that if Newcastle did move on from Howe it would be from a desire to elevate the brand and the name to the next level, which would mean going down the kind of Elite Serial Winner route that definitely always works and is definitely always a good idea.",
      "It still feels like Mourinho has unfinished business and scores to settle in the Barclays, and probably there will always be unfinished business and scores to settle in the Barclays for Mourinho.

      "We’ve said before that Potter and West Ham are perhaps the most interesting manager-club storyline of all heading into this season, because it feels like the one with the biggest range of realistic possible outcomes.",
      "Potter sacked by October feels entirely believable. Potter winning three manager of the month awards in a row with West Ham third in the table in October feels entirely believable too.",
      "But if it is indeed the former, where do West Ham turn next? They’ve tried Moyes and a Spanish Moyes and didn’t care for either. They’ve tried a coach’s coach. Again, does feel like the next step could be almost anything from anywhere.",
      "Almost every other name we’ve got on this list for someone else also feels like they could very much also end this season in the London Stadium dugout with all bubbles floating around them.",
      "We’re going with Gareth Southgate, though. A man so indelibly linked with the England job is perfect for a club that still bases around 63 per cent of its identity on ‘winning the World Cup’ in 1966. The remaining 37 per cent is split between Danny Dyer, the aforementioned bubbles, and disliking Tottenham. Just if you were wondering.",

      "They’ve managed to sign precisely one first-team player for a squad in very obvious need of far more significant surgery to give the manager they chose knowing full well how his teams played any kind of fighting chance of success.",
      "Matheus Cunha is a wonderful player, and we’re very excited to see him step up to a big club. But there’s also no denying that part of that excitement is because he is a very loose maverick who is liable to do something very batsh*t that, combined as it now is with the Manchester United spotlight, comes to dominate the news agenda for several days/weeks.",
      "And… that’s it. That’s all they’ve managed to do. Ruben Amorim, the manager in most obviously conspicuous need of getting a squad that is his and a pre-season with them is going to get neither of those things. And he’s still going to have Casemiro as his midfielder by the looks of it.",
      "So yes, the chance of another managerial search on the red side of Manchester this season is definitely very, very real, and there are only so many viable candidates for a club with their wild combination of heft and stupidity.",
      "It’s starting to look a little bit like it might almost be an impossible job, on the straightforward basis that anyone who’s actually willing to take it on has already in that act itself proved themselves unsuitable.",
      "So who knows where United turn next if turn they must.

Especially if the delicate balancing act between domestic and European exertions proves taxing. Especially as those European exertions will now be at the higher Europa League level.",

      "Kjetil Knutsen has done all that and more in his transformative time at the helm of Bodo/Glimt, a club who have come to dominate Norwegian football without any of the usual surrounding unpleasantnesses that come with teams that emerge from basically nowhere to dominate a country’s football.",

      "Man Utd made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, and have been pursuing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Friday 18 July 2025 15:11, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.",
      "Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, with agreement having now been reached over a £71 million deal for the Cameroon international.",
      "On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.",
      "But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson of Chelsea is another situation United are monitoring.",
      "While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",

      "Man Utd confident of signing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo in time for their summer tour of the US; Marcus Rashford has returned to the club's training ground; Real Betis still pushing for a deal to sign Antony; Juve & Napoli remain interested in Jadon Sancho",
      "Wednesday 9 July 2025 15:05, UK",
      "Manchester United remain optimistic of agreeing a deal to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo in time for the forward to be part of their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "United kick off their US tour with a game against West Ham in New Jersey on July 26.",
      "There remains a gap in valuation, but United are not far away from the overall fee Brentford want - believed to be £65m - however there is still work to do on the structure as the west London club want the majority, if not all, of the fee to be paid up front.",
      "Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.",
      "United are also still working on outgoings and, despite being given extra time to find a solution on his future, Marcus Rashford has returned to the club's training ground at Carrington.",
      "The striker is training away from the first team and using the club's medical and rehab facilities.",
      "Rashford's preference is a move to Barca, who have explored the conditions of a deal, but they have other targets in that position too such as Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.",
      "Williams has signed a new contract at Athletic Club and Liverpool have rejected all approaches for Diaz, however.",
      "Antony is another player United are happy to sell and Real Betis are still pushing for a deal for the winger.",
      "Talks between the clubs have been over a permanent deal - but it is thought the idea of another loan has been broached.",
      "However, for United to consider another loan this summer, it is thought they would want an obligation to buy him attached.",
      "The Betis president has admitted a permanent deal is difficult to do given the finances involved.",
      "Antony impressed on a straight loan in the second half of last season at Betis, scoring nine goals in 24 appearances.",
      "Elsewhere, Juventus and Napoli remain interested in a deal for United forward Jadon Sancho.",
      "Both clubs have been made aware by United what fee it would take to sign Sancho - believed to be £25m, with the sides both discussing terms with the England international's representatives.",
      "Juve have other targets, including Porto's Francsico Conceicao, however, and Sky in Italy are reporting that the Portugal international is their preferred choice.",
      "Conceicao was on a season-long loan in Turin last season and, until and including July 15, his release clause is €30m, which Porto want paid up front in full, although it goes up to €45m on July 16.",
