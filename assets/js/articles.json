      "Tottenham Hotspur's 17-year trophy drought is over after Spurs emerged victorious from the battle of the Premier League underachievers in Bilbao.",
      "Brennan Johnson smuggled the ball over the line three minutes before half-time for the only goal of a desperately poor Europa League final, in which Manchester United failed to inspire.",
      "The closest Ruben Amorim's side came to a goal was through a Rasmus Hojlund header which was superbly cleared off the line by Micky van de Ven, who stood tall as Spurs delivered a trophy to the delight of their often-criticised manager Ange Postecoglou.",
      "The Australian wore a delighted grin as he lived up to his promise of winning a trophy in his second season and earned Champions League qualification, with United left crestfallen and without European football of any kind next season.",
      "There was a fairly frantic feel to the opening proceedings in Bilbao, where the do-or-die nature of the game - a match which would serve as a season-saver for the winner, and condemn the loser to one of their worst campaigns in living memory - was leading the sides 16th and 17th in the Premier League toward a somewhat manic approach.",
      "Johnson was denied by Andre Onana from a tight angle, before the Welshman's team-mate Richarlison had a shot blocked.",
      "At the other end Guglielmo Vicario flapped at a Bruno Fernandes corner, with Amad Diallo picking up the loose ball and flashing a fierce drive across the face of goal and beyond the United attackers.",
      "That early promise then largely disappeared from the game though, and it became bogged down in a deep lack of quality full of errors on both sides. Hopes for a goal centred on either a piece of inspiration or a mistake, and three minutes before half-time the latter arrived.",
      "Fernandes gave the ball away to Pape Sarr, and after the Senegalese briefly loaned it to Richarlison and Rodrigo Bentancur he swung in a cross towards the darting Johnson, who swiped and flailed at it just enough to discomfort Shaw.",
      "The ball struck the United defender's arm and dropped towards goal, seemingly via the faintest touch from Johnson, with Onana unable to claw it away. Goal. Not the prettiest one you've ever seen in a European final, but Spurs didn't care.",
      "They had something to hold on to now, but while they would have perhaps expected an onslaught at the start of the second half one never really arrived. Attempts to progress the ball ended up being stifled by the hard-working Spurs midfield and wide players, and the game remained scrappy beyond the hour mark.",
      "United weren't creating anything, and indeed their most dangerous outlet was proving to be Vicario. The Spurs goalkeeper got in a muddle with Dominic Solanke from a Fernandes free-kick, but Hojlund's goalbound header was acrobatically and brilliantly cleared off the line by Van de Ven.",
      "Ruben Amorim eventually turned to his bench to introduce Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho, and suddenly there was a greater threat going forward. Fernandes headed just wide and you knew more chances were coming.",
      "Garnacho brought a sharp stop from Vicario but it was all so poor from United, and as Harry Maguire moved into the centre-forward position as an act of desperation, Vicario saved well late on from Luke Shaw.",
      "Spurs eventually emerged as winners of the slugfest, and will quickly forget just how they did it."

      "Rio Ferdinand has stopped short of blaming Luke Shaw for Tottenham's goal in the Europa League final - instead directing his frustration at Patrick Dorgu for his lack of communication.",
      "The north Londoners scored the opening goal at the San Mames with Brennan Johnson the man on the spot. He was able to make a darting run and got a touch to send the ball goal-bound, sneaking in despite Andre Onana's desperate dive in the Manchester United goal.",
      "The cross has rebounded off of Shaw, but Ferdinand insists Dorgu has to be shouting at his defender to let him know that the Tottenham attacker is making a run.",
      "United only signed Dorgu in January with the Dane joining from Leece, who were by no means challenging for honours, and Ferdinand believes the lack of experience may have been telling for the night's opening goal.",
      "\"I always say the defender the furthest away is your talker and your eyes and ears. He has to signal the other players. He has to shout, scream, push, whatever, and let them know players are running across them, and he didn't do that and they got punished.\"",
      "\"It is scrappy. It comes off Luke Shaw, does he get a touch? It doesn't matter.\" Meanwhile, former Spurs goalkeeper Paul Robinson highlighted Andre Onana's role in the goal. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It was a wonderful ball in from the left and the United defence couldn't deal with it. Johnson got there in front of his marker, Onana dived fumbled it with his left, fumbled it with his right and couldn't keep it out.\"",
      "The importance and value of the Europa League final has been underlined for weeks. Tottenham want to end a trophy drought that dates back to 2008 but the winner will also land themselves a spot in the Champions League and all the riches it offers."

      "Romero did eventually get back to his feet, but clearly Maguire felt that the Tottenham man was making more of the incident than was necessary.",
      "Even in the early minutes of the second-half the two defenders were exchanging verbals, albeit Romero was the man in the driving seat with Tottenham leading the final at the San Mames, owing to Brennan Johnson's goal just before half-time.",
      "The clash is do-or-die for both the Premier League sides, who have been poor domestically, but can claim a trophy and ensure passage into next season's Champions League with victory on Wednesday night.",
      "Maguire has been crucial in getting United to the final itself, scoring a dramatic winner in the last eight. The Red Devils scored three times in the final minutes to complete an incredible comeback over the French side.",
      "Despite there being a trophy and huge sums on offer in the Europa League final Maguire insists victory would not change the narrative of their season as he confessed they have been well below the standards they demand of themselves.",

      "Gareth Bale admits the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson was a major factor in him opting to snub Manchester United and join Real Madrid. In 2013 the Welshman made a then world-record move to the Spanish giants.",
      "Bale had just been named the PFA Player of the Year for the second time with a number of the world's biggest clubs circling. Those in Manchester looked to land the forward, but they were soon in the midst of searching for a new manager after Ferguson confirmed he was calling it a day.",
      "Had the Scot remained at the helm then Bale admits he'd have had more of a decision to make, but his departure meant that Real were always frontrunners in his mind.",
      "The Welshman also concedes that United's squad was ageing and he feared for what the future would hold and his decision to head to Spain was quickly justified as he claimed the Champions League in his first season.",
      "He told talkSPORT: “It was a couple of times I was close to joining but it never quite materialised. I think the closest was when I actually joined Madrid. It was between United and Real, and at the time Fergie had left, so it didn’t quite have that aura.",
      "“I think the team was ageing a little bit so I felt like I’d always had my heart set on Madrid anyway. I feel like I made the right decision in the end, not to be horrible to Man Utd fans, I feel I made the right choice.",
      "“I think it would have definitely been a bigger factor (if Fergie had stayed). Having such a legendary manager, somebody with that kind of pedigree who you kind of trust with your career. It definitely would have made the decision a lot harder but ultimately he wasn’t (staying), so it was more of a simple decision for me.”",
      "Bale's CV would blossom throughout his time in the Spanish capital. When he left he'd won La Liga on three occasions and lifted the European Cup on five occasions before seeing out his career in Los Angeles.",
      "United's transfer success has plummeted since Ferguson's exit. They've spent huge sums on players, many of whom have underdelivered. Meanwhile they also missed out on several major targets - in the period immediately after Ferguson's retirement the club tried and failed to sign the likes of Bale, Cesc Fabregas and Toni Kroos."

Garnacho was previously on an upward curve in Manchester, but Amorim has cited issues with his game and has chosen to name him among the subs.",

Thousands of Tottenham fans gathered along two major avenues in the centre of Bilbao which bought traffic to a halt as they drank beer and sang late into Tuesday night.",

      "Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur were aiming to put their rotten seasons behind them by claiming silverware with success in the Europa League, and it's Spurs who did the business. Brennan Johnson scored the only goal of the game, with an acrobatic goal-line clearance from Micky van de Ven vital in keeping them in front.",
      "After a scrappy first half, Johnson's effort deflected in off Luke Shaw a couple of minutes before the break. Spurs didn't threaten a great deal after the break, but it didn't matter.",
      "Ange Postecoglou made the bold decision to leave captain Son Heung-min out of his starting line-up, with Richarlison preferred on the left-hand side and vice-captain Cristian Romero leading the team out. Ruben Amorim's Manchester United gamble was less successful, with Mason Mount backed over Alejandro Garnacho and failing to justify his selection.",
      "United pushed for an equaliser after the break, with Van de Ven hooking a Rasmus Hojlund header off the line after unconvincing play from goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. The Italian keeper redeemed himself late on, though, saving brilliantly as Shaw threatened a stoppage-time equaliser.",
      "Brennan Johnson is Spurs' match-winner, and said he's expecting a mic drop moment when Ange Postecoglou speaks to the media.",
      "The boss said he wins in his second season and so it proved.",
      "It's a win for Spurs, but will it be enough for their manager to stick around?",
      "Speaking before the game, Jamie Carragher and Roy Keane suggested Ange Postecoglou would leave in the summer, win or lose.",
      "There's one more league game to go, and after that we'll know what's next for the Australian.",
      "\"I don't think they've done enough to deserve it,\" Rio Ferdinand says of his former club Manchester United.",
      "\"Both teams were more scared to lose the game.",
      "\"The [Spurs] keeper I think made one save in the whole game and you can't expect to win a trophy like that\"",
      "\"Incredible - I've got no nails left!\" - that's the instant reaction from former Spurs player and manager Glenn Hoddle",
      "\"Fantastic for the club.",
      "\"It wasn't a classic but cup finals are about winning games.\"",
      "It's all over!",
      "Spurs have held on and are the Europa League champions.",
      "They'll be playing Champions League football next season, while Manchester United won't have European football at all.",
      "Leny Yoro's tried his luck from distance but he can't find the target.",
      "A huge cheer for that from the Spurs end,",
      "Still time for another chance, with Luke Shaw winning a header inside the box, but there's a big Vicario save - and a similar fan reaction.",
      "This will go down as one of the worst European finals in history.",
      "The standard of football is desperate.",
      "Which feels fitting, considering what remains at stake for both clubs.",
      "Both managers are becoming increasingly animated on the sidelines.",
      "United remain on top, largely because Spurs have no outlet when they get the ball.",

      "Brennan Johnson's race is run.",
      "The forward is making way, with defender Kevin Danso on in his place.",
      "With 12 minutes to go, Spurs are switching to a back five and it could be a case of 'what we have, we hold'.",
      "That didn't take long.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho picks up the ball wide left and runs at Pedro Porro before firing in a low shot.",
      "This time, though, Vicario gets a strong hand to it and the ball goes behind for a corner,",
      "Ruben Amorim has turned to his bench with 20 minutes to go.",
      "It's time for Alejandro Garnacho, as some predicted, with Joshua Zirkzee also coming on.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Mason Mount are the players withdrawn.",
      "So close to an equaliser!",
      "Micky van de Ven has to be at his acrobatic best to clear Rasmus Hojlund's header off the line!",
      "It's another let-off for Vicario, who came for a high ball in the box but couldn't clear the danger. Still 1-0.",
      "United are pushing now, but they're leaving themselves open on the counter.",
      "They were almost punished, too, and a better first touch from Dominic Solanke might have had Spurs doubling their lead.",
      "It might be a cliche, but the next goal here will be huge.",
      "Bruno Fernandes swings in a free-kick from the right, and Leny Yoro gets to it before Guglielmo Vicario.",
      "The Spurs keeper was certainly second to the ball, but got his body in the way of Yoro's toed effort to keep the ball out.",
      "That could have gone very differently.",
      "Loud chants of 'Oh when the Spurs go marching in' can be heard in San Mames.",
      "Still a long way to go, but United haven't looked massively close to pulling level since they fell behind.",
      "The winner of tonight's final will earn just shy of £11m, with £5.9m in prize money going the way of the losers.",
      "That's on top of the millions United and Spurs got for their group stage achievements.",
      "And it's before we get on to the significant sums the winner will secure for next season due to Champions League qualification.",

      "They've just had a little pow wow at the start of half time.",
      "A few fist bumps and all smiles.",
      "Still a long way to go, of course, but safe to say spirits high in the Spurs camp following that first half.",
      "Manchester United came desperately close to winning this competition back in 2021.",
      "They overcame Real Sociedad along the way that time, just as they have in 2025, before overcoming AC Milan, Granada and Roma.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side came up short in the final, though, with Villarreal claiming a dramatic penalty-shootout win as David de Gea failed from the spot.",
      "Did you experience buffering on your stream of the match during the first half?",
      "You weren't the only ones, with fans complaining on social media.",
      "Here's the moment where Spurs went in front.",
      "We've seen scrappy goals win big games in the past, and this was certainly scrappy.",
      "United will hope it's not the decider, though.",
      "That goal at the end of the first half is the difference for now.",
      "Will Ruben Amorim be tempted to turn to his United bench at the break?",
      "Will Ange Postecoglou urge his side to push for a second, or will Spurs sit back?",
      "Brennan Johnson has the opener!",
      "The Spurs fans go wild in the stands, and for good reason.",
      "Their top scorer ghosts in behind the back-line and gets a touch which isn't the cleanest, but it hits Luke Shaw and squeaks past Andre Onana.",
      "It might eventually go down as an own goal, but Spurs won't mind either way.",
      "As expected, with so much at stake for both teams, this has been a cagey, tense opening to the final, with few clear-cut chances, other than Brennan Johnson's shot, which was saved by Andre Onana, and Amad's angled effort, which flashed just wide.",
      "Predictably low on quality, for a final between the sides in 16th and 17th position in the Premier League, there has been little flow or fluency to the game.",
      "He's not so impressed with either goalkeeper, though.",
      "After witnessing Andre Onana and Guglielmo Vicario in action, he's suggested the two managers might be ready to encourage players to start peppering the opposition goal.",
      "One notable absentee in Bilbao tonight will be Erik ten Hag.",
      "The former Manchester United manager has not been invited to the Europa League final between his former club and Tottenham.",
      "Ten Hag took charge of five United games in the competition earlier this season, and remained unbeaten.",
      "Before getting sacked in November.",
      "So he could argue he helped get United to this showpiece game.",
      "He left in bitter circumstances, so it's not surprising his pride has persuaded him not to even make his own way to the final.",
      "Unlike fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal, who was invited to the 2017 final, despite having been sacked by United at the end of the previous season.",
      "He even turned up in official club gear, too.",
      "Now it's the turn of Ruben Amorim's team to threaten.",
      "Amad finds space in the box and drives a dangerous ball across, but there's no United player there to convert.",
      "Getting closer to a breakthrough for one of these two sides.",
      "Both teams have started as though they have a point to prove … the point being they really are the 16th and 17th worse teams in the Premier League.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was caught offside within 30 seconds and since then, the opening exchanges have been littered with errors and fouls.",
      "Big-game nerves? Sure. But while this occasion might yet prove to be high on thrills, don’t expect it to be high on quality.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson is sat slap bang next to Sir Jim Ratcliffe in the Manchester United posh seats.",
      "A great meeting of minds.",
      "And one between two men who were at odds with each other earlier this season, when Ratcliffe decided to axe the managerial great as a United ambassador.",
      "Even Fergie hasn't been spared the ruthless nature of how Ratcliffe does business.",
      "But it all looks quite convivial for now."

      "Canada striker Jonathan David will be a wanted man this summer as he prepares to leave Lille on a free transfer. Manchester United are among the clubs in the mix for the Ligue 1 hotshot, but his international boss Jesse Marsch doesn't expect him to go anywhere without a guarantee of first team football.",
      "David will be one of the leading men for Canada as they look to get out of the group stage at a men's World Cup for the first time. They picked up just one point in Qatar in 2022, but enter the 2026 edition as co-hosts along with the United States and Mexico.",
      "25-year-old striker David is already his country's all-time top scorer, but enters this summer with a big decision to make. And it's one with former Leeds boss Marsch - who led Canada to third place in the CONCACAF Nations League in March - has shed some light on what the frontman will think about ahead of his upcoming move.",
      "“Knowing Johnny, he is going to want to play,” Marsch told reporters as Canada named a preliminary squad ahead of this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup. “He’s going to want to go to the best club he can be at. And I think achieve the most in terms of what it would mean to compete for trophies in Europe.",
      "\"But he’s going to want to play as well. And I think that’s important. I think the most important thing for him is, it’s not good if he goes somewhere and then he has to play on the bench a lot and not get minutes to keep himself sharp and fit and ready to go, especially with the World Cup being a year away.”",
      "United are among a number of sides keen on David, who scored 109 goals across 232 games for Lille. Napoli are also reported to have held talks with a view to a swoop, while Inter Milan have also been linked.",
      "If the forward joins Inter, Marsch wouldn't expect him to feature in the Gold Cup. That tournament overlaps with the Club World Cup, where Inter have been drawn in a group with River Plate, Urawa Red Diamonds and Monterrey.",
      "Lille finished fifth in Ligue 1 this season, securing Europa League football next term. However, ahead of the final game of the season, David confirmed it would be his last.",
      "\"I wanted you to hear from me that after five years at the club, it's time to say goodbye,\" he said on Instagram. \"I've spent five amazing years in Lille.I know it hasn't been the easiest, but I hope that my goals and celebrations have brought you joy and happiness. It's been a long and fun ride, and especially with those two titles that we won together, I think [that] makes the story even better.\"",
      "He also shared a message to his team-mates, coaches and club staff, before addressing the fans once more and saying: \"I know the beginning wasn't the easiest, we had some hard moments, but I think that with your support and your help it has helped me flourish throughout all these years and make me the player I am today.\""

      "Donny van de Beek has claimed his injury struggles date back to his time warming the bench at Manchester United. The Dutchman was signed in 2020 but was unable to ever make himself a regular.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer spent £35million to land the versatile attacker, but only made us of him sporadically as Van de Beek's frustration mounted. He scored on his debut but was rarely preferred to Bruno Fernandes with his minutes very much at a premium.",
      "He's since left, joining Girona in Spain, but has continued to battle an Achilles issue. The Dutchman has enjoyed far more minutes than he did at Old Trafford but clearly still has a chip on his shoulder when it comes to his underwhelming stint in Manchester.",
      "Solskjaer continued to defend his lack of use of the player, but in the years since Van de Beek's health has been a battle. He confessed that the time he spent as a sub means his body was less accustomed to the intensity of playing regularly.",
      "He told SportBible: \"It’s difficult to build rhythm and confidence when you’re constantly being sidelined. It’s hard to be at your best when you're in and out of the team, and I think when you're not playing regularly. Your body isn’t used to the intensity and you become more prone to injuries. The lack of consistent minutes didn’t help either.\"",
      "Van de Beek's goal on his debut did little to aid his cause and even when he would impress he was quickly returned to his bench role. He also admits the random cameos did nothing for his case with bit part minutes not helping him become a regular.",
      "He said: \"I think I deserved more chances, especially in my first year. I didn’t play all the time, but when I did, I had some good games. I was convinced I would get more opportunities. I felt good, and thought, ‘Okay, my time will come’ but for some reason, it didn’t happen. After a year or two, it gets harder because if you don’t get a longer run of games then it’s difficult to prove yourself.\"",
      "Van de Beek would score the last goal of the Solskjaer era as he came off the bench to score what would be a consolation during a 4-1 loss at Watford. The Norwegian was forced to defend his use of the player on several occasions and claimed leaving him on the bench spoke to the quality of the squad.",
      "\"I think it says a lot about our depth of quality in the squad that we don't have to use him every single game,\" he said.",
      "Despite that claim Van de Beek would make just four starts in his only full season under Solskjaer and things didn't change when Erik ten Hag, who coached him at Ajax, came on board before he eventually left Manchester."

      "Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke has urged the club to make a surprise move for Liverpool's Darwin Nunez. The Uruguay international looks poised to leave Anfield this summer, but his next destination has yet to be confirmed.",
      "Atletico Madrid are among the clubs believed to be in the mix for Nunez. They may well have the upper hand, too, with the former Benfica star reportedly in favour of a move to the Spanish capital.",
      "There have also been reports of interest from Saudi Arabia, though a European stay appears to be the player's preference. United haven't been linked themselves, but are expected to strengthen in attack after a tough season in front of goal for leading man Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "\"He’s not quite lived up to expectations and sometimes a new start might be a good thing for a player, rather than being there and just being another number and getting game time occasionally,\" Yorke told gamblingindustrynews.com. \"What I see is an individual wanting a platform to become the top man at the football club. He’s not going to get that with Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk and the other players who they have there.",

I look at the young man who has a good presence, who has a little bit of zest in him, who’s got all ingredients to be even better than what he’s actually producing at the minute.\"",
      "Nunez joined Liverpool in the summer of 2022 for an initial £64million plus up to £21m in add-ons. However, he looks poised to leave Anfield with three years of his deal remaining.",
      "He scored 48 goals in all competitions in his final Benfica season, but has yet to reach that tally in three seasons as a Liverpool player. Just seven of his 40 Reds goals have arrived this season, with manager Arne Slot tending to use him as a substitute.",
      "Liverpool boss Slot has pointed to the need for added weapons after his rotation failed to pay off in some high-profile defeats. The comments come after the Dutchman criticised Nunez for his approach during a draw with Aston Villa back in February in which he missed a golden chance.",
      "\"I would prefer him to score but the word 'chance' says it all,\" Slot said at the time. \"It's a chance so it's not 100 per cent sure that the ball goes in, and players miss chances,\"",
      "\"What was a bit harder for me to accept was his behaviour after that chance. I think it got too much in his head, where he wasn't the usual Darwin that works his a** off and makes sure he helps the team.\""

      "Former Manchester United star Phil Jones believes Rasmus Hojlund would benefit from an Old Trafford exit. Hojlund, 22, has endured an arduous second campaign on the red side of Manchester, where he has failed to justify his price-tag.",
      "Since the Red Devils paid Atalanta £72million for his services in 2023, the Dane has struggled for consistency in the United frontline. This season, he has only mustered ten goals and four assists in 50 appearances in all competitions, with nine of his goal contributions coming in the Europa League.",
      "Amorim was flitting between Hojlund and summer signing Joshua Zirkzee, until the latter picked up an injury that ruled him out for the rest of the campaign. Jones, who was part of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad that last won the Premier League, believes Hojlund may be better suited under Jose Mourinho.",
      "While speaking to OLBG, Jones described the Scandinavian forward as: \"A typical Jose Mourinho type of player - typical No.9.\"",
      "The ex-Blackburn Rovers defender then added: \"It’s a difficult one, I feel really sorry for him (Hojlund). It's obviously been a difficult season for him, but I always find it's difficult for a No. 9 in a difficult season.",
      "\"He's probably not getting the chances, you know, the seven, eight chances a game. He's feeding off one or two that might come into him in the 70th minute, and he's got to produce.",
      "\"It hasn't quite happened for him yet. It's been difficult for him, but I think if he were to move on, he would probably benefit from that. A bit like Marcus (Rashford), it's a fresh start for him.",
      "\"It's a difficult one for Rasmus Hojlund. What I would say is, I think that Man United will be looking for another No. 9. Maybe that would take a bit of the pressure off him as well if he can manage his minutes between the two No. 9s.\"",
      "Mourinho left United midway through the 2018-19 campaign after being given his marching orders by the club. Having managed Tottenham Hotspur and AS Roma, Mourinho is now in charge of Turkish giants Fenerbahce.",
      "Interestingly, Turkish outlet Sozcu recently claimed Hojlund was being eyed as a potential signing for Mourinho at the Sukru Saracoglu Stadium. There have also been suggestions that United manager Ruben Amorim may want to bring in his own forward, having inherited Hojlund and Zirkzee from Erik ten Hag's reign.",
      "The Red Devils have been linked with a move for Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap. The ex-Manchester City forward is believed to have a release clause worth around £30m.",
      "He has impressed for the East Anglians this year, netting 12 goals and contributing two assists, despite playing for a side who were convincingly relegated this season. United have also been mentioned as a potential destination for Sporting Lisbon forward Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The Swedish striker starred under Amorim before the United boss left the Portuguese giants to take up the reins at Old Trafford.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that an emotional phone call with his old Sporting CP kitman left him in tears on the eve of Manchester United's Europa League final. Fernandes joined United from the Liga Portugal side in a £47million move back in January 2020.",
      "He has gone on to become one of the club's key players, if not their most important. However, it's evident that Fernandes still holds a major soft spot for Leões, as evidenced by a call with João Reis that left him crying tears of joy.",
      "Sporting were crowned Liga Portugal winners on Saturday after beating Vitória Guimarães 2-0 on home soil, finishing two points clear of rivals Benfica. And it appears as though the club which put Fernandes on the world stage hasn't forgot about him, with Reis - who is described by his professional LinkedIn account as the club's U16 strength and conditioning coach - quick to call the 30-year-old in jubilation.",
      "Speaking about the call, Fernandes told Sport TV: \"Much happiness and gratitude for everything I lived in Sporting.",
      "\"It is a club for which I have enormous affection, a huge passion. I was as happy or happier than all those who were celebrating. Unfortunately, I could not be there, but I will still celebrate many titles in Marquês.",
      "\"I would have liked to have been there to congratulate the players, coaches and staff. I was able to do it with those who are here [Ruben Amorim and company] and who were part of this, congratulate them.",
      "\"Sporting is undergoing a major change. It's also been achieved through Ruben Amorim, Hugo Viana, Frederico Varandas... they've managed to change the dynamics of the club to become competitive again and win.",
      "\"I'm happy about that. I got a call from João Reis which brought tears to my eyes. It's a club that I'll always have enormous affection for and that will always have a place in my heart.\"",
      "After spending his early professional years with Novara, Udinese, and Sampdoria, Fernandes signed for Sporting CP in 2017. With 63 goals and 50 assists across 137 games, Fernandes lifted a Taca de Portugal with the side, as well as two Taca da Ligas - with the Primeira Liga that the club achieved this year coming as one of the very few titles that evaded him during his own three-year stint.",
      "Another United figure who will undoubtedly be celebrating Sporting's recent success is manager Ruben Amorim, who left the Portuguese outfit in November to join the Red Devils. While Amorim and Fernandes never crossed paths together in their homeland's capital, the two have forged a formidable partnership at Old Trafford, despite a lacklustre string of results for United in the Premier League this season.",
      "The Red Devils currently sit 16th in the league with just one game remaining to play, with Amorim having managed just seven victories since succeeding Erik ten Hag. However, the side's fortunes could change on Wednesday night when they face a Spurs side - who are also struggling domestically - in the final of the Europa League.",
      "After finishing third under the new league format, United handed Real Sociedad a 4-1 loss in the round of 16, before omitting Lyon with a scoreline of 7-6 on aggregate in the quarter-finals. The Red Devils secured a 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Club in the semi-finals to stamp their spot at San Mamés in Bilbao.",
      "Spurs, meanwhile, achieved 3-2 and 2-1 aggregate wins over AZ Alkmaar and Frankfurt respectively in the earlier knockout stages, before relishing in a 5-1 win over Bodo/Glimt in the semis to make it to the final. Both sides will be eager to make up for disastrous Premier League seasons - with Spurs sitting just one point behind United in the Premier League in 17th place - in what promises to be an action packed evening of football.",

The two under-pressure managers lead Manchester United and Tottenham in the high stakes match in Bilbao on Wednesday evening knowing the game will define their seasons.",
      "Both teams have endured a miserable season in the Premier League, with United 16th and Spurs 17th, making victory in the Basque Country vital. As well as giving their fans something to cheer, a win would automatically guarantee a place in the 2025/26 Champions League – a significant factor financially and in terms of attracting new players this summer.",
      "Spurs have not lifted a trophy since the League Cup in 2008, while Amorim knows victory would significantly alter the perception of his debut campaign, having failed to make an impact since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "It is an intriguing backdrop to the match at the San Mames Stadium, but former Tottenham midfielder Steffen Freund thinks the result may be a moot point. The German believes that, realistically, the decisions of those in power won’t be swayed by 90 minutes.",
      "“So I think maybe both coaches will go after the game. I don’t like that, but think about Man United: most of the coaches have been sacked – [Louis] van Gaal after an FA Cup win, [Erik] ten Hag after an FA Cup win – so that’s how it is in the football business. And as a coach, I would love to see both coaches keep going.”",
      "There have been widespread reports that Postecoglou could be sacked by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, regardless of whether he comes good on his promise to win silverware in his second season. The Australian was combative in his pre-match press conference, pushing back against a journalist who suggested that he would be perceived as a “clown” if he loses.",
      "He has tried to play down the importance of the occasion, but Spurs veteran Son Heung-min knows what victory would mean. “It’s going to be a huge, huge moment for both of us and also for the boys if we win it,” the Spurs skipper said.",
      "“As we always say, the first step is going to be really hard, but if you win that trophy, we can change the mentality, we can change the history and hopefully we can continue to compete for another trophy.”"

      "None of the United subs are warming up at half-time. I don’t think anybody expected United to make a change at the interval but if things don’t change ten minutes in then they are going to have to inject some energy and urgency into the XI. The situation is still perfectly salvageable for United and they have scored in every Europa League match this season.",
      "I’m blaming Dorgu for that more than Shaw. Shaw is marking the man he can see, which is Solanke. He tells Dorgu to get tight to Johnson, Dorgu does that but doesn’t follow his run or get his body in the way. Maybe Shaw is a little slow to react, but he probably expects the defender behind him to help out a bit more."

      "\"If you look at the team, Casemiro is used to playing these types of games, Bruno is always there, Harry Maguire has played in European games for his national team and knows the pressure.",
      "\"The final is a different context, a different game. The beginning of the game is really important - to feel the game - and I think we're getting better on that.\"",
      "When asked about the importance of winning the Europa League, Amorim responded: \"It's not going to change so much [in relation to transfers]. It can be a little help to add more if we need, but it's not going to change so much. I think the most important thing is the feeling of winning.",
      "\"It's going to help everybody. If you look at Carrington with all the changes, we had staff with us who are no longer there, we need to deliver that feeling in order to give something to everybody.",
      "\"I'm not thinking about the money. I'm not worried about the money because we're a big brand, but it's the feeling. We need that feeling, we need to have a connection with people and without trophies, it's really hard to get that connection.\""

      "But then it's also the case that the two sets of fans do things differently. While Spurs fans were gathering in numbers, smaller groups of Mancunians were seated around tables in different bars across this wonderful city.",

There were groups of five or six, bucket hats on, still singing 'For United are going to Bilbao' while knocking back pints in temperatures that will feel familiar after the spring that Manchester has enjoyed.",
      "There was no mass gathering, though - at least not yet. There might have been more substantial sing-alongs on Tuesday night, and the atmosphere will be cranked up a notch on the day of the final.",
      "There is room for 20,000 fans at United's fanzone in Etxebarria Parkea, with a musical line-up that could sell out Heaton Park, but for many of United's regular European away-dayers, such substantial shows of force and numbers are to be avoided. It's also true that Etxebarria Parkea is at the top of a hill in Bilbao, and as beautiful as the views are, the walk to get there isn't all that much fun.",
      "A group of United fans were scouting it out on Tuesday, climbing the steps to see the ring of steel around it. The big screen is up, and the bars and toilets are ready to go. \"It's f**king miles away,\" didn't suggest they would be going back on game day.",
      "The journey to Bilbao - and the wider Basque Country - has also been challenging. John and John, father and son United fans, were reunited in the city on Tuesday. Dad flew in from Manchester via Amsterdam, but his son was here via Hong Kong.",

      "They weren't the only father and son. Jonathan Law, from Worsley, stopped for a chat with his son Leo, and they will be hoping Leo's teachers aren't MEN readers after he admitted his son was skipping school to get a different kind of education this week.",

      "\"I've been in Spain in my motor home for a month, I'm sailing back from Santander to Plymouth on Thursday. I booked the crossing six months ago, not realising United were going to get to the final,\" he said.",
      "\"When we booked it, I never booked it with this in mind, but as they progressed through the rounds, I realised there was a possibility they were going to get to the final. Bilbao in the semi-final was the big one to get over.\"",
      "He is also one of the many United fans who have made the journey without a ticket, but he did the same in Stockholm for the Europa League final against Ajax in 2017 and plans to try the same approach to getting inside San Mames.",
      "\"I don't have a ticket, but everyone says leave it as long as possible, that's what I did in Stockholm,\" he said. \"I left it until five minutes before kick-off and got two tickets for face value, so the longer you hold the nerve, the better you have of getting good value.\"",
      "Although United fans seemed outnumbered on Tuesday, that might not be the case on matchday. Thousands are staying around the Basque Country after refusing to pay the price of accommodation in Bilbao.",
      "The MEN are holed up in San Sebastian, and a few groups of United fans were in the city on Monday night. More arrived on Tuesday, and others are on the other side of Bilbao in Santander.",
      "Andrew Houten and his dad flew from Manchester to Nantes in the west of France on Monday. They then took the train further south to Bordeaux before getting a coach to Bilbao. They are staying in Zaramillo, a small village about 20 minutes outside of Bilbao.",
      "Richard, a United fan from Blackpool, found another way to beat the exorbitant flight prices. Just come earlier.",
      "\"I went via Berlin,\" he said. “The flights were difficult, and I'm going back via Mallorca. I saw quite a few United fans on the route out, and it's a Sunday night to Friday trip. I had to square it with the wife, although I made sure I booked it first!",
      "\"The atmosphere has been fairly tame so far, but we found a couple of bars on Monday that were quite lively. There was a good mix of United and Spurs. It's been very friendly so far.",
      "\"I can't say I'm feeling confident, I think it's going to finish about 1 in the morning.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's side stormed into the final with a dominant 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Bilbao. Victory tonight would make it three trophies in three years for the Red Devils, following last year's FA Cup success and the League Cup win in 2023.",
      "By contrast, tonight could deepen the crisis at Tottenham, where boss Ange Postecoglou is reportedly on thin ice. There is speculation that even a Europa League triumph may not secure his future at the club.",
      "Spurs booked their place in the final with a 3-1 semi-final win against Bodo/Glimt. Although they, too, have had a troubled domestic season - currently 17th in the Premier League - this final offers them a rare chance to end a 17-year trophy drought dating back to their 2008 League Cup win.",
      "For United fans making the trip, tonight is about more than just football. It's a potential turning point after a year of setbacks - and they'll want to avoid any missteps off the pitch, especially those that could get them ejected for something as simple as a vape."

      "Manchester United have a chance to secure a place in the Champions League on Wednesday night, despite sitting in 16th place in the Premier League.",
      "United take on Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao (8pm kick-off). The winners will not only lift European silverware but will also be awarded a place in the Champions League next season, meaning victory in Bilbao comes with a lucrative prize attached to it as well.",
      "Like United, Spurs have had a disappointing domestic season. Ange Postecoglou’s side sit in 17th place in the table, one place and one point below United.",
      "The Champions League would be a huge boost to either team both financially and in attracting players in the upcoming transfer window. But United could potentially have a problem should they qualify.",
      "French outfit Nice, also currently owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos, secured their spot in the competition through a fourth place finish in Ligue 1. But UEFA rules could potentially see one or both teams prevented from playing in the competition.",
      "Here’s a roundup of the latest ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "UEFA rules state that no two clubs under the same control could compete in any two European competitions together. They have however since been updated so that the rules only apply to teams in the same tournament.",
      "Given Nice’s qualification for the Champions League, that could present a problem for United should they beat Tottenham.",
      "In a statement, UEFA have said that: \"No one is simultaneously involved, directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition; and no one has control or decisive influence over more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition.\"",
      "Therefore there needs to be proof that the two clubs are not run simultaneously.",
      "Due to the increasing nature of multi-club ownership models, UEFA now handle the situation on a case-by-case basis.",
      "An example is Manchester City and Girona, who are both owned by the City Group, were allowed to both compete in the Champions League this season. United and Nice were also both allowed to compete in the Europa League in the current season.",
      "This was made possible after shares after investors transferred their shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice to independent trustees through a blind trust structure. This meant effective control and decision-making at these clubs were solely under control of the trustee.",
      "This agreement is due to end on July 1 this year, however, meaning another solution may need to be found. As reported by MEN Sport, United are confident that they will be allowed to compete in the Champions League despite Nice’s qualification for the competition.",
      "Ratcliffe has been talking to UEFA since taking over at United and has been encouraged by the discussions.",
      "Following its decision in 2024 to allow Man City and Girona FC, as well as Manchester United and OGC Nice to compete in European competition, UEFA released a statement which read: \"The First Chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body (CFCB First Chamber) had previously opened proceedings involving: Girona FC (ESP) and Manchester City FC (ENG); and Manchester United FC (ENG) and OGC Nice (FRA) due to a potential conflict with the multi-club ownership rule provided for in Article 5 of the UEFA club competitions regulations.",
      "\"Following the implementation of significant changes by the concerned investors in Girona FC and OGC Nice (respectively City Football Group and INEOS), the CFCB First Chamber accepted the admission of Girona FC and Manchester City FC to the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League as well as Manchester United FC and OGC Nice to the 2024/25 UEFA Europa League. The clubs were able to demonstrate that such changes brought them into compliance with the multi-club ownership rule, considering that:",
      "\"More specifically, the significant changes made to the ownership, governance, and financial support of the concerned clubs, substantially restrict the investors’ influence and decision-making power over more than one club, ensuring compliance with the multi-club ownership rule during the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"In particular, the concerned investors have transferred their shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice to independent trustees through a blind trust structure established under the supervision of the CFCB First Chamber. Such blind trust was accepted by the CFCB First Chamber on an exceptional basis for the 2024/25 UEFA competitions. The trustees will regularly exchange information with the CFCB First Chamber during the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"As a result, the following applies at the level of Girona FC and OGC Nice for the 2024/25 season:",
      "\"Furthermore, as additional evidence of their independence, the concerned clubs committed to the following:",
      "\"From 1 July 2025, the shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice will be transferred back to their respective investor. As a result, in the absence of any major modifications to the clubs’ shareholding, governance or financing, the above-mentioned clubs shall be considered, as from that date, under the control or decisive influence of their investor.",
      "\"The CFCB First Chamber will continue to monitor the above-mentioned situations to ensure that the multi-club ownership rule continues to be complied with during the 2024/25 season.\"",
      "Speaking on the situation, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has given a clear answer. \"No, there are no circumstances upon which an ownership of Nice would prevent Manchester United from playing in the Champions League. I’ll be crystal clear on that,\" he said.",
      "\"It says you have to change the ownership structure, you know. So it’s all about influence and positions on the board and that sort of thing. A: the rules are changing, and B: there are shades of grey not black and white. Manchester City will probably have the problem before we have the problem because they’ve obviously got Girona.",
      "\"We have spoken to UEFA and I have to say the conversation wasn’t directed at, 'you have to solve this problem and you know we don’t like it'. We have an issue and we might have to change some things. But what they do recognise is that the multi-club model in many circumstances benefits the smaller club quite a lot.",
      "\"They do have a concern that if they stop the multi-club model then you take away quite a lot from the smaller club. Because the smaller club benefits a lot from the bigger club. So that’s a good thing. But what they’re worried about is if there’s ever an accusation that somebody influences the result of a game - lack of integrity. That’s the most concerning thing.",
      "\"We’ve never spent time really understanding the benefits of a multi-club. But we’ve got Omar obviously, who’s been intimately involved in a really successful multi-club, which is Manchester City. So we need to spend a bit of time with Omar trying to understand it a bit better before we finish up with a view.",
      "\"I think my inclination is positive towards multi-clubs, not negative towards multi-clubs. We haven’t spent enough time understanding all the details of it yet. Also, the UEFA thing is changing so you have to do it in the light of where you think UEFA is going to finish up, what the handicaps are. There are obviously handicaps involved.\"",

      "Manchester United have the chance to save their season this evening when they take on Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "After an awful Premier League campaign that sees United enter the final weekend of the season in 16th place, Ruben Amorim's side have the chance to win a trophy and guarantee a spot in the Champions League with a win against Spurs tonight.",
      "A 7-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals saw Amorim's side book their spot in the final, while Spurs beat Bodo/Glimt to make it an all-English final. United have failed to beat Spurs in their last six meetings, with Ange Postecoglou's side winning 1-0 and 3-0 in the Premier League this season while also beating United 4-3 in the Carabao Cup.",
      "So, could United win the Europa League in Bilbao tonight? Let's take a look...",
      "To complete this simulation, we used EA FC 25 and updated the squads with the latest injuries and suspensions.",
      "We predict that Spurs could line up in a 4-4-2 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Vicario; Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie; Johnson, Bentancur, Bissouma, Son; Solanke, Richarlison.",
      "We predict that United could line up in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Onana; Yoro, Maguire, Shaw; Mazraoui, Ugarte, Casemiro, Dorgu; Amad, Fernandes; Hojlund.",
      "Just three minutes in, United were handed the worst start possible in Bilbao, with Rodrigo Bentancur rising highest at the front post to flick a corner past Andre Onana and put Spurs a goal ahead early on. The early strike seemed to hand the Lilywhites a big confidence boost, and 28 minutes in they grabbed themselves a second, with United yet to get going.",
      "A long ball forward from Micky van de Ven picked out Richarlison on the left, and after cutting inside, the Brazilian threaded a wonderful pass through the United defence for Brennan Johnson to chase. The winger pulled away from Luke Shaw to meet the ball, and a devastating finish on his right foot saw the winger drill his shot into the top corner to make it 2-0.",
      "Amorim's side should've pulled a goal back before the break when an error at the back saw Cristian Romero gift possession to Rasmus Hojlund, but one-on-one, the striker showed no conviction as he fired his shot straight at Guglielmo Vicario. Spurs dominated the first 20 minutes of the second half as they looked to put the game out of sight, but one big chance at the other end allowed Amorim's side to find a way back into the game.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount earned United a corner when he tried his luck with a shot from distance, but great reflexes from the 'keeper saw his shot parried over the crossbar and behind. Harry Maguire forced Vicario into another save from the resulting set-piece with a header from deep in the box, but Shaw was the quickest to react as he prodded home the rebound to halve the deficit.",
      "As the game went on, United started to become more desperate in attack, and Amorim's side had another glorious chance to draw level in the 88th minute when Amad broke through the Spurs defence and into the box, but Vicario made another incredible save to deny the forward.",
      "The Spurs goalkeeper had the game of his life, and he was the difference as United fell to defeat in the Europa League final."

      "Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou are set to lock horns in a bid for silverware after challenging seasons, with the additional prize of a Champions League spot next term also at stake. Both teams have set foot in Spain in anticipation of Wednesday night's clash.",
      "Yet, when United step onto the San Mames pitch, their players will be wearing black shorts in lieu of the usual white, paired with their iconic red shirts and black socks.",
      "This change has been necessitated by Spurs' longstanding European tradition. The club from North London has donned an all-white getup in Europe since 1961, a custom established by then-manager Bill Nicholson.",
      "As the 'home' team for the finale, Tottenham's kit preference holds sway over that of United's. Spurs' choice to wear all-white dates back over 60 years, initiated by Nicholson to aid player visibility in poorly lit stadiums, reports the Mirror.",
      "The tradition commenced during an away match against Polish team Gornik. \"We just turned up in the dressing room for the game and there was the all-white kit,\" recollected former Spurs winger Cliff Jones.",
      "\"No-one said anything; nothing was said to us. We just focused on the game coming up.\"",
      "Ricky George, who was an apprentice at the time, reflected: \"The all-white kit was for visibility. It was Bill Nick's way of looking for those marginal gains. Those nights at White Hart Lane, under the lights, were just very special.",
      "\"We loved playing in all-white,\" Jones commented. \"I honestly cannot say for certain it made any difference in making us see each other better under the floodlights, but we did love playing in it. European nights we felt fresher, the air was different.\"",
      "United's choice to tweak their kit isn't unprecedented this season; they donned black shorts for their away fixture against Real Sociedad in March, a match that concluded with a 1-1 draw following strikes from Joshua Zirkzee and Mikel Oyarzabal.",
      "Yet, they reverted to their classic white shorts for the return leg at Old Trafford, where the Red Devils triumphed 4-1, buoyed by a Bruno Fernandes hat-trick. Regardless of their attire, United are eager to claim victory in the final and secure their spot in next season's Champions League."

      "Manchester United have got “a real baller” on their hands in Joshua Zirkzee, who’s been tipped to become a “superstar” under Ruben Amorim by a former Red Devil despite being ‘up for sale’.",
      "Zirkzee joined United from Bologna for £36.5m last summer and has managed just seven goals and three assists in a debut season which featured him being jeered off by his own fans during a defeat to Newcastle in December.",
      "His performances before suffering injury in mid-April were more positive though, certainly better than those of fellow striker Rasmus Hojlund, and Lee Sharpe reckons with a consistent run in the side the “real baller” can become a “superstar” at Old Trafford.",
      "“I like Zirkzee – he was unfortunate to get injured when he did, but he’s a real baller and I think he can be a superstar for Manchester United if he can get games under his belt,” Sharpe told Metro via Coin Poker.",
      "“He needs a regular run. I don’t think he’s had a 10-game stint where he has actually played week in, week out.",
      "“There were reports that he wasn’t quite fit when he signed, so it took him a bit of time to get up to speed. I think he was just finding his feet when he got injured but I think he’s going to prove a real key player next season.”",
      "Zirkzee made a shock return to training this week but the Europa League final clash with Spurs may have come too early for the Dutchman.",
      "Football Insider claim United have put both Zirkzee and Hojlund are ‘up for sale’ ahead of the summer transfer window in order ‘to make way for top striker target Liam Delap’.",
      "The report states that the Ipswich striker is ‘set to arrive at Old Trafford in a £30million deal with United in pole position to secure his signature ahead of Chelsea and Everton’.",
      "It is understood that at least one of Zirkzee or Hojlund will need to be sold ‘to free up space in the squad and raise funds for further summer business’.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s arrival at Old Trafford in a £62.5m transfer from Wolves looks to have been sewn up and Sharpe believes both he and Delap will be good additions to Amorim’s squad.",
      "“I think both players look like good acquisitions,” Sharpe added.",
      "“I’ve seen Delap a few times this season and he’s a good, big strong typical number nine. He holds the balls up well, which is what you need in any team but he also knows where the goal is and puts defenders under pressure.",
      "“He’s still young enough to improve and for the position United are in – not quite challenging for the league but looking towards that top six – and I think he would be an ideal signing.",
      "“Cunha speaks for himself. In a team like Wolves, which have struggled at points this season, he’s been the standout player.",
      "“He’s a little bit like Kobbie Mainoo in that he can beat players, create a chance and score a goal. I’d like him to calm his temperament down at times – you don’t want him getting sent off and costing his team games just because he’s losing his rag – but ability-wise I think he’s really good and a great addition to the squad.”",
      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a shock boost ahead of their Europa League final with Spurs, as some key players were pictured in training on Tuesday.",

      "",
      "Moises Caicedo to Chelsea (£115m – August 2023)\nEnzo Maresca’s suggestion that Caicedo is the “best defensive midfielder in the world” after a 1-0 win against *checks notes* Tottenham Hotspur was a bit of a stretch, but the 23-year-old has fared much better post-£100m transfer than most of his counterparts.",
      "The former Liverpool target’s second season at Stamford Bridge has been far stronger than his first and he’s one of the few huge Todd Boehly-era signings to pay off. He’s not quite justified the £100m player tag yet, but he’s getting there. He is Chelsea’s player of a poor season.",
      "",
      "Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea (£106m – January 2023)\nThis has comfortably been Fernandez’s best season to date at Chelsea, but that is not saying much. Like Caicedo, he needs to produce the goods more consistently if he’s to be considered an elite midfielder instead of one who’s purely very good on his day.",
      "Fernandez has found himself at the centre of transfer speculation concerning a deal that won’t come to fruition, with it incredibly difficult to see what he would add to what is already a well-stocked Real Madrid midfield.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish to Manchester City (£100m – August 2021)\nWe love Grealish, and you should too. He’s clearly a brilliant bloke and a gifted footballer, but even we have to admit that his time at Man City is coming to an end.",
      "Grealish’s immense form heavily contributed to Man City’s historic Treble season in 2022/23, but he’s not come close to matching this overwhelming peak in prior or subsequent campaigns.",
      "Pep Guardiola’s new favourite toy – Omar Marmoush – is the third attack-minded signing to outshine the England international after Jeremy Doku and Savinho and he desperately needs a new home to rediscover the magical performances he produced in his second season and for Aston Villa.",

      "",
      "Paul Pogba to Manchester United (£89m – August 2016)\nEven with Man Utd’s woeful downfall this season, you are hard-pressed to find a former Red Devils player-cum-pundit desperate enough to call for Pogba to be given a “third chance” at Old Trafford, with Dwight Yorke one exception.",
      "Pogba is arguably the most talented footballer on this list, so the massive investment of £89m to re-sign him from Juventus could have been justified at the time. But the story of his second stint at Man Utd – marred by manager fallouts and a stinking attitude – should give him no hope of another chance, even with Sir Jim Ratcliffe supposedly ‘betting on’ free agents this summer.",
      "",
      "Angel Di Maria to Manchester United (£59.7m – August 2014)\nAnother contender for being Man Utd’s worst signing post-Sir Alex Ferguson, Di Maria is a fine example of an individual who proves the club has become a “graveyard for coaches and players”.",
      "Di Maria joined Man Utd riding the crest of a wave after shining in the previous season’s Champions League final, but he flopped at Old Trafford and could not leave quickly enough, joining PSG after a single season in the Premier League.",
      "His success after exiting Man Utd suggests the club were the problem, not him, as there are only two Old Trafford departees post-Ferguson who have done better.",
      "",
      "Fernando Torres to Chelsea (£50m – January 2011)\n“This was the no-brainer. This was the banker, this was the one that couldn’t fail, this was the one that’s never failed.” Well, it did…",
      "Chelsea appeared to pull off a major coup when they snatched Liverpool’s goal machine from their arch-rivals, but it turned out his legs had gone as he only scored 20 goals in 110 Premier League games for the Blues. He at least has that Champions League semi-final goal to lean on, though.",

      "Ex-Man Utd striker Dwight Yorke has called for his former club to sign Nunez, who apparently has “got all of the ingredients to be even better”.",

      "“He’s not quite lived up to expectations and sometimes a new start might be a good thing for a player, rather than being there and just being another number and getting game time occasionally.",
      "“What I see is an individual wanting a platform to become the top man at the football club. He’s not going to get that with Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk and the other players who they have there.",
      "“I think for me personally, if I was United, I know the Liverpool and the Man United thing is a bit of a rift there, but I look beyond that.",
      "“I look at the young man who has a good presence, who has a little bit of zest in him, who’s got all the ingredients to be even better than what he’s actually producing at the minute.",
      "“He’s still at a good age. He’s now been in England for the last three years or so. He understands English culture.",
      "“What he’s expecting I think is a new beginning. If I were looking at him from the outside, that is somebody I would take upon to bring aggression. You’d be the top man or one of the top men at Man United.",
      "“If he wants to go there, you give me something. And I think he will score more goals at Man United than at Liverpool.”",
      "Yorke has also named Aston Villa star Emiliano Martinez, who has reportedly been ‘offered’ the chance to replace Andre Onana.",
      "“It’s kind of a no-brainer,” Yorke said on Man Utd signing Martinez.",
      "“Emi Martinez has been really exceptional for a number of years and again you could see why huge clubs would want him.",
      "“I mean Man United, I know they’re struggling, but even now you’d have to consider it because they’re such a huge club.",
      "“He wouldn’t just be bringing experience, but he’s a far better goalkeeper than Andre Onana, just going by the numbers.",
      "“I think for Onana, it hasn’t quite worked out, and everyone anticipated that he would have done well. But definitely, signing Martinez would be a huge coup for United.”",
      "Liverpool are stepping up their interest in RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko with Darwin Nunez expected to leave this summer, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez is ready to leave Anfield this summer with a transfer to Atletico Madrid edging closer, according to reports.",
      "Emiliano Martinez has established himself as one of the world’s best. The bravado that made him so might not work at Man Utd if he replaces Andre Onana…",
      "Including Man Utd flop Rasmus Hojlund, here is the worst player at each Premier League club this season, according to WhoScored.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly made an offer for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez after Unai Emery offered no assurances over his future at the club.",
      "A weekend of emotional farewells had us say goodbye to Goodison Park, Jamie Vardy, Emiliano Martinez, the old Arsenal and very possibly West Ham soon."

      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",

      "This is required with Man Utd’s current squad not fully suited to Ruben Amorim‘s preferred 3-4-3 formation, while most of their players have not done enough to justify sticking around beyond this summer.",
      "Results in the Premier League have been abysmal this season as they could finish 17th, but they could still salvage something from this campaign as they face Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",

      "It has been widely reported that United’s priority is to strengthen in forward positions this summer, with Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap among their preferred targets.",
      "Now, a report from The Times claims Man Utd ‘will have £100m to spend even if Spurs win the final’, though club chiefs believe this budget could reach £200m via selling Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "The report deems this viewpoint a ‘tad optimisic’, with Chelsea and Aston Villa not guaranteed to sign Sancho and Rashford permanently. Regarding Sancho, it’s noted that Chelsea ‘could prefer to pay a £5million penalty’ instead of investing £25m to make his deal permanent.",
      "Cunha is said to be Man Utd’s ‘primary’ target, with Man Utd ‘confident that Amorim can tame his temper’.",
      "Delap is another named target, while United are planning three more signings.",
      "‘The striker Liam Delap, who is available for £30million after Ipswich Town’s relegation, is a target while the wingback positions need strengthening and Bayindir is likely to be sold to make way for another goalkeeper to rival Onana for the No1 jersey.’",
      "It is also revealed that Man Utd’s summer transfer window ‘will be led by the technical director Jason Wilcox’, with INEOS ‘happy with his work so there are no plans to recruit a director of football’.",
      "Man Utd could also raise funds by sanctioning pure profit exits for Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, but they ‘will only leave if a club makes a substantial bid for either’. While the latter is ‘most likely to depart’, the Red Devils ‘would like to keep both players’.",
      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",

      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss was initially keen to wait until this summer to make the move, but he decided to join early after being given an ultimatum by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and United‘s board.",
      "The 40-year-old has struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation as Man Utd’s current squad is not suited to this set-up and performances in the Premier League have been shambolic.",

      "READ: Man Utd losing Europa League will lead to ‘relegation and even bankruptcy’",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd’s best performances have come in the Europa League as they have reached the final.",
      "The Red Devils face Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Wednesday night and this is a massive game, with a trophy, Champions League football and much-needed prize money at stake.",
      "A loss would be disastrous for either side, but a report from The Times claims ‘the noises coming out of United are that Amorim will be in charge next season, regardless of the result of the Europa League final against Tottenham’.",
      "This is partly to do with Amorim’s strong relationship with Ratcliffe, as the co-owner ‘would try to talk him out of walking’ if it came to it ‘because he rates him so highly’.",
      "The report has also lifted the lid on Amorim’s relationship with Ratcliffe, who ‘speak every week by phone’.",
      "It is also noted that they ‘occasionally communicate in a WhatsApp group that contains other senior figures’, with ‘Amorim sharing his thoughts on games in a mini-match report and data is fed into the group too’.",
      "One such message was about Casemiro, who Amorim praised for ‘running 10.5km in the first leg of the semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao, more than any other player’.",
      "Amorim’s ‘man-mangement skills’ are ‘admired’ by United’s hierarchy, with Casemiro going from being an outcast to being ‘close’ to the head coach.",
      "The report also reveals Man Utd’s ‘main reason’ for standing by Amorim. They explain:",
      "‘The main reason why Ineos have so far refused to pull the trigger on Amorim’s reign is because they truly believe that with a full pre-season under their belts, and a revamp of the squad, he will have the tools he needs to start making United successful again.\nManchester United player in team uniform.",
      "‘There is an acceptance that he has had to spend much of the season placing square pegs in round holes. Noussair Mazraoui, for example, spent most of his career playing as an orthodox right back, but there is a chance the Moroccan will be asked to continue at wingback against Spurs, although Diogo Dalot — along with Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee — returned to training on the eve of the final.’",
      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a shock boost ahead of their Europa League final with Spurs, as some key players were pictured in training on Tuesday.",
      "One Man Utd player is getting frustrated that INEOS and Ruben Amorim are not playing him in order to get him to leave the club, according to reports.",
      "A report reveals how Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim was ‘talked out’ of handing in his resignation after a 3-1 home defeat to Brighton in January.",
      "Neville insists it’s too early to judge Amorim and Ratcliffe at Man Utd and picked the ‘six players minimum’ required in a Red Devils rebuild this summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has done nothing to suggest he can turn Man Utd around, while there is some laughter and anger about Man City."

      "Were Mediawatch in a snarkier mood it might note that the only ‘box-ticking’ going on here is the Mail crowbarring ‘wokery’ into a headline for the eight millionth time, while for the eight millionth time failing to define what ‘wokery’ actually is.",
      "The true nonsense here is that McEvoy’s article is broadly fine, hoping that Gary Lineker’s departure doesn’t signal an unnecessary and damaging broader shift in Match of the Day’s overall style and focus.",
      "And unlike other Daily Mail fears, this one is not entirely unfounded. There has been talk from BBC suits of the need for the show to feature ‘more chat’ and Mediawatch finds itself in broad agreement with McEvoy’s central thrust that this would be a bad idea, that people want to watch the highlights and a bit of analysis and not just the analysis. But also not just the action. There are plenty of other options for those who want those things. As McEvoy puts it, Match of the Day should be…",
      "… the amalgam of both, the action dominating with the reassuring-as-old-slippers insight of the pundits as an accompaniment. This diet is distinct from both the protracted analysis of Sky’s ‘main event’ and the unvarnished 10-second video clip trotting across personal smartphones.",
      "But after several hundred words of reasonableness, McEvoy makes his fatal error – or Machiavellian click-generating move, choose your fighter – that presumably made a sub-editor punch the air in delight.",
      "Nobody, even among the small ‘c’ conservative Saturday night audience, is opposed to innovation and judicious tinkering. But the great hope is that change for its own sake, such as box ticking and wokery, or indeed a bellyful of laddishness, is left at the studio door.",
      "Please, can someone explain to us what on earth ‘wokery’ even means in this context?",
      "And also how, precisely, the end of Gary Lineker – a bog-standard centrist dad routinely portrayed by the right-wing press as profoundly dangerous Britain-hating commie firebrand – means the Mail fear there will be suddenly be more of it?"

But, of course, the fine we will accept. If you give a red card for this, you have to ban a lot of coaches during the games because in an emotional situation of the game it will happen that you make a step on the pitch. Of course we are role models and we have to act like this. But I think sometimes you also should bring out your emotions. In this case it was to protect Joao Pedro because it was a hard tackle on him. If I don’t show emotions there, me as a player, I would say, ‘the coach isn’t interested in me’, so that’s why I try to show emotions in some part of the games,” he said.",

When it continues like this, you see it every weekend the blocking goalkeeper – if the Premier League doesn’t find a clear rule it will end in a different sport. In a normal game when a player is blocked when the ball is not near from him, it’s always a foul, so I don’t understand why it’s not a foul, they have to find an answer. It can be part of the game, but it should be a clear rule as to what is allowed and what isn’t. When it happens during the game you always get a foul in the midfield if you’re blocked, so why not blocked on a set-piece?” he said.",

And although we don’t come into games trying to get players sent off, why he hasn’t sent off Calafiori is a little bit beyond belief.

I said to Ibou Konate, ‘This is a f**king joke.’ The fourth official thought I said to him: ‘You are a f**king joke.’ That’s definitely not what I said.

There is an ongoing process and I will respect that. Many things happened in extra time that led to me being quite emotional. There was a VAR review for two minutes and I thought, maybe the only thing that could happen is he looks back at the foul, or maybe it’s offside. Of course then, after 10 minutes you hear there fans cheering and you [realise] it’s not offside. It is an emotional sport and sometimes individuals with emotions make the wrong decisions.

      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Liam Delap (Ipswich Town)\nEvery Premier League club – except Arsenal – is chasing Liam Delap, hopefully resulting in an exciting transfer saga that ends at the right time instead of dragging on and on and on.",
      "Despite attracting interest from several competent football clubs, it’s reportedly Manchester United (or Chelsea… or United again) leading the race. Delap is open to the move, which should be enough of a red flag for everyone else to back off and let United crack on.",
      "Twelve goals in 36 matches in a debut Premier League season is a very solid return for the 22-year-old. Not long ago it was 12 in 30, which looked even better and explains the hype.",
      "Ipswich’s relegation and his loss of form won’t stop the vultures circling, and £30million still feels like a bargain. Especially for a striker who is, by all accounts, a slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "8) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that. As could Florian Wirtz, Alejandro Grimaldo, Jonathan Tah, Piero Hincapie and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. Chelsea seem very keen – him and Delap fit their ‘project signing’ blueprint. This is why Arsenal prefer Gyokeres, who is more of a ready-made title winner.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Liverpool, though Man United and Arsenal are obviously in the picture.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea now seem to prefer Sesko and Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but that would open him up to ridicule after calling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s agent a “dumb f**k” for saying he was moving there.",
      "Clubs seem to be oblivious to Osimhen’s availability but it’s guaranteed that the Nigerian will leave Napoli this summer after spending the season on loan at Galatasaray. His bridges in Naples have been burned to the ground.",

      "Of the many areas Manchester United need to strengthen this summer, goalkeeper is the position they will most resent having to address.",
      "Andre Onana should have been United’s No. 1 for a decade; that was the plan when the Red Devils spent £43.7million on the Cameroonian in 2023 to replace David De Gea and, to be fair to the recruitment ‘brains trust’ at Old Trafford at the time, there was very little dissent over their pick.",
      "Onana was viewed as a safe set of hands with two feet that would help United play the Ten Hag way, a concept that remains a mystery. The ex-Ajax keeper had just helped Inter Milan get to the Champions League final and the decision to give him De Gea’s gloves was overwhelmingly well-received by everyone bar De Gea.",
      "The recent revisionism around De Gea highlights how far short Onana has come to matching those early expectations. Despite the Spaniard’s success at Fiorentina – after a season’s sabbatical – the decision to replace De Gea was absolutely correct. Their choice of replacement – in glorious hindsight – was not.",
      "We’ll give him a pass on the fact he hasn’t improved United in possession. Sometimes, a goalkeeper building out from the back is only as good as the players he’s passing to. As we know, many of his team-mates just aren’t up to receiving the ball under pressure, from either high-pressing opponents or the millions scrutinising them across the globe.",
      "That doesn’t excuse some of Onana’s clumsiness, especially when playing longer. But his real failings are rooted in the more traditional expectation of an elite goalkeeper: be hard to beat. Save the shots you’re expected to save, and some that you’re not.",
      "His two seasons in the United goal have been riddled with mistakes. Not just basic handling errors, but some inexplicable decision-making and highly-questionable techniques. One example: his approach to one-on-ones – stay deep, sit down – can’t be one that any of the Carrington goalkeeping coaches and analysts endorse. And, assuming they have identified it, they haven’t corrected his habit of parrying into poor areas.",
      "The fact that United are in Bilbao right now, hoping to rescue a generationally-bad season with a trophy and a route into the Champions League via the back door, is in spite of Onana’s performances.",
      "As is the case with many of their failing players that need upgrading, getting Onana out of Old Trafford won’t be easy for United without almost giving him away. Really, they need to hope a sheikh in Saudi is blinded by his profile enough to ignore his flaws.",
      "With that comes another attempt at finding a goalkeeper capable, composed and confident enough to keep United’s goal.",
      "Recent days have seen the Red Devils linked with Emiliano Martinez. At first sight, it appears to be a solid match.",
      "Martinez, not long ago viewed by some as the best on the planet largely because of his role in making Argentina kings of the world, appears to possess the requisite confidence. Outwardly at least, he presents as a character big enough to handle the pressure of defending even United’s goal.",
      "But perhaps we shouldn’t be fooled by his bravado. It is entirely likely that Martinez is more sensitive and self-aware than Onana. The Argentina No.1 has spoken about how he has worked on portraying an image of infallibility; much of the arrogance is an act. Which is absolutely fine – goalkeepers do need to fake it if they aren’t feeling it. But we ought not to believe that Martinez is the outstanding candidate based purely on the character he plays.",
      "But you could argue that type of personality is not what United need at this stage of whatever trauma it is they are currently going through. An attention-seeking egomaniac impatient with others’ imperfections would not lead a happy existence behind Ruben’s reds right now.",
      "MORE ON THE EUROPA LEAGUE FINAL FROM F365\n👉 Tottenham vs Man Utd prediction, expected line-ups, how to watch and stats\n👉 Big Midweek: Europa League final, Heung-min Son, FA Cup winners Crystal Palace, Pep Guardiola\n👉 Man Utd fans fear defeat to ‘serial chokers and jokers’ if Hojlund starts",
      "The game doesn’t produce many goalkeepers with those traits anymore. Modern keepers tend to carry a calmer authority, more in the mould of Alisson than Schmeichel or Kahn.",
      "Plenty still skirt close to the edge, but the likes of Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale have worked hard to train their chimp rather than allow it to fling faeces while swinging from the goalposts.",
      "Martinez too has tweaked his mindset and persona on the way to becoming one of the Premier League’s best, channelling the frustration of being overlooked at Arsenal towards oozing the confidence that helped Argentina to a third star. It worked for him then. But that doesn’t mean it will work at Old Trafford.",
      "He doesn’t have to act the d*ck now. The chip on his shoulder from being binned by Arsenal ought to have been smoothed by a World Cup winner’s medal and various individual honours thrusted from his groin that vindicate him from whatever doubts plagued him. It’s a matter of opinion whether Martinez is the best in the Premier League/Europe/world, but he’s rightly in all those conversations. That should be enough to facilitate the evolution from manufactured arrogance to supreme and justified confidence.",
      "United need much more of the latter than the former. Of course, Villa will have plenty to say about Martinez’s next steps. Shipping to Saudi is a very different prospect to selling to a domestic rival, if United can still be labelled that. Without making it worth their while, there is certainly more in a move for United than Villa.",
      "Which leads us to believe it perhaps won’t happen, especially if United are turned over by Tottenham in the Battle of the Banter Clubs. Regardless of the outcome in Bilbao, persisting with Onana is not an option for a serious club if United are hoping to be viewed as one again in the near future. The Cameroonian must be replaced, by an experienced, proven stopper. And Martinez ticks most of their boxes.",
      "Manchester United have been told why they need to “look beyond their rift” with Liverpool and sign £64m flop Darwin Nunez this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "Man Utd’s Andre Onana features twice, but one Brighton player has a hat-trick of shame in this ranking of the worst performances in this season’s Premier League.",
      "It’s probably Matz Sels on the eye test, but the stats say that Ederson has been tested more than Alisson and come out well on top.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly made an offer for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez after Unai Emery offered no assurances over his future at the club.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been consistent in his message that not even winning the Europa League can save Manchester United’s season.",
      "Maybe he’s right. The fact they sit 16th in the league, with scope to slump further, remains a mind-melter when you actually stop and think about it. This is, after all, Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And unlike with Spurs, whose own league efforts are somehow even worse, there is not the same sense at United that a trophy – any trophy – makes everything worth it. United don’t need another season where the cracks of wretched league form are papered over with a trophy. They had one of those last season, and have spent this season paying for it.",
      "But what beating Tottenham in Bilbao might do for Man United is far more significant than the outcome of a single season. This, really, feels like where the divergence exists between these two finalists who sit next to each other so miserably back at home.",
      "Both can point to a vast discrepancy between their Premier League and Europa League form. Both have, correctly and inevitably, prioritised this competition at further cost to already ruined domestic campaigns.",
      "Both have made it abundantly clear where their priorities have been for months now.",
      "But with Spurs this feels like an opportunistic chance for catharsis, to cast off a banter albatross at long, long last and move on with their lives. On its own, the Europa League final perhaps means more for them, but as part of a wider plan it is United who face the bigger sliding doors moment in Bilbao.",
      "Win or lose, Spurs will reset and relaunch yet again under a new manager, who will be given some of the signings he needs yet by no means all. They will spend a year or two in transition, lose their nerve, and start the whole process again. It is the history of the Tottenham.",
      "United’s case is slightly different. They are in the early stages of one of their own frequent post-Fergie resets, one that involved bringing in a manager whose style of play is almost entirely at odds with the squad that’s been left at his disposal.",
      "While Ange Postecoglou will surely leave Spurs win or lose, Amorim surely stays. What alters with victory here is the potential speed and scope of the rebuild he badly needs this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s move to Old Trafford is welcome, and shows that even in their current reduced and sorry state United remain a draw for players with what are, on paper, better choices.",
      "But there is no doubt that the financial and footballing benefits of being able to offer Champions League football will make United’s other wooing missions this summer that bit easier.",
      "Bluntly, even as wretched as they are now, United in the gutter are still looking at the stars. Given the right tools and opportunity, Amorim remains a manager capable of restoring them to something like their rightful place in English football even after his unnecessarily chaotic and poorly-timed arrival.",
      "For Spurs, Wednesday night in Bilbao is a destination in itself. A release of emotion and frustration akin to that we’ve already seen this season for Newcastle and Crystal Palace.",
      "For United, though, it represents more of a stepping stone. They’ll enjoy the night if it goes their way, of course, but it won’t even be the first time they’ve won this trophy in the post-Fergie wilderness years.",
      "The flipside, of course, is that defeat comes with dread consequences and further erosion of an already significantly depleted aura.",
      "While victory represents a potentially transformative springboard for Amorim and the club, defeat will leave them as not only the Manchester United team that finished 16th – or maybe even worse – in the Premier League but also the one that handed a trophy to Tottenham.",
      "This one game comes to early in Amorim’s reign to definitively make or break him right now, but it still feels like when his United career comes to be judged, the result of this one game will be a pivotal moment in setting its overall course."

      "Nine Man Utd players who should leave this summer\nFollowing the season United have had, where it’s honestly been such a drag watching some games, it makes you think how United have somehow gone from 8th place last year in the league with Ten Hag at the helm (which was deemed as disastrous), to 16th in the league this year. It proves some players are just rubbish and there for the paycheck. There isn’t really an excuse for it to be finishing not only in the lower half of the table, but to be finishing below 15th place, is brutally shite.",
      "I have no idea how the team are somehow the only unbeaten side in Europe this season, but it looks like Amorim does have a few tricks up his sleeve in European competition, but has to improve drastically in the Premier League next season otherwise he will probably get sacked. Truth be told, I wish the whole board would just get sacked, with former United players and those who understand the standards of the club to take their place, but Ratcliffe and the Glazers are the ones in charge and it doesn’t look like that will change any time soon…",
      "If the owners actually had some sense of responsibility and courage, and the manager must communicate this as well, they need to have a serious conversation with some of the players at the club and insist on putting them on the transfer list. And if United can’t sell them due to the ridiculous salaries they are on, at least loan them and agree a deal with another club to pay for 40-50% of their wage. The players who need to leave are the following.",
      "Luke Shaw: This player is honestly so lucky to have been at United for the last 11 years. Yes its unfortunate how his leg injury ruined his potential and his fitness, but United should have gotten rid of Shaw years ago. Not reliable or good enough and did have a few good years, but it’s time to go.",
      "Jonny Evans: Did we seriously just sign him to keep Tom Heaton some company? Pointless signing.",
      "Victor Lindelof: Actually rate him quite a lot as a defender and player, and built a somewhat solid partnership with Maguire over the years, but should try and head back to somewhere like Benfica or a mid-table club in Italy/Spain.",
      "Diogo Dalot: I think he had a great year last season, but very big downfall this year. If United can get 35-40 million for him, sell him as he isn’t good enough defensively, has headless chicken vibes.",
      "Christian Eriksen: I thought he was excellent in his first year at United and was just as good as Casemiro in that first year under Ten Hag, but time for him to leave on a free and enjoy last few years at another club.",
      "Jadon Sancho: No explanation needed, came for money and incredibly overrated. Loan him again if necessary.",
      "Marcus Rashford: Looks like he needs a new start, and if United can sell him for a reasonable amount of money, they should sell him and it’s a big salary amount off the books too.",
      "Antony: Has proven that United really were the problem, need to convince Real Betis to sign him for around 30 million and looks to suit La Liga much more than the Premier League.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund: I do think the criticism of him has been somewhat unfair, but is he good enough to score 15-20 goals a season? He just looks so uncomfortable up front and should head back to Italy where the game seemed to suit him more. Would make a big loss on him given the price paid for, but should cash in and sign another striker.",
      "I would arguably include Mason Mount as part of this list due to his injury issues, but only came in two seasons ago. Knowing United, they won’t even sell half of the players listed here, and it will be the same vicious circle of an ‘Average’ summer of transfers. 8-9 players must be sold/loaned out this summer, a large chunk of players need to leave the club before bringing in new blood. If the owners don’t realise that, then Amorim will eventually pay the price and the same thing will happen to United where they bring in a manager for 2 years max and change it up when the owners feel like it/are bored.",

      "There are some positives though…\nSo here we stand on the precipice of glory or failure. Win and the season will be marginally acceptable, lose and it will be confirmed a disastrous campaign. This goes for both teams, and the fact Spurs have got the better of us thrice this season makes me incredibly nervous (albeit the two under RA were close affairs). Which United will turn up – Ruby’s Euro diamonds or Ruben’s relegation-hunting rejects?",
      "The league season was a write-off a good couple of months ago, so I can understand some sluggish league performances. We haven’t won since March but, Newcastle aside, most matches have been fairly evenly contested. But this doesn’t make it acceptable, and Ruben has said as much.",
      "Of course the manager has to take some flak, that comes with the territory, but we have known for some time that the squad isn’t good enough regardless of what system is being played – this doesn’t necessarily mean they are all “bad” players individually, just as a collective it hasn’t worked, and changes were and are needed.",
      "I like Hojlund, but he isn’t ready to lead the line for us every week and is still learning the game and how to deal with the pressure of being at one of the world’s biggest clubs – he needs to be a 1 in 2 striker, and it remains to be seen if he can hit those numbers.",
      "Garnacho will be a fine player, but he isn’t a wingback or a #10, so doesn’t suit the system; he has improved but, again, is not ready to play there week in week out. I don’t want us to sell him but might be necessary.",
      "Our wingbacks, key positions in this system, have not delivered consistently – injuries explain some of this but, regardless, we need players there who can defend, attack and stay fit! Dorgu looks a good buy but is still raw, not sure Amass will make it with us but we’ll see. Malacia who? Dalot gives 100% but isn’t consistent in attack, he should stick to the edge of the box cutbacks as they are his most effective deliveries, and Mazraoui looks more at home as the right CB. Most of our quality in MF is aging and our GK loves a mistake. So other than that, it’s all good.",
      "It’s not all doom and gloom, Maguire continues to look good in a 3, Yoro looks a player, Diallo has come back as sharp, Zirkzee has shown some flashes and Bruno is Bruno. Mount has even stayed fit for longer than 3 matches. We will add to the squad in the summer (Cunha would be perfect, would love Mbeumo but can’t see it), there are some promising youth players to come through and the players we keep will have more of an idea of what is expected of them.",
      "The point being, talk of getting rid of Amorim at this stage is madness. He will know that next season brings less patience, and his methods have to be seen to be working in the league as that is our bread and butter. A trophy and CL place would, however, be a start and buy him some further support.\nGarey (come on United!!) Vance, MUFC",

      "Is Frimpong that odd of a potential signing?\nYouth development is never linear; as good as Bradley has been, he isn’t consistent. Defensively he was excellent against Mbappe and bloody terrible against Martinelli. He’s been Cafu incarnate going forward, whilst also showing the inadequacies of Abel Xavier in some moments.",
      "For every youth prospect that excels, like a Gravenberch, there’s a youth prospect that excels and then stalls, like Bajcetic. Both may well thrive, but relying on one was foolhardy and didn’t work and relying on the other did work – though entirely out of luck rather than judgement.",
      "There is a difference between giving youth a chance with an opportunity that’s still safe to fail, and relying on youth and then their struggles hamper the whole team, the compounding pressure of that then destroys their career.",
      "Gravenberch saved the day this season but it was a forced gamble, rather than a plan that should be scaled. Beyond that, perpetually play a kid in every game, and you’ll break them as LFC did with Owen and Arteta may well do with Saka.",
      "The interesting thing about Frimpong is, if he is signed, it’d obviously provide competition for Connor Bradley, but given his attacking output, it’d not be out of the question for both to play on the right hand side. Frimpong strikes me as another potential Riise, who can play on the wing or as full back.",
      "And to that end, Salah has rightly earned a new contract, but this season has indicated a degree of burnout by April. If a season is 50+ games long, with minutes available at right wing and right back, then 40+ starts for Frimpong across both roles, and 20 + sub appearances for Connor at full back is still good squad management, and that’s discounting injuries. I’m likely mis-remembering but I recall Arsenal playing Eboue as a winger, and didn’t Saka start out as a full back before moving forward? I’m sure it’s been done before, it’s just my memory is failing me.",
      "Not everyone’s career ends up like Gareth Bale’s but the prospect of playing an attacking full back further forward isn’t entirely new, and not entirely unsuccessful. Riise was instrumental in Istanbul after all.",
      "Final thing would be that at circa thirty million, in today’s world of utterly ludicrous prices, that’s not too extravagant, and albeit losing Trent for buttons is a huge dropped-bollock, having two people replace him for an all-in cost of 30 million does repair that damage somewhat.",
      "I can empathise with the argument F365 are making about saving your transfer kitty till you know if a target is available. The inverse to that logic though is your main target’s price tag could/would swell to fill your entire budget if you wait forever, as your negotiating position is reduced: folks will know how much money you have.",
      "If LFC kept their powder dry, then Newcastle could argue they want the whole fee for Isaak up front. If LFC bring in two fullbacks relatively quickly, they could make the case to Newcastle that they’d be ‘happy’ adding extra onto the fee, but need to defer the installments across 18 months or longer etc – basically negotiating. (notwithstanding that i don’t think Isaak will move this window, just using him as an example as you did).",
      "I’d hope that with the sales of Darwin, Chiesa, Tsimikas, Kellegher, and Jota, and the departure of Trent, and the rumours of an exit for Endo and Elliot, that the club would have budget and wage bill capacity to do what they need to. If the signing of an ‘extra’ full back negates that, then as much as I really can’t be arsed with the manic fringe of the FSG-out brigade, some questions would realistically need to be asked as to where the money is. And Frimpong looks a decent buy if the club can get it sorted.\nTom",

      "On Joel Ward. Or why Palace are 12th\nYes, I’m still overwhelmed by the FA Cup Final. Details keep coming back to me, like seeing Paddy McCarthy from the 2010 survival side squaring up to one of Manchester City’s medical team, or the fact that victory was secured with two important players (Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton) requiring substitution due to head injuries.",
      "However, the dominant memory at the moment is what happened immediately before the cup presentation. Last week it was announced that Joel Ward, the longest-serving member of the current Crystal Palace squad, would be leaving the club when he contract expires in the summer.",
      "Clearly we all missed a memo because we didn’t plaster Selhurst with posters calling him a Judas, forcing him to pick “loyalty or lolly”, sending death threats to him and his family on social media and demanding the Joel Ward mural be painted over – that’s what you’re supposed to do when a long-serving right-back announces they’re leaving at the end of their contract, isn’t it?",
      "Ward joined the club from Portsmouth in 2012, leaving a side that had been relegated from the Championship for one that had finished 17th, for a fee of £400,000. The following season he made 25 appearances as Palace were promoted to the Premier League, and prior to this campaign made that many or more appearances in nine out of eleven seasons. Arguably the dictionary definition of a reliable if unspectacular full back, there is no denying that he has been one of the best value for money signings of the past 15 years – particularly as his arrival, with Palace just a year or so out of administration, meant they had to sell players in order to fund his acquisition.",
      "In a way, he’s a good example of why Palace finish roughly 12th every year. A more ruthless club would have cut Ward loose a long time ago, replaced him with someone younger, cheaper and with personal ambition in abundance that can be translated into ambition for the team. And yet, he’s still here, because as Steve Parish has said in interviews about other players, he wants to do right by the person behind the player; he knows that Ward, like Paddy McCarthy or Damien Delaney before him, still has leadership and experience to contribute to the group and its younger members even if he isn’t playing every week.",
      "Some clubs, or at least the very online people among their supporters, will see this as excessive sentimentality that holds Palace back, but it isn’t, it’s just humans being considerate to each other.",
      "And then we get to Saturday, when Ward and Guehi get to lift the FA Cup together, the first people to ever do that in Crystal Palace colours. It was a fantastic moment and something so richly deserved for someone who has done so much for the club for so long. Not being someone to actively seek the spotlight made it all the better that he got to be front and centre at the greatest moment in the club’s history – the greatest moment in the club’s history so far. Go well, Wardy.\nEd Quoththeraven",
      "",
      "Giving the promoted clubs a chance\nSimple solution, currently Premier League teams can only loan two Premier League players, what if say newly promoted sides were allowed up to 6 (then 4 in their second season and back to the default 2 in their third)? On the face of it wouldn’t it be a win-win? Newly promoted clubs get access to more Premier League level talent without the cost of transfer fees or locking in long-term expensive contracts, bigger clubs have more scope to give league minutes to players who need them (so currently all the promoted teams can only lend 6 between them, under this system you’d open up 24 more slots).",
      "You’d be less likely to end up with scenarios where players who desperately need the minutes, like Evan Ferguson end up going on loan to clubs who are taking them on as a spare rather than as a core part of their starting line up. I also would have an option for special appeal, wherein a club could make a case for exception circumstance on going over the set limit, this would leave the door open to late window options that turn up (like say a scenario where a player gets dramatically left out of the squad after a huge falling out and has nowhere to go).",
      "I’m aware that the sight of a team taking the field with majority players they don’t ‘own’ might be weird at first (and of course they don’t have to fill all their slots either), but surely it’d be preferable to the predictable churn of promoted sides in giving them a better fighting chance, and with more league teams in Europe than ever before and so needing deeper squads i can see how something like this could serve as a halfway house for players on the verge of the first team of higher tier sides to bridge the gap.",

      "Malouda said earlier this month: “Simple answer: yes, he’s ready, but I want him to stay in Lyon and give us more years and to keep developing himself in Lyon. I think right now with this kind of talent, you could have PSG going for him in France.",
      "“He could have teams like Barcelona and in the Premier League he is a player I could see in a club like, like, Arsenal, like Man City. So in terms of talent, in terms of potential, he belongs to the Premier League. But I would delay. I want him to stay in Lyon.”",

      "At the end of April it was revealed that it was now ‘highly likely’ that Rashford would miss the rest of the season at Aston Villa and the summer transfer speculation started in earnest.",

      "The Catalan giants ‘could close a swap deal’ with Man Utd with Rashford ‘back on Barca’s radar’ after proving that ‘he’s still a top-level star’.",
      "It is understood that ‘the option that has gained traction is to finalise a swap deal in which Ronald Araujo would be the other player, although he is not in the plans.’",
      "Whether in a swap deal for Rashford or not, the Uruguay international’s ‘departure is all but confirmed when the transfer window opens’.",
      "The report adds that Premier League giants Man Utd ‘still appears to be interested in taking him on, as they did in the past, when they even submitted a formal offer.’",
      "Earlier this month, Barcelona sporting director Deco admitted that the Catalan giants were missing strength in the wide areas of their side, something which Rashford could provide.",
      "Deco said: “If we can improve, that’s always an option, but the key is to consolidate what we have for the coming years.",

      "The comments echoed Jamie Carragher’s warning earlier this week, when he suggested Delap would be better served taking an intermediate step, such as Everton, before joining a top-six club.",

      "There was a touch of confusion around the goal too. Pape Sarr sent in a good cross, with Johnson and Luke Shaw charging for it. The ball pinged between the two before coming off Shaw's arm, sending it goalwards.",
      "It was the Spurs forward who got the lightest of final touches at the near post to ensure it smuggled home, sending the sea of white shirts inside the San Mames into raptures.",

      "Casemiro then fired into the side netting as Man Utd ran out of ideas in Bilbao. It means they will have no European football next season and their summer transfers will likely be impacted as a result.",
      "But the night belonged to Tottenham, who lifted their first European trophy since 1984 and beat Man Utd for a fourth time this year.",
      "The drama on the final day is set to come in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League, with just one point now separating fourth-in-the-table Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in seventh, with third, fourth and fifth spots still up for grabs.",

      "Spurs' poor Premier League campaign, which has seen them slump to 17th place on 38 points, having lost a club-record 21 games, has led to suggestions that he could leave even if he guides them to their first trophy in 17 years in the Europa League.",

Pape Sarr is fit, however, despite having been taken off with back pain during Friday's 2-0 loss to Aston Villa.\n\n\nJames Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also missing due to injury but like Bergvall, have travelled with the squad to Bilbao to support their team-mates.",

      "\"If I were worried about my tenure at this football club, it's fair to say we wouldn't be in this position as I would've been distracted long ago. I'm pretty good at making sure all my focus is on giving this football club the best opportunity to do something special.",
      "\"Whatever happens after that, I'm very comfortable that I'll continue on trying to win trophies wherever I am.\"",
      "The Spurs boss insisted he has not spoken to his players about his future ahead of the final, adding: \"Again, that would not really be helpful in what is before us right now.",
      "\"I've said to the lads from day one, nothing is guaranteed in life, nothing is guaranteed in sport, so you've got to make sure you take every opportunity before you.",
      "\"That's what I've done my whole career. I've been in this position before where the big game was the last game I managed, so it's not unusual territory for me and I've always navigated that pretty well.",
      "\"For me, nothing is more important than my responsibility at this football club and to its fans tomorrow. Me and the players' minds are on one thing and that's trying to create something special.\"",
      "Pressed again on his future, Postecoglou insisted: \"I wouldn't be the first person who changes jobs. We all change jobs.",
      "\"My future's assured. I've got a beautiful family, I've got a great life, I'll keep on winning trophies until I finish, wherever that is, so don't worry about my future.",
      "\"My future is not entwined with anything. Provided, God willing, my health remains and my beautiful family and friends are beside me... there's nothing wrong with my future.",
      "\"Don't stress. Sleep easy at night. I'll be OK.",
      "\"I don't think my job is done here. I really feel like we're building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.",
      "\"I still think there's a lot of work to be done, that's quite obvious with the challenges we've had this year, which are well chronicled. There's some reasoning in the context of that, but also there's been some growth that I'd like to see through.",
      "\"Whether that happens or not is not that important right now. I don't think this job's finished and I certainly feel like there's some growth there that we can take this club to where it needs to be.\"",
      "Spurs captain Heung-Min Son insisted he is ready to make history by winning his first trophy at the club after admitting he was affected by nerves in the 2019 Champions League final loss to Liverpool.",
      "\"It would be very special,\" he said. \"It would be a historic moment, I stayed here 10 years. I just want to win the trophy, which nobody has done in 10 years.",
      "\"Tomorrow is going to be a massive day for the club and for the boys, and for me as well. It has been such a tough season but we have always been together and that's why we are here.\"",
      "Son, who also revealed he had chatted to Bundesliga winner Harry Kane ahead of Wednesday's game, continued: \"Six years ago I played my first final. It was a very nervous moment.",
      "\"It was exciting but I was very nervous. I couldn't believe I was in the Champions League final.",
      "\"Six years later I'm a grown man, I'm experienced and just want to prepare in my way, calm.",
      "\"So many players have changed, also my role has changed. I'm captain of this club and leader of the boys and I want to help lift the trophy together.",
      "\"That is my dream. Tomorrow, I hope we can make a historic day that I can never forget.\"",
      "Son only recently returned from injury but insisted he feels physically prepared for the challenge ahead as Spurs aim to change their history of falling short.",
      "\"If we win the trophy, we can change the mentality and the history of the club. Then hopefully we can compete for other trophies.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim reiterated his stance that winning the Europa League would not solve the club's issues but admitted it would help him build their future.",
      "Amorim's side sit only a point ahead of Postecoglou's in 16th place in the Premier League after a similarly difficult campaign but while the Spurs boss has preached optimism, Amorim has favoured brutal realism.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident, but we already know the problems,\" he said.",
      "Manchester United have been given a boost with Diogo Dalot, Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro all available to feature having recovered from injury.\n\n\n\"They recovered quite well,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we respect the feelings of the players, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to part of the team and that is a very good sign.\n\n\n\"They are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club; the way we do everything in the week at Carrington, the recruitment, the academy. I think we need to improve.",
      "\"It's hard to point at one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow will be important for us, for our fans. That feeling of winning can help us have strength to do every job we have to do.",
      "\"But nothing is going to change our season. We have a lot to do at our club, not just winning tomorrow. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build the future.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire insisted Manchester United have shown their quality in the Europa League, despite their domestic struggles.",
      "\"When you play for this club, you want to win every football match and this season we've been far too inconsistent, we haven't won enough in the Premier League. It's not been good enough, we know that.",
      "\"The Europa League has been different. We've performed at a high level and we have proven again this season we can beat anybody.",
      "\"I'm sure, next season, we will improve an awful amount, with a full pre-season and, as players, we're all looking forward to that, but we've got a big game tomorrow night, first and foremost.",
      "\"It's a special night, a special occasion. We've prepared well and it's one we're looking forward to.\"",
      "Maguire has earned plaudits for some of his attacking contributions during United's run to the final, including scoring the winner in their comeback win over Lyon in the quarters, but hopes he won't be needed up front on Wednesday night.",
      "\"The manager has me dribbling every day in training, running up and down the wing,\" he joked.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao, managed to put a good cross in and Casemiro scored the goal.",
      "\"I've gone up front in the later minutes of games; hopefully tomorrow night I'm not going up front.",
      "\"I don't want to go up front chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "\"I'm always there to help, always there to do my best, but I'm more than happy playing in my favoured position.\""

      "\"Every game has its history…\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said these words when asked about the prospect of playing Tottenham in the Europa League final - a team that has beaten the Red Devils three times already this season.",
      "But the question is, will their recent history matter when it comes to who wins the trophy - and that crucial Champions League place?",
      "Perhaps the performance Spurs will take the most encouragement from is their first of the season against United, an utterly dominant 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September to put even more pressure on United's former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The game is evidence of why Ange Postecoglou is wrapping Micky van de Ven in cotton wool ahead of the final.",
      "Van de Ven was not just defensively impressive in this game, as he typically is, he also carried the ball over half the length of the Old Trafford pitch to set up Brennan Johnson for their opening goal in the third minute.",
      "The game then was seemingly over at the end of the first half when Bruno Fernandes was sent off - a red card that was later overturned through appeal.",
      "But this is a different United side. Although you cannot suggest their position in the Premier League of 16th is evidence they have moved forward under Ruben Amorim, they do look better defensively, they concede fewer chances, and have shown in these big European nights that they can be a threat going forward, more so anyway, then under Ten Hag.",
      "The second time these two sides met was in the Carabao Cup quarter finals in December - a fun encounter that Postecoglou's Spurs won once again, this time 4-3, with Amorim having taken over from Ten Hag.",
      "But when you look at lessons both sides could take to the final, it is challenging when you consider the context around it.",
      "First of all you look at the make-up of both sides. Spurs had Archie Gray and Radu Dragusin making up their centre-back partnership, with Fraser Forster in goal. Spurs' main three at the back of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario and defenders Van de Ven and Cristian Romero were all injured.",
      "For United, again, a side that will be much changed for the final with Altay Bayindir starting in goal, Lisandro Martinez, who is out for the remainder of the season, as well as Antony, who is now starring for Real Betis in Spain, also featured.",
      "On this occasion, although Spurs were injury-hit and did well to progress, Amorim also took a calculated risk to heavily rotate many of his first-team players. It did not work out as they lost their next three games in the Premier League as well.",
      "February was the last time these two sides met and Spurs won 1-0 but I don't think Amorim will look back at this game too closely.",
      "That's partly because the goal United conceded was a poor one. Andre Onana should have done much better to palm away a Lucas Bergvall shot, which ended up leaving James Maddison with a comfortable finish right in front of goal.",
      "Amorim had very limited opportunities to change the game when you look at the squad he had to pick from at that moment. It was an injury-ravaged United side. Victor Lindelof was the only substitute who had any sort of Premier League experience.",
      "Spurs had injuries too, with Kevin Danso and Ben Davies their centre-back pairing, two players who again are not likely to start in the final, while Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski also started but will play no part on Wednesday due to injury.",
      "Not much, really!",
      "Spurs will take confidence despite the circumstances. When they have taken on Untied this season, they have been able to pull out performances and perhaps more importantly, results.",
      "Dominic Solanke has three goals in three meetings against United too, which may give him that extra edge against their opponents in the final.",
      "Asked about facing a side who have beaten United three times, Amorim said: \"If you look at the odds, we are closer to winning than losing. Both teams will play like all or nothing.\"",
      "Those last three words perfectly describe Manchester United in Europe this season: all or nothing.",
      "United looked like they'd be out of the competition when they were 4-2 down at Old Trafford against Lyon in the quarter-finals but they miraculously came back.",
      "In the semi-finals, as I travelled to Bilbao for their tie against Athletic Club, most pundits and fans alike would have thought a draw away to a team who had lost just once in LaLiga since August at home would have been sufficient",
      "Man Utd won 3-0 in San Mames and 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "We also have to consider the tactical tweaks Amorim has made since the two sides last met in February.",
      "In the most important games, he has now settled on a midfield duo of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Brazilian especially has become revitalised under Amorim in recent months.",
      "Amorim told me this has been mainly down to Casemiro working on his own fitness as well as the United boss tweaking the way they press, more so with their wing-backs going high, enabling Casemiro to stay in front of the defence and not be caught out on transition.",
      "Amorim and the players have spoken about how the physicality levels of European opponents are more suited to the players, which does pose the question of how they will deal with a physical Spurs side who will look to impose themselves as they have done in this season's previous meetings.",
      "But United have been illogical and unpredictable when it comes to the Europa League this season. When you consider all of the circumstances of their previous meetings with Spurs, it is clear that they won't have much relevance.",
      "Wednesday's game is a different proposition for both sides."

      "Matheus Cunha is set to join Manchester United after the season ends this weekend.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows previews the Europa League final and outlines where the value lies as Spurs and Manchester United look to save their seasons.",
      "This is a beautifully grotesque final. Both teams are balancing on the highwire with no safety net below them.",
      "We can get carried away with overdramatising the outcomes of football matches but this one truly is huge, especially for Tottenham, who have one game to decide whether it's been their best or worst season for many years. It's a ridiculous situation, really.",
      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11. The 90-minute odds have United at 7/4 and Spurs at 29/20.",
      "It's a 50-50 spin of the Roulette wheel. White or red. Heads or tails.",
      "I'm very confused about this game from a betting perspective.",
      "These two teams have been completely different in the Europa League compared to their Premier League form. And usually you'd put more weight in the domestic form to gauge a true ability of a team, especially in this spot as this is an all-Premier League final. But I'm very torn.",
      "United can't score in the Premier League, averaging just 1.14 goals per 90 minutes and have scored just five goals in their last eight games. But look at their Europa League form.",
      "They have averaged 2.5 goals per game this season, scoring a whopping 19 goals in their six games with Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Club in the knockouts.",
      "And then we have Spurs, who are equally as confusing to analyse. As they are a completely different team to their overall form of this Premier League season when their first-choice back five plays under Ange Postecoglou. The difference is simply huge.",
      "When Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie all play under Postecoglou, they have won 18 of those 30 games, losing just six times.",
      "If you were converting that to points per game - that's two per game. If you translate that over the course of a Premier League season of 38 games, you get 76 points, which would be enough to finish a clear second in the Premier League this season. There is a really good side lurking there.",
      "It's a game where backing teams both not to win is actually quite attractive, so the draw in 90 minutes at 23/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play the outright market.",
      "Three of the last four Europa League finals have ended in a stalemate. It's a result which is always a runner in finals of this nature where two big clubs meet with lots on the line.",
      "Much better opportunities are found in the props market for Wednesday's clash in Bilbao, notably in the fouls markets.",
      "The Europa League final has a rich tradition of being a foul-heavy occasion - it makes sense with such riches on the line.",
      "The last 15 Europa League finals have averaged 31.2 fouls per 90 minutes.",
      "That's a huge number.",
      "For context, Premier League matches have averaged 22.5 fouls per 90 this season, so the added jeopardy of a final using those numbers, there could be almost 10 more fouls in this type of game that a run-of-the-mill Premier League game. And when you throw in so much being on the line for these clubs and how evenly matched they are in the betting, I think this game could be very foul-heavy and potentially go way above the number the market is expecting.",
      "Sky Bet has the line set at 24+ match fouls at 5/6 which looks a great starting point for those looking to exploit these total fouls angles. I'd advise laddering the prices on offer with Sky Bet right up to the 10/1 on offer for 32+ match fouls, which has a chance of landing based on the historic averages.",
      "And it's worth noting that Spurs are a foul-heavy team under Postecoglou - he likes to play expansive and man-for-man which creates lots of one-on-one situations in space that therefore lend itself to fouls being made. Since he was appointed, no team in the Premier League has seen more fouls in their matches than Tottenham - that average is 24.5 fouls per 90 over a 75-game sample size in the Premier League.",
      "On the biggest stage, with so much on the line, I'd expect this Spurs game to hit those foul averages so those odds look very generous to me."

      "\"Some will say maybe it is not fair when one of them wins and goes to the Champions because they did not earn it or qualify in the proper way. But it is what it is and it is going to be an interesting game now because their backs are against the wall,\" says Berbatov.",
      "\"Finals are about concentration, about not making silly mistakes, because you could be punished and there is no rematch. Maybe we will be surprised and it will be an open game but I expect caution, nobody wanting to take risks. Their seasons are on the line.",
      "\"The only thing that can justify either season now is lifting that trophy. Who needs it more? That is the question. United have been going backwards while others gone forwards. Spurs have not won a trophy in 17 years. So in a way, both managers need it.",
      "\"Ange Postecoglou, he can say, 'I told you, I always win something in my second season. Now shut up.' Or Ruben Amorim can say, 'Trust me, this is the system that we are going to play and now we can build for United's next season with that trophy'.\"",
      "It was Berbatov himself who scored the goal when Tottenham won the 2008 League Cup final - their last piece of silverware. They came from behind that day at Wembley to beat a strong Chelsea side. \"We were the underdogs, we had nothing to lose,\" he remembers.",
      "\"That was the Chelsea of Didier Drogba, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Petr Cech, some great players. But we knew that we would have our chances to score because we scored a lot of goals, that team, especially up front with me and Keano (Robbie Keane).",
      "\"Everybody expected Chelsea to win. Drogba scored a great free-kick but we kept going.\" Berbatov equalised from the penalty spot and Jonathan Woodgate won the cup in extra-time. \"Sometimes that is all you need, a penalty or a corner kick or whatever.\"",
      "Berbatov has had his own frustrations in finals, of course. In the 2002 Champions League final, his Bayer Leverkusen team were edged out by Real Madrid's superstars in an even game at Hampden Park. A moment of magic from Zinedine Zidane decided it.",
      "\"It was probably the greatest ever goal in a Champions League final. There was nothing you could do. The ball just landed at the feet of the one player you do not want the ball to land to. In football, sometimes even your best is not good enough. It is a cruel game.\"",
      "It was cruel in 2011 too. Despite being the joint-top scorer in the Premier League that season, sharing the Golden Boot with Carlos Tevez, Berbatov was surprisingly omitted not just from the United team for the Champions League final but the entire squad.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has since apologised for the move - he started Javier Hernandez, with Michael Owen preferred on the bench. Does Berbatov understand the call yet? \"Not personally but Sir Alex obviously admitted that he probably made a mistake,\" he says.",
      "\"My confidence was sky high. You are king of the world or that is how I felt. In every game, you think you are going to score. But even if I did play, I do not know if it would have made any difference because at that time Barcelona had prime Lionel Messi!\"",
      "Berbatov left United for Fulham at the end of the following season, with Ferguson calling time on his long reign at Old Trafford just one year after that. The Scottish legend bowed out with yet another Premier League title but United have been in decline ever since.",
      "\"United remain massive around the world, but it is a long time since that last Premier League and that way of thinking, that mentality of going to win every game, it has faded away,\" says Berbatov, speaking in his role as a LiveScore European brand ambassador.",
      "\"United have been struggling for years and that is painful, of course. Everybody knows that - the fans, the management, the coaches and the players as well. That is why this game is so important, so they can say, 'Look, we are struggling but we still won a trophy'.",
      "\"In the past few years, it has always been about how next season is going to be ours - and the next season. Again, we are in that position where next season, let us hope that the new manager can do it. As cliched as it sounds, you always have to keep the faith.",
      "\"Keep that faith and hope Ruben, with a pre-season behind him, will not start over, but maybe bring in the players he wants because he is not going to change, he loves that system. So you need players specifically to fit that system and hope the results come.\"",
      "Is there a suspicion that United just seem to find a way? Berbatov talks of them having \"a DNA that they need to win trophies\" while Spurs' wait goes on. But he is conflicted. \"I do not think it is that Spurs do not have belief. It is a tough question to answer,\" he says.",
      "\"On the one hand, there is the DNA of the club, the history, everything you have won before, and you know that the expectation from everybody is that you will win in the end. On the other hand, maybe if you are not expected to win then there is nothing to lose.",
      "\"Sometimes football can be a cruel game and there is just no explanation for it. You just go out there with your best intentions, you are fully concentrated, you are all ready to go, all your first-team players are ready and they play and then it just does not happen.\"",
      "Either way, Berbatov will be watching. Just do not ask him who he wants to win. \"I will sympathise with the loser because I have been there, winning finals and losing finals. Football will remind me again that there is so much joy but so much pain as well.\"",
