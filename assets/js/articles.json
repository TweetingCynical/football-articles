      "Gary Neville has hailed Manchester United's transfer business this summer, but warned there are still two problem areas they need to strengthen. United have spent big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, forking out around £133.5million on the two attackers.",
      "United struggled for goals last season, with only Everton and the three relegated sides managing less Premier League goals than their 44. But the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo should provide a major boost having notched 35 between them.",
      "Marcus Rashford has also joined Barcelona on loan after being frozen out by manager Ruben Amorim, who is also keen to offload the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia after deeming them surplus to requirements.",
      "And Neville believes United's moves so far are a good sign ahead of next season - although he would like to see the club sign a new goalkeeper and a new striker before the transfer window slams shut.",
      "\"It would seem that what's happening now is Ruben Amorim is identifying players he does not want in the squad and he's moving them out. That's a positive and on paper I do like the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "\"Why do I like them? They've got Premier League experience, they look more like Manchester United styles of players with a bit more pace and power and the physicality to get from box to box quickly.",
      "\"I think when you look at Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are more jinkers, more people who work in tight spaces. I've always felt that United need players that can open their legs up and really stretch teams and I think Cunha and Mbeumo do that.",
      "\"The other thing I like about those two signings is they've not proved themselves at the highest level yet in respect of Premier League club level or European club level so they should be really desperate and hungry to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is Old Trafford.",
      "\"That hunger hasn't always been there in the last ten years with players that have come to the club. They've maybe been the more finished article and we've got excited by them, but maybe they haven't had that desperation.",
      "\"I always feel like a player needs hunger, they need desperation in the game to feel that it's the most important thing and I think these two lads that have signed will have that. I think the two signings are good signings.",
      "\"There's a couple more needed. I think they need a goalkeeper and a centre forward and if they can fill those two positions with decent signings then United can have... I mean they have to have a better season than last year. It can't get any worse.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has moved to the top of Manchester United's wish-list as they look to add the striker to their ranks. The Red Devils have already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, but Ruben Amorim is open to adding more firepower to his side following the club’s dire 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The highly rated Sesko looks set to move on after Leipzig missed out on Champions League football. United will be absent from European football completely this season, but that is not thought to have put the Slovenian off.",
      "Sesko is reportedly favouring a move to Old Trafford over Newcastle, who are also in the market for a top forward, with Liverpool-linked Alexander Isak angling for a move away from Tyneside. According to The Athletic, Sesko is Man United’s priority if they go for another striker this summer and they are said to have made ‘informal’ contact with Leipzig.",
      "The Red Devils are also admirers of Ollie Watkins, but are unwilling to meet Aston Villa's £60m valuation of the 29-year-old England star. A move for Sesko now appeared to be the preferred and more likely option, with United also favouring his youth and potential over a proven quality like Watkins.",
      "United have been linked with Sesko in the past, but they balked at paying around £2m for the then-16-year-old in 2019. There were subsequent approaches in 2022 and last year before the club signed Joshua Zirkzee. Sesko will now cost many times more after emerging as one of the most promising strikers in Europe, scoring 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig since his arrival in 2023.",
      "His current contract runs until 2029, having only signed a new deal last year. It reportedly came with an understanding that he would be allowed to depart if another club offered in the region of £69m to £78m.",
      "United’s arrivals will need to be offset by some outgoings, with several players declaring their desire to leave the club. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were left out of the tour of the United States, with the so-called 'bomb squad' training at the club’s Carrington complex. Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan.",
      "United’s transfer dealings have been widely criticised in recent seasons but Amorim has said chief executive Omar Berrada and sporting director Jason Wilcox would not be taken advantage of just to get rid of those surplus to requirements.",
      "“Some players have to find a new place to have more space in the team and others clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams,” said Amorim last week.",
      "“We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide. If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players.",
      "“I know for a fact that these people, Omar and Jason, and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has confidently shut down any suggestion Manchester United will make a move for Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta. The Red Devils have made no secret about their desire to bolster their forward line.",
      "They have already brought in Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and recently unveiled £71m signing Bryan Mbeumo. However, the Red Devils are still looking for a new centre-forward, two seasons after forking out £72m on Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko has been one target of interest, while Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins has emerged as the latest priority. In and amongst the latest reports, Mateta has also been linked to Old Trafford in the past.",
      "But when the possibility of the Frenchman moving to United was touted to Ferdinand, the Premier League legend immediately shut down the possibility. Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents show, the ex-United and England captain replied: \"We ain’t signing Mateta. Trust me.\"",
      "In March, United were told that Mateta would set them back £40m. Reports from L'Equipe at the time also claimed the Red Devils had opened talks with the Eagles about a move for the 28-year-old.",
      "However, the rumours have since petered out, with United seemingly looking at other targets. They have already seen moves for the likes of Liam Delap, Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres fail, joining rivals Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal respectively.",
      "Mateta struggled when he first started at Palace but has been one of the Premier League's most dangerous forwards since Oliver Glasner took over. Under the Austrian manager, he has contributed 30 goals and five assists in 59 appearances in all competitions.",
      "However, for whatever reason, United are seemingly looking elsewhere. Ferdinand has been following United's pre-season tour of the USA, where they recently beat West Ham 2-1 in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "While the memories of last season's disastrous campaign are still fresh, Ferdinand has seen some positive signs this summer. Commenting on United’s transfer window so far, he added: \"For me personally, I’m hopeful more than anything.",
      "\"There is nothing to give me belief yet. I need to see it. The belief is that we have got two good signings who know the Premier League. That’s nice, that’s good, that’s needed.",
      "\"Again, I think we probably need one or two more to go into the season and go, 'Listen, I’m confident we can now go and finish in the top eight.' At the moment, I am sitting there thinking, 'There’s a lot of hangover from last season.’",
      "\"If you start actually digging into last season, it starts depressing me. But the new signings give you a bit of hope. Being out on tour helps you get a different perspective.",
      "\"It guides you and you’re now going, 'Oh, I can see them working, I can see some positive things, the team are together, the manager is getting time with the team.’ I am looking for positives.”",

      "Joshua Zirkzee has vowed to fight for his place and prove his worth for Manchester United – despite their search for a new striker.",
      "Zirkzee endured a difficult debut season at United, following his £36.5million move from Bologna, scoring just seven goals from 49 appearances. United are pushing to sign a new striker, with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins their top target, and have already signed two forwards this summer in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "But Holland forward Zirkzee said he welcomes the competition from new arrivals and said it can help bring out the best in him and his fellow attackers.",
      "“I’m very confident, everyone’s very confident,” said Zirkzee. “We’ve got competition, so whichever position the coach needs me is the position I’ll play – if that’s as a No.10 or a striker, it’s no different.",
      "“The coach knows me well and knows exactly what to do and I’ve got 100 percent trust in the coach so I’m not worried about that.",
      "“It’s part of being at this club [competition]. If another striker were to come, I guess it’s only good competition, so I’m not really worried.",
      "“They [Cunha and Mbeumo ] are two great players. We’ve seen that in training and we’ve seen that last season as well. We’re for the team and that’s what we’re all about. We just want the team to be good.",
      "“Everything is for the team, there’s no selfishness here, that’s not my mantra. If it were to help the team, then great. I’m not here to decide what’s fair and unfair, I just know that me and Rasmus [Hojlund] can do better and have to do better.",
      "“The manager wants goals, so that’s what I have to work on. That’s what it all comes down to. In the end, if you’re up top, you’re supposed to score goals. I’m not going to take that fact away.”",
      "Zirkzee’s lowest point last season came when he was booed by his own fans at Old Trafford in January when he was subbed after 33 minutes with United trailing 2-0 to Newcastle.",
      "He headed straight down the tunnel, visibly upset, but returned to the bench, and revealed how the support of his team-mates helped him through the ordeal.",
      "“The guys are always there for me,” said Zirkzee. “Bruno [Fernandes], of course, is the captain. We’ve got a great group and we’re all there for each other, so every individual wants the best for all of us. In that case, I can lean on a lot of guys in the team.”",
      "Zirkzee missed United’s US tour-opening 2-1 win over West Ham because of injury and said: “It’s a small injury, not a serious problem.",
      "“It’s pre-season. It’s not like last season, when I pushed myself to be there for the Europa League final. Now I just want to be there for the start of the season.”",

However, after weeks of talks, Manchester City gazumped their rivals to re-sign the same keeper they sold for £14million back in the summer of 2023.",

      "Roy Keane believes Ollie Watkins is capable of leading the line for Manchester United as the Red Devils focus in on the Aston Villa striker as their top target. Ruben Amorim has already added Mattheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to his attacking threat for the new season, but he is still on the hunt for a new No. 9 to front up his rebuild.",
      "It seems that United are shopping locally for their new signings, with Premier League experience clearly valued by the club's hierarchy this summer. Villa have remained adamant that Watkins is not for sale, but previously valued the 29-year-old at £60million, giving Old Trafford chiefs a benchmark to reach.",
      "However, United are confident that a compromise price of between £40m and £45m can be agreed between both parties to secure Watkins' services. Club icon Keane has weighed in on the Watkins debate before, stating that he believes the striker has what it takes to handle the pressure of a big club, as he put it.",
      "\"That’s a compliment to him, not that he has to leave Villa. But he’s capable of doing it.\" Discussing the striker's form at the time, Keane added: \"The kid is so sharp, he has a great shape to him. His movement is as good as any striker in the Premier League. He’s having an amazing season.\"",
      "Across 54 appearances last season, Watkins scored 17 goals and assisted 14 times. This type of return is exactly what United are after as they aim to improve what has been a disaster start to Amorim's reign.",
      "United already have two strikers on their books in Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, but it is safe to say the duo haven't exactly impressed during their time at the club. In total, Hojlund and Zirzkee have scored 17 goals between them, matching Watkins' solo endeavours at Villa last time out.",
      "Zirkzee only managed seven goals and three assists across all competitions for United following his £36.5m arrival last summer, while £72m man Hojlund hit 10 goals and four assists in 52 appearances. Amorim is aware that in order for his side to reach some level of success, he will require a more proven goalscoring record - and Watkins could be another cog in this puzzle.",
      "As well as Watkins, the Red Devils are also keeping tabs on RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old was consistent for a struggling Bundesliga side last campaign, scoring 13 goals and assisting five times in 33 league appearances.",
      "Sesko also scored four times across eight Champions League games for Leipzig, proving he can hold his weight in European competitions too. However, a £70m price tag could be off-putting to United, given that they have already dropped over £120m on Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "The Red Devils also have other areas to prioritise and are in the market for a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper. Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have not convinced Amorim that either of them are capable enough to hold the No. 1 jersey, with both being used sporadically throughout the 2024/25 campaign, not to much success.",
      "The United boss also hopes to strengthen his midfield with a solid deep-laying playmaker, as Casemiro's veteran status rules him out of the starting position. Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are also both options, but Amorim seems to like playing Mainoo further forward - and it doesn't seem like he is happy with the £50m paid to bring Ugarte from PSG last summer.",
      "But number one on the manager's agenda is a new frontman, and with Newcastle United also in the race for Sesko's signature, Amorim may opt for Premier League pedigree and a cheaper fee in Watkins. Keane's seal of approval holds weight too, given his success in United's colours in years gone by.",

Alongside Ollie Watkins, the 22-year-old RB Leipzig striker is being considered in the final month of the summer transfer window.",
      "It's believed that Watkins would be open to a move to United, while Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has kept communication lines open with the Red Devils since discussing a potential move last year.",
      "The Slovenian international has been a hot topic in the transfer market since the end of the 2024/25 season. Arsenal seemed keen on Sesko but decided to pursue Viktor Gyokeres instead, sealing a £63.7million deal for the Swede last week.",

      "Former Chelsea goalkeeper Petrovic had high praise for Sesko ahead of Euro 2024 last year, stating he \"has everything\" needed to succeed in the Premier League.",
      "Before the tournament, Petrovic had watched Sesko play several times and assured the Blues that he'd be a surefire success in the English top flight.",
      "\"I know [about the rumours linking him with Chelsea] and have been following him,\" Petrovic, who now plays for Bournemouth, told Nogomania. \"He's having a good half season, he's in great scoring form. I read that he's scored in his last seven matches in a row. He seems to have gained strong momentum for the Euros.",
      "\"He's a forward who has everything a modern player needs. He's tall, strong, fast and intelligent. I've watched some of his matches. Of course he can play in the Premier League. Absolutely! He has great potential, and he's been successfully proving it.\"",
      "According to Sky in Germany, United's board has been in touch with Sesko, and talks about a potential transfer to Old Trafford are possible. Should Sesko touch down in Manchester, manager Amorim has made it crystal clear exactly what he expects from any new recruits, saying: \"They have to want to come here.",
      "\"I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player.",
      "\"We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project. And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point.",
      "\"If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.\"",

      "“The mentality is a big thing. He talks a lot about it. Ruben demands 100 per cent and he doesn’t want anything less. If someone’s doing 85 to 90 per cent, it’s not enough for him. Especially this year, if you’re not doing the right things, I feel like you won’t play.",

      "“It’s not hard to see from the outside what it’s been like,” said Shaw. “A lot of the time I’ve been here over the last few years it’s been extremely negative. It can be quite toxic, the environment, it’s not healthy at all.",
      "“We need an environment that’s healthy, that’s positive, that’s got good energy and happiness. When you have all those things, you feel free and you can express yourself more on the pitch. Things come together and, especially this pre-season, I feel like us as a team, I feel the bond is growing.",

      "Liverpool will once again fail to lift back-to-back Premier League titles, according to a supercomputer which has predicted the full 2025-26 table. The Reds were crowned champions last season after a stunning start to life under new manager Arne Slot.",
      "Very few had backed Liverpool to win the title following the departure of Jurgen Klopp but a slump from Manchester City and Arsenal's failure to capitalise allowed Slot's side cruise to victory without a formidable challenge. That's set to change this term, though, with City having made 10 signings since the turn of year and Arsenal finally addressing their issues up front.",
      "Liverpool have, of course, spent more than anyone and won't stop at £269million. The reigning champions want to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak for a British-record transfer fee of at least £125m.",
      "That's after breaking the record to sign Florian Wirtz for an eye-watering £116m last month. But the supercomputer has Liverpool finishing THIRD - just as the Reds did in the 2020-21 season when they were defending champions under Klopp.",
      "Arsenal would finish second for the fourth year running, a new record, with City reclaiming the title under Pep Guardiola. There's also good news for Manchester United, who'd shoot up 10 places but narrowly miss out on Champions League football to Chelsea.",
      "Aston Villa would pip Tottenham to sixth place while Newcastle, West Ham and Everton round out the top half. Unfortunately for the three teams promoted from the Championship - Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds - they'd all go straight back down, a worrying trend which we've seen in the past two seasons.",
      "These are all predictions made by an AI supercomputer, via Sportscasting, which has simulated the upcoming Premier League season. Explaining City's title win, it said: \"Even without any seismic squad changes, their machine-like system - powered by Omar Marmoush, Phil Foden, the returning Rodri, and a 36-goal season from Erling Haaland - keeps them dominant.",
      "Who'll win the 2025-26 Premier League title? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"Their depth and consistency in tight matches give them the edge over Arsenal and Liverpool. Arne Slot's rebuilt side will feature a potent attack - with Mo Salah alongside new signings Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. But their defence will let them down against top teams, causing them to slip to third in the title race.\"",

      "Manchester United face a harsh reality as the club work on shipping out the players who wish to leave the club this summer. Manager Ruben Amorim left five first-team stars out of his pre-season plans ahead of Marcus Rashford’s loan move to Barcelona, having been informed that Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia also wanted to exit.",
      "Recouping money from the so-called 'bomb squad' could bolster United’s transfer plans. Yet, the Red Devils have reportedly lowered several of their valuations since the transfer window first opened, which will not be welcome news to United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Rashford has sealed his season-long loan move to Barcelona, who have a £26million option to make his stay at the Camp Nou permanent. That is a significant drop from United’s reported £100m valuation last April and is even less than the £40m price given to Aston Villa. However, United slashing Rashford’s past valuation by £74m is only a fraction of the total £213m United could lose as the club attempt to part with their wantaway players.",
      "Garnacho is another player whose price has dropped significantly since the start of the summer. The Argentine winger, who was linked with Chelsea and Napoli, was initially said to be worth £70m.",
      "However, United have since almost halved their asking price to £40m. This would represent a £30m difference in what United were expecting to receive from selling the talented 21-year-old, who scored 11 goals across all competitions.",
      "The writing appeared to be on the wall following Garnacho’s reaction to being named on the bench for the Europa League final last season. In the aftermath, Garnacho said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Antony’s productive loan spell at Real Betis last term would have boosted United’s hopes of recouping a significant portion of the £82m that they paid Ajax three years ago. The Red Devils quoted around £40m for Betis to sign the winger permanently, having scored nine goals and provided five assists in 26 appearances for the club.",
      "The price was deemed too high for Betis, though Antony’s valuation has remained around that mark. That would see United take a huge £42m hit on the Brazil international.",
      "Sancho is another high-profile signing who has never lived up to expectations at Old Trafford. There was plenty of fanfare when the England winger arrived for £73m in 2021 on the back of his sensational spell at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "However, Sancho failed to replicate that form for United before a fallout with ex-manager Erik ten Hag led to him being exiled from the squad in 2023. A brief return to Dortmund and a subsequent loan spell at Chelsea failed to prompt a permanent move.",
      "Football Italia has since reported that Juventus have made a £15m offer for Sancho, who is in the final year of his contract. This would be £58m less than his original transfer fee.",
      "Despite the financial hits that the club could take in the transfer market, United boss Amorim has insisted that he would welcome the players back into the fold if no deal can be finalised. “There are different reasons for the players [left behind],” he said.",
      "“Some players have to find a new place to have more space in the team and other players clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams. We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide. If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players.",
      "“I know for a fact, these people, Jason [Wilcox, technical director], Omar [Berrada, chief executive] and the club have a number for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.",
      "“I understand the clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I’m ready to receive the players, they have more competition, more competition if you want to play in the World Cup next year, so you need to play. I'm really happy with that because I have more options. If they have to fight each other to play one game a week, for me it’s perfect.”",

Mbeumo is getting to know his new team-mates on United’s pre-season tour of the United States after making a £71million move from Brentford and is excited by the prospect of playing with his new captain.",
      "United beat competition from Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle and Chelsea to land Mbeumo in the summer transfer window. The Cameroon international scored 20 goals for Brentford in the Premier League last season and is now tasked with revitalising an ailing attack which managed just 44 goals in 38 league games in 2024/25.",
      "Mbeumo will aim to link up with fellow new arrival Matheus Cunha, while United are hoping to sign a centre-forward to complete their new-look frontline before the window closes. But whoever may be in the pipeline, Mbeumo is delighted to have Fernandes assisting him.",
      "Appearing on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast in the US, he was asked which team-mates he’s most looking forward to playing with. “Of course, Bruno. Of course, yeah,” he replied.",
      "“Yeah, everyone sees it in the past years – he has a really good foot. He can shoot, he can cross, he can do crazy balls. Yeah, for a striker, you just enjoy that.”",
      "Asked how he would develop an understanding with him, Mbeumo added: “I think it's a little bit of everything. As I said, you earn experience from everyone. So it's always good to speak to someone like this.",
      "“But at the end, I think on the pitch, when you're smart like he is, I think you don't even need to think a lot. You just need to make the run and he's going to play you in the right space every time.",
      "“But of course, you can have a little discussion to make him know how I prefer the balls and how I'm feeling the best to have the ball. But at a certain point, there is only one way, even if it's not the one you like, you have to do the run and he's going to put the ball in a good position.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is certain that Fernandes is going to be key to United’s chances in the 2025/26 season. Speaking after their 2-1 win over West Ham on their pre-season tour, he hailed his skipper.",
      "“You can see it in the assists, the goals, but not just that,” he said. “I think now he has more players [around him]. I've felt that on the tour. I feel that now there are more players to help him to lead the group. That is a good thing.",
      "“But he's our leader, so he's really important. Not just on the field, but also off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and sometimes he plays with pain.”",

      "That is where United have been trying to find a new player. But with no European football to offer targets, having finished a lowly 15th last season, they missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal.",
      "United are, however, unwilling to pay Aston Villa's £60m valuation for the England star. Instead, they hope to negotiate down to around £40-45m for the 29-year-old forward.",
      "One of the things in their favour is that Watkins is understood to be keen on the move. While he has been an important player for Villa in recent years, he has clashed with Unai Emery over selection in the Champions League and would undoubtedly be the main man at United, where rotation would be less of an issue.",
      "Jadon Sancho had appeared to be set for a move to Juventus, but a third spell at Borussia Dortmund is now thought to be a serious possibility for the winger. Sancho is part of the bomb squad at United, having been told he has no future at the club under Amorim's management.",
      "He had agreed terms with Fenerbahce last month, before that move collapsed. Next came Juventus, with the Italian side thought to be close to signing the 25-year-old for £21.6m.",
      "According to reports, United could now flog Sancho to Dortmund for £15-17m, giving him a third spell at the club. Sancho made his name in Germany initially, joining United for £73m on the back of his form there, and also spent time on loan at Dortmund in 2024.",
      "Manchester United won't be signing Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea this summer. Jackson is exploring his options after the arrivals of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap left him contemplating a season on the bench. United held talks with his agent, but Chelsea's asking price has put them off.",
      "The Blues floated the figure of £100million, with an actual valuation of £80m still way too high for the Senegal international, who has a typically ludicrous but classic Chelsea contract expiry date of June 2033.",
      "Watkins is now United's No.1 target, with Sesko another option. United have spoken to Sesko's agent, but he is younger, more inexperienced and has no Premier League experience.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are keen on signing Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins this summer - but the club are reluctant to overpay for a player who turns 30 in December. And Arsenal had the same concerns before pulling out of the race to sign the England international.",
      "The Gunners explored a move for Watkins in January, but decided over the summer that Viktor Gyokeres was the answer to their needs up front. United have also looked at whether they might be able to land the forward, but are some way from an agreement.",
      "According to reports from The Athletic back in May, the Gunners' new sporting director Andrea Berta was unconvinced by the prospect of paying north of £40million for a player of Watkins' age. Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike were mentioned as potential alternatives at the time, though both have since joined different Premier League clubs.",
      "As an alternative, Amorim's side have spoken to Villa about the possibility of including Alejandro Garnacho in a player-plus-cash deal. Villa took Marcus Rashford on loan from United for the second half of last season, and Garnacho could yet fill the gap left by Rashford's decision to spend the upcoming season at Barcelona.",
      "In five Premier League seasons, Watkins has scored 75 league goals for Villa. His best return came in the 2023-24 season, when he bagged 19 in the league and 27 in all competitions.",
      "He finished last season with 16 in the league as Villa narrowly missed out on Champions League qualification. No United player ended up with more than eight.",
      "United have been in the United States for their pre-season responsibilities, earning a win against West Ham during the Premier League Summer series. After that victory, boss Amorim said he had yet to decide on his preferred XI for the league opener against Arsenal in mid-August.",
      "\"It's a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team,\" Amorim said. \"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been a serious target for a few Premier League teams this summer, including Manchester United and Newcastle. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Anita Vidovic, has also caught the attention of fans, especially given she is five years his senior.",
      "Sesko has been a standout player for RB Leipzig, scoring an impressive 21 goals across all competitions in the 2024/25 season. Despite the Bundesliga team's lacklustre performance, which saw them finish outside the top four, the Slovenian international remained a consistent force on the pitch.",
      "Ruben Amorim and United's hierarchy have noticed Sesko's prowess, but they're not the only ones. Newcastle are also keen to secure Sesko's services, particularly as Alexander Isak is now looking to explore other transfer options this summer.",
      "After extending his contract until 2029 last summer, Sesko will likely take some time to decide his next move. One person he'll likely turn to for advice is his girlfriend, Anita Vidovic.",
      "Cosmopolitan report the 27-year-old is originally from Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, and graduated from the Faculty of Public Administration.",
      "Anita is no stranger to the world of football. Her brother Boris has made 25 professional appearances in Germany and Poland's lower leagues, playing for teams like TSV Bicken and Ritzing.",
      "The 28-year-old hung up his boots in 2024 and has since ventured into reality television, featuring in series 12 of Love Island as a Casa Amor bombshell. Whilst it remains unconfirmed, it's probable that the elder Vidovic supports Sesko in the same way as his sister, who regularly appears wearing her boyfriend's football shirt on social media.",
      "The Leipzig striker rarely shares posts about his partner on his social platforms, restricting Anita's appearances to the occasional Instagram grid post. On the other hand, the 27-year-old WAG displays her man's romantic side on her TikTok often.",
      "Garnering approximately 20,000 views per clip, Anita reveals Sesko's affectionate acts for birthdays, anniversaries and other memorable moments. Videos of the duo dancing, sharing warm embraces and travelling the world together fill her feed, alongside her cheering on the forward from the stands at Leipzig.",
      "In one post from early 2025, Anita compiled numerous romantic footage of the pair and wrote, \"It was always you,\" alongside a white love-heart emoji.",
      "Footage shows Sesko playing with a young lion cub, demonstrating his skills at the driving range, enjoying a basketball match and dancing aboard a boat with his girlfriend.",
      "United supporters will be hoping that Anita will persuade her partner to choose the Red Devils over other possible Premier League clubs, but it appears her influence may not be required.",
      "Sesko has reportedly been impressed by United's strategy and their eagerness to secure a deal. It's suggested he received concrete figures about what he could earn and bring to Amorim's vision.",
      "It's been reported that Sesko and Leipzig have a 'gentlemen's agreement', suggesting the 22-year-old could depart for a 'special club'. Given their rich history and trophy haul, United certainly fit the bill.",
      "However, given Eddie Howe's Carabao Cup-winning side are also interested in Sesko, their ability to offer Champions League football could tempt the Slovenian star.",
      "With other clubs eyeing Sesko, it appears Amorim and United's top brass will need to act swiftly to secure the forward. However, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins is another player on United's radar, indicating it won't be a case of signing both.",

      "Garnacho is another of those up for sale, with the club looking for a potential suitor. And, according to The Independent, a player-plus-cash deal for Villa star Watkins is one avenue being explored.",
      "The same publication claims United have also spoken to Chelsea over a similar swap deal as they attempt to stay within PSR rules. In the Blues' case, Nicolas Jackson is the player who Amorim's side would want as part of the arrangement.",

      "Chelsea were linked with Garnacho back in January, but he ended up staying at Old Trafford for the remainder of the season. Now, though, it is looking harder for him to find a way back in under Amorim.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is ready to show up Manchester United’s departing players after highlighting the importance of defending in his game. United last week announced the arrival of Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal which could reach £71million.",
      "The 25-year-old is an exciting addition to Ruben Amorim’s forward line, which struggled for goals last season. Mbeumo will certainly add that, with 20 Premier League finishes for the Bees last season showcasing his eye for goal, while his blistering pace will also add a new dynamic to United’s attacking trident.",
      "Yet, during an interview on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the Cameroon international highlighted another skill of his which was undoubtedly a factor in Amorim pushing so hard to sign him this summer - his impressive defensive work-rate.",
      "The forward was asked by United legend Ferdinand about his efforts on the other end of the pitch, to which he replied: “It’s really important to attack and defend as a team. I think if just one of us doesn’t defend, it makes space for the opponents and they can get through.”",
      "Providing a nine-word comment which his new boss will love, Mbeumo said: “It’s really important to defend well as a team.” He added: “Of course it’s easier to regain the ball [that way] as well.”",
      "His emphasis on defending is in stark contrast to the forwards that have played and failed under Amorim since his appointment in November. Antony, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are three members of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ this summer.",
      "They were all told to find new clubs at the start of the summer and forced to train away from the first-team. While discipline and poor form were also factors in Red Devils chiefs deciding to part ways with the players, all three, along with returning loanee Jadon Sancho, have been accused of poor defensive workrate in the past.",
      "Much of Amorim’s success at Sporting CP, where he won two league titles, was built on hard defensive graft and winning the ball back aggressively high up the pitch, with press traps leading to quick transitions to attack.",
      "That is part of the reason why the Portuguese tactician relied so heavily on Amad last season compared to some of United’s flashier forward options. The Ivorian registered more tackles, duels and recoveries than Rashford and Garnacho, while repaying Amorim’s trust by scoring 11 goals and providing 10 assists in all competitions.",
      "Under the defensive-minded Thomas Frank at Brentford, Mbeumo was certainly no slouch either. He covered more ground than any other forward in the league last season, along with providing the most crosses (202) and the most expected assists (9.3).",
      "His intention to continue working hard in both attack and defence will be music to the ears of not only Amorim but also United's fanbase, who've expressed their frustrations with the likes of Rashford for his lack of tracking back on multiple occasions in the past.",

      "Luke Shaw admits the Manchester United environment has been \"toxic\" in recent years and head coach Ruben Amorim will not pick players who fall short of his demands.",
      "United endured their worst season in 51 years in 2024-25 and the season ended with Amorim telling winger Alejandro Garnacho he could leave after he questioned the Portuguese's decision to bench him in the Europa League final.",
      "Garnacho remains part of the 'bomb squad' that have been exiled from the first-team squad and ordered to train when their teammates are not on the premises at Carrington.",
      "Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia remain on United's books as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Amorim dropped Garnacho and Rashford for the Manchester derby on December 15 and the latter is unlikely to play for United again. Rashford was disciplined twice by former manager Erik ten Hag, while Sancho was banished from the squad after accusing the Dutchman of lying. Shaw acknowledged there were \"no stragglers in this group any more\".",
      "\"A lot of the time I’ve been here over the last few years it’s been extremely negative,\" Shaw said. \"It can be quite toxic, the environment, it's not healthy at all.",
      "\"We need an environment that's healthy, that's positive, that's got good energy and happiness. I think when you have all those things, you feel free and you express yourself more on the pitch. Things come together and I think, especially this pre-season, I feel like us as a team, I feel like the bond is growing and growing.",
      "\"I feel like in my time here, it's probably the closest I've felt with the squad since I've been here. I think the atmosphere is really good and extremely positive. Hopefully, that can continue.",
      "\"The manager has to [take action] because at the end of the day, he's going to be the one that has his job always on the line. He wants to come in and do exactly what he wants because he's always the one who's on the end of the stick. He wants to come in and do things his own way and stamp his own authority on the club. I think that's the only way you can do it, especially at Man United.",
      "\"I think we need to just all up the level of demands. That's what I think Ruben definitely brings in, is the demands. Especially the mentality. The mentality is a big thing on his lips, really. I think he talks a lot about it. Especially in day-to-day things, with the training. Ruben demands 100% and that's it and he doesn't want anything less.",
      "\"If someone's doing 85-90%, it's not enough for him. I think, especially this year, if you're not doing the right things, I feel like you won't play.",
      "\"And he's not bothered. I think you've seen what he's done in the past eight months with different players and things like that. He doesn't care who the player is. I think if he's not following what he wants, then that's how it should be, and I think rightly so. I think whatever the manager wants, us as players we have to be delivering that. So, yes, we're fully behind that.\"",
      "Shaw, 30, gave a raw interview moments after the Europa League final defeat consigned United to only a second season without European football in 35 years where he said United players had to \"question whether they're good enough\".",
      "The left back has played 27 games in the two full seasons since he signed a four-year contract worth around £200,000-a-week and this is his 12th pre-season with United. Bruno Fernandes, who joined United five-and-a-half years after Shaw, overtook him for club appearances last term.",
      "Shaw, who has started a meagre 20 United games in two years, has no regrets about his post-match candour and admitted he had \"an awful year\".",
      "\"I wouldn't say regret, but I think straight after the game your head's hot and you just say things and you don't think about it,\" he explained. \"I think a lot of people after that final, after that year, had the feeling of you don't know how next season's going to look.",
      "\"I think we have to be open and honest about that. I think none of us were good enough. I think there always has to be that question about what we think and what our plans for the next season. I just don't really know what more to say about that.",
      "\"It's never easy losing a final, especially after the season that we went through. It was even harder to take. Like I said, I think that's why my head was a bit hotter than usual as well.",
      "\"I think I had such an awful year as well. I was just fully angry about everything. I just think that's why I did the interview and said what I said.\"",
      "Shaw joined United 11 years ago and his first few at the club were beset by injury issues and he was publicly criticised by his managers. Louis van Gaal bluntly said Shaw was \"not fit enough\" during his first pre-season in 2014 and Jose Mourinho despaired at how immature Shaw conducted himself.",
      "After Shaw was late for training once, he innocently told staff that his mother had overslept and not woken him up in time. Now Shaw is preaching the importance of punctual timekeeping.",
      "\"I think us as players, especially the more experienced ones, we need to be demanding more from a day-in, day-out basis,\" he added. \"The levels in training, keeping the times of when we're doing this and doing that, making sure no one's coming late or anything.\"",

      "Amorim has played Kobbie Mainoo in the deeper midfield role throughout pre-season so far and his performances have been promising. Mainoo clearly has a decent understanding with Manuel Ugarte.",
      "It's a shame that Mbeumo isn't set to feature in this game, but Matheus Cunha should provide entertainment again.",
      "It was only a pre-season friendly but Manchester United put in a really positive performance against West Ham United at the weekend.",
      "With that in mind, I wouldn't make too many changes to the team that started that game but I would like to see Tom Heaton given a go from the start.",
      "If there is to be a change in the goalkeeping department this summer, it is likely that Altay Bayindir is the player who leaves the club and given Heaton will be at the club regardless, he deserves some minutes from the start.",
      "I would also hand Harry Maguire a start in place of Ayden Heaven, given the back three of Yoro, De Ligt and Maguire is probably the back three that will line up against Arsenal on the opening weekend of the Premier League season.",
      "Mason Mount needs some time from the start but perhaps that could come against Everton, where Bruno Fernandes could perhaps drop into a deeper role again. For this game, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte deserve another chance to build on their positive partnership in the midfield.",

      "The best interviews with Manchester United's players often take place in pre-season.",
      "The players are more relaxed in a luxury setting abroad, journalists are granted more time during the sit-down and chats take place ahead of a new campaign, so there is a clean slate.",
      "There are 'positive vibes' on pre-season tour, particularly this summer because United have reached rock bottom and the only way is up. The arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have boosted morale, probably just as much as Ruben Amorim's decision to axe the 'bomb squad' from his plans.",
      "And Luke Shaw spoke to journalists in Chicago this week, producing some fascinating quotes.",
      "\"A lot of the time I’ve been here over the last few years it’s been extremely negative. It can be quite toxic, the environment, it's not healthy at all,\" said Shaw about the dressing room.",
      "\"We need an environment that's healthy, that's positive, that's got good energy and happiness. I think when you have all those things, you feel free and you express yourself more on the pitch. Things come together and I think, especially this pre-season, I feel like us as a team, I feel like the bond is growing and growing.",
      "\"I feel like in my time here, it's probably the closest I've felt with the squad since I've been here. I think the atmosphere is really good and extremely positive. Hopefully, that can continue.",
      "\"The manager has to [take action] because at the end of the day, he's going to be the one that has his job always on the line. He wants to come in and do exactly what he wants because he's always the one who's on the end of the stick. He wants to come in and do things his own way and stamp his own authority on the club. I think that's the only way you can do it, especially at Man United.",
      "\"I think we need to just all up the level of demands. That's what I think Ruben definitely brings in, is the demands. Especially the mentality. The mentality is a big thing on his lips, really.",
      "\"I think he talks a lot about it. Especially in day-to-day things, with the training. Ruben demands 100% and that's it and he doesn't want anything less.\"",
      "Amorim did not improve results following his arrival from Sporting Lisbon, but he tackled an unhealthy culture at Carrington by laying down the law in the dressing room.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho were dropped from the squad to face Manchester City in December. Rashford was permanently exiled, but Garnacho was reintegrated before working his ticket again.",
      "Both players were not included in Amorim's plans for the new campaign and the 40-year-old deserves credit for taking on two talented members of the dressing room. It would have been more convenient to give them further chances rather than outright axing them from the squad.",
      "Amorim wants talented players who possess the right personality and character. Erik ten Hag addressed the culture during his reign, but there was more work to do when Amorim arrived in November.",
      "Some will not want to hear from Shaw given his injury record, but he is an experienced professional and is well-positioned to provide insight, so his selection of the word 'toxic' gave a glimpse behind the curtain.",
      "It feels like United are closer to achieving a healthy dressing room than they've ever been since 2013. Each United manager has tried to foster a perfect culture, but egos have been allowed to fester.",
      "Amorim's work behind the scenes to create an improved culture is just as important as getting tactics right on a matchday because a sporting institution cannot succeed without strong culture.",
      "The feeling of the squad, how players interact with each other and carry themselves away from the pitch is so important. Rashford and Garnacho had let themselves down at times and Amorim deemed that unacceptable.",
      "The raising of standards is a huge positive ahead of the new campaign.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer news live blog on Wednesday, 30 July.",
      "United still want to sign a new starting striker and have identified Ollie Watkins as their preferred target. Well-placed sources have suggested the Aston Villa forward would be open to joining, but United sources concede Watkins would command a sizeable fee.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is also under consideration and keen to secure a major move this summer. The striker rejected United three years ago in favour of joining RB Leipzig; however, his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has remained in dialogue with the club, visiting their Carrington training complex and Old Trafford since holding talks about a possible move in 2022.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho are three players the club still aim to move on. Al-Nassr. United are said to have explored including the former in deals to sign Nicolas Jackson and Watkins from Chelsea or Villa, respectively.",
      "Antony's agent has also confirmed his client is open to signing for a Saudi Pro League club amid reported interest from Al-Nassr. Sancho is said to have several suitors across Europe.",
      "Follow the latest United transfer news and rumors throughout the day with our live blog below:",
      "United are advancing with a potential move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Villa remain adamant Ollie Watkins is not for sale and United have received encouragement to pursue Sesko instead.",

      "MORE HERE",
      "If Sesko has indeed decided that United is going to be his next club and the recruitment team are making him their priority, that is huge news for the Reds.",
      "There was a concern that United may struggle to lure the players they needed to Old Trafford without Champions League football.",
      "And yet, time and time again, the lure of United seems to be working as strong as ever before.",
      "It appears that the move for Sesko this summer is starting to take shape.",
      "Now, The Athletic's David Ornstein understands that United are now in favour of signing the Slovenian if they are to bring a striker to the club this summer.",
      "United are understood to be unwilling to spend what they believe Villa would want to bring Watkins to Old Trafford so their focus is now Sesko.",
      "It is thought that RB Leipzig will be looking for between £69m and £78m for the striker.",
      "Following on from the report that Sesko prefers a move to United, the Daily Mail understands that Newcastle are beginning to accept they wont sign the forward.",
      "It is claimed that there is a feeling in the north east that United will complete a deal for the Slovenian.",
      "They do add that this could mean the door opens for their own move for Watkins this summer.",
      "According to former footballer turned journalist Jan Aage Fjortoft, Sesko has decided on his next club.",
      "Thankfully for Reds fans, it is good news as it appears the Slovenian wants United.",

      "In contrast to the reports from Tuesday, United are claimed to have opened talks to sign Donnarumma this summer.",
      "Sports Zone understands that United have contacted PSG over the availability of the goalkeeper.",
      "This comes as PSG have made progress to sign Lille’s Lucas Chevalier recently.",
      "Sadly for fans hoping that United would be able to bring him in, it seems Donnarumma's move to Old Trafford could be a non-starter.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano in his GiveMeSport column, the Italian is not currently on United's list of potential targets.",

      "Manchester United are said to have enquired about signing Pietro Comuzzo.",
      "The Italian newspaper la Repubblica [via Sport Witness] claims Nottingham Forest and Sunderland have also done so, with Milan and RB Leipzig equally interested. Fiorentina, however, will reportedly only consider offers over €30million (£26million) for their in-demand central defender.",
      "Nick Pope reportedly could emerge as a target for United should Newcastle sign Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "talkSPORT claims the 33-year-old \"fits the profile of the type of player United are looking for to challenge Andre Onana\". Pope is also in the final year of his contract with the North East club.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani reportedly still wants to sign for Juventus despite receiving calls from Premier League clubs.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims the Turin club remains his priority as they continue working on a deal with Paris Saint-Germain. Juventus could reputedly discuss a permanent move or a loan including an obligation to buy instead of only an option.",
      "Brandon Williams featured for Hull City in their pre-season friendly against Sunderland on Tuesday night.",
      "Williams, 24, left United last summer when his contract expired, but has yet to sign for a new club. Hull, however, have now taken the player on trial, training with the team before coming on as a second-half substitute for the final 20 minutes of their latest friendly.",

      "A lot of players want to be near the big cities. They want to be near Manchester, they want to be in London, and their families want to be there.",
      "You're fighting, geographically, if you are up in Newcastle, and that's just the nature of a footballer's mentality, I'm afraid. They might be drawn to whether they have friends at other clubs as well, or friends of their wives and families are a big part of that.",

      "Opponents Newport County went on to win the tie 4-2 on penalties to make it to the first round proper where they will face Championship club Millwall.",
      "According to Tuttomercato, Fiorentina defender Pietro Comuzzo is on the radar of United and their Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest and Sunderland.",
      "The 20-year-old centre-back made 33 appearances in Serie A last season and his new head coach Stefano Pioli holds him in high regard.",
      "United will be able to take a closer look at Comuzzo next month when Fiorentina are welcomed to Old Trafford for a pre-season fixture.",
      "There are a number of reasons why Garnacho must leave this summer, not least the fact that he has requested his departure.",
      "However, United must sell him permanently to fund their business for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "Now Rashford has gone on loan, United cannot afford to do the same with Garnacho - their only other asset.",
      "That being said, £30m appears to be a measly sum and the Reds will hope that they can negotiate a higher price with the Blues or elsewhere.",
      "According to The Independent, United have spoken to Chelsea and Aston Villa about the prospect of swapping Garnacho for Nicolas Jackson and Ollie Watkins respectively.",
      "It is believed that while Chelsea value Jackson at £80m, they are unwilling to pay more than £30m for Garnacho.",
      "United are wanting to keep a strong negotiation stance as they look to maximise their profit for the Argentine.",
      "Speaking to the media for the first time since arriving at United, Mbeumo has shed light on what Amorim told him about the club which convinced him to sign.",
      "Of course, I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects but the Manchester United one was very good for me. He (Amorim) said ‘we are people who like winning, and we want to be the best team’, and of course that's what we will try to do.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "The Sun reports this week that Nottingham Forest have won the race to sign Bologna winger Dan Ndoye this summer.",
      "This is significant because, if this turns out to be completed, it would leave Napoli back at square one looking for a winger.",
      "It is believed the Serie A giants have been battling Forest hard for Ndoye and should he be taken off the table, Garnacho or Manchester City's Jack Grealish could be an option again.",
      "That is according to Fabrizio Romano anyway.",
      "He understands that Garnacho is still a certainty to leave United this summer despite Amorim suggesting last week that those who have requested their exits are not automatically guaranteed to leave.",
      "Romano adds that Chelsea could move to bring the United man to Stamford Bridge later in this window.",
      "When his transfer back to the Premier League is reportedly planned for next summer, it is hard to say whether United should touch this deal or not.",
      "He will be at least 33 when he arrives back in England and on the face of it, that is not the sort of signing which Ineos would advocate.",
      "However, could Kane be like Robert Lewandowski who, at 36, managed to score 42 goals in all competitions last season for Barcelona.",
      "If Kane has a season as good as 2024/25 this year, he would be a tempting prospect even for Ineos' staunch recruitment team."

      "United signed Mbeumo from Brentford in time for him to travel to the US for the pre-season tour, but he was absent from the squad against West Ham in New Jersey due to his late arrival from Brentford.",

      "Diogo Dalot has joked Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo gave Manchester United 'headaches' last season.",
      "United spent a combined £127.5million to sign Cunha and Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively and both players arrived in time to travel to the United States for pre-season.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo were Ruben Amorim's top targets this summer. Amorim is keen to sign Premier League-proven talent and his new additions are expected to provide cutting edge in front of goal.",
      "United scored a measly 44 goals in the Premier League last season, while Cunha and Mbeumo scored league 35 goals between them, so they will singicantly improve the attack.",
      "Cunha also received the man of the match award in a 2-0 victory against United on Boxing Day.",
      "In an interview with CBS Sport, Dalot discussed Cunha and Mbeumo and joked they were responsible for causing problems. “I’m very happy that they are on our side now because every time we went to play against them, they always gave us big headaches,\" said Dalot.",
      "“They don’t need to prove anything in terms of trying to adapt to the country. They know the league well. They played a lot of years in the Premier League. Now they just have to come to a big club and try to help us put it back where it should be.",
      "\"They are two big characters, humble people, which is what we needed also. People who are driving, people who want to get better every day. They have adapted really well to the group.",
      "\"I think it was straight away you could feel their good energy, so it's a match. Now it's just time for them to adapt to the manager and what he's asking them to do. And for us to create connections and dynamics on the pitch, so we can be even better.",
      "Dalot will wear the No.2 shirt this season following the departure of Victor Lindelof. \"First of all, I've always liked the number. It's my favourite number, so I was waiting for the right moment since I came to the club to try to get it,\" he added. \"Victor has left and the number was available.",
      "\"I know historically the number has a big responsibility in the club. A lot of players have used it, not many made a mark with this number, and that's why I also took this responsibility.",
      "\"I know it's a big number in this club and I want to be a part of those who wore the No.2 shirt.\"",
      "Looking ahead to the opening game of the season against Arsenal, Dalot said: \"It's always exciting, if you don't like to play those games, you're not doing it right. It's also exciting for the fans I believe, they want to start the season with a big game and I'm sure Old Trafford will be buzzing.",
      "\"We're excited as players as well. When you dream about playing football, it's for these kind of games. This fixture is big historically in England, so it's also a big challenge for us to start with three points.\"",
      "United start 2025/2026 against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday, August 17.",

      "Harry Kane is said to be angling for a return to the Premier League amid Manchester United's search for a new striker.",
      "United are now pondering their options, with Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, 29 and but Benjamin Sesko, 22, of RB Leipzig on their list of targets.",
      "But could England captain Kane impact these plans? A report from The Telegraph claims that the 32-year-old will seek to wrap up his time at Bayern Munich next summer.",
      "Following the conclusion of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Kane will actively seek a return to the Premier League. It may also be beneficial for Bayern, with the existence of a contract clause explained, one that would allow the striker to leave for a decreased figure each year.",
      "The hard-hitting claim in the report is that Old Trafford is Kane's most likely destination, at least if Spurs do not take up their right to take up a first-option agreement made when they sold up in 2023.",
      "When it become clear Kane was leaving North London at that time he had a number of options on the table, both in England and abroad. United pulled out of the running and Bayern eventually won.",
      "Speaking in 2023, Kane made his feelings clear about the Old Trafford club who he did not join in the end, though could have opportunity to in the future.",
      "\"Obviously over the summer I know there were some talks between a few clubs in the background, but Bayern was a team I was really interested by and really excited by, so there weren't many other discussions,\" he told Sports Illustrated.",
      "\"Once they came in, it was between them and Tottenham to talk, and the deal got done.",
      "\"My focus is on here, obviously Manchester United are a great club, a really big club as well, but I decided to come here and I'm really happy I have.\"",
      "United ended up signing Rasmus Hojlund for £72m instead in the summer of 2023. The Dane has gone on to score 26 in 95 appearances over the past two seasons.",
      "Over in Germany, Kane has managed 85 strikes in 96 appearances as his latest club won the Bundesliga, marking his first career major title.",

      "Manchester United are considering a move for England striker Ollie Watkins and, should they strike-up business with Aston Villa over his proposed signature, would complete an attacking overhaul this summer.",
      "With the transfer window in full swing, United have made their move for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as work continues behind-the-scenes. If all goes to plan, those two No.10s will be the supply-line for Watkins - or RB Leipzig sensation Benjamin Sesko - at Old Trafford and beyond next season.",
      "Aged 22, Sesko would probably cost more, yet can boast more potential resale value - not to mention being the better \"project\" for Amorim to mould into his own. For the here and now, Watkins might be the better option - as United hope to spark up their attacking threat after a worrying goal-shy campaign.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were unable to lead the line with any conviction last season. As a reasonable defence for Zirkzee, though, he's a No.10 by trade and often looked more at home in that position anyway.",
      "Both men might have to give up a starting role for Watkins next term - if that proposed deal goes ahead - while a successful push for his services might also see Hojlund or Zirkzee have to give something else up, too. As the club's current No.9 and No.11, respectively, they represent two options Watkins might have his eye on.",
      "Indeed, the 18-cap England international has worn No.11 throughout his time with Villa, just as he did for Brentford before that. While at Exeter City, Watkins sported No.34, No.29 and No.14 on the back of his shirt.",
      "Assigning him No.9 or No.11 would require a difficult conversation with Hojlund or Zirkzee from decision-makers. As things stand, the club's unassigned jerseys include; No.14, No.20, No.27, No.28 and No.29.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly opened talks over possible swap deals with Aston Villa and Chelsea this summer.",
      "The Reds have spent heavily on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo so far this summer and will need to sell in order to fund more big-money deals. United currently have four players training away from the first team, with Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, and Tyrell Malacia all available for sale.",
      "One other method to sign players away from sales could be swap deals. The Independent claim that United have spoken to both Chelsea and Villa about Garnacho, as well as the possibility of players such as Nicolas Jackson and Ollie Watkins coming the other way.",
      "The report adds that there is one main obstacle as regards to any potential trade with Chelsea. It is said that while the Stamford Bridge hierarchy value Jackson at £80million, they do not want to pay more than £30m for Garnacho.",
      "The Reds are in dire need of a reliable goalscorer, having scored a mere 44 goals in the top-flight last season, their lowest tally in the Premier League era.",
      "United have identified Watkins as their preferred target, but Leipzig frontman Sesko is also under consideration as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Watkins reportedly grew dissatisfied at Villa last season, having fallen behind United loanee Marcus Rashford in the pecking order. After narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day of last season with a 2-0 loss to United, the England international is said to be open to exploring new opportunities.",
      "However, Villa's current stance is that Watkins is not for sale. The 29-year-old also reportedly has doubts over a potential move to Old Trafford due to the Reds' inability to offer European football following their 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in May.",

      "Manchester United academy graduate Brandon Williams featured for Hull City in their pre-season friendly against Sunderland on Tuesday night.",
      "Williams, 24, left United last summer when his contract expired, but has yet to sign for a new club. The player received a suspended prison sentence in May after admitting to dangerous driving and driving without insurance during an incident in August 2023.",
      "Hull, however, have now taken the player on trial, training with the team before coming on as a second-half substitute for the final 20 minutes of their latest friendly. Their head coach, Sergej Jakirovic, explained the decision afterwards.",
      "\"I like to help people because everyone deserves a second chance in life,\" he told Hull Live. \"I spoke with him very honestly, and I explained to him what I expect from him.",
      "\"We will be very careful, very, very slow. We have time, so we will try to help him. I think the quality is there because he was on a high level at Man United, so his quality is there. We need him to bring good fitness, and then we will make a decision.",
      "\"For me, his mentality is good. From our conversations, he's a very normal guy. He just asked me yesterday (Monday), 'can I play?' and then I asked him, 'do you feel comfortable to play some minutes?' His desire is there, and so is the hard work.",
      "\"On Saturday [when they played Stockport County at Edgeley Park], we left him here in Hull to carry on training, and so far, everything has gone according to the plan.\"",
      "Williams has not played a competitive match for approaching two years since the last of his 17 appearances during a loan spell at Ipswich Town in late December 2023. The full-back played in 51 games for United, all but one while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge",

Marcus Rashford recently departed for Barcelona on loan and further outgoings are expected; with the futures of Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho uncertain.",

      "According to Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg, the Magpies are prepared to submit an offer to Leipzig as soon as they receive the go-ahead from the player in question. The Bundesliga club are said to be demanding near to €80million for Sesko.",
      "However, the report also states that United \"have not given up\" on their pursuit of the 22-year-old Slovenian international. The club have already presented their project to Sesko, who is reportedly impressed by United's approach and interest.",
      "In the race for Sesko, United may have one notable advantage over their Premier League rivals with their long-standing interest in the player. United were strongly linked with Sesko in the summer of 2022, when he was still playing for RB Salzburg.",
      "At the time, journalist Fabrizio Romano revealed on his YouTube channel that United had held talks with Sesko's representatives, while exploring options to strengthen their attack. However, Salzburg were determined to keep him for another season, ultimately selling him to Leipzig the following summer.",

      "Two strikers remain on Manchester United's radar in the summer transfer window.",
      "Sources have indicated the search has been whittled down to Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko, with the former United's preferred option.",
      "Watkins is a safer bet at a time when Ruben Amorim can not afford to take risks. He has scored 75 goals in 184 appearances in the Premier League and demonstrated his quality with England last summer at Euro 2024.",
      "Watkins and Sesko have very different profiles, so it will be fascinating to see which player is signed.",
      "Sesko has not played in the Premier League and there is no guarantee he could make the transition from RB Leipzig to United, which is another reason to lean towards Watkins.",
      "However, Sesko has established himself as one of the finest goalscoring prospects in Europe and his ceiling is high, while Watkins has already maximised his potential as he approaches his 30th birthday.",
      "Sesko could prove to be better value for money in the long term and RB Leipzig would allow him to leave for a bid in the region of £69million to £78m, which is a reasonable valuation.",
      "The 22-year-old could develop into a world-class forward and he's been on United's radar for a few years. His agent, Elvis Basanovic, even visited Carrington and Old Trafford during talks over a possible move in 2022.",
      "Sesko rejected United three years ago as he opted for a move to RB Leipzig, where has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances, but the player has earmarked this summer as a chance for a big move.",
      "There is a degree of risk involved with Sesko that does not come with Watkins. Would he adapt to the demands of the Premier League? Would he settle quickly in England? How many seasons would it take him to score consistently? These are the types of questions United decision-makers will be asking.",
      "Sesko's goalscoring record in the Bundesliga is similar to Watkins' in the Premier League, but the German top flight is not as competitive and he is still raw, which must be considered.",
      "United scored a measly 44 goals in the league last season and it's logical to sign a striker who is proven in the division. Watkins would be a relatively short-term fix, but he would be effective and Rasmus Hojlund would benefit from playing second fiddle to a forward with such nous.",
      "So, would Aston Villa be happy to sanction a move for Watkins? United sources concede a sizeable bid would be required, but reports in the Midlands have claimed Watkins is not for sale. Who would lead their attack if Watkins was sold? Villa opted against signing Marcus Rashford permanently and Jhon Duran was sold to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in the winter transfer window.",
      "It would be a bold move to sell two goalscoring strikers in successive transfer windows.",
      "Villa are now one of United's rivals due to the good work of Unai Emery. The Spaniard has established Villa as European challengers and would not want to strengthen a competitor.",
      "Emery's side would probably be better off sticking with what they have this summer, which raises the possibility of United leaning towards Sesko.",

      "Whisper it quietly, but this might finally be the season Manchester United finally see the best of Mason Mount in a red shirt.",
      "When United signed the England international midfielder from Chelsea in a deal worth up to £60million two years ago it was seen as a major coup to get one of their rivals' biggest talents.",
      "One of Mount's greatest abilities was his availability and managers ranging from Thomas Tuchel to Gareth Southgate to Frank Lampard all hailed him as a coach's dream.",
      "Erik ten Hag thought he was going to get the same feeling but, ironically, since joining United, his lack of availability has been a major problem. A number of unfortunate injuries have restricted Mount to just 30 Premier League appearances across his first two seasons in Manchester.",
      "However, he ended last season strongly and scored twice in United's 4-1 Europa League semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao and played a prominent role in the side.",
      "Speaking back in March, United boss Ruben Amorim described why he 'really loved' Mount and why his version of United needed a player like him in the team.",
      "\"I really love Mason Mount,\" he said. \"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club. We will try to manage the load.",
      "\"You saw players who had a lot of problems in time but they can then stay fit and I believe a lot in Mason Mount. We need players like Mason Mount.\"",
      "Mount was signed as a deeper midfield option by Ten Hag but always thrived in a more advanced role at Chelsea. That is where Amorim sees him playing for United, too, but he will have fierce competition this season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes can play in that role while new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, have been brought in to play in that position.",
      "Mount has a fight on his hands but it is one he seems up for and insists he has ensured he's returned to pre-season feeling as strong as possible.",
      "\"I look at the end of last season and that was positive for me, to get back in the shape that I was in and be able to play and finish the end of the season off, to get a few goals, and to be back in and amongst the lads. That's the most important thing,\" he said.",
      "\"We're all in this together, and I think this period now is so important for us to spend together to train. But yeah, personally, I'm feeling really good. I feel like I'm in a really good place at the moment. I'm so excited for the start of the season.\"",
      "So far, Mount's body has held up in pre-season, having come off the bench in the draw with Leeds and the win over West Ham.",
      "With games against Bournemouth and Everton to come in the USA this week, the 26-year-old will be keen to make his mark ahead of what is a make-or-break season for him in the eyes of United fans.",
      "Amorim's system and support should get the best out of Mount. It is now time for him to deliver what United fans have waited two years to see.",

There were question marks as to whether Leon would be integrated in the senior squad after his first move to European football but the full-back has excelled in training and youngster Harry Amass will instead be loaned out.",

      "However, Romano understands that United do want a new goalkeeper but the 'numbers' need to be right.",
      "What MEN Sport says: We understand that there is currently no set budget available for a new first choice goalkeeper at Old Trafford which perhaps explains the lack of concrete interest from United for Donnarumma. Reports that United are not willing to pay £40m for Emi Martinez perhaps show evidence of a more sensible approach to transfer business. All this does make you wonder why United are not looking at bringing Aaron Ramsdale in on loan to provide good competition for Andre Onana.",
      "While this would not be a transfer for 2025, The Telegraph claims that Harry Kane is eyeing a return to the Premier League in 2026. United were interested in him back in 2023 when he moved to Bayern Munich but could not negotiate a deal with Tottenham.",
      "Kane is most likely eyeing Alan Shearer's record of 260 Premier League goals and a move closer to family as he turns 33 next year. It remains to be seen if United return to their interest in the striker.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is set to outshine the outgoing talent at Manchester United, having emphasised the significance of his defensive contributions.",
      "Last week, United confirmed the signing of Mbeumo from Brentford in a transfer that could total £71million. The 25-year-old represents an electrifying boost to Ruben Amorim's squad, which was goal-shy last term.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals for the Bees in the previous season, demonstrating his knack for scoring. His remarkable speed promises to inject a fresh element into the Red Devils' forward line.",
      "However, it was during his appearance on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast that the Cameroonian international drew attention to another aspect of his game that likely influenced Amorim's eagerness to secure his services this summer: his commendable defensive efforts.",
      "When quizzed by United icon Ferdinand about his contributions to defence, Mbeumo responded: \"It's really important to attack and defend as a team.",
      "\"I think if just one of us doesn't defend, it makes space for the opponents and they can get through. It's really important to defend well as a team. Of course, it's easier to regain the ball [that way] as well.\"",
      "His focus on defence is a marked departure from the forwards who have struggled under Amorim since his appointment in November. Antony, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are three members of United's so-called 'bomb squad' this summer, reports the Mirror.",
      "They were all instructed to seek new clubs at the start of the summer and made to train separately from the first team, with Rashford leaving for Barcelona last week on a season-long loan deal.",
      "While discipline issues and poor form also played a part in the decision by United's management to let these players go, all three, along with returning loanee Jadon Sancho, have been criticised for their lacklustre defensive efforts in the past.",
      "Much of Amorim's success at Sporting CP, where he clinched two league titles, was built on solid defensive work and aggressive ball recovery high up the pitch, with press traps leading to swift transitions to attack.",
      "This is partly why the Portuguese coach relied so heavily on Amad last season compared to some of United's more flamboyant forward options. The Ivorian recorded more tackles, duels and recoveries than Rashford and Garnacho, while rewarding Amorim's faith by netting 11 goals and providing 10 assists in all competitions.",
      "Under the defensively-minded Thomas Frank at Brentford, Mbeumo was certainly no slouch either. He covered more ground than any other forward in the league last season, as well as delivering the most crosses (202) and the most expected assists (9.3).",
      "His commitment to exerting effort in both attack and defence will be a welcome sound not only to Amorim but also to United's supporters, who have previously voiced their dissatisfaction with players such as Rashford for his perceived lack of defensive contribution.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has revealed the next signing that the Premier League giants need to make after landing Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "So far this summer, the Red Devils have only made three signings as they have spent around £130m to land Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are good signings for Man Utd, but they have loads of business still to do during this summer’s transfer window.",
      "The lack of exits are impacting Ruben Amorim‘s side and limiting their business as Marcus Rashford is their only high-profile departure, while Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho remain contracted to the Premier League giants.",
      "This is deterring pursuits for their remaining key targets, with reports indicating that their remaining priorities are a striker, a defensive midfielder and a goalkeeper.",
      "Neville has commented on United’s business and picked out the signing they “need” next. He has also revealed his feelings on his former side’s prospects next season.",
      "“Yeah, [United’s transfer business] could be a bigger challenge than the economy… I think the two signings are good signings yet, there’s a couple more needed,” Neville said on Sky News’ Business Live.",
      "READ: Romano reveals ‘private agreement’ for Sesko as Man Utd ‘deal is on’ for Newcastle target",
      "“I think they need a goalkeeper. And I think if they fill those two positions with decent signings, then United can have a lot, I mean, they have to have a better season than last year. It can’t get any worse, really.”",
      "Ex-Premier League striker Emile Heskey recently claimed one Man Utd goalkeeper target is “closest” to a former Red Devils shot-stopper.",
      "“He’s got the presence to play for Manchester United. And he’s very confident. Whoever goes into Man United, you have to have some serious presence. You have to have some serious belief in yourself,” Heskey claimed.",
      "“And I think he’s got that because the pressure is going to be on from day dot, because when you look at Onana, his confidence is on the floor.",
      "“Whoever comes in next, they have to hit the ground running. Emi is an interesting character, and you’d need to be that to take on a challenge like United right now.",
      "“He’s probably the closest goalkeeper in attitude to Fabien Barthez, and you need that. It’s a huge club, absolutely massive. He’s won the World Cup, he’s played with Lionel Messi, so he’s well suited as far as we can tell.",
      "“We won’t know for sure until and unless he moves, because we’ve seen goalkeepers crumble in minutes, like Massimo Taibi, with the pressure of United. They make a few mistakes and then you never see them again.",
      "“The only reason that’s not happened to Onana yet is because their other keepers are no better than him. If you can’t look to your number two at all to take the pressure off, then there’s a huge issue there.”",

      "The Red Devils have already brought in two attacking improvements this summer with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arriving from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "But a new centre-forward is still top of their list of priorities this summer with The Athletic reporting on Tuesday that RB Leipzig’s Sesko and Aston Villa’s Watkins are now their main two targets.",

      "It has been rumoured that a deal for either Watkins or Sesko could see Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund, who only scored seven Premier League goals between them last season, leave in the summer.",

      "“I’m a different profile but in the end if you’re up top you’re supposed to score goals, I’m not going to take that fact away. But the most important thing is that we win so if Bruno scores 60 goals and we win all the games that’s fine.”",
      "Watkins would bring more experience than Sesko and Mbeumo, who has played with the Aston Villa striker when they were both at Brentford, with the new Man Utd winger endorsing a move for his former team-mate.",
      "Mbeumo told Rio Ferdinand on the Man Utd legend’s YouTube channel: “Ollie is a complete striker, he can do a lot of things. He can drop to be available or go in behind.",
      "“That is really good for me as a winger because you can use his pace to fit in there. Plus he can combine as well. It’s really good.”",
      "Speaking about his move to Man Utd, Mbeumo added: “You want to play on the greatest stages in the world. And Old Trafford is one of them,’ he said of his move to United, who finished just 15th in the Premier League last season.",
      "“So being able to play here every two weeks is just big.  When I spoke properly with the gaffer, he said “we are people who like winning, and we want to be the best team”, and of course that’s what we will try to do.",
      "“We had a very friendly and constructive conversation. He explained his project to me, what he wanted to do and I really clicked on that.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, and they have form for signing veteran goalscorers…",
      "We know these days that players are on the wrong side of the hill once they leave school, but some oldies have shown there’s still life (and goals) in the old dogs once they sign for Manchester United later in their careers.",
      "Watkins is 29, he is said to be the preferred choice of the two names on their shortlist, and he would certainly be an upgrade on what the Red Devils currently have up front. Even though he is pushing 30, that didn’t stop these permanent striker signings from making a big impact at Old Trafford…",
      "",
      "Edinson Cavani\nFew United fans cared that Cavani was 33 when he joined United amid the madness of Covid times. For free, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer signed PSG’s then record goalscorer with a tally of 200 in 301 games. It was a much-needed boost a few days after being humped 6-1 at Old Trafford by Tottenham.",
      "Cavani took on the No.7 shirt and made a better fist of living up to its iconic billing than anyone else since the first coming of Ronaldo. Helping United to a runners-up finish in the Premier League – an achievement only recognised in hindsight – the Uruguayan scored 10 league goals and 17 in all competitions, despite having to come off the bench almost as often as he started.",
      "Signing a new one-year contract, Cavani could be forgiven for thinking he had done enough to be trusted to lead United’s line. But then, the second coming. Not only did Ronaldo take the starting spot Cavani wanted; he took the shirt of his back too.",
      "Now 34, Cavani seemed to take it all rather personally. For Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, his appearances were sporadic and his goals even more so. He was hardly alone in going through the motions for Rangnick, but the desire to get out of Old Trafford was more thinly disguised than most.",
      "",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo\nYes, it all came to a rather unsavoury end, but Ronaldo’s return didn’t seem such a bad idea when he finished the 2021/22 season as the club’s top scorer with 24 goals in 38 appearances, including some big moments in a generally wretched campaign.",
      "Granted, it wasn’t hard to shine in a team that got Solskjaer sacked and barely bothered to tune in to Rangnick, the interim replacement. He didn’t do much in the way of pressing, but what did anyone expect? Especially while he was surrounded by younger pretend pressers, who made Rangnick rip up his philosophy after approximately 45 minutes of his first match in charge.",
      "Top scorer and Player of the Season in his first year back at Old Trafford, Erik ten Hag’s appointment got Ronaldo’s back up. He was picked to start just once in the new manager’s first eight Premier League games, a role never compatible with Ronaldo’s ego.",
      "Rather than keep things in-house to preserve his legacy, Ronaldo took a scorched earth approach to manufacturing an exit. He sat down with Piers Morgan to criticise, well, everything. He wasn’t wrong about many things, but the inevitable mutual consent was reached to allow Ronaldo to move into semi-retirement in Saudi.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nIbra may have been 34 when he strutted into Old Trafford for a reunion with Jose Mourinho, but there were few signs of the veteran slowing down. He joined United on the back of his most prolific season ever in which he bagged 50 goals in 51 appearances for PSG.",
      "Zlatan was… Zlatan. He was United’s top scorer with 27 goals, netting at crucial times during Jose’s Aldi Treble. He would have scored more had his season not been brought to a premature end by a serious knee injury with a month still to go.",
      "The injury delayed the signing of another one-year contract, but by the time Ibrahimovic was fit, United had signed Romelu Lukaku, who took his starting place and his No.9 shirt. Hardly suited to a stand-in role, Zlatan was allowed to leave Old Trafford in March to join LA Galaxy. But his first season in red is one of pitifully few fond memories for United fans in recent years.",
      "",
      "Robin van Persie\nThere’s a theme among these veteran strikers: brilliant in their first season; far less so after that.",
      "None of the above, though, were as inspiring as Van Persie in his maiden campaign at Old Trafford. He did have the advantage of playing for Sir Alex Ferguson, but even accounting for that, the Netherlands striker’s impact was almost Cantona-esque.",
      "In the wake of losing the title to Manchester City, signing Van Persie from Arsenal was a statement in itself, with City also interested in the Gunners skipper once he identified Arsene Wenger’s side were going nowhere fast. ‘The little boy inside was screaming for United’, as Van Persie put it, so Fergie made sure he got there ahead of his noisy neighbours.",
      "It was decisive in United wrestling back control of Manchester and the Premier League, albeit briefly. Van Persie, evidently born to play at Old Trafford, scored 26 league goals to claim the Golden Boot as well as his first title.",
      "Then, to Van Persie’s horror as much as anyone else’s, Ferguson retired. He still hit double figures for David Moyes and Louis van Gaal in the following two seasons, but the onset of the post-Fergie funk was as a swift as it is stubborn to shift. “Moyes was not to blame – anyone who came in after Ferguson, good luck to you,” said Van Persie after he retired. “It was not only him to blame, it was us as well. The standards were so high but they dropped.”",
      "",
      "Teddy Sheringham\nBucking the trend somewhat, Sheringham struggled badly in his first season at Old Trafford. But it all worked out rather well in the end…",
      "Sheringham signed up for the impossible job: replacing Eric Cantona. At 31, the England striker was a year older than the retiring United skipper who left impossibly big boots to fill.",
      "It probably didn’t help that he barely spoke to his new strike partner Andy Cole. He failed to hit double figures in the league, which was relinquished to Arsenal. So when Ferguson signed Cole’s best mate at the start of the following season, the writing looked to be on the wall.",
      "Sheringham played in fewer than half of the Premier League games as United regained their title, scoring only twice, but the veteran scored career-defining goals off the bench in the FA Cup final and Champions League final to make himself a hero of the Treble.",
      "Even his third season at Old Trafford was a personal struggle – he scored six goals in all competitions. It was only at the fourth attempt, aged 35, that he bagged double figures in the league (15) while breaking the 20-goal barrier in all competitions for the first time, winning the PFA Player of the Year along the way.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is “not really worried” about the Red Devils being linked to Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins this summer.",

Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",

      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",

      "4) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Not a ‘fact’ when your maths are wrong, fella. But also it will be ‘argued that his age limits his value’ because his age limits his value.",
      "The biggest fee paid for any 29-year-old this summer is less than £12m; Villa would be very lucky to get anywhere near £50m for Watkins, and we would argue that the pragmatic decision would be to sell at that price.",
      "The most any club has ever paid for a 29-year-old is £57m and that was Diego Costa. He is foreign, though.",
      "That should sound alarm bells ringing in the head of Watkins if it has been turned in the direction of Old Trafford at all. Just as in the case of City and Kane, there is no conviction to United’s supposed interest. It must be assumed that the club are either trying to please Amorim or simply view Watkins as being better than nothing.",

      "But transfer journalist Jacobs has warned Man Utd that they need to get on with it as Newcastle are “advanced” in discussions to land Sesko with “club-to-club talks” taking place.",
      "Jacobs told talkSPORT: “If Manchester United want Sesko, they’re going to have to be quicker than for Ollie Watkins because Newcastle are advanced on the player’s side, they’re in club-to-club talks, they’re ready to bid.",
      "“Manchester United are still have internal conversations and as a consequence, their outreach for both Watkins and Sesko is still formative.",
      "“But I get the impression that this is a big week in the pursuit of a number nine because if it’s Sesko, Man United are going to have to get moving. If we hear a bit of a lull, it probably means they’re looking for proven Premier League experience.”",

      "“If Sesko comes in, he’s got two players that have played Premier League, scored goals in the Premier League and backed up by Bruno [Fernandes] so I think it’s a different dynamic that he comes into.",

      "20) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon, but the Bees have shown they are no pushovers.",

It doesn’t alter the fact that neither Juve nor Milan can afford what Liverpool are hoping to get.",

Guehi to Liverpool could accelerate following Luis Diaz’s transfer to Bayern, apparently. The Crystal Palace captain’s “heart is set” on a move to Anfield, says the ex-Manchester United chief scout, who remains very well-connected within the game. FI’s words, not ours.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Borussia Dortmund\nThe Gunners man is on Dortmund’s list of winger targets, with Jadon Sancho also under consideration. Arsenal could reinvest some of the money into Rodrygo, which means their supporters are bang up for this.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "14) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa \nUnited are said to have spoken to Chelsea and Villa in an effort to lump Garnacho in as part of a deal to sign a striker. Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins. Regardless, there is a deal to be done here.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "11) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nThis rumour is a re-entry into the top 20 amid reports Sesko is one of two names on United’s striker shortlist. The Red Devils could be helped by talk of a gentleman’s agreement between Leipzig and Sesko that he could go for £60million to one of a select few clubs, which United are among. But Newcastle are not. And one suspects Leipzig might change their tune when Newcastle are trying to throw at them whatever Isak money there might be. For United’s sake, we hope Sesko got something in writing.",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one has picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. We could see this happening, but not quickly. Some reports suggest Watkins is the first choice, but others say director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who worked at RB Leipzig, is pushing for Sesko.",
      "",
      "7) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters. The worst-case summer scenario for Newcastle could become a grim reality.",
      "",
      "6) Sam Johnstone – Wolves to Burnley\nWith James Trafford returning to Manchester City, Burnley are in the market for a keeper despite already having signed one. It seems they want to take Johnstone from Wolves’ bench to compete for their no.1 spot, and Wolves are quite happy to facilitate either a loan switch or a permanent deal for around £8million.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments…",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle and Liverpool are currently at a stand-off, with Isak in the middle. Newcastle have received no bid yet, and the Reds are holding fire, knowing that time only increases the pressure on the Magpies. They are still intent on digging in, even if it means convincing Isak to stay for one more season, but if the Swede is certain he wants to go now, he needs to hope Liverpool’s desire matches his own. Given Isak left it so late to declare his wishes and Liverpool have already signed a striker in his place, it is easy to imagine this being kicked down the road until next summer. For now we wait until Liverpool show their hand.",
      "",
      "2)  Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms agreed and the two clubs close to a compromise that will see Chelsea pay over £35million for the teenager. Some reports suggest a deal has already been done. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "1) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, Ramsdale is having a medical on Thursday before the Toon pay £4million to borrow him for the season with the option of a more permanent arrangement.",

      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) James Trafford – £27m/€31.2m (Burnley to Manchester City, July 2025)\nBurnley are claiming that they have sold Trafford for a British record fee for a goalkeeper but City sources place the deal at £27m plus add-ons. Newcastle were willing to pay that sum but, not for the first time, their lure was far less than City’s.",
      "",
      "12) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "13) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "14) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "15) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "16) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "17) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "18) Djordje Petrovic – £22m/€28.8m (Chelsea to Bournemouth, July 2025)\nThe Chelsea transfer ethos in action: a player they signed for £12m on a seven-year contract and who played as many games for the Blues as Strasbourg was sold for almost twice as much within two years.",
      "",
      "19) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "20) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",

      "Manchester United have received a blow in their desire to offload Antony, though there is fresh interest in another expensive flop, according to reports.",
      "Antony has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in recent days after a fruitful six-month loan at Real Betis.",
      "The Brazilian winger joined United from Ajax for around £85million in August 2022 and has failed to live up to the hefty price tag. However, his form during the second half of last season has raised the player’s value ahead of a summer sale.",
      "Betis want to keep Antony but are struggling to match the 25-year-old’s wage demands. He currently earns £105,000 a week at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils have so far failed in their attempts to shift all of their unwanted high earners, with the exception of new Barcelona loan signing Marcus Rashford.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all surplus to requirements, with Ruben Amorim eager to move them on and reinvest in new signings.",
      "The club have signed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £127.5m but Amorim wants a new centre-forward, and potentially a midfielder and goalkeeper — though the latter is contingent on Andre Onana leaving.",
      "It was reported by Foot Mercato on Monday that Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr — captained by United legend Cristiano Ronaldo — have made an opening offer for Antony.",
      "Meanwhile, a fresh report from Antenados states that Antony has ‘rejected’ offers from Brazilian clubs Sao Paulo and Botafogo.",
      "Indeed, the former Ajax forward has ‘ruled out’ a return to his homeland in the summer transfer window.",
      "It’s confirmed that Antony ‘is not in United’s plans next season’ but Sao Paulo ‘demonstrating interest’ will not sway him, with the Serie A side receiving a ‘negative result’.",
      "It’s added that clubs in the Middle East are interested but there’s no mention of the aforementioned Al Nassr ‘offer’.",
      "Another player who could leave United this summer is Rasmus Hojlund, who is not a part of Amorim’s bomb squad alongside Antony, Sancho, Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Hojlund joined the Premier League giants from Atalanta in the 2023 summer window and has been strongly linked with a return to the Italian Serie A in recent months.",
      "According to Italian outlet Calciomercato, Hojlund’s former Atalanta head coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, is keen on reuniting at AS Roma, who the veteran boss took charge of at the end of 2024/25.",
      "The report claims that Artem Dovbyk’s uncertain future could open the door for the arrival of the 22-year-old Danish international.",
      "Calciomercato states:",
      "In the event of a Dovbyk transfer, Roma would attempt to bring Rasmus Hojlund back to Italy. The 2003-born Danish striker has a contract with Manchester United until June 2028 (plus an option for another season) worth €3 million net per year.",
      "His name had also been linked on the market with other Italian clubs such as Inter (before the explosion of Pio Esposito, the arrival of Bonny from Parma and the negotiations for Lookman from Atalanta), Napoli (before the arrival of Lucca from Udinese), Juventus (as an alternative to Kolo Muani and Darwin Nunez) and Milan (as an alternative to Vlahovic).",
      "Hojlund has only scored 26 goals in 95 matches for United, while Antony has only recorded 17 goal involvements in 96 appearances.",
      "Antony has turned down two offers to move away from Man Utd as he has his heart set on a transfer to Real Betis this summer, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim’s ‘decision’ on Rasmus Hojlund has reportedly sparked his desire to ‘return to his former club’.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr have reportedly made an ‘offer’ to Man Utd for Antony as Cristiano Ronaldo’s team ‘continue to explore Europe’.",
      "Man Utd could use Rasmus Hojlund to ‘compensate’ Juventus if they beat them to Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani, according to reports.",
      "We’ve analysed the Man Utd first-team squad and decided who should be kept, sold, or loaned out before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a final decision on whether to offload Rasmus Hojlund this summer amid two key factors."

      "Manchester United have whittled down their striker shortlist to two: Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko. Tell us who they should they sign…",
      "United have spent around £133million on adding some creativity to their attack but still they lack a top-class centre-forward.",
      "They have been linked with a variety of names through the summer, including Viktor Gyokeres and Dusan Vlahovic, but reports suggest there are only two names on their wishlist.",
      "One is Ollie Watkins. The Aston Villa forward is seen as proven Premier League quality and he is likely to be the cheaper of the two options.",
      "Arsenal were quoted £60million when they enquired over Watkins in January, but United reportedly believe there is a deal to be done at around £45million.",
      "The cheapest price for which they might get Benjamin Sesko out of RB Leipzig is around £60million. That is said to be the agreement between the Bundesliga club and the giant striker if a select few clubs of Sesko’s choosing make a move. United are said to be among them.",
      "Did Sesko get that agreement in writing? Because with Newcastle seemingly eyeing the Slovenian as a possible replacement for Alexander Isak, Leipzig are almost certain to do what they can to get closer to what they feel is their striker’s real value – around £75million.",
      "𝗢𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗘 𝗪𝗔𝗧𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗦 𝘃 𝗕𝗘𝗡𝗝𝗔𝗠𝗜𝗡 𝗦𝗘𝗦𝗞𝗢",
      "Watkins is 30 in December and United reckon he might cost £45million.",
      "Sesko turned 22 in May and will cost at least £60million.",
      "Who should the Red Devils try to sign first? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/pDe14JBjga",
      "— Football365 (@F365) July 29, 2025",
      "Watkins is older but cheaper and proven in the Premier League, while Sesko is pricier with greater longevity and potential. So which striker should United move for?",
      "Of course it might all be irrelevant if United cannot raise the funds for either.",
      "It seems they must sell to buy and though Marcus Rashford is out from under Ruben Amorim’s feet – for this season at least – there are still four members of the ‘bomb squad’ to park elsewhere.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s price continues to fall, with United looking for £15million to £17million. Juventus and, once again, Dortmund are interested, but both would be wise to sit tight and wait for United to get even more desperate.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was seen as the most sellable asset but, again, there is no bidding war. Perhaps there is a way to use Villa’s interest in the winger to grease the wheels of a deal for Watkins but reports suggest Garnacho is content to sit tight until the end of the window when his options could be increased by United’s eagerness to be rid.",
      "The Saudi interest in Antony could do United a huge favour, especially since Real Betis have strung the Red Devils along all summer with seemingly no intention of paying a fee for the Brazilian.",
      "Then there’s Tyrell Malacia, who seems to have disappeared from everyone’s radar.",
      "MORE MAN UTD COVERAGE FROM F365\n🔴 Man Utd ‘confident’ of signing ‘preferred’ striker for one reason despite ‘prohibitive’ factor\n⚪ Man Utd set for €25m Greenwood windfall with big move to Saudi Arabia on the cards\n⚫ Man Utd: ‘Very disrespectful’ INEOS act forced signing to collapse as ‘over the top’ demand surfaces",
      "Man Utd have begun ‘formal talks’ to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig after sending ‘a secret delegation to Germany’, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a ‘deal is on’ for Man Utd to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle this summer.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is “not really worried” about the Red Devils being linked to Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins this summer.",
      "According to reports, there are four reasons behind Alexander Isak ‘doubting Newcastle United’s project’ as they are targeting three ‘top signings’.",
      "Some have scoffed at Man Utd for chasing soon-to-be-30 Ollie Watkins. But they have good form for signing veteran goalscorers…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘exploring’ an ‘innovative solution’ to offload Alejandro Garnacho as they eye three key signings."

      "Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has suggested there are no longer any \"stragglers\" in the squad as a result of Ruben Amorim's tough approach.",
      "The new season provides fresh opportunity for United to avenge what Amorim himself labelled a disaster season as United recorded a record low Premier League finish of 15th, while also suffering defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",
      "Despite the 1-0 defeat in Bilbao, Shaw was quick to defend manager Amorim after the game, explaining that the Portuguese is the right man to lead the club forward. Asked to further explain his comments during United's training camp in Chicago, Shaw doubled down on his stance.",
      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",
      "\"I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",
      "While there were some lows for Shaw both personally and United as a team, Shaw believes the spirit in pre-season should spur them on to lofty ambitions like winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I can't be any worse than it was last season,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Obviously, I didn't have a pre-season last season either, so I think it's really benefiting me to be able to just be fit and train with the team and get minutes.",
      "\"I'm enjoying that. Aims-wise, I think the aim has to be winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I know people will be questioning me for saying that after last season, but it has to be that. It's not just me who thinks that. I'm sure the whole team, if you ask them, they all have the same aims.",
      "\"Even the manager, I'm sure he probably wouldn't say it in the press, but we all have to have the same beliefs and ambitions. Like I said, that real family feeling together, and we all strive for the same thing.\"",
      "Since Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford, he has overseen a period of change to the squad with some understood to be allowed to leave this summer.",
      "Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof left the club upon the expiry of their contracts at the end of June, while Jonny Evans announced his retirement, taking up a role in United's academy.",
      "Marcus Rashford, who was also training away from the main squad after returning from a six-month loan spell at Aston Villa this summer, has secured a loan move to Barcelona, which includes an option to buy for the LaLiga side.",
      "After Rashford's departure, United continue to work on exits for Sancho, Antony and Malacia - as well as Garnacho.",
      "Manchester United are focusing on sales, but work continues behind the scenes around the potential recruitment of a striker.",
      "United have been in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future amid interest in him from Italy.",
      "Work has been done to explore potential deals for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is another player the club have looked at, but Chelsea's valuation of the striker is understood to be considered far too high.",
      "United have approached Villa about Watkins, who they have a long-standing interest in.",
      "However, Villa do not want to sell and he is thought to carry a value of around £60m.",
      "The interest in Sesko is understood to be driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell, who signed the striker as a 16-year-old for Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "Gary Neville has backed Ruben Amorim's overhaul of the Man Utd squad, including the summer signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim is identifying players he does not want in the squad and moving them out. That's a positive,\" Neville told Sky News.",
      "\"The second thing is I do like are the signing of [Mathues] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got Premier League experience.",
      "\"They look more like Manchester United's style of players, with a bit more pace and power, and that physicality to get from box to box.",
      "\"The other thing I like about those two is they've not proved themselves at the highest level in the game so they should be really desperate to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is Old Trafford.",
      "\"That hunger hasn't always been there in the last 10 years with players that have come to the club.",
      "\"The two signings are good signings yet there's a couple more needed. I think they need a goalkeeper. They need to sign a forward.",
      "\"They have to have a better season than last year. It can't get any worse really.\"",

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",

      "Man Utd's Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan; the deal gives Barca the option to buy the England international,  27, at the end of the season; the forward's Man Utd career has appeared over since a public fallout with manager Ruben Amorim last winter",
      "Thursday 24 July 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as \"a club where dreams come true\".",
      "Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford said at his unveiling. \"It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here.",
      "\"It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.\"",
      "A Barcelona statement said: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until 30 June 2026. The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.",
      "\"The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta; the director of the Football Area, and other Board members.\"",
      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",
      "The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.",
      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",
      "It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.",
      "The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.",
      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.",
      "\"This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",
      "Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.",
      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",
      "\"I've nothing bad to say,\" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.",
      "The only slight hiccup Rashford made all day was timekeeping. He arrived 15 minutes late for the contract signing ceremony, but no one seemed to mind.",
      "The first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker posed near an old English telephone box as part of his official club video.",
      "Apt.",
      "Because at his media unveiling, Marcus Rashford rang the right tone and kept everyone engaged. He may well have found his calling.",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
