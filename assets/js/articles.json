      "Simon Jordan has slammed both Manchester United and Marcus Rashford after the England striker sealed his move to Barcelona.",
      "Rashford, 27, has joined the Blaugrana on a season-long loan deal - with Barca holding an option to turn it permanent for £26million. He was unveiled on Wednesday at Camp Nou, where Rashford declared: “I feel at home here – it's where dreams come true.”",
      "Certainly, his time at United under Ruben Amorim was far from a dream, with Rashford jettisoned from the first-team squad, dumped on loan to Aston Villa in the second half of last season and then made a part of the club's 'Bomb Squad' this summer, when the Portuguese made clear he wanted him nowhere near his first-team squad in the upcoming season.",
      "Now, former Crystal Palace owner Jordan has pointed the finger at both the club and Rashford for how his time at United has disintegrated to such an extent that getting him out of the club on loan without recouping any kind of up front transfer fee - they will save £12m in terms of salary - is seen in some quarters as a win.",
      "\"We should lament the loss of a significant talent,\" said Jordan, speaking on talkSPORT, when asked about Rashford's switch. \"I don't think he was ever at the level he was built up to be but we should lament the loss of the culture of Man United for a player to lose his way.",
      "\"Do you remember after the European Championships he hadn't been fit a lot of the season, was in the European Championships squad... came into that. After the European Championships, the club allowed him to go on holiday for two weeks and then have a shoulder surgery. Hang on... Get your priorities right!",
      "\"I think you have to lay the responsibility on the opportunities that have not been taken by the player at his own door, but if you don't create the culture for these young men to respect and value the opportunities that they've got, they can then get distracted by outside influences.\"",
      "While Jordan made clear his displeasure with how the Old Trafford hierarchy has handled Rashford in recent years, he also insists the player must bear responsibility for how his career at United has unravelled also.",
      "Jordan continued: \"Of course [it is Rashford's responsibility], but we know there are very few leaders in football. There are more often people who are followers.",
      "\"You lose them [followers], there's distractions and outside influences. They get more distracted in their social life. They make their decision for their birthdays. They make the decision to not turn up for training and go out on the whiz in Northern Ireland - and things of that nature.",
      "\"These are things that are clearly being tolerated by a culture. Alongside that you've then got the distractions, the affluence and the wealth footballers have.",
      "\"You've got a culture of not being able to tell people the truth because if you do, they can't cope with it - it's only good news they can hear so they don't build resilience and leadership.\"",
      "Damningly, Jordan finished: \"I think he'll be successful at Barcelona because the clear thing for Marcus Rashford is to get away from Manchester United. That's for Man United's sake and Marcus Rashford's sake - and we should lament that because he's a good player.\"",
      "Speaking at the Nou Camp after his unveiling, Rashford said: “I'm very excited. It's a club where people's dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the clubs stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "“It feels like I'm at home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here, because it's a family club, people are comfortable here and it's a good place for players to showcase their skills. I want to say thank you for the warm welcome. It's a different environment for me but it feels like home.",
      "“I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and help this club win. They won so much last year and I can see the ambition is to do better than last year and that is what you want to hear as a player. It keeps you improving year on year and that's what you need to be - the best version of yourself. So I'm very excited to be here, eager to get the games going and I'm enjoying every minute of it.",
      "“I always try to make decisive actions - fast, dynamic plays and I always like good football, so I have always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans. It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it.”",

      "And then, he was gone. After so long on the outside, so much conjecture, being brutally and unequivocally dumped by Ruben Amorim, Marcus Rashford is gone from Manchester United and has his dream move to Barcelona.",
      "Rashford was announced and officially unveiled by the Spanish giants on Wednesday, his loan move - with a £26m transfer option - having been ratified and the England star having trained with his new team-mates. His exit offers United some much-needed financial breathing room after completing the £70m signing of Bryan Mbeumo on Monday night.",
      "Arsenal are set to land their new No.9 at last, with Mikel Arteta taking their summer spend close to the £200m mark with the arrival of Viktor Gyokeres now imminennt.",
      "As Arsenal head toward £200m, Liverpool have hit the £300m mark, with Hugo Ekitike's switch now signed, sealed and delivered. What does that mean for Newcastle and Alexander Isak, we'll have to wait and see.",
      "Elsewhere, Chelsea are moving for two more of Europe's bright young talents, while Brighton are busy, with Pervis Estupinan the latest player to depart.",
      "“Jorrel Hato looks like a very attractive prospect and fits the profile. He's 19 years old, he's physically very good, he's comfortable on the ball, he can play left back, centre back. I think even in the number six position in the midfield, he would make a lot of sense.",
      "“Now, whether it would make sense to join Chelsea from his point of view, in terms of how many opportunities he would get, that remains to be seen. But it's somebody to keep an eye on for sure.”",
      "Simon Jordan has slammed both Manchester United and Marcus Rashford after the England striker sealed his move to Barcelona.",
      "And when we say slammed, he's really let rip!",
      "Speaking at the Nou Camp after his unveiling, Rashford said:",
      "“I'm very excited. It's a club where people's dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the clubs stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "“It feels like I'm at home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here, because it's a family club, people are comfortable here and it's a good place for players to showcase their skills.

      "Arsenal have been credited with interest in Ajax defender Jorrel Hato and RB Leipzig midfielder Xavi Simons this summer – but now Chelsea could scoop them both up.",
      "Hato, a 19-year-old centre-back, has been linked with Liverpool as well, having caught the eye of many scouts with his play. Arsenal have moved ahead with Mosquera instead, so may be out of the race for him.",
      "But Simons, an attack-minded midfielder, could fit the brief for the Gunners. However, Chelsea have already approached the Netherlands international to agree terms and are now in pole position for him.",
      "The Son Heung-min to LAFC stories have reared their head again.",
      "Latest from the US is that the American side are really pushing 'hard' to get the Tottenham skipper before the summer transfer window is closed.",
      "Any deal won't happen until Spurs have been to Asia as part of their pre-season tour.",
      "After that.... we'll see.",
      "Arsenal are close to announcing the signing of Gyokeres after prolonged negotiations with Sporting. The Gunners had initially appeared to prefer Benjamin Sesko, in part due to his younger age.",
      "The fact they have decided on 27-year-old Gyokeres is interesting, because it goes against Arteta’s own philosophy in the transfer market. Usually, they avoid signing players who are over the age of 25, believing younger players have a higher ceiling and will retain their value better.",
      "However, Gyokeres isn’t the first player for which Arsenal have broken that rule this summer, with the arrivals of Arrizabalaga and Norgaard also contradicting their philosophy.",
      "Roberto Firmino has completed his transfer from Saudi side Al-Ahli to Al Sadd in Qatar.",
      "The former Liverpool and Brazil forward has signed a deal with the Qatari club until 2027.",
      "During his time with Al-Ahli, the Brazilian forward played 65 matches across all competitions, scoring 21 goals and providing 17 assists - winning the AFC Champions League.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim led from the front when the squad arrived at their Chicago hotel to begin their pre-season tour.",
      "United boss Amorim was one of the first off the team bus when it pulled up at the plush Waldorf Astoria hotel, only pausing to high-five members of security staff as he made his way in.",
      "But leading from the front on the pitch is continuing to prove problematic for Amorim, whose summer search for a striker to solve United's goalscoring crisis has so far drawn a blank. A meagre haul of 44 goals in the Premier League last season, as United finished 15th, their worst placing for 51 years, should have made recruiting a striker their priority in the summer window.",

      "The £79m man will wear the no.54 shirt for his new club - but only until August 1.",
      "Hugo Ekitike is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong today and has been given the temporary squad number.",

      "Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona on loan with a dig at Manchester United by saying: “I feel at home here – it's where dreams come true.” Rashford secured the move after falling out with United boss Ruben Amorim, who exiled him last season and decided he was not part of his future plans.",

      "Rashford, who hopes the move will see him make England's World Cup squad for next year's tournament in the US, revealed the role Barca coach Hansi Flick played in making the move happen. “Another key factor of the reason that I'm here is the conversations I had with him,” said Rashford.",
      "“They were very positive. Last year and throughout his career he's proved he's one of the top coaches and to lead such a young team to a very successful season and coming back to still want to do more - it showed me everything that I thought I knew about the club.",
      "“Now, to be here, it's everything I wished and thought. I'm eager to get going and learn the Barcelona way and be ready for the games.”",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, where he scored four goals before injury ended his campaign early. The 27-year-old was dropped by Amorim for the derby against Manchester City last December and never played for United again.",
      "Despite offloading Rashford, United are braced to start the new season without a new striker leading their attack. A striker was the priority in this summer's transfer window, after United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "But the only two arrivals so far have been £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for £71m, neither of whom are a No.9. United have seen their top striker targets go elsewhere this summer – Liam Delap joined Chelsea, Viktor Gyokeres is closing in on a move to Arsenal, while Hugo Ekitike is Liverpool-bound.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim fears there is every chance United will start their Premier League opener at home to Arsenal on August 17 without a new striker. A swap deal involving winger Alejandro Garnacho – left out of the US tour squad after asking to leave – and Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, both valued at £40m, is an option.",
      "Garnacho wants to stay in the Premier League, with Chelsea his first-choice club, although there is a reluctance at United to sell him to a domestic rival in a move that could ultimately backfire. Jackson has been pushed down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge following the arrival of Delap from Ipswich and Joao Pedro from Brighton, both of whom are ahead of him in terms of selection.",

      "Barcelona have announced that Marcus Rashford has been given the No.14 shirt after joining on loan from Manchester United. Rashford, 27, will spend the 2025-26 season with Barca, who have the option buy him for £26million next summer.",
      "The England international will wear 14 on his back while playing under Hansi Flick, aiming to break into a side who won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Supercopa de Espanda last season. The number was last worn by Pablo Torre, who recently completed a permanent move to Mallorca.",
      "Thierry Henry also wore 14 during his time at Barcelona and it's a number associated with Johan Cruyff, although he didn't wear it for Barca. Rashford has previously compared his style of play to Henry, who was part of Pep Guardiola's treble-winning team in 2009.",
      "While on holiday in Marbella last month, the United loanee told Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer: \"I see myself reflected in Henry. He's comfortable playing on the left and also in the middle. He's a free player.",
      "\"As I've developed, the number 9 position has become more comfortable, more natural. Things like playing with my back to goal are becoming easier for me. You're always in front of goal and always dangerous.\"",
      "Rashford's move was announced on Wednesday after signing his contract at Barcelona's offices. Shirts with 'Rashford 14' were displayed behind him.",
      "Barca said in a statement: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of Marcus Rashford until June 30, 2026. The agreement also includes an option to buy the English striker.\"",
      "United, meanwhile, wished the 27-year-old well as they confirmed his departure. \"Everyone at Manchester United wishes Marcus good luck for the season.\"",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Rashford made it clear that he was keen to join Barcelona in the aforementioned interview. The forward was asked if he wanted to play alongside Barca wonderkid Lamine Yamal in the future.",
      "\"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best,\" he replied. \"So hopefully, we'll see.\"",
      "Rashford was part of a five-man 'bomb squad' at United after Ruben Amorim made it clear that he, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were all not part of his plans. The quintet were left out of Amorim's 32-man squad who flew to the USA for their pre-season tour on Tuesday.",

      "Barcelona have wrapped up the loan signing of Marcus Rashford, giving the England star an escape from Manchester United after being frozen out by manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Rashford has not played for United since December 2024 after a row with Amorim over his training performances and he was later sent on loan to Aston Villa, where he showed glimpses of his ability before suffering a season-ending injury.",
      "But now the 27-year-old has a chance to impress on the biggest stage and compete for a starting spot with the likes of Lamine Yamal and Raphinha under new boss Hansi Flick. Barcelona will cover Rashford's wages for the duration of his spell, though the player will take a pay cut on his usual salary of £325,000-a-week.",
      "The club have a £26million option to buy next summer and there is huge anticipation to see how Rashford gets on alongside a star-studded squad that will be competing on multiple fronts for silverware. Rashford is said to have emerged as Barcelona's \"priority target\" after Nico Williams decided to sign a 10-year deal with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Barcelona won La Liga in Flick's first season but now want to push on and become a force in Europe, with Rashford the club's third major signing this summer after goalkeeper Joan Garcia and Copenhagen forward Roony Bardghji. Rashford's first goal at the Nou Camp will be to break into the first team, knowing it will be hard to displace either Yamal or Raphinha on the wings.",
      "Yamal is considered one of the best players in world football right now, with the teenager scoring 18 and assisting 16 in all competitions last season. Brazilian star Raphinha, meanwhile, had an even better campaign as he scored 34 times and assisted 17.",
      "Barcelona fans do appear to be excited by Rashford's arrival on loan after creating a mural for him pictured in the club's colours, while much of the reaction to his signing has been positive. Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo report that he'll wear the No.14 shirt, last worn by Pablo Torre, who recently joined Mallorca.",
      "Rashford arrives with some pedigree, having won five trophies during his time at United and scoring 138 goals in 426 appearances. He has also notched 17 goals in 62 caps for England.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "The Red Devils could also do a swap deal involving winger Alejandro Garnacho – left out of the US tour squad after asking to leave – and Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, both valued at £40m.",
      "Garnacho wants to stay in the Premier League, with Chelsea his first-choice club, although there is a reluctance at United to sell him to a domestic rival in a move that could ultimately backfire.",
      "Jackson has been pushed down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge following the arrival of Delap from Ipswich and Joao Pedro from Brighton, both of whom are ahead of him in terms of selection.",
      "United are focusing their transfer business this summer on players with proven Premier League experience who do not require a settling in period but who can hit the ground running.",
      "That approach has been underlined by their successful moves for Cunha and Mbeumo, with Jackson a viable option that would solve two problems - recruiting a new striker and offloading Garnacho.",

It is set to be a similar story on Thursday, with the heatwave continuing, as United's players train at Soldier Field, home of NFL side Chicago Bears.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim led from the front when the squad arrived at their Chicago hotel to begin their pre-season tour. United boss Amorim was one of the first off the team bus when it pulled up at the plush Waldorf Astoria hotel, only pausing to high-five members of security staff as he made his way in.",
      "But leading from the front on the pitch is continuing to prove problematic for Amorim, whose summer search for a striker to solve United's goalscoring crisis has so far drawn a blank. A meagre haul of 44 goals in the Premier League last season, as United finished 15th, their worst placing for 51 years, should have made recruiting a striker their priority in the summer window.",
      "But with 24 days until their opening fixture of the new season, at home to Arsenal, United are still grubbing around for a new No.9 to lead their line, after seeing a host of targets choose other clubs. Liam Delap joined Chelsea from Ipswich, while Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike are closing in on moves to Arsenal and Liverpool respectively.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo may have scored 15 and 20 goals respectively in the Premier League last season, more than United duo Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee. But those impressive numbers from Cunha and Mbeumo do not negate the need for United to recruit a prolific striker capable of scoring 20-plus goals a season on a consistent basis.",
      "The last United player to score more than 20 Premier League goals in a season was Robin van Persie, who led the club to their last league title under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012-13. But finding the back of the net remains an issue for United, as evidenced by the way they toiled in Saturday's first pre-season encounter with Leeds in Stockholm, which ended goalless.",
      "United retain an interest in Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani, who was on their radar two years ago, before they eventually paid £72million - way over his true market value - for Hojlund. A swap deal involving winger Alejandro Garnacho – left out of the US tour squad after asking to leave – and Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, both valued around £40m, is another option.",
      "Which striker should Manchester United sign? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "Jackson has been pushed down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge following the arrival of Delap from Ipswich and Joao Pedro from Brighton. Three of United's league games in September have been moved for TV, with the derby against Manchester City switched to September 14 at 4:30pm.",
      "The following weekend, United's visit to Chelsea will still be played on September 20, but has been pushed back to 5.30pm for TV. United's trip to Brentford – and new signing Mbeumo's first return to his former club – will kick off at 12.30pm on September 27.",

The mercury could pass 30 degrees in the Windy City, but the humidity will make it feel much hotter and create stifling conditions for the players.",

      "Several promising youngsters have also been named, including the unexpected addition of Williams. The 19-year-old isn't the most celebrated or well-known academy graduate. He spent the latter half of last season on loan at Cheltenham Town in League Two, where he scored two goals and provided two assists in 17 games.",

      "Belgian clubs Club Brugge and Anderlecht had also shown interest, preferring permanent deals. However, it seems Amorim has now changed his mind on the young talent.",

Malacia has not played for United since January and spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV.",

      "Casemiro admitted that Rodrygo can become one of the very best players in the world with Liverpool advancing in talks with the Real Madrid star's camp. The Manchester United midfielder was team-mates with the winger in Spain for three years and was certainly best positioned to analyse the heights he believed his compatriot could reach.",
      "The 24-year-old has established himself as a vital player for the Spanish giants in recent years but suffered a decrease in importance last season under Carlo Ancelotti due to the signing of Kylian Mbappe.",
      "He started just 22 league games, while getting only 92 minutes of action during Madrid's run in the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this month. His lack of game-time has led to uncertainty over his future, with Arsenal and Liverpool reportedly interested in the forward.",
      "It was earlier this year that Casemiro - who spent nine years with Madrid - showered praise on Mbappe and his former team-mates, including Rodrygo. Speaking to Diario AS, the Brazilian insisted that while the Frenchman has the ability to be the world's best, it's a label in football that the 24-year-old is also capable of.",
      "\"He [Mbappe] is one of those players that when you play against them you don't know how to stop him. He's not [on top of] the podium yet, but he'll get there,\" Casemiro said.",
      "\"He's the heir to [Messi and Ronaldo], along with Vinicius Jr, who continues to grow and improve in every game, Rodrygo, and Fede Valverde.\" It wasn't the first time he sang the praises of the winger as he said in 2022: \"He lit up my eyes.",
      "\"He's a star. God gave him the gift of playing football. Rodrygo knows when to attack, when to defend, when to be more aggressive, when to play more vertically. This kid is one of the most complete players of his generation.\"",
      "With speculation suggested Luis Diaz is ready to depart Anfield with Bayern Munich interested in the Colombian, reports indicate that the Reds are ready to pounce on Rodrygo with talks commencing with his entourage, according to Foot Mercato.",
      "They claim discussions have begun between the Premier League champions' hierarchy and Rodrygo's camp in order to seek out the possibility of a transfer after six years in Spain. While no contact has been directly made with Madrid, the winger's preferred destination is said to be England.",
      "The Gunners are also said to be interested in pursuing Rodrygo despite signing one wide player already in Noni Madueke. A third Premier League have reportedly joined the race, with Tottenham Hotspur aiming to lure the Brazilian to north London.",

      "Former Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has taken aim at Sir Jim Ratcliffe, claiming he \"doesn't have much experience in football\" and insisting \"a lot needs to change\" at Old Trafford.",

      "The 'Special One' did win two major trophies at United and also finished second in 2017-18 and suggests Ratcliffe's lack of footballing experience might hinder the club - in a subtle jab at the billionaire and the United hierarchy.",
      "Speaking to Portuguese outlet Record, he said: \"Today, I think that with the change in ownership at the club, with an owner who doesn't have much experience in football but rather in sport...",
      "\"What happened to Ruben, from being the manager of the worst Manchester United in Premier League history to having continuity and confidence to continue and be Ruben Amorim, is a sign that a lot needs to change.\"",
      "However, Mourinho believes current boss Amorim has \"incredible potential\" to be a success at Old Trafford and urged the club to keep backing him - and to allow him to do his work as he sees fit.",
      "\"With that stability... We all agree that he's a manager with great potential and personality. I think he has incredible potential to do great work.\"",
      "Mourinho is now at Turkish club Fenerbahce, where he is hoping to win his first major since joining them last summer as he approaches his second season.",
      "Since leaving United, Mourinho had an unsuccessful spell at Tottenham, where he was sacked just days before the 2021 Carabao Cup final against Manchester City. He later won the UEFA Conference League with Roma before also being sacked by the Italian side last year.",

      "Manchester United’s desperation to get Marcus Rashford off their wage bill has seen them dramatically drop their valuation of the striker. Rashford is poised to join Barcelona on a season-long loan with an option to buy after being frozen out by Ruben Amorim at United.",
      "Amorim’s relationship with Rashford broke down in December when he was ejected from the United first-team squad. He was then sent out on loan to Aston Villa in January, and having resurrected his career with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances, Rashford set his sights on Barca.",
      "The 27-year-old rejected a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia and has been waiting patiently for Barca and United to come to terms over a move. That has now happened and Rashford flew into the city earlier this week to complete the final stages of his move.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to take Rashford on loan for the 2025/26 season with an option to make it permanent. Barca will pay the entirety of his wages after Rashford agreed to take a 15 per cent pay cut from his £325,000-a-week wages. They can also sign him for €30million (£26m).",
      "Earlier this summer, United made it clear that they would happily sell Rashford to whichever club would stump up £40m. His contract with the club runs until June 2028, so their asking price wasn’t outrageous, especially considering they believed he was worth £100m in April 2024 when Paris Saint-Germain were sniffing around.",
      "United’s rapidly sliding scale around Rashford just demonstrates the sourness around the forward since Amorim made up his mind. The England striker has been part of Amorim’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ over the past few weeks, forced to train separately from the first team at Carrington.",
      "Rashford and fellow unwanted players Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia have been arriving at the training ground post-5pm, when everyone else has already left. It is a brutal policy that doesn’t have universal support inside the building but is designed to speed up their exits.",
      "It may have played a part in securing Rashford’s exit, while Sancho is also poised to leave for Juventus. But what is more likely to have done the trick is United’s desperation to offload their high-earning players who Amorim had made clear have no future at the club.",
      "Rashford was not Barcelona’s first choice this summer. The Catalan giants had tried to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club, but the move fell through. They also showed an interest in Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, but were put off by the Reds’ transfer stance.",
      "“I don’t want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players,” manager Hansi Flick said earlier in the summer. “I like them and we’ll see what happens.”",
      "Rashford will not be a guaranteed starter, either. He can play on the left of Barca’s 4-3-3 formation, but will be aware that Raphinha has just enjoyed an incredible campaign in that position, while he will be a mere back-up to Robert Lewandowski at centre-forward.",

      "Manchester United’s new signing Bryan Mbeumo already has his sights set on emulating his boyhood hero Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Mbeumo, who has joined United from Brentford in a deal worth up to £71million, revealed the first football shirt he owned growing up was Ronaldo’s iconic No.7. The Cameroon star, who plays out wide like Ronaldo but can also operate centrally, was just four when his idol joined United for the first of two spells in 2003.",
      "In that six-year spell, Ronaldo scored 118 goals in 292 appearances, before returning for an ill-fated second stint at United, which ended in acrimony after a season-and-a-half. Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals for Brentford last season, modelled himself on Ronaldo and said he dreams of matching the exploits of his hero now he is a United player himself.",
      "“My first top was one with Ronaldo behind [on the back],” said Mbeumo, when asked to name his favourite player. “It changed the time. When I was really young, the two best footballers were Ronaldo and Messi. When I was growing up, Neymar. After that, it was Eden Hazard.",
      "“My dream was to become a football player and play for one of the biggest teams in the world. But when you’re actually doing it, it’s completely different.”",
      "On the pitch, Mbeumo is an uncompromising, fearless and physical attacker, who shows no mercy to opponents in his relentless quest for goals and assists. Off it, however, he is a completely different character, with the piano and chess his chief hobbies away from the pressure of playing football at the highest level.",
      "Asked if he was quiet or loud, Mbeumo said: “A little mix of the two. I’m quite quiet when I don’t know people. But when I know everyone I make jokes and have banter. I like piano and chess. I’m just a normal guy. I discovered the piano a few years ago, when a friend was playing and I wanted to try.",
      "“With chess, I played a little bit when I was younger. Two or three years ago, I started playing and I enjoyed it, so I play online. I have a board at home but I have no-one to play with.”",
      "Part of the initiation ritual for new signings at United is to perform a song in front of the squad, with Mbeumo hinting he could go one stage further. “Maybe I can play the piano and sing!” he said. “I know I’m a calmed and chilled guy out of the pitch, but on it I change completely. I’m really determined and focused.",
      "“It comes from my parents. They gave me my values. Also, all the coaches I’ve worked with gave me a lot of advice. It’s like a family and all the things you face in your personal life helps build your mentality and character.",
      "“I grew up in a small town, where everyone knew each other and I have a lot of memories from the stadium of my first team. I try to go back there at least once a year to see my old manager and the little kids, who have a dream as well, like I had. It’s really good for them to see someone who is here now. They can see that they can do it and that’s important for me.”",
      "Piano-loving Mbeumo will hope to hit the right notes for United and help spark their revival after they ended last season in 15th place, their worst finish of the Premier League era.",

      "The opening fixture against Arsenal at Old Trafford will evoke memories for many United fans of the sun-kissed 4-1 thrashing of the champions in 1989. United invested strikingly that summer, too, yet lost three of their first five matches.",
      "After Arsenal visit, United are at Manchester City and host Chelsea in September. David Moyes complained that the fixture computer had pitted United against Chelsea, Liverpool and City in his first five fixtures. That defeatist attitude was one of innumerable reasons why he was always ill-suited to United.",
      "Amorim’s first full season begins similarly (Liverpool are also lurking around the corner in October). United were actually unbeaten in three games with City last season, two of their best performances were against Arsenal and they narrowly lost at Chelsea five days before the Europa League final.",
      "United will not look markedly different when they line-up against Arsenal. The best-case scenario is there will be three new starting signings: Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and a new striker. The sight of his former Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres with a cannon stitched to his shirt rather than a devil may cause Amorim to drop to his haunches sooner than usual.",
      "Gyokeres was never a realistic target. The top-tier strikers on the market want to stay or play in the Champions League. United do not have the clout or wherewithal to move for Gyokeres or Alexander Isak. There was concrete competition for Cunha and Mbeumo but United were never going to be a tough sell for players at Wolves and Brentford.",

      "Jason Wilcox, United’s director of football, has overseen a shift to focus on Premier League recruits after United bought only one senior player from a Premier League club in nearly six years. At the time of writing, Ollie Watkins and Jean-Philippe Mateta are realistic options who would fit the bill up front: two centre forwards in their late 20s whose value is bound to dwindle after this summer.",
      "Unai Emery’s curious handling of Watkins when Marcus Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa piqued the striker. Mateta caused United plenty of grief at Selhurst Park and Old Trafford in two memorable Palace victories.",
      "Watkins has never broken the 20-goal barrier for Villa, though. Mateta hasn’t for Crystal Palace, either. It would be a stretch to bill either as 'proven'. They would still have a worthy support cast of Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad, Bruno Fernandes et al. and represent an upgrade on Hojlund.",
      "After successive seasons where they recorded a minus goal difference and their worst campaign in 51 years, United need a frontman they can get behind. That extends to the players, too. Plenty have always been unconvinced by Hojlund, a signing destined to fail through his exorbitant £72million fee and ties to Erik ten Hag’s agent, Kees Vos.",
      "Between the sticks is a goalkeeper lacking confidence from supporters. Andre Onana is set to continue as No.1 by default as United have focused their investments at the top end of the pitch.",
      "Onana is at least shielded by a quintet of centre backs with a promising blend of youth and experience. United signed a centre half in seven of the past nine summer transfer windows. They will not be acquiring one this summer and what has been one of their weakest areas of the squad in recent years is now one of their strongest.",
      "Leny Yoro has found his feet, Harry Maguire has become a captain without the armband, Ayden Heaven has been a revelation and Matthijs de Ligt looked to have got to grips with the Premier League before injury. Lisandro Martinez - when he has recovered from injury - could be more influential in Amorim’s back three than he was for Ten Hag.",
      "There is a potential midfield minefield, though. Bruno Fernandes seems likely to be permanently relocated to a deeper role and you could play him in goal and he would still be the most influential player in the United side.",
      "But beyond him there are glaring issues. Manuel Ugarte’s form towards the end of last season was so poor he was benched for the Europa League final. Casemiro’s good form was reserved almost exclusively for the Europa League, so he could become redundant with no European football. Kobbie Mainoo has been primarily recognised by Ruben Amorim as a playmaker and Toby Collyer has started three games in his career against teams from League 1, Scotland and Romania.",
      "United would like to strengthen in midfield but the issue is the unshiftable Casemiro. Sources say four different figures were given mandates to sell him yet he seems certain to see out the final year of his United contract.",
      "Casemiro is valued at £15million and, realistically, no club is forking out that fee for a 33-year-old who will be free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement in January. Casemiro has regained his place in the Brazil squad after an 18-month exile but it helps matters that his former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti is in charge.",
      "United have valuable assets in midfield in Fernandes and Mainoo but the former rejected the opportunity to move to Saudi Arabia. The concern would be that United could cash in on Mainoo if a late bid comes in and frees up funds.",
      "There would be parallels with Scott McTominay, only this time last year Fulham’s interest in McTominay and United’s interest in Ugarte were well documented. McTominay was a sellable asset and always seemed likely to leave.",
      "Mainoo’s future is uncertain but there has not been a lot of noise around him so far this summer. His contract has a maximum expiry date of 2028 but he rejected United’s initial proposal of a renewal at the start of the year and it has been quiet on that front.",
      "Realistically, United could get through a lighter season with the aforementioned midfield quintet. A new midfielder should be at the top of the shopping list in 12 months.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon are imperfect options on the left wing but there are senior auxiliary alternatives. Mbeumo has to operate on the right-hand side, a problem position that United have struggled to solve for upwards of a decade. Mbeumo represents the best of both worlds in that he is adept at attacking and defending but United have to play to his strengths after a 20-goal season.",
      "Senior figures at United are targeting a top six finish. That is not pie-in-the-sky stuff when recent history shows clubs have shot up the table without European commitments. Newcastle United nabbed Champions League qualification in 2023 and 2025. Liverpool nearly won the league in 2014. Leicester City did win the league in 2016. So did Chelsea a year later.",
      "The exception is United. The last time they were out of Europe, they scraped fourth under Louis van Gaal in 2014-15, winning one of their final six fixtures. Van Gaal’s tenure got off to a startling start with defeat to Swansea City.",
      "He was never one to play on the front foot, though.",

      "Manchester United are prohibited from signing a midfielder due to the continued presence of the high-earning Casemiro.",
      "Well-placed sources say four intermediaries had a mandate to try and sell Casemiro, who has entered the last year of his United contract and earns around £300,000-a-week.",
      "United would require a fee of £15million to avoid a loss on Casemiro under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules but an offer is unlikely to be forthcoming.",
      "Casemiro, 33, shone during United's Europa League knockout ties but the club were seeking buyers for the Brazilian in the winter transfer window when he went a month without playing.",
      "United want to reinforce their central midfield but Casemiro is one of five existing options. The club would have to generate significant funds or shift a high earner to have the leverage to bolster the area.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is set to be relocated to central midfield permanently and United committed to spending £50million on Manuel Ugarte last August. Kobbie Mainoo has been used as a playmaker by head coach Ruben Amorim while Toby Collyer has only started three games in his professional career.",
      "Mainoo rejected United's initial proposal of a new contract at the start of the calendar year and Ugarte's form in last season's run-in was so poor he was benched for the Europa League final at the expense of Casemiro.",
      "United released Christian Eriksen last month and have prioritised sharpening their attack with the £133.5m outlay on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with a centre forward also wanted.",
      "The club have scoured goalkeeping options but Andre Onana's recent injury has complicated matters in that area. United are not actively looking to sell Onana, either.",
      "Casemiro joined United from Real Madrid in August 2022 for £60m rising to £70m. After a superb first season, his influence waned considerably until he returned to the starting XI for the Europa League round-of-16 tie with Real Sociedad in March.",
      "Amorim admitted after the second leg with Sociedad that \"I’m improving the way I use a player like Casemiro\". The Brazil international returned to the national team squad last month after an 18-month exile.",

      "Manchester United signing Bryan Mbeumo chose a Cristiano Ronaldo shirt for his first kit when he was a child.",
      "United officially announced the signing of Mbeumo from Brentford for £65million plus £6m in add-ons on Monday night. Mbeumo visited Carrington to undergo his medical last weekend and the forward has signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year, at Old Trafford.",
      "The club said Mbeumo made it clear from the outset his desire to join the club and never budged from that position, despite interest from Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle this summer.",
      "When his transfer was announced, Mbeumo described United as the club of his dreams and he also revealed that his first shirt as a child had Ronaldo's name printed on the back.",
      "The Cameroon international is 25 years old, meaning he grew up watching Ronaldo in his prime.",
      "The five-time Ballon d'Or winner left United in dramatic circumstances in November 2022, but Ronaldo's first stint in Manchester was hugely successful and he inspired Mbeumo when he was younger.",
      "“My first top was one with Ronaldo behind [on the back],” said Mbeumo during an interview with club media. “It changed the time. When I was really young, the two best footballers were Ronaldo and Messi. When I was growing up, Neymar. After that, it was Eden Hazard.",
      "“My dream was to become a football player and play for one of the biggest teams in the world. But when you’re actually doing it, it’s completely different.”",
      "Asked if he was quiet or loud, Mbeumo added: “A little mix of the two. I’m quite quiet when I don’t know people. But when I know everyone I make jokes and have banter. I like piano and chess. I’m just a normal guy. I discovered the piano a few years ago, when a friend was playing and I wanted to try.",
      "“With chess, I played a little bit when I was younger. Two or three years ago, I started playing and I enjoyed it, so I play online. I have a board at home but I have no-one to play with.”",
      "Mbeumo was asked about his initiation in front of the squad and said: “Maybe I can play the piano and sing! I know I’m a calm and chilled guy on the pitch, but on it I change completely. I’m really determined and focused.",
      "“It comes from my parents. They gave me my values. Also, all the coaches I’ve worked with gave me a lot of advice. It’s like a family and all the things you face in your personal life helps build your mentality and character.",
      "“I grew up in a small town, where everyone knew each other and I have a lot of memories from the stadium of my first team. I try to go back there at least once a year to see my old manager and the little kids, who have a dream as well, like I had.",
      "\"It’s really good for them to see someone who is here now. They can see that they can do it and that’s important for me.”",

      "United head coach Ruben Amorim refused to consider Rashford for selection again after the forward blanked him following his substitution in the 2-1 Europa League win at Viktoria Plzen on December 12. Rashford and teammates Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were also instructed not to be on the premises at the same time as the United first team at their Carrington training complex this month.",
      "Rashford, 27, wanted to join Barcelona in January but had to settle for a temporary move to Aston Villa, where he scored four goals in 17 games. Barca have long admired Rashford, whose 20-year association with United has effectively ended.",
      "Rashford nevertheless wished his boyhood club well. \"The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while,\" he said at his presentation. \"So I don't have anything bad to say about Manchester United. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to play for them.",

      "Rashford admitted he has restored \"discipline\" to his life after two turbulent years. Rashford was rebuked by former United manager Erik ten Hag for attending a birthday party hours after the 3-0 home defeat to Manchester City in October 2023 and he was dropped for the FA Cup fourth round tie away to Newport County days after embarking on a boozy bender in Belfast.",
      "The England international has trained rigorously over the summer and Rashford enthused he is \"in a good place. I'm happy, I'm healthy and I'm eager to get going.",
      "\"It's one thing to say you're motivated and determined but these are things that can change day to day depending on how you're feeling. The thing I bring back to my life, not just the sport, is discipline. I'm happy to be here and to enjoy this club. It's a different country, with different clubs, and I'm ready for this new experience.\"",

      "\"He was at the match between Leipzig and Wolfsburg to scout Šeško again. The striker is still very, very young. He can leave with a good offer; I think Leipzig are willing to talk if they receive a fee closer to €70m [£60.6m]...\"",

      "Manchester United need a striker. After boasting their goal count with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored a combined 35 Premier League goals last term, more firepower in attack is a must.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men were woeful in front of goal last season. Alongside their worst campaign in 51 years, United ended the season on -10 goal difference with just 44 league goals scored. Only the three relegated teams and Everton scored fewer.",
      "That issue has somewhat been covered with Mbeumo and Cunha. While fears of the 'Manchester United curse' creeping in to prevent them from producing similar numbers from last term, they significantly improve Amorim's options in the final third.",
      "Just as the start of the window, United are in the market for a new striker, a new face to lead the line with an obsession at scoring goals. Liam Delap was targeted, went to Chelsea. Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen were also on their radar but the pair are close to moves to Arsenal and Galatasaray respectively.",
      "With three weeks until another Premier League season gets underway, United are facing a race against time to get their hands on a new centre-forward. Ollie Watkins, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Benjamin Sesko are three candidates but none appear to be the outstanding option for United's decision-makers.",
      "RB Leipzig's estimated valuation of Sesko surpassing the £75million mark means that move is difficult. Watkins, who has been tipped to leave Aston Villa for some time, is said to be available at £60m and comes with Premier League experience.",
      "But what do the numbers say? When analysing each player's numbers for the 2024/25 season [via FBREF], Watkins appears to be the better option. The England international played six more games for Villa across all competitions but Sesko clocked up more minutes (3,761 compared to 3,682).",
      "Of course, Sesko scored more goals than Watkins, albeit against Bundesliga teams compared to Premier League defences. Watkins registered nine more assists and had a better xG of 18.6 compared to Sesko's 13.6. Watkins also had a better expected non-penalty goals plus assisted goals of 22.1, Sesko managed just 13.3 and a better xG (0.51) per 90 minutes.",
      "To be fair to Sesko, eight more goals than Watkins came as a result of just 14 shots. But he fell short to Watkins in shot-creating actions (58 compared to 80 and 1.80 per 90 compared to 2.19). Goal-creating actions, which is a direct action that leads to a goal (passes, takes-ons and drawing fouls) also swung in Watkins' favour with 16.",
      "In terms of passing and possession, it's clear to see the major contrast between the pair. Sesko attempted 174 more passes than Watkins but managed just a 66.9% completion rate, compared to Watkins' 72.8%.",
      "On the ball, Sesko had more touches. FBREF class 'one touch' as receiving the ball, dribbling and then passing. However, the Slovenian's biggest presence came in the middle third of the pitch (559) whereas Watkins' was in the attacking third (517). The Villa star also registered more in the attacking penalty area, 206 compared to Sesko's 113.",
      "Sesko's natural habit of dropping deep and connecting play is something that had made him so attractive to Arsenal with Mikel Arteta utilising a false nine-type centre-forward throughout his tenure. But at United, they need someone to lead the line and stay in the box.",
      "Many factors point towards Watkins being the right choice for United. Premier League proven, expected to be cheaper and fits the criteria needed.",

      "The French icon spent three seasons at Barcelona after joining from Arsenal in 2007. During his time at the Camp Nou, Henry helped Pep Guardiola's star-studded squad to a historic La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League treble in the 2008/2009 season.",
      "Rashford has made no secret of his admiration for Henry and he even once compared his versatility to that of the Frenchman. \"My idol is Thierry Henry,\" said Rashford previously. \"Like him, I enjoy playing as a number nine more and more.",
      "\"I'm comfortable playing on the left and also in the centre. Henry is a free player.\"",
      "England winger Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, after his working relationship with United head coach Ruben Amorim broke down in December.",
      "Rashford signed for Aston Villa on loan in the mid-season transfer window. He scored four goals in 17 appearances at Villa Park, with Unai Emery opting not to sign him on a permanent basis.",
      "Upon his return to Carrington this summer, Rashford was stripped of the No.10 shirt as that was instead handed to summer signing Matheus Cunha.",

      "On Tuesday afternoon, news emerged that the 32-year-old would not join his teammates on their flight to the US. The Reds are flying to Chicago to take part in the Premier League summer series, which includes games against West Ham, Bournemouth, and Everton.",
      "And Maguire has allayed any concerns over his absence by releasing a statement on his Instagram stories",

      "United signed Overy to the academy on a scholarship deal last summer and the defender has now been rewarded with a professional contract, which is recognition of his potential.",
      "The 18-year-old trained with the first-team at Carrington in May. Overy was among a large group of youngsters who trained ahead of facing Chelsea in the Premier League, with the likes of Chido Obi, Godwill Kukonki, Harry Amass, James Scanlon and Jaydan Kamason also taking part.",
      "Shortly after signing for United, Overy picked up an injury and spent eight months on the sidelines. The promising right-back finally made his debut for the Under-18s in February.",
      "After Overy's debut for the academy, former U18 manager Adam Lawrence reflected on his road to recovery from injury and told MUTV: “It’s been really hard for James because obviously he’s made the move from Australia and he’s a terrific lad, first of all.",
      "“But he got injured in pre-season and you can see he’s such a great lad, a great kid and has such good energy and he wanted to be back. A real credit to him because he stayed positive throughout.",
      "\"It’s not affected him in terms of his positivity. And listen, it’s obviously disappointing what’s happened in the game, but for him to be back and playing football again is brilliant.\"",
      "The opportunity to sign a professional contract is an important milestone in a youngster's career.",
      "Overy qualifies to represent Australia, England and Scotland on the international stage.",

      "Manchester United's delight after completing the signing of Bryan Mbeumo on Monday will have been tempered after taking one look at the Christmas schedule.",
      "Following a prolonged negotiation period with Brentford, United managed to complete the signing of the 25-year-old for a fee of £65m plus a potential £6m in add-ons. The Bees fought hard to keep hold of their forward despite Mbeumo being adamant that he wanted to join the Reds.",
      "MEN Sport understands United are disgruntled by the manner in which Brentford handled negotiations for Mbeumo. And, they are unlikely to be any happier when they take a look at the schedule for the forthcoming season.",
      "United's hectic Christmas schedule starts on December 20 against Aston Villa before playing three matches in a week against Newcastle, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Leeds. A trip to Burnley comes up a few days later before the FA Cup third round.",
      "The Reds will then officially end their busy schedule on January 17 when they face Manchester City in the derby. Unfortunately for them, Mbeumo is likely to play his last game of the festive period against Villa before joining his Cameroonian teammates for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Mbeumo, if fit, is more than likely to be called up to the side and if he is, he will be guaranteed to miss the Newcastle, Wolves and probably Leeds matches. Should Cameroon get out of the group stages, which is expected, he will then miss the Burnley match too.",
      "As one of the favourites, Cameroon will be aiming to reach the final and if they complete their target, Mbeumo will miss the FA Cup third round match and the big derby as the final will be played on the same weekend. In total, there is a real possibility that the 25-year-old misses six domestic matches over Christmas which could pose a big problem for United during a crucial period of the season.",

      "Ahead of flying to the US from Manchester Airport on Tuesday afternoon, Mbeumo was introduced to and trained with his new teammates at Carrington for the first time earlier in the day.",
      "And the occasion was marked by Mbeumo being ordered to run the gauntlet.",

      "Manchester United have been set a more ‘realistic price’ by RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko that Arsenal would have paid for their top target. Yikes.",
      "United have turned their attention to a new No.9 having finally completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, with the Cameroon international joining Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as the Red Devils’ new recruits this summer.",
      "A report last week claimed Sesko ‘wants Man Utd move’ despite the Red Devils being unable to offer European football to the Slovenia international.",
      "United are ‘understood to be admirers of Sesko’s all-round game and believe his style would suit the Premier League’ and the RB Leipzig star ‘would favour a move to Old Trafford over other destinations’.",
      "The Slovenian is ‘not the only name under consideration’ with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson also potential options.",
      "The report added that as Sesko is ‘open to the move and willing to forgo European football in the short term, United are weighing up whether to make a concrete push’.",
      "The Athletic‘s Ornstein then confirmed United have held ‘talks’ over a move for Sesko, along with Watkins and Jackson.",
      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "Bild journalist Christian Falk revealed on Wednesday that Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting, could be ‘key’ to Sesko’s transfer having previously worked at RB Leipzig, and was seen watching the striker in action for Leipzig in April.",
      "It was claimed earlier in the window that the Bundesliga club were looking for a fee of at least £70m for their prized asset amid strong interest from Arsenal, but Bild now believe Leipzig will settle for a more ‘realistic price’ of £59m for Sesko.",
      "That’s less than the Gunners could end up paying for Viktor Gyokeres, who was below Sesko in Mikel Arteta’s new No.9 pecking order but became the top target after Leipzig made it clear to Arsenal that they wouldn’t budge in their valuation of Sesko.",
      "They have now budged and we imagine Arsenal won’t be best pleased if United manage to secure his signing for the £59m that they were perfectly willing to pay for the Slovenian.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Tottenham make ‘shock’ approach for Man Utd star as they ‘actually stand a chance’ of doing a deal\n👉 Rodrygo set to top terrible list of Real Madrid stars moving to the Premier League\n👉 Man Utd ‘open talks’ with Ligue 1 teen as Zirkzee taps up £34.6m star in Nottingham Forest hijack",
      "Falk claims Leipzig – who won’t be playing Champions League football next season – have a ‘target’ figure in mind for player sales, with Xavi Simons set to make up around half of that figure as he nears a move to Chelsea, with Sesko the only other player in the squad they could sell to make up the rest.",
      "“It’s worth noting that Leipzig have to sell players this summer,” Falk told the Daily Briefing. “They have a target to bring in €100m (£86.6m, $117m), and they have just two players in this range who can make the club money.",
      "“Xavi Simons, of course, is one such footballer, with the other being Benjamin Sesko. So, it could be that the club has to sell both players in this summer’s transfer window. That’s why Manchester United will definitely be an option.”",
      "On comparisons to Erling Haaland, Falk continued: “Sesko is a fan of the Premier League and is prepared to make this next step.",
      "“He has a lot of self-confidence – he’s on record as telling reporters that he believes he’s similar in profile to Erling Haaland: ‘My teammates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I’m better than him.’",
      "“So, you see, he’s not afraid of big names or big clubs! I think this transfer can gather real pace now that Arsenal are no longer at the table.”",
      "Man Utd have been told what they will need to pay to sign Benjamin Sesko this summer after David Ornstein revealed the Red Devils have held ‘talks’ over the RB ...",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool signings have received the ‘Here we go’, which has opened the door for new faces to get into our top 10 available strikers ranking.",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly now moving to seal their next two signings this summer after getting a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday.",
      "While selling clubs prepare a wedge of Man Utd tax to put on their strikers, we’ve entered the mind of Ruben Amorim to rank their top ten targets.",

      "29) Wataru Endo (Liverpool)\nHard to knock £15m for a player of Endo’s quality; he is a solid rotational option.",
      "",
      "28) Leon Bailey (Aston Villa)\nSigned from Bundesliga giants Bayer Leverkusen for a cool £25m in 2021, Bailey failed to hit the heights expected of him in his first year for Villa. We said ‘2023/24 is his last chance to prove himself at Villa Park’ and he did just that. Bailey was fantastic. But he’s now reportedly surplus to requirements.",
      "",
      "27) Matthijs de Ligt (Manchester United)\nWe don’t think De Ligt was that bad for Man United last season. He did have a mad few minutes at Anfield, mind.",
      "",
      "26) Robin Koch (Leeds)\nKoch is decent in the air, comfortable on the ball, versatile, rarely injured, but not the most convincing defender in the world.",

      "25) Mathys Tel (Tottenham)\nHis six months on loan at Spurs was pretty disappointing, but then Spurs were historically s**t. They recently signed him permanently from Bayern.",
      "",
      "24) Mark Flekken (Brentford)\nFlekken was fine for Brentford. Not outstanding but not bad by any stretch. He made the most saves across Europe’s top five leagues last season.",
      "",
      "23) Brajan Gruda (Brighton)\nBrighton paid £25m for the young German, who is beginning to show why on a more frequent basis.",
      "",
      "22) Marcel Sabitzer (Manchester United)\nSigned on loan for the second half of 22/23, Sabitzer filled a gap for Erik ten Hag and barely put a foot wrong. His form at Borussia Dortmund and for Austria at Euro 2024 will have been hard for Man Utd to stomach. They could have had him for £15m!",

      "3) Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)\nLiverpool wanted Martin Zubimendi last summer and after failing to convince him to leave Real Sociedad, they stuck with Gravenberch. He quickly blossomed into one of the best deep-lying midfielders in Europe. His level of consistency and availability gives him the edge over Konate.",

      "Signed to win City the Champions League, he did just that at the first attempt as his new team completed the Treble. A whopping 52 goals in 53 games in his debut season was a simply outrageous return.",
      "He now has one of the biggest contracts in world football after City tied him down for 115 months. Cheeky.",

      "Tottenham have made an approach to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo as his contract saga drags on, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have made three signings so far this summer with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon all arriving.",

      "Marcus Rashford was unveiled as a Barcelona player on Wednesday with the Red Devils getting all of his wages off their books in a loan deal, while the Catalan giants have an option to make the deal permanent in the summer.",

      "One player they ideally want to keep is Mainoo but the Red Devils are still struggling to renew his contract with the midfielder’s deal expiring in 2027.",
      "And now TBR Football claim that Tottenham have made a ‘shock enquiry’ to sign Mainoo and ‘actually stand a chance of signing’ the England international.",
      "Spurs ‘have asked about signing’ Mainoo as the north Londoners ‘appreciate the 20-year-old and are keeping abreast of his contract situation, which still hasn’t been agreed’.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is ‘keen to add another’ midfielder this summer and Mainoo could fall down the pecking order at Old Trafford with the World Cup just around the corner.",
      "With that in mind, Mainoo ‘will be eager to be playing regular football’ and that ‘could open the door for Spurs and Chelsea’ as TBR Football ‘sources suggest he could still move this summer’.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Gary Neville recently revealed why he would like to keep Mainoo after he had an injury-hit campaign last term.",
      "When asked if Mainoo should leave this summer, Neville said: “Mainoo, no. That’s a step too far.",
      "“If we can’t give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield… I look at Mainoo and the way he plays football and I think a top club would want him.",
      "“Why can’t we make him a top player? If he’s one of ours and he’s shown talent.",
      "“I don’t know what’s gone on there in the last few months. He’s obviously had some injuries which has caused him a problem so he needs to stay fit, but I’d like to think he could be one of that two in midfield that Ruben Amorim plays.",
      "“It’s probably not Casemiro as his partner and it’s probably not Ugarte as his partner, it’s probably someone else in there who is better than those two, if I’m being honest.",
      "“But we should be building around Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield and not because he’s come through the ranks.”",
      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Only three Premier League players are on offer…",
      "Mainoo is so much more than ‘pure profit’ and the very idea of selling him is an indictment of Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Amorim has made up his mind and ‘the talk’ at Man Utd has now turned to where the midfielder might go and how much they can get for him."

      "Liverpool are said to be ‘accelerating’ a move for Real Madrid star Rodrygo to replace Luis Diaz amid widely reported interest from Arsenal, less widely reported interest from Manchester City and presumed interest from Chelsea, because it’s Chelsea and they want all the forwards.",
      "But they should perhaps pump the brakes after casting an eye over this truly appalling comprehensive list of honking flops who have made the move from Real Madrid to the Premier League, in order of transfer fee.",
      "",
      "19) Christian Karambeu (Middlesbrough, £2.1m)\nWe’re in absolute agreement with Karambeu, who insisted his move to Teeside from Madrid was a “big, big deal” on the back of two Champions League titles in three years for Los Blancos, to go with his World Cup and European Championship winners medals with France. Boro finished 14th in his only season before Karambeu upped sticks to Olympiacos.",
      "",
      "18) Davor Suker (Arsenal, £3.5m)\nBought as a replacement for Nicolas Anelka, who moved in the opposite direction for £22.3m, it’s fair to say Croatia’s World Cup 1998 hero wasn’t quite like-for-like, scoring just 11 goals in 39 appearances. Fortunately Arsenal also signed a certain Thierry Henry in the same summer.",
      "",
      "17) Fernando Morientes (Liverpool, £6.3m)\nHe managed just 12 goals in 61 appearances and later admitted he was the “worst version of myself” during a two-year stint as Anfield which was “killing me slowly”. Yikes.",
      "",
      "16) Jonathan Woodgate (Middlesbrough, £7m)\nAfter two injury-ravaged seasons at the Bernabeu, Woodgate returned to fitness and form at Boro before moving to Spurs in January in 2008 and immediately becoming the second-last (yes, the second last) trophy-winning hero.",
      "",
      "15) Njitap Geremi (Chelsea, £6.9m)\nArriving in the first cash-laden summer of the Romano Abramovich era, his always felt like a slightly odd signing after a decent but not world-beating season on loan from Madrid at Middlesbrough. After 19 starts in his debut season under Claudio Ranieri, Geremi was never more than a bit-part player under Jose Mourinho, though we’re sure he’s perfectly happy with a haul of two Premier Leagues, two League Cups and an FA Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham, £8m)\nWe’re not sure whether Tottenham fans will be delighted or sickened by Van der Vaart claiming the Harry Redknapp side he played in with Gareth Bale and Luka Modric was “the best team I ever played in” having left Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema, Raul and Ruud van Nistelrooy behind him at Real Madrid.",
      "That may well have been the peak ‘Spurs are fun but are never going to win anything’ period and Van der Vaart was a big reason for that, presumably swapping notes with Jamie O’Hara over their future roles as Tell It Like It Is pundits, colloquially known as ‘pr*cks’.",
      "",
      "13) Esteban Granero (QPR, £9m)\nHe joined as one of several ‘marquee signings’ among 15 in total in that mad 2012 summer which was entirely predictably QPR’s undoing as they finished bottom of the table.",
      "",
      "12) Claude Makelele (Chelsea, £16.8m)\nComfortably the best Premier League signing from Real Madrid, Makelele made 217 appearances for Chelsea, winning five major trophies including two Premier League titles and has one of the most enduring legacies of any footballer to play in England, with clubs now spending nine-figure sums to fill The Makelele Role, albeit for slightly more well-rounded players than the diminutive Frenchman.",
      "",
      "11) Michael Owen (Newcastle, £16.8m)\nThere’s a misconception that injuries stopped Owen from reaching the Premier League heights he enjoyed before moving to Real Madrid on his return to the English top flight. But he played 29 and 28 games in consecutive seasons for Newcastle and was just a bit balls, scoring 19 goals across the two.",
      "",
      "10) Danilo (Manchester City, £26.5m)\nWe would refer to Danilo as a rare misstep in the Pep Guardiola, Txiki Begiristain era in a summer in which they also signed Aymeric Laporte, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, who’ve done alright, but they somehow managed to make a £7.5m profit on the Brazilian after two years of not doing very much at all.",
      "",
      "9) Sergio Reguilon (Tottenham, £25m)\nFor a famously miserly football chief, Daniel Levy does choose to spend Spurs’ money very strangely at times. He was entirely duped by five knockout games for Reguilon on loan at Sevilla to help them to the Europa League, and five years and 73 games after joining Spurs, the full-back is now without a club having left at the end of his contract.",
      "",
      "8) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal, £30m)\nOdegaard is presumably the recent example Rodrygo is hoping to mimic with his eyes on the Premier League. The playmaker was destined for great things when he signed for Madrid as a child but needed to leave to realise his potential, and while Rodrygo’s situation is different in that he’s proved he’s good enough for Real Madrid while still at Real Madrid, he will be attracted to a major role similar to Odegaard’s at a top English side.",
      "",
      "7) Raphael Varane (Manchester United, £40m)\nWe wonder whether Manchester United signing a centre-back with far more miles in his legs than his 28 years for £40m would be seen in more negative terms had it not been for his 30-year-old pal signing for £60m a year later.",
      "",
      "6) Robinho (Manchester City, £32.5m)\nQuite the 2008 deadline day for City, with Robinho arriving along with all the Abu Dhabi cash after their takeover of the club. The Brazilian announced his delight at signing for Chelsea in his first City press conference and manager Mark Hughes later claimed he believes he didn’t recognise him and was “expecting to see Sir Alex Ferguson at the airport”.",
      "",
      "5) Mateo Kovacic (Chelsea, £40m)\nThe ultimate close-but-no-cigar footballer in many ways as he’s never really been a key cog after leaving Inter for Real Madrid in 2015, as illustrated by him having four Champions League winners medals but not playing a single minute in the three for Real Madrid and just 10 minutes for Chelsea in 2021.",
      "",
      "4) Mesut Ozil (Arsenal, £42.5m)\nHe left Arsenal with a reputation of being work-shy, but mercurial may be a better description of an absurdly talented footballer who could do astonishing things with the ball at his feet but also often went missing in games, particularly at the end of his time at the Emirates. We’re not quite sure of the definition of a ‘streets won’t forget footballer’ but Ozil was somewhere between that and world class.",
      "",
      "3) Alvaro Morata (Chelsea, £58m)\nMorata has said he “stopped enjoying football” at Chelsea and that was pretty clear to everyone watching. “I didn’t feel like doing anything, leaving home, talking to people, nothing.”",
      "",
      "2) Casemiro (Manchester United, £60m)\nThere was undoubtedly an uptick in Casemiro’s performances at the end of last season, but he had set a very low bar by his standards to hobble over and we are very amused by what looks to be a reasonably decent chance of him starting the coming season at the base of Ruben Amorim’s midfield after well over a season of desperation to be rid of him.",
      "",
      "1) Angel Di Maria (Manchester United, £59.7m)\nHe actually started very well, with three goals and six assists in his opening 10 Premier League games, and Amorim would bite your hand off for a forward with a goal contribution ever 126 minutes as Di Maria managed in his solitary season at Old Trafford.",
      "But he really didn’t get on with Louis van Gaal and his wife might be the only person in the world who hates Manchester more than Mr Di Maria.",
      "“The people are all pasty-faced, prim and proper… weird,” she said.",
      "“They’re walking down the street and you don’t know if they’re going to kill you or what. The food’s disgusting. All the girls are all dolled up to the nines, perfectly made-up and there’s me with my hair in a bun and with no make-up on.",

      "We’re guessing she preferred Paris like her husband, who got 92 goals and 120 assists while starring for PSG.",
      "Liverpool have held ‘no talks’ over a move for Real Madrid star Rodrygo, who is ‘not viewed as a possible replacement’ for Luis Diaz in a huge boost for Arsenal.",
      "Sky Sport Germany’s Florian Plettenberg has clarified whether Rodrygo is a target for Tottenham amid interest from Arsenal and Liverpool.",

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Hugo Ekitike – £69m/€79.5m (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool, July 2025)\nThere could yet be another £10m added to this deal, which is an awful lot of money for a player who moved for less than £27m in the summer of 2024. That leap in value came after a 22-goal season for the German club.",
      "",
      "12) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "13) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "14) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nLiverpool would presumably quite like Nunez to activate the clauses which would take the worth of his deal up to £85m, but might actually prefer the far likelier scenario of someone taking him off them.",
      "",
      "15) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "16) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "17) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "18) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",
      "",
      "19) Zlatan Ibrahimovic – £57m/€66m (Inter to Barcelona, July 2009)\nFor a big old slab of money and a part-exchange which saw Samuel Eto’o head the other way, Pep Guardiola decided to give himself a headache for the entire 2009/10 season. Ibrahimovic scored 22 goals and won five trophies across 46 Barcelona games but no-one involved in the convoluted deal will consider it worth the hassle. To make matters worse, Eto’o won the Treble with Inter.",
      "",
      "20) Diego Costa – £57m/€65m (Chelsea to Atletico Madrid, December 2017)\nProof that Chelsea used to be incredible at this transfer lark: they signed Liverpool target Diego Costa from Atletico for £32m in 2014 and built two title-winning teams around his 20-goal seasons, before Antonio Conte dumped the Spain international over text and theoretically torched his valuation by publicly ostracising him, yet Atletico – serving a transfer ban – bought the 29-year-old back for £25m more than they sold him despite Costa not having played for months. And in a miserable second Atleti spell, he scored 19 goals in 81 games, moving to Brazil for free before they won the title.",

      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal – £123.7m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Manchester United have ‘opened talks’ with a Ligue 1 teen while Joshua Zirkzee taps up one of his former teammates amid interest from the Red Devils.",
      "United have turned their attention to a new No.9 having finally completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, with the Cameroon international joining Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as the Red Devils’ new recruits this summer.",
      "The Athletic’s Ornstein confirmed United have held ‘talks’ over a move for RB Leipzig’s Sesko, Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson in their search for a new No.9.",
      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "Sesko is thought to be their top target and is ‘open’ to the move to Old Trafford even without European football, with RB Leipzig said to be ready to listen to offers of around £60m for the Slovenian.",
      "But the Red Devils are spreading the net wide and it’s now claimed that Bologna star Dan Ndoye and Metz teenager Idrissa Gueye are also in the frame for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "L’Equipe report Gueye ‘could take a sharp acceleration during the summer’ and leave the club after helping them to promotion from Ligue 2 last season.",
      "The 18-year-old got five goals and an assist having broken into the first team in January but ‘should fly to a new club’ this summer’, with Metz wanting €20m [£17.3m], though it’s claimed they would listen to offers of around €15m [£13m].",
      "Southampton, West Ham and Wolves are all credited with interest, but both Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund have reportedly ‘entered into discussions with his entourage’.",
      "Ndoye has agreed personal terms over a move to Nottingham Forest, who are expected to return with a second bid for the 24-year-old after their opening offer of €30m [£24.4m] was rejected by Bologna, but United could yet hijack his transfer.",
      "The Red Devils have been linked with the right winger for some time and Italian outlet Il Resto del Carlino claim they’ve agin ‘made contact’ over a move for Ndoye and are considering an offer of €40m [£34.6m].",
      "The report adds that United forward Joshua Zirkzee, who moved to Old Trafford from Bologna for £34.5m last summer, has had ‘telephone contact’ with his former teammate to encourage him to join him in Manchester.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli are also keen on Ndoye, and they too are said to have agreed personal terms.",
      "Man Utd have reignited their interest in a £34m Serie A star to replace Alejandro Garnacho, who ‘wants to leave’ after the Europa League final defeat."

      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Manchester United.",
      "Rashford has joined on an initial 12-month loan from Manchester United, with the Catalan giants holding the option of signing him on a permanent basis for £30.3m (35m euros) in 2026.",
      "Barcelona will cover the entirety of Rashford’s wages during his time at the club after the forward agreed to take a pay cut, with United set to save around £15m with him removed from the wage bill.",
      "“I feel at home here; it’s a very family-oriented club,” Rashford said at his unveiling. “I always try to make decisive, quick, and dynamic moves, and I’ve always loved good football. That’s why, since I was little, I’ve loved watching Barca, just like all football fans.",
      "“They won a ton of titles last year, and I can see they’re ambitious to win more this year, very excited. I think it’s a club every player wants to play for. They’ve made me feel at home in these first few hours; everyone has made me feel very comfortable.",
      "“One of the key reasons for me coming here was him (Hansi Flick), the conversation I had with him was very positive.",
      "“I’m eager to get started and learn from the ‘Barca method.’ He’s one of the great coaches. Last season, he did an incredible job with a young team, with many successes.",
      "“I thank the fans for the welcome and hope you enjoy it. It’s my first time here, and the first game will be a special moment.”",
      "Rashford hasn’t played for Manchester United since last December after being dropped by manager Ruben Amorin for the Manchester derby over what the Portuguese boss claimed to be a lack of effort in training.",
      "The England international spent the second half of the 2024-25 season on loan at Aston Villa, and looked to be back close to his best with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances for the Villans.",
      "Asked about leaving United, Rashford added: “The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while. So I don’t have anything bad to say about Manchester United… I wish them all the best and hope they are successful in the future.”",
      "The 27-year-old trained with his new team-mates for the first time on Tuesday and is expected to be included in the squad that travels to Japan for a pre-season tour of Asia on Thursday.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford should’ve departed Manchester United a hero. Instead, his exit prompts barely a shrug as he gambles on Barca levers…",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford was reportedly told what he must to do succeed at Barcelona in a meeting with Hansi Flick.",
      "Man Utd’s Marcus Rashford faces a nervy wait to finalise his loan move to Barcelona amid a summer of issues for the Catalan club.",
      "Marcus Rashford was ‘almost scuppered’ in his mission to join Barcelona from Manchester United because of a slight delay from back-up airport of choice."

      "Manchester United have been told what they will need to pay to sign Benjamin Sesko this summer after David Ornstein revealed the Red Devils have held ‘talks’ over the RB Leipzig star.",
      "United have turned their attention to a new No.9 having finally completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, with the Cameroon international joining Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as the Red Devils’ new recruits this summer.",
      "A report last week claimed Sesko ‘wants Man Utd move’ despite the Red Devils being unable to offer European football to the Slovenia international.",
      "United are ‘understood to be admirers of Sesko’s all-round game and believe his style would suit the Premier League’ and the RB Leipzig star ‘would favour a move to Old Trafford over other destinations’.",
      "The Slovenian is ‘not the only name under consideration’ with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson also potential options.",
      "The report added that as Sesko is ‘open to the move and willing to forgo European football in the short term, United are weighing up whether to make a concrete push’.",
      "The Athletic‘s Ornstein then confirmed United have held ‘talks’ over a move for Sesko, along with Watkins and Jackson.",
      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "And now Bild journalist Christian Falk has revealed the price he believes United will have to pay to land Sesko, while also revealing the Red Devils hold a ‘key’ to his transfer after Arsenal walked away from their pursuit of the Slovenian as they close in on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "“When one door closes, another opens! Arsenal have withdrawn their pursuit of Benjamin Šeško, which creates an opportunity for Manchester United,” Falk told CaughtOffside.",
      "“The Red Devils weren’t in the front row for the club and player. However, there’s a key executive involved in all of this – Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting. He’s previously worked for RB Leipzig, and he’s now supporting the potential deal. Vivell’s also been watching the situation develop since April. He was at the match between Leipzig and Wolfsburg to scout Šeško again.",
      "“The striker (22) is still very, very young. He can leave with a good offer; I think Leipzig are willing to talk if they receive a fee closer to €70m [£60.6m].”",
      "Man Utd have been set a more ‘realistic price’ by RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko that Arsenal would have paid for their top target. Yikes.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool signings have received the ‘Here we go’, which has opened the door for new faces to get into our top 10 available strikers ranking.",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly now moving to seal their next two signings this summer after getting a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday.",
      "While selling clubs prepare a wedge of Man Utd tax to put on their strikers, we’ve entered the mind of Ruben Amorim to rank their top ten targets.",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed the three strikers Man Utd have held ‘talks’ about after also enquiring over Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres."

      "Anthony Gordon’s dream move to Liverpool could become a reality while Chelsea move for a pair of Arsenal targets.",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) Rodri – Man City to Real Madrid\nWe’re told that Real are offering Eduardo Camavinga, Rodrygo and €40million for Rodri. Real probably value that package at around £170million. Which feels like a lot for a player coming off the back of a serious knee injury. But probably still not enough for City to seriously consider.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Ezri Konsa – Aston Villa to Liverpool\nA report in Spain suggests Liverpool could alter their focus to the ‘slightly more affordable’ Konsa since Palace are looking for £50million to sell Marc Guehi a year before he goes for free. Konsa is under contract until 2028 – would Villa demand less for him than what Palace are demanding for Guehi? We think not.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Liverpool are monitoring Rodrygo if Luis Diaz leaves. The Reds are insisting on top whack for Diaz, who is set to be the subject of an improved offer from Bayern. Real too were looking for around £86million for Rodrygo but they have since accepted they may have to settle for less. In that context, it makes sense but still somehow doesn’t pass the sniff test.",
      "",

      "",
      "17) 🆕 Kobbie Mainoo – Manchester United to Tottenham\nSpurs have made an enquiry to United over Mainoo, whose contract talks with his boyhood club are not progressing as quickly as either side might hope. That shouldn’t prompt panic, though, since the midfielder’s current terms expire in 2027 and United have the option to go for another 12 months beyond that. Still, does Mainoo fit Ruben Amorim’s system? He might be their best chance of getting some decent money in this summer.",
      "",
      "16) 🔼 Anthony Gordon – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt’s been pretty quiet around Gordon so far this summer, but it seems someone is trying to drum up the noise. We all know he would probably walk to Anfield to join Liverpool, so most likely the stirring is being done by the those close to the player. Which might do the trick since the Reds will be on the lookout for a replacement should they get big money from Bayern for Luis Diaz. This feels more likely than Liverpool going for Rodrygo.",
      "",
      "15) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Manchester United\nUnited continue to be linked with Jackson but we hear that Chelsea have valued him at between £80million and £100million. If you’re not going to take it seriously, lads. We could see this happening, probably late and something exchange-y involving Alejandro Garnacho. But not if Chelsea keep pretending they want the silliest of money.",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho is being linked with Chelsea and Spurs but the noise seems to be building around Villa. Morgan Rogers to Chelsea, then Garnacho to Villa? The Villans would turn a profit from any such dealing and if they sit tight, they could get Garnacho for even less than the current asking price of around £40million. If they are really clever, they could probably get him on loan.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seemed as though Liverpool were taking Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead doused our initial suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak. But it all seemed a bit weird on Saturday when Isak was sent home from Glasgow ‘due to the speculation around him’ and Eddie Howe sounded less convincing that the Swede would remain with Newcastle beyond the end of the window. Maybe this one isn’t done?",
      "",
      "12) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nIt was thought Xhaka might be heading for the riches of Saudi but instead he fancies the splendour of Sunderland. Indeed, the ex-Arsenal midfielder has told Leverkusen he only wants to move to the Stadium of Light while urging the German club to do a deal quickly. Those pleas, though, appear to have fallen on deaf ears, with Erik ten Hag insisting Leverkusen have already lost too many key players this summer.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "8) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao but the sales of Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah will allow the Old Lady to sign Sancho too. Agreements are said to be in place with both United and Sancho, who should be thanking his lucky stars even if he’s halving his salary. How will he cope?",
      "",
      "7) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. Only problem now is they need to deal with Brentford, who have already lost one forward to Manchester United. Given the Bees know Newcastle were prepared to spend big on Hugo Ekitike or Joao Pedro, the Magpies can expect a rough ride. They will have to try a lot harder than £25million.",
      "",
      "6) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "5) Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nThis one doesn’t seem to have moved in since Forest saw their arse over Spurs randomly plucking the same number out of the sky that appears on Gibbs-White contract under the buy-out clause. Forest threatened legal action and since then… nothing. The player is missing from Forest’s pre-season trip to Portugal but that’s to stay behind with his heavily pregnant partner. What now? For this to go through, Spurs must suss that they are legally on solid ground and pursue the deal at the cost of their original offer; or they sweeten the deal for Forest to sell a player who wants to move.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThe Netherlands defender’s agent is quite open about talks that have taken place with Chelsea, who have also been in touch with Ajax. Hato has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Real Madrid, but he’s apparently already ‘said yes’ to Chelsea, who seem intent on getting to the teenager first.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nWe all assumed Newcastle would pull their finger out after their initial bid of £27million inclusive of add-ons was rejected last month. Since then, though: nothing. Leaving City to swoop in for the England Under-21 keeper. Reports suggest City are trying to secure a discount on the £40million buy-back clause they hold for their ex-goalkeeper but with the increased noise around Ederson departing, it’s hard to envisage the Citizens allowing Newcastle back into the race.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nAfter bemoaning the abject lack of progress in the last week, it seems we finally have some. Ornstein reckons Sporting and Arsenal are ‘on the verge of total agreement’. Which is where we thought they were but, apparently, a ‘conclusion is imminent’. Which is something we can all be thankful for.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nThe delay between medical and confirmation is a pattern with Arsenal this summer but this one has really dragged. Mosquera is heading for Singapore to join his new team-mates but still we wait.",

      "Joao Palhinha could be heading back to the Premier League just one year after leaving it, with one new suitor joining the race according to Florian Plettenberg, and Bayern Munich ready to listen to offers.",
      "The Portugal international endured a frustrating debut season in Germany, making only six Bundesliga starts for the title winners and watching on as others took precedence in Vincent Kompany’s midfield.",
      "His move from Fulham last summer came after a collapsed deadline-day switch the previous year, and while the eventual £46.5million deal got over the line, the fit never quite did.",
      "Palhinha recently admitted his first year in Bavaria had been “difficult” during tentative links to Arsenal, though he reaffirmed his commitment to return for pre-season and prove himself.",
      "Man Utd are allegedly one of the clubs considering a move. New boss Ruben Amorim worked with Palhinha during their time together at Sporting and Braga, and reports suggest the 30-year-old is being lined up to provide a defensive anchor that would allow Bruno Fernandes more attacking freedom.",
      "Amorim’s midfield was one of the biggest concerns last season, and while much of Utd transfer focus has been on forwards, a move for Palhinha could be the next domino.",
      "However, Utd are believed to be exploring a loan, while Bayern are reportedly pushing back against any temporary deal with the Bundesliga season fast approaching.",
      "MORE TOTTENHAM COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Florian Plettenberg clears up Rodrygo to Tottenham talk amid Arsenal and Liverpool interest\n👉 Tottenham: Gibbs-White told to ‘sue’ Forest amid ‘disgrace’ as two reasons for ‘very likely’ outcome\n👉 Tottenham ‘ready to pay’ £61m in PSG hijack as Liverpool ‘offered’ Bournemouth exchange target",
      "Fulham have also been credited with an interest in bringing Palhinha back. The Cottagers sold him for a club-record fee but are are also said to be eyeing a loan deal as part of a wider rebuild under Marco Silva.",
      "The west London club are targeting up to five signings and view Palhinha as a potential marquee return, should Bayern allow it.",
      "But the Germans would prefer a permanent exit and are said to have made that clear in talks with interested parties, according to reports.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur have now entered the picture, with Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg revealing that the north London club are monitoring the situation.",
      "“It is not concrete at this stage, but there is interest,” he posted on X. “Palhinha’s camp has been informed. Bayern are open to talks should suitable offers arrive for the 30 y/o.”",
      "Spurs have already been active this summer with deals for Mohamed Kudus, Mathys Tel and Kevin Danso, but midfield reinforcements have so far taken a back seat.",
      "Palhinha would offer something different to Yves Bissouma, Rodrigo Bentancur and Pape Matar Sarr, as a pure ball-winner with a track record of excelling in the Premier League and Champions League experience to match.",
      "Tottenham will be given a challenge in their pursuit of a Bayern Munich star as his former side are reportedly ‘determined’ to bring him back on board.",
      "Tottenham will reportedly ‘need’ to do one thing before they can secure the signing of a Bayern Munich star who they have been looking at for a while.",

      "We also have the best available attacking midfielders, centre-backs, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Lois Openda (Leipzig)\nAfter missing out on Champions League football, Leipzig are expected to make two or three important sales this summer. The best available attacking midfielder and Chelsea target, Xavi Simons, is the most likely as things stand, and Openda could follow his teammate out the door.",
      "After scoring 21 goals in 38 Ligue 1 matches in 2022/23, Openda earned a well-deserved transfer to the Bundesliga, and 24 goals and seven assists in his maiden campaign was a very promising return.",
      "Last season was less convincing from the Belgian, and every other Leipzig player. Still, nine goals and nine assists is hardly rubbish.",
      "With Leipzig open to selling a key player or two, there should be some clubs keen on signing Openda.",
      "",
      "9) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African striker’s move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers can’t be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football could do a lot worse, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",
      "",
      "8) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Naturally, Manchester United are a solid option for Kolo Muani, while Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldn’t be ruled out either, having sent Marcus Rashford back to Old Trafford and returned Marco Asensio to PSG.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping £80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but he’s only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. He’s been a colossal flop but there’s still hope for Kolo Muani.",
      "MORE: Ten players in the Club World Cup shop window for Premier League scouts",
      "",
      "7) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, while the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford don’t want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning £65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting £27m for David Raya and £40m for Ivan Toney. Somehow though, Craig Hope reckons the Bees will accept ‘a fee in the region of £30m’.",
      "If that’s true, we should see Wissa holding up a Newcastle United top in no time.",
      "",
      "6) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nOn a list containing two Leipzig players, here is a former Leipzig player. During his time in Germany, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino’s team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. There is talk of Newcastle targeting him after missing out on Blues signing Joao Pedro and Liverpool-bound youngster Hugo Ekitike, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If he’s available for under £40m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors.",
      "",
      "5) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nThe Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him. But who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli were very interested but showed no intention of paying £60m and signed Lorenzo Lucca instead, so the Reds are now anxiously hoping a Saudi Arabian club offers big bucks for Darwin.",
      "Darwin is only 26, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leave a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",

      "",
      "4) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him – it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "3) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface could be part of a summer exodus at Bayer Leverkusen, but head coach Erik ten Hag has said there have already been too many sales since his arrival. That spells bad news for Sunderland target Granit Xhaka.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "2) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentford’s Wissa. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Probably from Manchester United.",
      "",
      "1) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nPredicting Benjamin Sesko’s future is essentially pointless at this stage.",
      "There is a lot of hype surrounding the young Slovenian and a move to Arsenal looked likely before they prioritised Viktor Gyokeres. Now, it’s anyone’s guess where he’ll be playing next season. Manchester United have been linked but need sales before even considering bidding for him, while Saudi Arabian champions Al Hilal have tried and failed already this summer.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite forward, but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could become the best striker in the world.",
      "",
      "Man Utd have been set a more ‘realistic price’ by RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko that Arsenal would have paid for their top target. Yikes.",

      "While selling clubs prepare a wedge of Man Utd tax to put on their strikers, we’ve entered the mind of Ruben Amorim to rank their top ten targets.",

      "We also have the best available strikers, attacking midfielders, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Mario Gila (Lazio)\nA player going under the radar in Serie A is Lazio defender Gila. The uncapped Spaniard turns 25 in August and is under contract at the Stadio Olimpico until 2027, so there is likely some degree of willingness to sell this summer.",
      "Lazio picked him up from Real Madrid for around £5million in July 2022, and he’s gone on to play 84 times for the Italian giants, scoring two goals.",
      "Comfortable and confident on the ball, Gila is an astute defender and would be a top signing for any big club looking to bolster their defence.",
      "",
      "9) Ousmane Diomande (Sporting)\nThe Ivorian has previously been linked with Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham, but FA Cup winners Crystal Palace seem the most likely, even if that rumour has gone very quiet.",
      "Jarell Quansah’s move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen hasn’t quite triggered a transfer domino effect in the Premier League, though the Premier League champions have ramped up their pursuit of Palace captain Marc Guehi. No bid has been made or seems close, but if he leaves the Eagles, Oliver Glasner must get his replacement right. Diomande would be a coup and a safe option in that regard.",
      "READ: Palace should be ‘genuinely astounded’ by Arsenal, Liverpool part-exchange offers for Eze and Guehi",
      "",
      "8) Giorgio Scalvini (Atalanta)\nThere are question marks over two things: Scalvini’s availability and Scalvini’s injury record. One report from Italy says he is ‘unsellable’, but Fabrizio Romano claims Newcastle United want him and ‘more clubs are keen’, with Atalanta receiving ‘initial approaches’. That certainly sounds like he’s ‘sellable’ — but only for big, big money.",
      "The 21-year-old tore his ACL last June and was restricted to a mere eight appearances across all competitions in 2024/25, starting five times. After recovering from the serious knee injury, the young Italian was eased back in before suffering a shoulder injury in December, missing two games. He then injured the same shoulder in January and didn’t feature again for the rest of the season. That’s 42 games missed for Atalanta since the ACL injury 13 months ago.",
      "The potential is still there, but you can understand the reluctance to break the bank. If he wasn’t so unlucky with injuries, he’d be a lot higher here.",
      "",
      "7) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nAfter a season-ending injury to Gabriel Magalhaes on April Fool’s Day, Kiwior came into the Arsenal starting XI and did pretty well, staking a claim for a big-money transfer this summer – or more minutes for the Gunners in the Premier League.",
      "Knowing Arsenal, they’ll struggle to get £30m, but really ought to be demanding closer to £45m, especially if the aforementioned Quansah cost Leverkusen £35m. The fact Kiwior is left-footed surely adds £10m to his value too. Apparently, that’s the world we live in now.",
      "",
      "6) Antonio Silva (Benfica)\nChelsea and Manchester United are among the clubs to be linked with the Benfica defender, who apparently “wants Juventus”, per his agent Jorge Mendes.",
      "Benfica are known to be difficult negotiators, and talks over Silva will likely be no exception. He’s expected to be the next big-money sale after ex-Red Devils youngster Alvaro Carreras joined Real Madrid earlier this summer.",

      "",
      "5) Goncalo Inacio (Sporting)\nThere’s a £51m release clause in Inacio’s Sporting contract and Manchester United have been linked for a while – long before Ruben Amorim left the Portuguese club for Old Trafford. Amorim would surely push for his signing, but United are prioritising other positions and don’t have the financial flexibility to go big on a centre-back.",
      "Separating Inacio, Silva and Diomande wasn’t easy. I don’t watch Portuguese football too often…for my sins. But you don’t need to watch Sporting every week to know this boy is very good. With United surely out of the picture, it’s unclear where Inacio will end up. Maybe Liverpool will get involved if they can’t lure Guehi away from Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "4) Loic Bade (Sevilla)\nThere is some bias here, believe it or not. Bade was identified by yours truly as a centre-back for the future when he was playing in Ligue 2 with Le Havre, so it’s absolutely imperative that he gets a big transfer and becomes recognised as one of the best defenders in Europe.",
      "Bade did get a decent move to Rennes for £15m when he was 21, but it didn’t really happen for him there. Then came the bizarre Nottingham Forest loan that lasted four months and produced zero appearances. He’s found a home in Seville, though, and has been impressing for them since joining in January 2023, straight after leaving Forest.",
      "The French international helped Sevilla win the Europa League in his first six months and signed permanently for around £10m. He’s been a top signing and is ready for a proper crack at the Premier League.",
      "",
      "3) Carlos Lukeba (RB Leipzig)\nReal Madrid are one of the clubs being linked with the 22-year-old, which does a lot of the talking for us, really.",
      "There are high hopes for Lukeba, who hopefully doesn’t follow in the footsteps of another French Leipzig defender, Mohamed Simakan, by moving to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Newcastle clearly want a new centre-back but could be put off by Lukeba’s left-footedness, with a long-term Sven Botman partner the priority, though the Dutchman has proved to be very injury-prone. Liverpool could emerge as a very serious option with another French ex-Leipzig defender, Ibrahima Konate, being fiercely linked with Real Madrid.",
      "He has a €90m (£77.5m) release clause, which surely won’t be triggered this summer. It’ll be interesting to see Leipzig’s stance if offers come in, especially with Benjamin Sesko likely to stay.",
      "",
      "2) Edmond Tapsoba (Bayer Leverkusen)\nOn a list full of children, Tapsoba stands out as an old fogey, aged 26. There are younger options, but there aren’t many better. Plus he has the benefit of entering his prime years having proven himself in a wonderful team.",
      "The Burkina Faso defender played 46 times for Leverkusen in 2023/24, when they lost just once all season, in the Europa League final against Atalanta.",
      "He featured nine times in the Champions League and is clearly good enough to make the step up, if he so desires. Leverkusen are still a very good side, even without Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong; we wouldn’t blame him for staying.",
      "Transfer speculation has significantly died down, but all it takes is one Fabrizio Romano post on X, folks, and then every club is interested.",
      "",
      "1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nYou can argue about Guehi’s ‘availability’, but with a year left on his contract and interest from Premier League champions Liverpool, Crystal Palace should be open to selling their captain for the right price. Losing him on a free would be disastrous in the eyes of many, though there is a case for keeping him ahead of a Europa Conference League campaign. Is an extra year worth more than a potential £50m transfer fee?",

Jashari has made it clear that Milan is his preferred destination, but if negotiations with the Belgian club continue to stall, a move elsewhere can’t be ruled out. Given his stance, playing for Brugge again seems unlikely.",

      "",
      "9) Angelo Stiller (Stuttgart)\nIt’s unlikely that Stiller leaves Stuttgart this summer, but as a standout performer outside of the Champions League spotlight, he could be tempted by a bigger move.",
      "The 24-year-old four-cap Germany international signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract in January, with Fabrizio Romano confirming that ‘several clubs’ wanted to sign him in the summer transfer window.",
      "Valued at €45million (£39m) on Transfermarkt, Stiller played 47 times across all competitions last season, assisting an impressive 11 times from defensive midfield.",
      "",
      "8) Douglas Luiz (Juventus)\nThe former Aston Villa midfielder left England to ease Profit and Sustainability pressures last summer. He had been superb in 2023/24, but his debut season in Italy was anything but.",
      "Injuries kept him in and out of the Juventus squad and, when fit, he failed to make himself undroppable. Consistency eluded him, in part due to a lack of rhythm, and he never really got going. We all know what Luiz is capable of, and there’s rumoured interest from the Premier League. Based on his Villa form, £30million – his reported asking price – could be a snip.",

      "AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been linked, but Porto aren’t in the mood to do business on the cheap, especially after tying him down to a five-year contract in May.",

      "Fulham didn’t suffer without him and Palhinha barely featured for Bayern, starting just nine matches in all competitions and failing to hit 1,000 minutes across the campaign.

      "The Danish international scored against England at Euro 2024, but it’s the rest of his game that’s got Europe’s elite taking notice. He’s now Sporting captain and, at 26, has the tools to become a world-class holding midfielder if he picks the right next step.",
      "",
      "4) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe may reluctantly sanction Mainoo’s sale this summer to fund a rebuild, but only for a suitably ridiculous fee. Chelsea have been linked, though they already have more young midfielders than minutes to give them.",
      "Mainoo was once untouchable at Old Trafford, but INEOS-era chaos has quickly changed that. It’s surprising that he hasn’t nailed down a role under Ruben Amorim – stylistically, he fits – but he’s not looked fully sharp this year.",

      "Even if the deal suits the immediate needs of all involved, the details of the agreement that takes Marcus Rashford from Manchester United to Barcelona reflect well on none of the signatories.",
      "The two clubs are settling somewhat but Rashford, at least, has got what he really wanted and probably more than he deserves. In Catalonia right now, in between thanking his lucky stars, the 27-year-old is practising his keepie-uppies ahead of being officially unveiled as a Barca player.",
      "None of this is how Rashford should be leaving United. If you were told a couple of years ago that the academy graduate would be swapping Old Trafford for the Nou Camp, the expectation might have been for Rashford to be revered and waved off with the warmest wishes of everyone at his boyhood club, while United banked a massive fee following a decade of stellar service.",
      "Instead, after witnessing a couple of years of apathy, most Stretford End-ers will shrug wearily while Rashford becomes the chief beneficiary of Barca’s financial ineptitude that made their primary targets unattainable.",
      "Doubtless, some of United’s online fanbase will be somewhat more animated. Many of Paul Pogba’s loons latched on to Rashford as the subject of their fanaticism and, to them, the player could no wrong. It’s always the manager at Manchester United.",
      "The truth is, for the breakdown of the bond between Rashford and United, there is plenty of blame to go around.",
      "Rashford can be excused a good deal of frustration over how his boyhood club was run for the most of the nine years since he burst into Louis van Gaal’s first-team. Too often in that time, he was one of the few certainties among the chaos and, as a local academy graduate, a throwback to the values United still claim to represent.",
      "As recently as two years ago, Rashford looked set to cement a hero’s legacy at United when he became the first player in the post-Ferguson era to score 30 goals in a season.",
      "Then he just seemed to get sick of it. All of it.",
      "You would have to be an extreme optimist to view as a mere coincidence the peak of Rashford’s performance coming around contract renewal time. Almost as soon as the ink was dry on a £325,000-a-week deal, Rashford’s form and focus vanished – only to be rediscovered this summer when it became clear that Barca might be an option after all.",
      "Perhaps only Rashford and those closest to him really understand what happened, but to many outsiders looking in, the love was gone. First for United, then football. Whatever might have been going on in his mind, he just looked thoroughly fed up with his lot.",
      "On the pitch, even pretending to press became too much of a chore. In possession, the blinkers narrowed. Not as they tend to on the most ruthless of marksmen; whether he simply lost faith in those around him – not unimaginable at United – it became about self before side. And by 2023, his questionable decision-making was no longer limited to between the white lines.",
      "MORE MARCUS RASHFORD COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 Rashford’s Manchester United actions must speak far louder than his thousands of empty words\n👉 Rashford transfer ‘almost’ collapses but Manchester United ‘are the biggest winners’ of £25m loan",
      "It was a human response. Here was a lad still rooted in his hometown, earning wealth for generations in his mid-20s, carrying more of the burden than many of his team-mates for United’s failings. Many would struggle with such expectation in that environment. Especially when factions of the right-wing press were still going after him for the heinous act of feeding children at a time of national crisis.",
      "Rashford’s activism and advocacy, prompting more changes in government policy than any recent opposition party, should not be forgotten by a soul, least not anyone at United. They were more than happy to bathe in Rashford’s reflective glory. That pride should never fade.",
      "Those things considered – plus more than one debilitating injury through which he played, and upheaval in his personal life – few among us are entitled to judge Rashford harshly for allowing his halo to slip. Perhaps we should give him more credit for the fact it didn’t happen sooner.",
      "But since the back end of 2023, after signing his contract that summer, Rashford simply hasn’t seemed interested in rediscovering the form that earned that mega-deal. Even a pretence was too much. By the time Erik ten Hag was sacked, Rashford seemed to care not one jot how he was perceived by Ruben Amorim or anyone else at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim struggled to contain his befuddlement at the wider mess he inherited at United, but he saw no reason to sugar-coat the reality when it came to Rashford. “You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench, but I would put [goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn’t give the maximum every day.”",
      "That is damning. How bad must things have got with Rashford, since his partner in pre-derby crime, Alejandro Garnacho, continued to be used until Amorim could tolerate him no more?",
      "Amorim’s keeper coach craic came towards the end of a run of a dozen games Rashford sat out amid a transfer request of sorts. Not a real transfer request, of course. Why go to the bother of writing a letter that will cost millions in needlessly-sacrificed salary when you can just use Henry Winter’s X account to tell the world you are ‘ready for a new challenge’ and still get paid?",
      "The misguided belief among Rashford and his people seemed to be that he would have his pick of clubs in January. Barca were mentioned then; in terms of profile, AC Milan sounded a good match too. So perhaps it was slightly more humbling to find himself parked at Aston Villa rather than flying into a European giant.",
      "Even there, Rashford was on the bench more than Unai Emery’s starting XI in the Premier League, and when given the choice to sign the temporary No.9 on a permanent basis, the Villans thought better of it.",
      "All of which makes us wonder if this move to the actual FC Barcelona is a karmic consequence of all the child-feeding and Tory-bothering. Because, as Teddy Sheringham said, this is a grand opportunity that Rashford’s performances and mindset have not merited.",
      "Maybe he should be careful what he wished for. Rashford’s ‘dream’ of signing for Barca could turn sour very quickly if the financially-illiterate club is unable to register him with La Liga. Until they juggle their finances to creep back under the league’s salary limit, it remains a very real possibility.",
      "No-one back in his hometown wants Rashford thrust into that nightmare scenario, even if the stench of burnt bridges fills the Manchester air.",
      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Man Utd.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford was reportedly told what he must to do succeed at Barcelona in a meeting with Hansi Flick.",
      "Man Utd’s Marcus Rashford faces a nervy wait to finalise his loan move to Barcelona amid a summer of issues for the Catalan club.",
      "Marcus Rashford was ‘almost scuppered’ in his mission to join Barcelona from Manchester United because of a slight delay from back-up airport of choice."

      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",

      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Already linked with Manchester United and West Ham, Parma's Zion Suzuki is one of the great young goalkeeping talents. Adam Bate speaks to those who have worked with the Japan international to find out why clubs are so excited about his potential...",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:19, UK",
      "It seems inevitable that Zion Suzuki will move to the Premier League one day. Already courted by Manchester United and West Ham, it is just a matter of when. The hype is justified. This 22-year-old Japan international is seen as a new breed of goalkeeper.",
      "It is by design. Japan have been throwing resources at football with a specific target in mind. Project 2050. The aim is to win a World Cup by then. Frans Hoek, the legendary goalkeeping coach, has been tasked with identifying the traits of the goalkeeper of the future.",
      "In Suzuki, back when he was sat among the substitutes for Urawa Red Diamonds, Hoek spotted all the ingredients required to do it all. \"I saw him in a camp and said, 'This guy has to go to Europe as soon as possible. It does not matter what league it is. He has to play.'\"",
      "And so, Suzuki embarked on the adventure that has taken him to Belgium with Sint-Truiden, onto Italy with Parma and now linked with some of the richest clubs in Europe. Still only 22, the only question is when to make the leap. Those who know him do not doubt his talent.",
      "\"He is a really quiet guy, a really calm character. That is him off the pitch.\" On the pitch, Suzuki becomes something else entirely. He dominates. \"He is really aggressive because he has massive physical strength.\" He is 6'3\" but looks bigger. \"He is so powerful, so dynamic.\"",
      "That physicality clearly underpins his potential. \"It is like his body is just made of muscles. And I have never seen in my life a goalkeeper who can jump higher. His physical tests were off the charts.\" But it is what this physicality enables him to do that is particularly intriguing.",
      "Rudel enjoys telling the story of one of his first sessions with Suzuki. As the goalkeeper coach, he was setting up a drill. \"I said to him, 'Okay, now show me how far you can throw.' I looked away and then saw this ball flying 20 metres over the halfway line,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I turned around and said to him, 'I told you to throw it not kick it.' He just smiled back at me and replied, 'But I did throw it.' I told him to show me again because I could not believe that someone had that much power in their body that they could throw the ball that far.\"",
      "Rudel rates Suzuki as \"above average\" with his feet but as has been seen with Ederson at Manchester City, the tactical significance of being able to pass short and long has increased. Suzuki ranked third for long passes in Serie A last season and second for throws.",
      "In Belgium, Rudel remembers some stunning saves away to Club Brugge, with one stop in particular becoming his trademark. \"It is those low saves because he is so dynamic and so quick to get down. He has unbelievable reflexes. For me, that is his biggest strength.\"",
      "There have been many examples of that for Parma. One down to his left to keep out Tijjani Reijnders' shot for AC Milan in the San Siro stands out, while the save away to Empoli against Ismael Konate was similar. Denying Como's Marc Kempf a headed goal was even better.",
      "The pick of the lot came against Roma in February when he produced an outrageous double save that defied belief. After keeping out Matias Soule's shot, he somehow scrambled to claw away Anass Salah-Eddine's follow-up. It was the save of the season.",
      "\"With those low power saves, his arms are so strong,\" says Rudel in reference to the technique behind it. \"Sometimes when goalkeepers go down fast and get their fingers to the ball, it still goes backwards. That never happens to him. He has crazy power in his hands.\"",
      "What makes Suzuki so fascinating is that he combines these reflex stops with a commanding presence. Think of the great goalkeepers and they tend to favour one or the other. But Suzuki does more than get down low to make saves, he gets high to snuff out the danger.",
      "He caught 55 crosses for Parma last season, 21 more than his nearest rival in Serie A. Across Europe's five major leagues, only Joan Garcia, snapped up by Barcelona this summer, claimed more crosses. Outside the area, Suzuki ranked second in Serie A for sweeping up.",
      "There are still things to work on, as one might expect of a goalkeeper who is still only 22 years old. He also dropped nine catches - a Serie A high - reflecting the fact that this desire to be proactive comes with risk. But he continues to progress, a theme of his short career.",
      "\"That is another of his strengths and why I am convinced that he can perform in the Premier League,\" says Rudel. \"He went from Japan to Belgium and then Belgium to Italy. Those are big adaptations but he did it really quickly. That is what separates the really good ones.\"",
      "Asked if Suzuki will go to the very top, Rudel has no doubts. \"One hundred per cent.\" The only question is how best to manage the journey. Some advise him to wait and play one more season with Parma. But sooner or later, Zion Suzuki will make a very big move.",

      "AC Milan are also keen on Jackson, but talks via intermediaries have highlighted a gap in valuation. Milan also have United's Rasmus Hojlund on their list, as well as Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta.",
      "Chelsea are not actively trying to sell any of their players. There continues to be interest in Jackson from multiple clubs, especially as strikers are in demand and short supply this summer. At the moment, Jackson is staying at Stamford Bridge, but that is not guaranteed to be the case by the time the window closes.",
      "Watkins' future at Aston Villa has been the subject of further speculation this summer after Arsenal made an approach for him in January.",
      "Although he is 29 and not expected to demand the same fee as a Sesko or Gyokeres, the England international's quality means he is on the list of a lot of top clubs this summer.",

      "There is no doubt Watkins could provide a quality addition to any team, but Villa will not let him go easily - he has and continues to be an incredibly important player for them.",

      "The Nigeria international was on loan at the Turkish club from Napoli last season, and the two parties have reached an agreement for Osimhen.",
      "Galatasaray are paying £64.9m (€75m) in three instalments in a deal which includes a 10 per cent sell-on clause for Napoli.",
      "They have also negotiated a clause that means Galatasaray would have to pay a penalty to Napoli if Osimhen is sold to another Italian club over the next two years.",

      "Arsenal are thought to be finalising the bonus payments with Sporting, after agreeing the fixed fee of £55m over a week ago.",
      "Arsenal are expected to pay a further £8.5m in add-ons, and negotiations have been around the conditions of those bonus payments, with the hope that Gyokeres plays some part in the club's pre-season tour.",

      "Report as Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against Leeds; Matheus Cunha made his debut but United failed to show much attacking improvement; Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar, but Leeds had good chances through Largie Ramazani",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 21:51, UK",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "After Ruben Amorim's side recorded their worst-scoring Premier League campaign last term with 44 goals, there were little signs of improvement in front of goal despite starting new £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha, who played the first half.",
      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",
      "Man Utd then had the best chance of the afternoon as the clock ticked into 90 as Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from a corner from just two yards out, with Ayden Heaven finding Meslier on the rebound from a similar distance.",
      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is on his way to complete a £71m move to Manchester, but there is still a lot left to be desired about Amorim's attack on the basis of this showing.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim to MUTV:",
      "\"It was a pre-season game. The distances between the sectors were really big sometimes. We suffered a little bit when we tried to press high, they kicked the ball high and won the second balls. They were dangerous in those moments.",
      "\"We have a lack of pace. Especially in the middle of the park, you can feel it's hard to bring the ball. But we created chances. We have a lot to do, but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams. A good test.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team [Wolves]. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",
      "On Diego Leon's debut at left wing-back: \"We have to understand that the kid came from Paraguay. It's his second week at Manchester United. He did really well, he's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.",
      "\"The environment is really good. Of course sometimes we are going to struggle, but what I felt in the first moment is that if we are going to struggle, we will struggle together. That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",

      "Manchester United, it's almost like you never left.",
      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",
      "Obi taking the ball off Cunha's toes and Amorim admitting his relationship with Fernandes \"is not there yet\" meant it was a slow start in his new colours.",
      "And Hojlund's display showed more frustration - falling over the ball at one stage in the box and then getting in the way of a late Dorgu strike.",
      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
      "Amad Diallo also looked sharp at wing-back - which is important in the context of Mbeumo coming into the team.",
      "But United need a lot more than the Brentford man to improve this attacking set-up. There's still a need for a new striker, plus more clarity in midfield and out wide.",
      "There's now less than a month to go until United's Premier League opener with Arsenal. An awful lot still needs to change on the pitch if Amorim's project is going to take off.",
