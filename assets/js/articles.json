      "A deal for England Under-21 star Liam Delap to join Manchester United was all but done before a last-minute change of heart, it has been claimed. Delap instead joined Chelsea, with the opportunity to play Champions League football said to be a factor.",
      "United were 90 minutes away from securing Champions League football themselves, only to lose the Europa League final against Tottenham in Bilbao. They have still been able to lure top attacking talent to Old Trafford, but Delap appears to be the first star they missed out on as a result of that European failure.",
      "According to The Mail, United's deal for Delap was '90 percent done'. A £30million release clause came into play when his previous club Ipswich Town got relegated, and Ruben Amorim's side were in the box seat before Chelsea swooped in.",
      "The same outlet reports that Matheus Cunha - another player with a release clause - was United's top target. They got that deal wrapped up early, also adding Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to their ranks, though a relatively cut-price Delap deal could have had a knock-on effect on the club's wider transfer business.",
      "Delap didn't take long to get off the mark for Chelsea, netting in a Club World Cup group stage victory over Esperance. His Premier League progress has been derailed by injury, though, and he hasn't played since limping off against Fulham in August.",
      "United's new starting striker Sesko has been eased in, despite a relative lack of other options. His first three league outings all came from the bench, and it wasn't until appearance number six that the Slovenia star scored his first goal for his new employers.",
      "Sesko followed his close-range effort at Brentford with a second United goal in the win against Sunderland before the international break. That victory lifted Amorim's team back up into the top half, but pressure remains ahead of Sunday's trip to Liverpool.",
      "\"Of course, he was anxious for his first goal,\" Amorim said of Sesko before the Sunderland game. \"The thing I like most in Ben is, even when things are hard for him with the ball, he is working hard in every minute of the game. That is the most important thing in the moment.\"",
      "While United's match away to Liverpool will provide a big test, Chelsea have what looks on paper like a more inviting game when they return from the international break. Enzo Maresca's team are off to the City Ground to face Nottingham Forest, who sit a point outside the relegation places and haven't won since the opening weekend of the season.",
      "The game is set to come too soon for Delap to feature, though. The striker remains out of action with the hamstring injury he sustained against Fulham, and isn't expected back until November or perhaps December.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are confident in securing a deal to purchase land around Old Trafford which can open the way for their lofty Old Trafford ambitions. The Red Devils are looking to build a brand-new £2billion stadium capable of holding around 100,000 people, where their current, leaky home is.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe first laid out these ambitions by describing the club's vision as the 'Wembley of the North'. A 100,000-seater stadium would see United own the biggest stadium in the country, with current leader Wembley Stadium holding 90,000 spectators.",
      "However, their ambitions have recently been complicated by an ongoing issue with a vital part of land close to the Stretford End. United do not own this specific space, which belongs to Freightliner.",
      "Reports from the Daily Mail claim that the 13-time Premier League winners have offered £50m to purchase the land. Unfortunately for the Reds, it's also said Freightliner are looking for £400m.",
      "United believe the government could intervene to set a fair price by making a compulsory purchase order. But this may not be necessary, as the same report states that United officials have engaged in \"constructive\" talks with Freightliner and are confident a deal is only a matter of months away.",
      "If United can purchase the land, they can move forward in their ambitions for the new Old Trafford. In March, futuristic designs of a bigger Old Trafford created by Lord Norman Foster, featuring an enormous canopy, were presented.",
      "Previous reports understand the stadium costs are in the ballpark of around £2bn. The land owned by Freightliner is believed to be part of the new stadium footprint, which is made up of 17,000 homes.",
      "It already has the support of the mayor of Manchester, Andy Burnham, who suggested he may sign off on compulsory purchase orders. In August, after telling BBC Radio Manchester an order could be signed \"if needed,\" he said: \"The Greater Manchester Combined Authority has approved the establishment of a mayoral development corporation (MDC) to oversee a masterplan of the area to facilitate some of the land assembly.",
      "\"But there's plenty that can be done if an agreement cannot be reached. The real action is only going to get going in the autumn with the MDC.\"",
      "Moreover, United are believed to be funding the construction of the stadium themselves, but are eager for the government to stump up for the wider infrastructure included within the project. The club is hopeful to be in the new Old Trafford by the 2030-31 campaign.",
      "Reports from the Athletic have also stated United were contemplating the introduction of 'Personal Seat Licences' which could result in fans having to pay up to £4,000 for the right to buy a season ticket at the new venue. This scheme, which is widespread at US sporting events, is also believed to be optional and would mainly concern seats in the premium areas of the stadium.",
      "Fans are currently being asked to present their feedback on facilities, cost, and other aspects of the plans.",

      "Despite a rocky start at Old Trafford, the Slovenian has found his footing, scoring in his last two games including a crucial goal in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland before the international break. Meanwhile, 22-year-old Hojlund was shipped off to Napoli on a season-long loan in September.",
      "The Serie A club has an obligation to permanently sign the Danish forward if they secure a Champions League spot next season. Hojlund has hit the ground running in Naples, netting four goals in his first six outings.",
      "United legend Schmeichel is baffled by the club's decision, criticising his former team for their transfer strategy and blaming their creative players for Hojlund's struggles.",
      "\"The signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years,\" Schmeichel voiced his concerns on BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "\"You only have to see what he's doing at Napoli with Kevin de Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with - he's scoring goals. I've consistently said this for two-and-a-half years - Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goal-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "\"We let him go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service.",
      "\"You spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don't have the number six we should have, and there's the goalkeeping position as well.\"",
      "Schmeichel went on to highlight other urgent matters at United requiring immediate attention, particularly between the sticks.",
      "\"This season alone we've conceded nine goals from goalkeeping errors,\" he continued. \"When I played, when Edwin van der Sar played, when David de Gea played, the brief was win 10 points a season, you don't give points away.",
      "\"Why did we bring someone in that we didn't need? Because the head of recruitment comes from Leipzig [also Sesko's former club] and he's got to make a mark.",
      "\"When I played, the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson] was in charge. He said 'him in and him out'. Now it's different people with different agendas that decide. How can you create a stable environment to have a football team that can go out and win every game?\"",

      "Manchester United are now reportedly eyeing a swoop for Crystal Palace's midfield maestro Adam Wharton, pushing Brighton's Carlos Baleba down their transfer wish-list. Ruben Amorim is known to be on the chase for midfield reinforcements moving forward.",
      "Last summer, United were heavily linked with Brighton's Baleba, but a deal didn't happen after the lion's share of their budget was splashed on bolstering the attack. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko were all added to the squad.",
      "Brighton chairman Tony Bloom has since confirmed United's interest in Baleba. However, talks with the Premier League side never advanced beyond initial contact last summer, as the Seagulls were believed to be holding out for a hefty £115million fee – a figure they compared to Chelsea's deal for Moises Caicedo – if they were to let their star man go at that stage.",
      "Despite that steep price tag, rumours continue to swirl linking Baleba with a move to Old Trafford in both the January and next summer's transfer windows, However, United have also been keeping tabs on other midfield talents, including Palace man Wharton.",
      "Reports now suggest that the England international has leapfrogged Baleba in United's transfer pecking order. According to the i paper, Amorim is a big fan of Wharton, particularly due to knack for kick-starting attacks with forward passes.",
      "Baleba's inconsistent start to the season with Brighton has also reportedly raised eyebrows at Old Trafford. While Brighton are expected to demand a hefty sum of over £100million, for Baleba, it's believed that Wharton could be secured for a lesser amount, although the exact figure Palace would demand remains uncertain.",
      "The club is keen on securing a replacement before letting go of their midfielder, making a summer transfer more probable than a January one. It's also reported that United are prepared to wait patiently to bring the right player into the fold.",
      "The choice between Wharton and Baleba appears to be a dilemma that United will face in the upcoming transfer windows - whether that's in January or next summer. It seems their position from just a few months ago may have shifted, with Wharton now emerging as the priority target over his Premier League rival.",

Some fans may want to see Ruben Amorim's side go back in for the Cameroon international next year, but treble-winner Brown believes Wharton is the better signing.",
      "The 21-year-old has taken the Premier League by storm since moving to Selhurst Park from Blackburn in February 2024. When asked whom he'd like to see United sign out of Wharton or Baleba in 2026, there was no doubt who was the superior candidate.",
      "\"I’d have to go for Adam Wharton. I love him, and I think it’s always good if you can add an English player to the squad,\" he told 10Bet Casino. \"He’s strong, he’s talented, he’s technically good, and he knows his job on the pitch. He knows the Premier League and I’d have no problem if United bring him in.",
      "\"I think he could maybe be the right replacement for Casemiro. He’s not going to be there for years to come, and it might be time for that position to be freshened up. The midfield is all about combinations and partnerships, so if Wharton comes in he’d have to be able to link up with the players we’ve already got.",
      "\"We saw for England when it was Scholes, Lampard and Gerrard, you can’t just shove your best players into a team and hope it works. It’s not as simple as that. You need a manager to make sure the combinations are right, and for Wharton, I think he would be the right man for that position in midfield.\"",
      "It's possible two slots are set to open up in United's midfield next year as Casemiro's contract runs down to its expiry date. Kobbie Mainoo is also being slated for a departure after struggling to work his way into the Amorim's plans.",
      "Wharton's stock has gone nowhere but up since he moved to south London last year. Not only has the player earned his way into Thomas Tuchel's England reckoning, but he also played a huge role in getting Palace to Europe and securing the club's first major title following last year's FA Cup triumph.",
      "Not only that, but it appears he would be significantly cheaper than Baleba if the £60m figure attached to his name proves accurate.",

      "Amorim had previously claimed that his players were being influenced by high-profile pundits' criticism of his system ahead of their match against Sunderland. His side's victory over the newly promoted side has quietened the noise around his future and United's struggles, but that hasn't stopped the Portuguese boss from absorbing criticism for the way he's handled the situation.",

      "But since the 7-0 Anfield humiliation under Erik ten Hag in March 2023, the Old Trafford club have drawn their last two away games at Liverpool.",
      "And former Manchester United forward Dublin said: “This is one of one of two or three games in the season which just level out. We know that Liverpool have been better than Manchester United for many, many years. But this is a rivalry, it is tribalism - it could go either way. As an ex-Man United player, I want them to win the game.",
      "“They are due to have a very potent, winning game. Liverpool watch out - it is going to be a close one. Liverpool have lost their last three games - this is where they can be at their most dangerous because they may not be in their stride but they have got so many amazing, world-class players. If they turn it on, nobody can live with them. I am hoping they don’t turn it on. But if they do, it is going to be some game.”",
      "Manchester United finished 15th last season and have already suffered a humiliating defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup in this campaign.",
      "“Man United have to be in the top four - that is it,” added Dublin. “And that is a low estimate for Manchester United football club. They should be winning the Premier League, they should be getting into the Champions League every single year. Where they are right now, European football would be a good season.",
      "“If Man United win on Sunday, they will be in a better place mentally. I think there will be more harmony in the dressing room. Beating Liverpool for Man United has got to be the stepping stone where they need to go: ‘We have beaten one of the best teams in the world, never mind the Premier League. This is when we have to start turning it on’.”",
      "The title race is open with Liverpool, who started their Premier League defence with five consecutive wins, getting overtaken at the top by Arsenal before the break. The top two were the biggest spenders over the summer but Dublin does not see a two-horse race.",
      "“It is a tough one to call,” added the Homes Under The Hammer presenter. “Hard to look past Liverpool, Arsenal have been outstanding yet again. Are they going to get over the line this time after going so close? Man City are now going to be a little bit angry because they have been out of the picture. They want to get silverware. Chelsea as well. So many sides. I think if Liverpool start to get in their stride, they could be hard to catch.”",

      "Hojlund bagged 26 goals in 95 appearances for United but only 14 in the Premier League. That saw club chiefs move to replenish the forward line by signing Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for £200m. But Scholes believes United are repeating a mistake of the past, with 50-year-old claiming they have put the 22-year-old Sesko under the exact same pressure as Hojlund.",
      "\"You look at Rasmus Hojlund, 22-year-old kid, came when he was 20 years of age,' Scholes said on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast. \"One centre-forward for Manchester United and everything was on him, the pressure was on him and he couldn't handle it. He should be coming in and out of the team. There should be three or four centre-forwards there.",
      "\"This summer, what do they do? They let him go and they buy another one, very similar, exactly the same! 22 years of age.",
      "\"He's started ok, he looks like he's getting better. But where's the common sense in that?\"",
      "Sesko has two goals in his last two Premier League matches but Hojlund has found things easier away from Old Trafford. With competition from Lorenzo Lucca, the striker has been on fire for Napoli and scored four goals in six matches.",
      "Scholes highlighted the difference at United now, compared to the past when Ole Gunnar Solksjaer arrived. The Norwegian finished as the top goalscorer amid competition from Eric Cantona and Andy Cole, while Teddy Sheringham arrived at the end of the season.",
      "\"It's like Ole coming over to us when he was 22 and we had no other centre-forward and he was the one playing every week,\" Scholes said. \"You'd kill him!\"",
      "Nicky Butt agreed with his team-mate. \"That's us as well, when we played,\" he said. \"They all talk about our group coming through. But we didn't play every game, we weren't in every week with all the pressure on our shoulders.",
      "\"You look to your left and you'd have Roy Keane, you look to your right and you'd have Bryan Robson or Brian McClair.",
      "\"You're surrounded by unbelievable players and you think, it's easy for me because I can play 6 out of 10 today and we're still going to win because we've got all these players around us. They don't have that now. I do feel sorry for the players.\"",

      "Manchester United icon Roy Keane's position regarding a managerial comeback appears crystal clear, according to Martin O'Neill. The 73-year-old collaborated with the former United midfielder whilst they were in control of the Republic of Ireland national squad, though both departed that role in 2018.",
      "The duo would later reunite at the City Ground for a short period overseeing Nottingham Forest in 2019, but neither have accepted a coaching position since that time. Both ex-players have dedicated recent years to media work as pundits, though Keane was strongly connected with the available managerial role at Sunderland in 2022, before Alex Neil's appointment.",
      "Whilst Keane hasn't completely dismissed a managerial comeback, the 54-year-old appears satisfied with his punditry work, featuring on television programmes and podcasts.",
      "Keane recently disclosed that he was interviewed by the FAI regarding the Republic of Ireland manager's position before Heimir Hallgrimsson's appointment.",
      "\"I would doubt it very much,\" O'Neill told OLBG when asked if Keane would be the next Republic of Ireland manager.",
      "\"However, as I'm getting older and he is enjoying himself in life, seems to be, know, he's doing all his punditry to work and getting adverts on TV and things like this here.",
      "\"So I'm quite sure he's probably not thinking about going into management.",
      "\"But if he did and asked me along as the assistant, you know, to have a little cigarette mainly... or as a chief scout for him living down in southern Italy.",
      "\"Yes, I'll take that. I'll take that all day long.\"",
      "Keane has hinted at a potential move overseas in the future. \"In the next couple of years, I reckon I will be moving abroad... putting it out there,\" he revealed to the Overlap trio Jamie Carragher, Ian Wright and Gary Neville during their On Tour episode in Turin.",
      "When quizzed about his preferred destination, Keane responded: \"Do you know what, Switzerland, maybe? Switzerland is beautiful.\"",

      "Former Juventus and Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba will need to keep waiting patiently to return to action. Monaco had hoped to welcome the Frenchman back to action against Angers this weekend, but the game looks to have come too soon.",
      "Pogba has not stepped on a pitch in more than two years, having been handed a ban following a positive doping test during his time with Juventus. The ban was reduced on appeal after his offence was ruled not to have been intentional, and he moved to Monaco ahead of the 2025/26 season.",
      "There had been some hope that a return to form might see the 2018 World Cup winner push himself into contention for the 2026 tournament after missing Qatar 2022 through injury. More than two months into the season, though, he's still waiting to make his bow.",
      "“We expected him to be available for the next match. That is no longer the case,\" Monaco CEO Thiago Scuro told reporters (as translated by GFFN). \"Paul had a small problem last week that will cost us at least two more weeks.",
      "\"It is the first negative episode that we have had since we started the process with him. Given how long he has been out of activity, it can happen. It isn’t the end of the world; we have just postponed for two weeks to prepare him better. We hope to have him available soon.”",
      "There had been hope that Pogba might be able to feature against Tottenham in Monaco's next Champions League match, immediately after the Angers tie. The team from the principality are winless across their first two European games, with Eric Dier rescuing a late point against Manchester City after a 4-1 away loss against Club Brugge on matchday one.",
      "That will come too soon, though, with Pogba also expected to miss out against Toulouse on October 25. The midfielder was also unable to play a single minute under Adi Hutter, the manager who brought him to Stade Louis II, with the Austrian dismissed during the October international break.",
      "Monaco have acted quickly to appoint Hutter's successor, with Sebastien Pogocnoli taking the reins. The Belgian, who had a spell playing in the Premier League with West Bromwich Albion, arrives after leading Union SG into the Champions League.",
      "“I think that the process and the alignment of ideas on playing principles, the hunger to work on player development, which Sébastien has shown, and all of the staff that we have around the coach and the players, is all the security that we have to reduce the risk [of moving on from Hutter],\" Scuro said of the new appointment. \"Of course, there is risk, but we are ready to manage the risk and build another good season.”",

Jeremy has covered football, rugby and cricket World Cups, as well as Wimbledon, the golf majors and the Olympics.",
      "Bruno Fernandes can be forgiven for being tired. Because he has carried Manchester United on his back for longer than he will care to remember.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim became United manager almost 12 months, no-one has made more appearances than Fernandes. And no-one has done more to try and lift his side out of the doldrums than the Portuguese midfielder.",
      "So it will come as no surprise Fernandes faced accusations of being jaded during Portugal's 2-2 draw with Hungary in a World Cup qualifier. On a miserable night for Fernandes, he got himself booked to pick up a one game suspension and had been hauled off by the time the Hungarians managed a last-gasp equaliser.",
      "And it's ironic that it was Dominik Szoboszlai who scored it. Because Fernandes will come up against Szoboszlai again this weekend, when United travel to bitter rivals Liverpool.",

      "You don't have to be a genius to realise this doesn't compliment Fernandes's strengths. So why can't Amorim work it out, too?",
      "If United are dominating a weaker side, which doesn't happen that often, let's be honest, then Fernandes wouldn't be exposed. But sending Fernandes into battle at Anfield as a holding midfielder, would be akin to sending a lamb to the slaughter.",
      "And it doesn't matter if Amorim picks a side to win or draw at Liverpool, because neither will happen if Fernandes is deployed closer to his defence than attack.",
      "Fernandes should be slap bang and centre of a front three, which also includes Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The scenario is simple really. Play to his strengths - or suffer the consequences.",

Everything looked under control when goals from Paulo Henrique and Gabriel Martinelli put Carlo Ancelotti's side in charge at the break, but it was a different story by full-time.",
      "Former Liverpool forward Takumi Minamino pulled a goal back early in the second half, after which Ancelotti made a triple change in an effort to take back control. It wasn't to be, though, as Keito Nakamura equalised before Ayase Ueda completed the remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"A second-half blackout by the entire team,\" Casemiro told Sportv (via ESPN). \"If you sleep for 45 minutes, it could cost you a World Cup, a Copa América, a medal, a four-year dream.",
      "\"The whole team wasn't at its best in the second half, and it's the details. At this high level, it's the details that make all the difference. We know there was an extra boost of enthusiasm [following the win against South Korea].",
      "\"We wanted to end this 12-day preparation on a high note. And perhaps we threw away our excellent preparation in 45 minutes. So, let this be a lesson learned, the World Cup is here. We need to play at a high level, no matter if it's against Japan or whoever as 45 minutes can cost you a childhood dream.\"",
      "Brazil know full well how damaging a brief lapse can be. They impressed in the last World Cup, hammering South Korea in the round of 16, but a late lapse in the quarter-final against Croatia allowed the opposition to equalise and then eliminate Brazil on penalties.",
      "Ancelotti took over as manager in the middle of the qualification campaign for the 2026 edition, with the South Americans never in any real danger of elimination. They were far from convincing en route to qualification, though, and the Italian boss pointed to areas where improvement will be needed between now and next summer.",
      "\"What we have to evaluate is the team's reaction after the first mistake, which wasn't good because we lost some of our balance on the field and our positive thinking,\" Ancelotti said. \"We have to learn from our mistakes in the second half. The team's biggest mistake was not reacting well after the first goal. It's a good lesson for the future. We have to learn from this defeat.",
      "\"I think until Fabricio's mistake [for the first goal] we controlled well the game. The team then lost its mentality after the first mistake. That was the team's biggest mistake.\"",
      "Ancelotti indicated Brazil need to ensure they have \"balance\" if they are to be competitive at next summer's World Cup in North America. They will find out their group stage opponents in December when the draw takes place in the United States.",

      "The captains of the 20 top-flight sides are said to support the move, though individuals could still opt against participating. Most Women's Super League teams have already decided against taking the knee in matches marking Black History Month, believing the act is no longer meaningful.",
      "The gesture was first introduced after the murder of George Floyd in the United States in May 2020. But in 2022, the Premier League confirmed that players would only take the knee in high-profile fixtures.",
      "There was hope that reserving it for No Room for Racism matches in October and March, the Boxing Day fixtures, and the final league matches of the season would increase its resonance. However, a new decision will soon be made on whether to maintain it.",
      "\"It's always been their choice,\" Masters told Sky News. \"It's never been something that has been forced upon them, either collectively or individually. They had another discussion in the summer.",

Ferdinand, however, doesn't believe he's the appropriate figure to make comparisons with, despite grasping the reasoning.",
      "Yet despite not entirely agreeing, he maintains that the statement carries real weight. \"I think it's really important [that] the message [is sent] out to the current squad,\" Ferdinand said during a video on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"With that message, you don't get players sitting there going, 'Oh, he's going to be off in a minute anyway, I can just sit here and chill, I can down tools.' No, in their eyes now, he ain't going, 'I'd better pull my finger out and start doing a bit.'\"",
      "Ferdinand also values Ratcliffe's transparency: \"I just like to hear the people that are in the driving seat of a football club come out and speak. That's what I like about Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "\"He went on a podcast to speak about something totally different, but obviously, that podcast isn't going to allow him to come on and not ask him about Man United. So, it's just refreshing that somebody in his position actually talks.",
      "\"Do I exactly agree with what he said? I understand the sentiment– if you go through the facts, I don't think it's the right person to draw a comparison with.",
      "\"You look at Arteta – there are similarities in some of the stats. The big one is that he improved the team from 10th to finish eighth in his first year. Amorim took his team from 14th to finish 15th.",
      "\"There was also flexibility in the way Arteta had his team. I think he had about seven different formations in his first 50 matches, just trying things out.",
      "\"The improvement line would have been a bit more consistent, and you'd go, 'I can see it happening.' Whereas with Amorim, you look at him and there isn't as much consistency or positives that are coming out of it that you're going, 'oh, I can actually see it clearly, it's hitting me between my eyes, I couldn't let this guy go'.",
      "\"I think right now, we're at a stage with United and Amorim, [where] I just want to see that consistency of some results coming through, performance alongside that, and an idea that you go, 'oh, I can see this training ground stuff really paying off'. The consistency with all of those three different elements isn't there right now, and I'm hoping he can get that right.\"",

      "Portuguese media have raised concerns about the condition of Bruno Fernandes after the Manchester United star picked up a ban in Portugal’s draw with Hungary. Despite Cristiano Ronaldo setting a new record for World Cup qualifying goals, the Group F leaders’ hopes of sealing a spot at next year’s tournament with two games to spare were dashed by an added-time leveller from Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai in a 2-2 draw.",
      "Ronaldo had earlier scored twice to become the highest ever goalscorer in World Cup qualifiers on 41, overtaking Guatemala striker Carlos Ruiz, who bagged 39 qualifying goals in his career. But as Ronaldo was fated for another incredible milestone, it was a night to forget for Fernandes, who picked up a booking, ruling him out of Portugal’s penultimate qualifier against Ireland in Dublin, before being substituted on 62 minutes.",
      "Local media were not impressed by Fernandes, with Renascenca saying that he, along with Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva, showed some “physical fatigue,” which is not what Ruben Amorim will want to hear ahead of United’s showdown at Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, A Bola gave him a rating of 6/10, saying he had little influence on the game. They commented: “He hit the post once in the second half, but that was perhaps the only time he managed to find space in the central corridor. For this reason, he often appeared close to the line, especially on the left, but without gaining any influence.”",
      "The rest of the team received marks of between five and seven, apart from Ronaldo, who got 8/10. Fernandes felt Portugal were guilty of allowing the game to become too stretched after he had gone off.",
      "Speaking afterwards, he said: “We entered their game in the last 30 minutes, a transitional game, and we opened up the field a lot. We were controlling the game well, pinning them back and creating opportunities. Suddenly, we started to enter that transitional game that didn’t benefit us.",
      "“Our strength is possessing the ball, pinning teams back. Even if it’s difficult to find the goal, as it was against Ireland [Portugal won 1-0 with a late winner], it’s always better to possess the ball, create our own opportunities than to open up the field, playing a game of attacking transitions, which ended up being beneficial for them.",
      "“Hungary is very strong on set pieces, transitions and second balls. With space, they can create danger, and that's what happened. We also have to give credit to what they did.”",
      "Despite the setback, qualifying should still be a formality for Portugal, who lead second-placed Hungary by five points with two games left.",
      "Fernandes added: “If we go to the World Cup, we'll still be favourites, like all the teams that will be there, because they'll all have a chance to win the World Cup, regardless of their level of prominence.",
      "“Our goal is to qualify first, and then we'll think about the World Cup. But this doesn't affect what we can do as a team. Every game serves as a learning experience for the next, whether you win or lose.",
      "“We played against a team with a very low block, and it was difficult to find space to finish, but we were able to win the game and we have to do it again to reach the World Cup.”",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson had a telling reaction to his Manchester United ambassadorial role being axed last year. The decision was made as part of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's cost-cutting measures and was criticised heavily.",
      "Ineos chief Ratcliffe opened up last week about his 24 months at Old Trafford, having purchased a near 30 per cent stake in the club from the Glazer family in 2023. He addressed the financial scaleback that became synonymous with his early reign and saw iconic manager Ferguson's role end.",
      "After he stepped down from his trophy-laden spell as United manager in 2013, Ferguson was retained and paid a multi-million-pound annual contract as a club ambassador. Ratcliffe opted to end this agreement, enraging ex-United players, but Ferguson's reaction said a lot.",
      "Sources at the club stated 12 months ago that the decision to axe him was taken as part of cuts that saw around 250 employees lose their jobs.",
      "But it was said that Ferguson himself received the news amicably and did not harbour any ill regard towards Ratcliffe for the decision, showing his class. It was reiterated that he would always be welcome at the club where he won 13 Premier League titles.",
      "It was also reported, originally by The Athletic, that this decision was presented to Ferguson face-to-face during a meeting with the United board. He accepted this axing without any rebuttal.",
      "But while Fergie didn't take issue with his role ending, some of those who once played under the Scottish manager did. Dwight Yorke exclusively told the Mirror: \"I was as surprised as everyone else.",
      "\"We are going through a change at the football club from top to bottom. Everyone is looking over their shoulder at the moment. It is not really a fitting way to treat someone who has done so much for the football club, his contribution is unprecedented. They have been so successful for such a long time, the only people who know what is going on are those people who have just come in.",
      "\"I am not sure if everyone will be in agreement with the changes, but this will raise a few eyebrows. If they can do that to someone like Sir Alex Ferguson, then I suppose everyone is on a tightrope.\"",
      "Yorke was not the only one to blast the club's hierarchy for their cost-cutting decision. Fans were up in arms about the call, and so was United legend Eric Cantona.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson should be able to do anything he wants at the club until the day he dies,\" posted Cantona on Instagram. \"Such a lack of respect. It's totally scandalous. Sir Alex Ferguson will be my boss forever! And I throw them all in a big bag of s***!\"",
      "Ex-United defender Rio Ferdinand also had his say, posting to X: \"If Sir Alex can be taken out, then NO ONE IS SAFE at Man Utd – anyone can get it now. Ineos sending a message to ANYONE at the club?!?\"",
      "Speaking on The Business podcast, Ratcliffe reflected on his time in Manchester and doubled down on his decision to cut costs, despite the apparent backlash it caused. He said: \"The costs were just too high.",
      "\"There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been told that Bruno Fernandes ‘doesn’t understand’ the role he’s been asked to play at Old Trafford. The Portuguese midfielder has been a key player under Amorim during his time at the club.",
      "Despite still being productive from an attacking standpoint, the former Sporting Lisbon star has been tasked with a slightly deeper position on a number of occasions. But Fernandes has struggled to have an impact when given more defensive responsibility.",
      "Former Chelsea star Craig Burley has now claimed that the midfielder does not know how to play the role. Speaking on ESPN, he said: “They have got no legs in midfield, we’ve talked about this with Casemiro and Ugarte. Bruno Fernandes is playing there, but it’s not his position.",
      "“He doesn’t understand the defensive aspects and the positional aspects of being a deeper-lying midfielder. And it also negates, which we’ve talked about at length, his ability to influence 30 yards further up the field.”",
      "Burley is not the only one to have highlighted Fernandes’ issues when it comes to his new position. Speaking after last month’s Manchester derby defeat, Gary Neville claimed that he could not play the role against the better sides in the Premier League.",
      "“The midfield is a massive problem and we know that, United fans know that, [Manuel] Ugarte and Fernandes today,” he said on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "“Ugarte is not good enough, and Bruno is not a player who plays in a deep-lying midfield in a two, he can do, I think, if United are at home and they’re playing against a team who are dominating possession, you can maybe bring him a bit deeper and get away with it.",
      "“But against any team who have good possession and good players, and that’s most teams in the Premier League, Bruno is always probably going to struggle in a midfield two.",
      "He added: “Bruno is United’s best player by a mile, but this system has to have him as a one of a two in midfield or as one of a front three, of which he is neither of these two positions.”",
      "Fernandes has actually spoken out on the demands put on him by Amorim, and claimed that he would be willing to play anywhere. Speaking during the international break, he said: “I love playing football, whatever the position.",
      "“They can put me at full-back, winger, goalkeeper. I’ll always give my best. Everyone has their preferences, but we have to adapt to the coach’s ideas.”",
      "United are back in action this weekend as they take on fierce rivals Liverpool at Anfield.",

      "Ruben Amorim finds himself under intense scrutiny at Manchester United with the club still struggling to meet expectations under the Portuguese coach. Despite high hopes following his appointment last year, poor results and performance have led to growing calls for change from fans and pundits alike.",
      "A recent 2-0 victory over Sunderland at Old Trafford has provided some relief, marking the team's third consecutive home win before the international break. The result has temporarily eased the pressure on Amorim, particularly with his side showcasing glimpses of the tactical prowess that earned him the job.",
      "Additionally, the Red Devils are winless on the road this campaign, and their only victories have come against two promoted teams and a Chelsea side who spent most of the match with 10 men. With last season's record-low 15th-place finish still lingering, United fans will be desperate for their side to start building momentum once the domestic season resumes.",
      "Almost a year ago, Erik ten Hag was given his marching orders at United after a poor start to the new season. Despite the club's rotten run - United were 14th in the league at the time - the Dutchman was reportedly left completely in the dark about his impending sacking, with crunch talks taking place at Carrington, United's training ground in the lead-up to the fateful day, October 28, 2024.",
      "Ten Hag had survived a potential summer dismissal after winning the FA Cup, even earning a one-year contract extension and over £200million in new signings. However, amid a run of just one win in eight games, the decision was made swiftly, with the sacking described as a \"walk-the-plank moment\" that underscored the club's volatile decision-making under Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "This historical uncertainty mirrors the current pressure on Amorim, who's facing a similarly-tense battle to keep his job after underwhelming in his first year at the helm. Recently, Ratcliffe admitted Amorim had \"not had the best of seasons,\" but also hinted at affording the coach patience.",
      "\"He has not had the best of seasons,\" Ratcliffe said during a recent appearance on The Business Podcast. \"Amorim is a good guy. I would say Ruben needs to demonstrate that he's a great coach over three years. \"That's where I would be - three years - because football is not overnight. Look at Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, he had a miserable time the first couple of years.\"",
      "Just as Ten Hag received backing before his abrupt exit, Ratcliffe's recent comments, giving Amorim time to prove himself, echo the fleeting support his predecessor experienced this time last year, hinting at potential upheaval if results don't improve.",
      "Manchester United's £66m summer signing Benjamin Sesko endured a frustrating afternoon during Slovenia's World Cup qualifier against Switzerland on Monday. The game ended 0-0, extending Sesko's international goal drought to a full year.",
      "The 22-year-old forward, who, after a slow start at Old Trafford, has netted two goals in his last two United matches, was described as \"lonely\" by the Slovenian press due to minimal service from team-mates.",
      "Ekipa newspaper rated Sesko 6.5 out of 10, quipping that he might have been \"singing that 20-year-old Akon hit - Lonely,\" after he sent his only chance wide while being isolated for most of the game. With Slovenia holding just 34 per cent possession and prioritising defending, Sesko was forced to track back, managing only 31 touches, one off-target shot, and no successful dribbles.",
      "Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek highlighted the team's lack of \"bloodlust\" in attack, indirectly pointing to Sesko's struggles amid poor support. Despite positive defensive contributions like five ball recoveries, Sesko's outing underscores challenges in translating his club form to the national team, especially as Slovenia risks missing the 2026 World Cup.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been advised that Adam Wharton would be an ideal addition for Manchester United. The Crystal Palace midfielder has been strongly linked with a switch to Old Trafford as United chiefs seek a long-term successor to Casemiro, whose deal runs out in June next year.",
      "Wharton is broadly regarded as one of the Premier League's most promising talents following his displays for Palace across the past two campaigns, including during their FA Cup final triumph against Manchester City at Wembley in May.",
      "The 21-year-old made his England debut last year and is presently in high demand, with Liverpool and Real Madrid also reportedly keen on securing his signature. United have now been encouraged to pursue Wharton aggressively after being told he would be a vital component as the club attempts to reverse its declining fortunes.",
      "Former Red Devils keeper Ben Foster issued the appeal after lavishing praise on Wharton for his outstanding showings for Palace in recent seasons. The ex-England and Wrexham stopper also criticised detractors who suggest he is overpriced.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"I think there's always a lot said about Adam Wharton. I always read a lot of stuff saying, 'God, he's so overrated.' I think you need to watch him for the eye test.",
      "\"First and foremost, go to a game and watch him and see what he's capable of. See how he moves around the pitch, how he operates and it's a thing of beauty. It's effortless. He glides around them, but he's got legs as well.",
      "\"That's the bit there that Man United are interested in. They've got nobody in there at the minute who's got those legs, that can get about, has that vision of passing and that calmness and control when he's got the ball.\"",
      "Wharton's current contract with Selhurst Park is set to run until the summer of 2029, having initially joined the club from Blackburn Rovers for £18m back in February 2024. Despite recognising the player's high ambitions, Palace chairman Steve Parish has insisted they're not in a hurry to let their star midfielder go.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT, Parish said: \"I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club.",
      "\"He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace. He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had and that a lot of young players get.",
      "\"I think this season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday.",
      "\"It's a difficult programme for us right now. I think he's very committed to the club. I don't know where all this stuff comes from.\"",
      "When quizzed about United's reported interest, Parish added: \"If Manchester United want Adam Wharton, there's nothing surprising really about that. The fact of the matter is he's got a long contract to run. There's no pressure on us to do it, and I don't think there's any real pressure from the player either.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has carried Manchester United on his back for quite some time. Longer than he will care to remember.",
      "It's almost a full year since Ruben Amorim pitched up at Old Trafford to replace Erik ten Hag. And since his compatriot's arrival, no one has made more appearances than the United captain. Equally, no one has done more to lift the club during what has been its most dismal 12 months in the Premier League era.",
      "On Sunday, United head to Anfield with Fernandes facing accusations of \"physical fatigue\" after Portugal's failure to beat Hungary on Tuesday night. The Portuguese press were unimpressed with Fernandes - who was booked, to pick up a suspension and was hauled off before Hungary's late equaliser.",
      "Ironically, that late equaliser came from someone he'll face on Sunday: Dominik Szoboszlai.",
      "The two could be in direct combat. Then again, they might not. Both see their respective managers move them around the pitch. But while Szoboszlai looks comfortable with whatever the responsibilities are that Arne Slot asks of him - whether as a No.8 a No.10 or even at right-back - comfortable with his role is something Fernandes just currently isn't.",
      "In Amorim's 3-4-3 formation, Fernandes has been found badly wanting when asked to play in a deeper midfield position. You don't have to be a genius to realise that it doesn't play to his strengths. If the world can see that, then why can't Amorim too?",
      "When United are up against a supposedly weaker side and dominating - which doesn't happen that often, let's be honest, then Fernandes wouldn't be exposed. But it doesn't help them to remain secure.",
      "At Anfield this weekend - where Fernandes played as part of the front three in last season's 2-2 draw - he may well starts as part of the midfield two. To do so would be akin to sending a lamb to the slaughter.",
      "United are heading to Merseyside wanting three points and to build momentum coming out of the international break. They may well take one. Whatever it is, neither will happen if Fernandes is on top of his defence and not trying to make the difference in attack.",
      "He should be leading the attack at Anfield, with Bryan Mbeumo and fit-again Mason Mount, playing to his strengths.",
      "If they don't they'll suffer the consequences.",
      "Amorim is still shoe-horning Fernandes into his system'. It needs to stop, or a thumping at Anfield is a possibility.",

      "The youngster has one goal and one assist in five games at Premier League 2 level for United having impressed coming through the age-group sides.",
      "His form at Under-18 level prompted interest from Canada in the forward and Jesse Marsch called the teenager into a senior training camp during the summer in a bid to convince him to join the co-World Cup hosts.",
      "Marsch is a big fan of the United prospect, telling reporters in Canada in May: \"He's a dynamic player. He's very good around the goal. You can see he's an intelligent player.",
      "\"He's a version of Jonathan David. He's not exactly the same player but he's a striker that can play up on the backline and is also good at coming underneath and connecting plays and being part of the build-up phase.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with Gabe and his family. He has several options to think about in what country he wants to represent.",
      "\"I think it's really important that the family feels the connection to Canada.\"",
      "Biancheri subsequently made his debut for Wales Under-21s in September and has this week scored his first goal for his country in a fine 2-0 win over Austria.",
      "He opened his account in the 25th minute of his first start when he capitalised on a loose back pass from David Heindl to sit the goalkeeper down before rolling the ball into an empty net. Chris Popov snatched a second for the Welsh in the 90th minute.",
      "Biancheri's performance caught the eye in Austria and led to some speculating he could earn a call into Craig Bellamy's senior squad for the November internationals.",
      "Canada will likely still harbour ambitions of the youngster declaring for them while Biancheri is also eligible to represent Italy.",

      "\"We've gone through ups and downs, but we're together. And we'll continue to be together with the manager, with the staff, to continue moving forward,\" said Mason Mount after winning against Sunderland.",
      "\"For us, it's just focusing on what the manager wants and that's in training. And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "\"Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.\"",
      "Some fans have joked Mount is the teacher's pet at Manchester United, but he wasn't picked to start in a must-win game against Sunderland because he gets along with Amorim.",
      "Mount started because of the quality, pressing and energy he brings to the team, and he admitted during his post-match chat that he considers himself the \"catalyst\" for the press.",
      "The 26-year-old vindicated his selection just eight minutes into the game when he finished brilliantly at the Stretford End and he might have done enough to retain his starting role against Liverpool.",
      "Mount started against Sunderland at the expense of Matheus Cunha, who might have to settle for a role off the bench again at Anfield when United make the trip to Merseyside on Sunday.",
      "Cunha hasn't put a foot wrong since joining from Wolves in the summer. The Brazilian is yet to score or assist, but his all-round performances have been strong down the left flank.",
      "He was unfortunate not to get off the mark against Fulham at Craven Cottage (Cunha hit the post and was also denied at point-blank range) and it feels like only a matter of time before he breaks his duck.",
      "However, it feels like Amorim will start Mount on the left side in the No.10 role against Liverpool because his work ethic will be hugely beneficial against the Premier League champions in their own backyard.",
      "Cunha has improved that aspect of his game - Wolves' coaches challenged him to improve when not in possession - but he isn't known for working tirelessly backwards and forwards.",
      "That's not to say Cunha doesn't work hard. He has demonstrated his willingness to work his socks off since signing for United, but Mount may be seen as the better option for Anfield.",
      "United is such a big club that rotating a player for tactical reasons can feel like a story - especially if that player is a relatively new signing and was signed for a multi-million-pound fee.",
      "The truth is Manchester City and Liverpool have dominated the Premier League due to their strength in depth. They regularly rotate players and there is no hysterical reaction when a player is benched.",
      "It won't be a big deal if Cunha is named on the bench again this weekend, it would merely be a selection decision made by Amorim to give United the best chance of leaving Anfield with a positive result.",
      "Liverpool are likely to dominate the ball on Sunday afternoon. United will have to work meticulously out of possession, press efficiently and players will have to win their individual battles.",
      "United last won at Anfield in 2016 when Louis van Gaal was in charge and the bookmakers have made Liverpool heavy favourites to win the fixture, but the contest should be closer than the odds suggest.",

      "Hello and welcome to live coverage of all the latest Manchester United news on Wednesday, October 15.",
      "The Reds' season is currently on hold due to the second international break of the season and talk has quietened around Ruben Amorim's suitability for the top job at Old Trafford for now after a 2-0 defeat of Sunderland last time out.",
      "Amorim's future may well have been knocked down the news agenda, but United were plunged into further uncertainty last week when the mega-rich Saudi Arabian government official Turki Al-Sheikh made huge claims about a takeover of the club on social media.",
      "That sparked speculation online about what this could mean for the Reds' immediate future, with further claims that the supposed investors were based in the United Arab Emirates and had approached United legends about backing their bid.",
      "We will have all the latest on that, top transfer headlines and injury news as the Reds' return to action with a clash against Liverpool this weekend edges closer...",
      "Crystal Palace are reportedly keeping tabs on the future of Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jobe Bellingham. The younger brother of Real Madrid and England international Jude joined the Bundesliga heavyweights from Sunderland this summer for around £31m.",
      "Unfortunately for the 20-year-old he is yet to register a goal contribution or complete a full 90 minutes of football for the club. German outlet Bild recently claimed Ruben Amorim's side are monitoring his situation.",
      "But they are not the only ones as Crystal Palace are interested in his services, according to GiveMeSport. Dortmund manager Niko Kovac is far from giving up on him, recently highlighting the England U21 international as a player with a \"huge upside.\"",
      "Dion Dublin believes Manchester United may just beat Liverpool at Anfield this weekend. He insisted the Red Devils are due a major victory which can push Ruben Amorim's campaign forward, despite the recent 2-1 home victory over Chelsea.",
      "\"We know that Liverpool have been better than Manchester United for many, many years. But this is a rivalry, it is tribalism - it could go either way.",
      "\"As an ex-Man United player, I want them to win the game. They are due to have a very potent, winning game. Liverpool watch out - it is going to be a close one.",
      "\"Liverpool have lost their last three games - this is where they can be at their most dangerous because they may not be in their stride but they have got so many amazing, world-class players. If they turn it on, nobody can live with them. I am hoping they don't turn it on. But if they do, it is going to be some game.\"",
      "Ex-Manchester United defender Wes Brown believes the return of Lisandro Martinez will be like a new signing to Ruben Amorim. The left-footed, central-defender has been out injured since February after suffering an ACL in the loss to Crystal Palace.",
      "The Argentine was recently training on the grass, with other reports suggesting he could soon be training with the first team very soon. While it will be a long time until he is starting for United again, Brown believes Martinez's return cannot come soon enough.",
      "He told the Metro: \"Luke Shaw has done well on the left of the three, but even with that, I think a club always needs competition for places. When Lisandro Martinez is fit, he’s a rock for the team.",
      "\"He was excellent for a couple of seasons, but he hasn’t played a lot of games recently. He’d need to learn to play alongside Yoro and De Ligt, but if he comes back soon, it’ll be like a brilliant new signing for the manager.",
      "\"Amorim likes to have a left-footer on the left of that back three, and he’s ideal for it. He’s still got a big future at the club, and when he gets back into the side I hope he slots in seamlessly. It’ll be a huge boost for the club and the manager.\"",
      "Dion Dublin believes Ruben Amorim has to guide Manchester United into the top four at the absolute minimum. With three wins, one draw and three defeats, United are currently residing in 10th, below newly promoted Sunderland.",
      "Despite spending more than £200million in the summer, the results have not been coming for Amorim. Looking at the season so far, Dublin warned him anything less than finishing in the top four is unacceptable.",
      "\"They should be winning the Premier League, they should be getting into the Champions League every single year. Where they are right now, European football would be a good season.",
      "\"If Man United win on Sunday, they will be in a better place mentally. I think there will be more harmony in the dressing room.",
      "\"Beating Liverpool for Man United has got to be the stepping stone where they need to go, 'We have beaten one of the best teams in the world, never mind the Premier League. This is when we have to start turning it on.'\"",
      "Tomorrow evening, Manchester United's women's team will take on Atletico Madrid in the Red Devils' second UEFA Women’s Champions League fixture. The Red Devils overcame Valeranga 1-0 in their opening fixture with Maya Le Tissier converting a penalty.",
      "Here's how you can watch Marc Skinner's side in action against the Spaniards, who recently lost 6-0 to defending champions Barcelona.",
      "Those who wish to tune in can do so with a subscription for Disney+. MUTV, the United App and the club's official YouTube channel will be hosting a watch along of the match.",
      "Despite the struggles of Manchester United, young defender Leny Yoro has been included in the list of players for the European Golden Boy award. The young Frenchman has been a bright light in an otherwise dark 14 months for the Red Devils.",
      "He has become one of the first names on the team sheet for Ruben Amorim. Below are the other candidates on the list.",
      "Leny Yoro is among the final players for the Golden Boy award pic.twitter.com/2xc3GkjnWe",
      "Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker has claimed that it would cause \"big problems\" if the Reds allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave, amid his lack of regular game time at Old Trafford.",
      "Parker told mybettingsites.co.uk: \"It would cause big problems if they allow Mainoo to go because he's a local boy. But it's not just about that, it's about what he's achieved in a short space of time and he hasn't been given the time and the respect.",
      "\"You've got to understand, when you're younger, losing form can happen quite quickly but it's about getting it back. When you make mistakes, you nurture, you don't stamp down on things, you demand but you demand in a different way. He hasn't been given what a good manager like Sir Alex Ferguson would do with a young player.",
      "\"Maybe they should've let him go out on loan and play. Go overseas and experience that little bit to come back again and start again. Especially in this current scenario where you're not going to use him, let him go and do that.\"",
      "Jaap Stam is adamant that Harry Maguire deserves a new Manchester United contract.",
      "Ex-United defender Stam told Sky Bet: \"Harry Maguire deserves a new contract. I have a lot of respect for him. He went through a difficult period when managers tried to move him on, but he stayed, fought for his place, and became important again.",
      "\"He’s been professional and resilient, but the only question for the club is whether to invest long-term in him at his age or start building for the future with younger players. In terms of attitude and contribution though, he’s earned a new contract.",
      "\"He has a lot of competition in the national team. To go to the World Cup, he needs to play regularly. If he’s not starting every week at United, he might look elsewhere - but moving doesn’t guarantee playing time either. It depends on the club and the situation he goes into.",
      "\"Sometimes it’s better to fight for your place where you are.\"",
      "Manchester United are exploring a shock move to re-sign James Garner from Everton, according to United in Focus. The 24-year-old left the Reds to sign for Everton in a deal worth £9million in 2022.",
      "Garner has gone on to make more than 75 Premier League appearances and become an integral member of David Moyes' side at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.",
      "Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown has backed Kobbie Mainoo to return to his best and believes that he needs to get out there and play regular football again.",
      "Brown told Freebets.com: \"Listen, Kobbie’s a young, very talented lad. Everyone knows that. He’ll be desperate to play, especially after the impact he made last season, but there’s clearly something going on behind the scenes.",
      "\"Maybe the manager wants different things from him, maybe he’s working on parts of his game. Whatever it is, I just hope there’s good communication between them.",
      "\"At his age, he needs football — it’s as simple as that. He’s not going to develop sitting on the bench. Every fan wants to see him play. When you’ve got that kind of ability, you should be on the pitch.\"",
      "Despite signing Benjamin Sesko during the summer transfer window, Manchester United are reported to be keen on landing another striker and are targeting Mateo Retegui, according to Fichajes.",
      "It's claimed that the Reds are prepared to spend up to £52million on the Italy international, who signed for Saudi Pro League side Al Qadsiah from Atalanta in the summer.",
      "During his time at Atalanta, the 26-year-old scored 28 goals and provided nine assists in 49 appearances. He was the top scorer in Serie A during the 2024/25 campaign and won the Capocannoniere.",
      "Former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Emmanuel Petit has hit out at Ruben Amorim after the Manchester United head coach claimed that pundits are influencing his players.",
      "Speaking before his side's game against Sunderland, Amorim said he feels his players are susceptible to reading and hearing a lot of the criticism about his system through high-profile pundits.",
      "After Gary Neville rubbished Amorim's remark, Petit has now weighed in with his verdict and said that the Portuguese is \"talking absolute nonsense\" in a brutal assessment.",
      "Speaking to Boyle Sports, Petit said: \"That's the first time I've heard a manager use that as an excuse for the failure of his players. Don't be ridiculous. Ruben Amorim is talking absolute nonsense. Your players know what you're saying is absolute nonsense too.",
      "\"How can you say that when you manage for Manchester United? If you are not able to deal with critics when you manage or play for big clubs and are receiving so much money, then change clubs. Don't work with top clubs.",
      "\"I read that and thought, ‘Did he seriously say that?’ I've been a player for top clubs with huge expectations. When I was on the pitch, I never tried to find excuses.",
      "\"You just take your own responsibility, be a man. I know I've been very upset with critics, some of what they said was unfair most of the time, but you have to deal with it.\"",
      "Fabrizio Romano has reported that Crystal Palace have no plans to negotiate a fee for Adam Wharton ahead of the January transfer window. Speaking on his YouTube channel, the journalist said: \"They want Adam Wharton to stay at the club and to be a really important part of the story.",
      "\"Then 2026 summer transfer window, maybe after the World Cup, we will see if Wharton will be there or not. He has chances. Palace will assess the situation with the player, also based on proposals.\"",
      "Romano added: \"We have many links with Man United. I can confirm that Man United appreciate the player guys, but it's not only Man United. Trust me, it's several clubs appreciating this boy.",
      "\"He's really appreciated. He's considered one of the best talents in his position in England. And so, for sure, there is interest, Man United, and not only, but at the moment, nothing has been decided in terms of bid, numbers.",
      "\"If you see, 30, 40, 50 millions, nothing at this stage. Palace are very focused on this season with the player and the player is very focused on this season with Palace.\"",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Liam Delap almost joined United in the summer transfer window. The report claims that the striker's move to Old Trafford was 90 per cent done before the Chelsea swooped in and secured his signature.",
      "Delap enjoyed a great start to life with the Blues, winning the Club World Cup, before suffering a hamstring injury. After missing out of the Englishman, United forked out £74m to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "According to United in Focus, United are keeping tabs on Neiser Villarreal. The report claims the 20-year-old striker, who is set to join Cruzeiro on a free transfer in January, has also attracted interest from Anfield.",
      "It's said that United have had scouts at the Under-20 World Cup this autumn, and Villarreal has caught the eye. The Reds will reportedly continue to monitor his developement when he debuts in Brazil next year.",
      "According to Defensa Central, Kobbie Mainoo would be open to joining Real Madrid on loan for the remainder of the season. The 20-year-old midfielder currently faces an uncertain future, having fallen down the pecking order at United.",
      "The report claims that Mainoo remains focused on becoming a key player for Ruben Amorim, but, if he can't get regular game time, he'll look for a 'way out'. Real madrid are reportedly in the market for a new midfielder, and they 'could consider his possible arrival'.",
      "Ben Foster has explained why Ruben Amorim must bring Adam Wharton to Old Trafford. Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, the former United goalkeeper said: \"I think there's always a lot said about Adam Wharton.",
      "\"I always read a lot of stuff saying, 'God, he's so overrated.' I think you need to watch him for the eye test. First and foremost, go to a game and watch him and see what he's capable of.",
      "\"See how he moves around the pitch, how he operates and it's a thing of beauty. It's effortless. He glides around them, but he's got legs as well. That's the bit there that Man United are interested in.",
      "\"They've got nobody in there at the minute who's got those legs, that can get about, has that vision of passing and that calmness and control when he's got the ball.\"",
      "According to German outlet Bild, United are monitoring Jobe Bellingham's situation at Borussia Dortmund. The 20-year-old midfielder left Sunderland to join the German outfit in the summer for £27m, plus £4.2m in add-ons.",
      "The report claims that Crystal Palace are also keen on the Bellingham. The England Under-21 international has struggled to force himself into Niko Kovač’s side, having made just two starts in the Bundesliga so far this season.",
      "This weekend, the Reds will lock horns with Liverpool at Anfield. While the reigning Premier League may fancy their chances, United have recently shown signs of promise...",
      "That's it for today, folks!",
      "Thank you for tuning in with us. We'll be back bright and early tomorrow.",
      "Catch you then!",
      "Casemiro could stay at Manchester United beyond this season - but only if he takes a significant pay cut.",
      "The Brazil international and five-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid is among United's highest earners with a salary of around £300,000-a-week.",
      "The midfielder is out of contract at the end of this season, although United have an option to extend his deal by an additional 12 months.",
      "But United would look to negotiate any extension for the 33-year-old on reduced terms. Casemiro has re-established himself as an automatic pick at United under Ruben Amorim and is set to start Sunday's visit to arch rivals Liverpool when the Premier League returns following the international break.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Keane has spoken about Marcus Rashford before England's match with Latvia this evening. The forward is currently on loan at Barcelona from Man United.",
      "When asked on ITV Sport if the environment at United was not helping Rashford, Keane said: \"Well, it doesn't help, but if you look back at Marcus' time at United towards the end, there were obviously issues going on. He had one or two issues off the field.",
      "\"I think he was late for one or two meetings on a night out in Belfast or whatever, so he was part of the problem with the environment, particularly as one of the most experienced players at United. He should have been setting the standards and showing new people at the club what it's like to be a Man United player, but I think that's been well documented.",
      "\"What we have to look at with Marcus is he's got this sort of chance now with England, and he deserves it. No doubt about his talent. He's obviously fantastic. His stats obviously need to improve if he wants to go to that next level, like Thomas Tuchel just said there, in terms of goals and assists, but he has the talent.",
      "\"But the other bit that I think would have frustrated fans, not just maybe England more United, was his body language or not running back or not pressing properly. They're the stuff he has to tidy up, and if he does that, then there's no reason why he can't still become a world-class player.\"",
      "Manchester United will reportedly have to wait until next summer to sign Brighton star Carlos Baleba, according to talkSPORT.",
      "Brighton reportedly have no plans to sell Baleba in the January transfer window. The 21-year-old midfielder is said to be content on the south coast, with suggestions that he is pushing for a move being downplayed.",
      "Although Baleba made a huge impact for the Seagulls last season, his form has dipped this term, with Fabian Hurzeler admitting that the summer interest from the Reds may have unsettled him.",
      "\"For sure, when a young boy reads there is interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep, deep down,\" Hurzeler told talkSPORT. \"That’s also part of the development to understand that when you play well, there comes a big offer, there comes a big club who wants to have him.",
      "\"But then to keep pushing, to be humble, stay here in Brighton, and try to make the next step with the team and that’s something we have to keep on working with him.",
      "\"I can’t give you a clear answer if it’s really affected him or not. But for sure, he’s a young boy and we need to understand he’s not a machine that if you click on, then he always runs and off then he stops. We need to understand his feelings, his emotions, where he comes from, and that’s our responsibility.\"",
      "The consensus is that Ruben Amorim will keep the same side that beat Sunderland before the international break when he takes Manchester United to Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Casemiro has been in action for Brazil over the international break, alongside Mathues Cunha, with the pair involved in a 5-0 victory over South Korea before they were stunned 3-2 by Japan on Tuesday. That defeat has increased the pressure on boss Carlo Ancelotti ahead of the World Cup next summer and came after Brazil took a two goal lead.",
      "But perhaps the most pertinent news for United from Brazil's trip to Asia, came in Casemiro playing 90 minutes in both games. He captained the side in both fixtures and, at 33, has completed two full matches on the other side of the world with the physical and travel exertions that come with it.",
      "That is hardly ideal preparation for a domestic derby on Sunday with the midfielder set to have a minimum number of training sessions back at Carrington before the trip to Liverpool. Casemiro has already racked up 330 Premier League minutes this season, a figure that would have been higher had he not been sent off against Chelsea and subsequently missed the defeat at Brentford through suspension.",
      "It means Amorim must make a call on whether Casemiro can go again against Liverpool or whether his minutes will need to be managed.",
      "Man United have been told that they are unlikely to land Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton in January.",
      "The Palace star has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford as United bosses are on the hunt for a long-term successor for Casemiro, whose contract is set to run out in June next year. The 21-year-old made his England debut last year and is set to be one of Europe's most in-demand players - with Liverpool and Real Madrid also reportedly keen on securing his signature.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has reported the latest on Wharton's future. He claims that the England international's future at Palace is likely to be up for debate after next summer's World Cup rather than in the January transfer window.",
      "\"For January, Palace have no intention to negotiate,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"They want Adam Wharton to stay at the club and to be a really important part of the story. Then 2026 summer transfer window, maybe after the World Cup, we will see if Wharton will be there or not. He has chances. Palace will assess the situation with the player, also based on proposals.",
      "\"We have many links with Man Utd. I can confirm that Man Utd appreciate the player guys, but it’s not only Man Utd. Trust me, it’s several clubs appreciating this boy. He’s really appreciated. He’s considered one of the best talents in his position in England.",
      "\"And so, for sure, there is interest, Man Utd, and not only, but at the moment, nothing has been decided in terms of bid, numbers. If you see, 30, 40, 50 millions, nothing at this stage. Palace are very focused on this season with the player and the player is very focused on this season with Palace.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will be eager to help Cameroon reach the World Cup, but that ambition could come at a cost for Manchester United.",
      "Cameroon drew 0-0 with Angola on Monday and currently sits four points behind group leaders Cape Verde, who have already qualified for the World Cup for the first time. Mbeumo and Andre Onana, on loan at Trabzonspor, hope to see a similar outcome for their nation, but Cameroon must wait to find out if finishing second will secure a play-off spot.",
      "The goalless draw means Cameroon now relies on other results to determine their fate, with DR Congo, Uganda, or Nigeria still in contention to overtake them. Should they finish among the four best group runners-up, Cameroon would enter the Confederation of African Football (CAF) play-offs to decide who advances to the inter-confederation stage.",
      "If Cameroon reach the CAF play-offs, they are scheduled for the next international break in November. Winners would then face a second play-off to reach FIFA's inter-confederation tournament, which will feature teams from CONMEBOL (South America), CONCACAF (North America), OFC (Oceania), and AFC (Asia).",
      "In total, Cameroon could play up to four high-stakes matches - two CAF and two inter-confederation - to secure a spot at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is closing in on a return to Manchester United training as he reaches the final stages of his recovery from a knee injury.",
      "The defender has been carefully handled during the rehabilitation process and he is now understood to be not far off returning to full group training after a period of working individually on grass.",
      "United will not take any risks with Martinez, so his return to a matchday squad is not imminent, but he could be available for selection again just before the November international break.",
      "Manchester United summer arrival Diego Leon has just made his senior debut for Paraguay in an international friendly against South Korea.",
      "The left-footed defender is yet to make his bow for United's first-team but he has made several appearances in the matchday squad and also played 45 minutes in Premier League 2.",
      "Leon played the final 13 minutes of the 2-0 defeat after replacing Sunderland's Omar Alderete. The 18-year-old is pushing for his first minutes under Ruben Amorim but that seems unlikely to come soon with Noussair Mazraoui expected to return and Lisandro Martinez making progress in recovering from his injury.",
      "Manchester United could choose to try and keep Casemiro beyond his current contract which expires at the end of the season.",
      "According to ESPN, offering him a new has not been ruled out but he would need to take a pay-cut in order to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "There is a 12-month extension option in his current contract but activating that would require him to be paid at his current salary. Something that United may not be keen to do with aims to continue reducing their wage bill.",
      "Thomas Tuchel has delivered a thorough Marcus Rashford verdict with the Manchester United loannee included in a second consecutive England squad after a bright start to his spell at Barcelona.",
      "\"He can be one of the best in the world because of the quality I see in training, the finishing with both legs and with the head.",
      "\"He is explosive, he is fast, he is strong in the air, so where are the limits? There are no limits — but the numbers don’t reach the potential.",
      "\"He needs to push himself into goal involvements, that means goals and assists, it is as easy as that. [Consistency] is the headline for him. To keep on pushing himself to the limit. I think the limit for him is very, very high. Maybe higher than for others. He has the potential but potential is a dangerous word with high-level sports.",
      "\"You have to reach your personal best on a regular basis, that is what is demanded on this kind of level and that is the challenge for him. It’s not a question of talent, it’s a question of whether he can prove the point at club and international level. This is his task, whether he starts for us or comes off the bench, he has to constantly prove himself.",
      "\"He still has to make these decisions. He is still in that moment, he is still young enough to take the right decisions and not let go. Because otherwise he will be disappointed in ten years at what could have been and what he made of it.\""

      "Manchester United are confident that a deal can now be struck to secure land around Old Trafford which would, subsequently, pave the way for their proposed new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "United's plans for the new state-of-the-art venue - which is initially expected to cost around £2billion - have been complicated by an ongoing problem with Freightliner, who own an important bit of land behind the Stretford End.",
      "According to reports from The Daily Mail, United have offered around £50million to buy the land while Freightliner are seeking a more ambitious sum of £400million - a fee the Reds feel as 'unrealistic'. United feel that a compulsory purchase order could eventually be made, in which case the government would intervene to set a fair price.",
      "However, the report added that the club have held 'constructive' discussions with Freightliner - and are optimistic about striking a deal 'within the coming months'.",
      "Should a deal be struck up, it would mean that United can press ahead with plans, which were drawn up by Lord Norman Foster, for a new stadium complex to be built.",
      "Even though that would be another positive step, United still need to find funding for their huge project which is anticipated to cost £2bn-plus. Despite this, the club hope the new venue, dubbed 'Wembley of the North', can be finished in time for the start of the 2030/2031 season.",
      "In July, it was revealed that United are considering introducing 'Personal Seat Licences' - a method that would see supporters charged up to £4,000 for the right to buy a season ticket at the new stadium.",
      "Fans are being asked for their feedback on a variety of areas including facilities and cost.",
      "Once the new stadium is constructed and opened, United's existing home is, in turn, set to be demolished. United would likely continue to be playing at Old Trafford until they move into their new stadium, however.",
      "Architects at Foster and Partners said the new stadium would feature an umbrella design and a new public plaza that is 'twice the size of Trafalgar Square'. The design will feature three masts described as \"the trident\", which the architects say will be 200m high and visible from the Peak District.",

      "Manchester United will come up against Liverpool for the first time this season on Sunday and Arne Slot is likely to call upon Hugo Ekitike at some stage in the contest.",
      "While the headlines from the summer transfer window were stolen by Alexander Isak, Ekitike has managed to hit the ground running on Merseyside. The Frenchman has five goals in 10 appearances for Liverpool so far this season and has mostly kept Isak out of the starting line-up when available.",
      "Had it not been for his bizarre red card against Southampton in the Carabao Cup, Ekitike could have added further goals to his tally. Ahead of the contest this weekend, it is hard to imagine Ekitike representing United.",
      "However, had Isak been granted his exit from Newcastle sooner, there is a real chance that Ekitike could have gone to Old Trafford. Last month, the 23-year-old was quizzed about the possibility of signing for United.",
      "\"Liverpool are Premier League champions, with great players and great history,\" Ekitike replied as he justified his decision to move to Anfield from Eintracht Frankfurt. \"I think it was a good choice for me and that's why I chose Liverpool as it was the best option and I wanted to come.\"",
      "United will be hopeful that their inability to sign Ekitike will not come back to haunt them on Sunday. The Reds did manage to bolster their centre-forward position eventually as Benjamin Sesko was welcomed into the team.",
      "Sesko has got off to a slower start than Ekitike but he joined a team with more work to do than Liverpool. That being said, the Slovenian has scored in back-to-back matches for United prior to the international break to boost his confidence.",

      "As the dust settled on England's European Championship final defeat to Spain 18 months ago, few could have imagined Kobbie Mainoo would have earned just one cap since that 2-1 defeat in Berlin.",
      "Mainoo started the Euros final in midfield as a teenager and enjoyed an impressive tournament on the back of a breakthrough season at club level for Manchester United that culminated in a goal in an FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.",
      "England and United hero Rio Ferdinand tipped Mainoo to go and become one of the greats, while Gareth Southgate heaped praise on the midfielder ahead of selecting him in his final squad in 2024.",
      "But now, with England having confirmed their place in the World Cup in North America next summer, Mainoo is in the international wilderness.",
      "His sole cap since that final against Spain came in September 2024 when he played 77 minutes of a Nations League win over Republic of Ireland.",
      "Mainoo has slipped down the pecking order at Manchester United since Ruben Amorim's arrival with the head coach viewing him as a direct rival for captain and virtual ever-present Bruno Fernandes. It's meant Mainoo has been restricted to cameo appearances off the bench in the top flight. His only start this term was in the Carabao Cup shock loss at League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "The 20-year-old asked to leave United on loan in the summer window but that request was knocked back and any similar attempts to depart in January are likely to fall on deaf ears despite his lack of gametime.",
      "Amorim might not view Mainoo as a certain starter, but he knows the value in having a player of his quality in the squad should injuries strike.",
      "Not that any of that helps Mainoo, whose faint hopes of making a late run into England contention will be all but over if he can't find games at United.",
      "During the international break, Mainoo has made no secret of the fact he has been working hard on his strength and conditioning during his down time.",
      "He has been put through his paces by a fitness team at Complejo Deportivo Arroyo, Enmedio, a fitness centre and sports complex in the Spanish town of Estepona, posting updates on social media.",
      "The motivation for posting such content is clear – Mainoo and his camp want the world to see just how hard he is training and that he is doing everything he can to force his way into boss Amorim's plans and earn his way back into United's starting line-up.",
      "But Amorim is unlikely to budge any time soon on his selection stance. United resume their Premier League campaign at Liverpool on Sunday. Mainoo will likely again have a watching brief.",

      "Former Manchester United player and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is back on the job hunt after being fired by Besiktas at the end of August.",
      "The Norwegian was let go by the Turkish giants after losing to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport in Conference League qualifying. Since then, the rumour mill has gathered pace around where Solskjaer could be heading to next.",
      "Vacant managerial positions at Rangers and the Swedish national team are believed to be on Solksjaer's radar but, as of yet, no contracts have been signed. But with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest surrounding the 52-year-old and his potential next job.",
      "Since his exit from Besiktas, Solskjaer has been spotted back in England reuniting with one of his former United colleagues Kieran McKenna. The Ipswich Town head coach was promoted to the first-team coaching staff by Jose Mourinho but spent most of his time working with Solskjaer.",
      "Shortly after Solskjaer left United, McKenna joined the Tractor Boys and took them from League One to the Premier League before their relegation back to the Championship. On September 12, the Reds legend was in the crowd for the 5-0 victory over Sheffield United before returning shortly before the international break as Ipswich beat local rivals Norwich City 3-1.",
      "Some have insinuated that Solskjaer is the subject of an anecdote Paul Scholes shared on his The Good, The Bad and The Football Podcast. He told his fellow presenters Paddy McGuinness and Nicky Butt: \"I was actually with a lad the other night, who told me he was actually going to meet Rangers, and I’m not sure if he did, but his name hasn’t been mentioned.",
      "\"They contacted him, and he’s going to meet them in London the day after.\" When asked by McGuinness and Butt if it was Solskjaer, Scholes replied: \"No comment,\" but did reveal this person was not a current manager.",
      "Scholes could have also been referring to Michael Carrick but the wry smile suggests that McGuinness and Butt were potentially spot on with their Solskjaer guess.",
      "The bookmakers still consider it to be unlikely that Solskjaer is welcomed in at Ibrox, but reports have suggested that he has held talks with Sweden over their head coach role. Swedish media outlet FotbollDirekt understands these talks have taken place but his camp are refusing to comment on the matter.",
      "Solskjaer would not be alone in wanting the Sweden job though. Olof Mellberg and Graham Potter are also thought to be keen, with the latter expressing his interest after being sacked by West Ham United.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",

      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to judge Amorim after three years at Old Trafford but the Portuguese’s record of 37 points from 34 Premier League matches is surely setting alarm bells ringing in the boardroom.",

      "READ: World Cup turncoats include £50m Manchester United signing and iconic winner’s son",
      "That amount would be fine to steer away from relegation but, for a club with aims of pushing up the table, the Red Devils need more goals in their side.",
      "And now Spanish publication Fichajes insists that Man Utd have ‘identified a more than interesting target in the Middle East’ to give Benjamin Sesko some competition.",
      "Man Utd are ‘keeping a close eye on’ Retegui, who moved from Atalanta to Saudi Pro League side Al-Qadsiah last summer, and they have added him to ‘their list of candidates to strengthen their forward line’.",
      "The Spanish outlet adds: ‘Reports estimate that United could pay between 50 and 60 million euros (£44m and £52m) for his signing, a figure that pales in comparison to what Al Qadsiah paid, but which could convince if they negotiate well.",
      "‘The English club sees Retegui as an interesting player to complement or compete with its current attacking options. His recent performances support this.’",
      "Retegui has scored three goals in four Saudi Pro League appearances, while he has contributed four goals and four assists in Italy’s last four World Cup qualifiers.",

      "Another classic international break is in the books, and who could forget the thrills and spills of England’s rollercoaster ride to an easy 3-0 win over Wales and an easy 5-0 win over Latvia?",
      "Truly, the history books will have to be rewritten. Everything else is a footnote. England are going to the World Cup. We thought they might.",
      "We all know there’s a conspicuous elephant in the England selection room right now and we’re sure you’re eager to see just how far Jude Bellingham has fallen here. Some of you may even have skipped ahead. Naughty, but we’ll forgive you.",
      "Personally we’re more interested in just how far Djed Spence has climbed, but we fully appreciate that might just be us.",
      "As ever, the number-one and most important rule to keep in mind with the Ladder is this: this is not our top 50, but our best guess at what we think Thomas Tuchel’s top 50 is. And, just to set ourselves thoroughly up for November’s disastrous fall, we do think we’re starting to get a handle on how he’s approaching the job now. And who that is good/bad news for.",
      "Last month’s England Ladder is here for your perusal, with the brackets below indicating each player’s ranking within it.",
      "",
      "And just like we always do and just like we knew we would again, after bumping Kane down a spot just to feel alive we pop him straight back to the top. Has perhaps never been under less threat for his starting spot in this team, and does seem like a fever dream now to consider he was struggling so much during the Euros last summer that actual cheers greeted him being replaced by Ollie Watkins.",
      "The lack of competition for his place might be of more concern if he wasn’t just so unbelievably brilliant. We will still fight anyone who says he’s playing better than ever; he’s just doing all the same incredible things he did for years and years and years except instead of doing them for a silly team in a truly elite league he’s doing them for a truly elite team in a silly league.",
      "But the key thing here is the incredibleness and brilliance. Even those of us who believe his real goal tally to be zero must accept that Kane is now quite likely to reach 100 goals for a country where for over a century the 50-goal mark appeared to represent an unbreakable ceiling.",
      "Ronaldo-like longevity cannot be ruled out for a player who looks after himself impeccably, making it highly conceivable that when his England career does finally end he will have twice as many goals as any other England player in history.",
      "And people will still argue he isn’t an all-time great. Maybe he just needs a haircut.",
      "",
      "Just a brilliant player whose role and its importance grows with every game for both club and country. A perfect example of how stepping up in class as he did when leaving West Ham for Arsenal can help mould an excellent player into a truly world-class one.",
      "Very little more you could want from a midfielder than what Rice now delivers on a regular basis, and his set-piece prowess in particular absolutely screams tight-tournament-game difference-maker.",
      "As we say in every Ladder these days, the numbers next to his and Harry Kane’s names are largely meaningless because both are absolute nailed-on certainties.",
      "",
      "Has played every competitive game since Thomas Tuchel took over and has conceded not one goal. Quality of opposition a factor, for sure, but it’s still a remarkable degree of faultlessness for a player who absolutely loves playing for England and has become exceptionally good at it.",
      "",
      "Brilliant against Wales, quieter against Latvia, still we’re pretty certain when push comes to tournament shove a definite starter on the right in a full-strength England team, no matter how persuasive and admirable and extremely-useful-to-have-around-just-in-case the charms of Noni Madueke may be.",
      "As it is for England, so it is for Arsenal. It’s a very good situation for both, and there’s no real need to complicate it beyond that, we don’t think.",
      "",
      "Lovely to have him back in an England shirt for the first time in a year, and it just looked and felt right to have him there. There really is a lovely experienced and reassuringly reliable spine to that England team with Stones back in position ahead of Pickford and behind Rice and Kane.",
      "",
      "Continues to look utterly suited to and entirely unflustered by international football, and that partnership with Rice already looks like one that manages the neat yet deceptively difficult trick for a midfield duo of highlighting and accentuating each man’s strengths rather than each man’s flaws.",
      "It’s a trick that has quite famously proved beyond some of England’s very best central midfielders ever.",
      "One of the biggest and most significant problems to which Tuchel had to find a swift answer on this short sprint to attempted World Cup glory was ‘Who partners Declan Rice in midfield?’",
      "It is no longer a big or significant problem.",
      "",
      "His absence against Latvia was reportedly nothing more than ‘managing minutes’ so for now we’re still assuming he’s ahead of Ezri Konsa in the centre-back pecking order but there’s no real doubt now that both are in the top three of said centre-back pecking order.",
      "We very much enjoyed his ‘centre-back playmaker’ role against Wales. You just don’t see that often.",
      "",
      "Injured Reece James is injured. So, so utterly frustrating, but it does at least appear on this occasion that his latest absence from England duty was precautionary rather than strictly necessary and represented just some sensible club-country joint dialogue and decision-making towards a mutually beneficial final outcome.",
      "We’re very sure that a fully fit James is Tuchel’s first-choice right-back, given their history and James’ quality, but above all that because of the fact that in his absence during this break Tuchel didn’t actually even take the chance to look at a different right-back.",
      "Centre-back Ezri Konsa did the job for most of the Wales game, with left-back Djed Spence finishing that job and then staying there for the Latvia game.",
      "A left-back doing a passable fill-in job at right-back was at least a fun little Tuchel reversal of one of Gareth Southgate’s favourite tropes.",
      "",
      "We find ourselves in agreement with Tuchel but not, perhaps, with a majority of England fans that Gordon is the first-choice starter on the left-wing now.",
      "As with Morgan Rogers, the evidence Tuchel is showing us tells us that’s how he sees it, Gordon having started each of the last three games.",
      "We didn’t really understand much of the criticism of Gordon’s performance against Wales. The frustration that the end product wasn’t quite there is fine, but it seemed to be overplayed in regard to what was there, which was further evidence of how Gordon’s direct running on the left offers a counterpoint and contrast to England’s more methodical and patient approach elsewhere, giving them the ability to alter the pace and direction of their attacks in a pleasingly defence-disorienting manner.",
      "He also struck up an instant rapport with Djed Spence that possibly answers another of England’s thornier pre-World Cup posers.",
      "But even if the criticisms after Wales were valid, the Latvia performance silenced them. Created a big early chance for Harry Kane – and if you create a big chance for Harry Kane at this moment in time and don’t end up with an assist to show for it you can count yourself particularly unfortunate – before grabbing his chance to score a brilliant counter-attack goal the one moment Latvia’s back nine were briefly otherwise engaged on a rare and foolhardy attack .",
      "Your mileage may vary, but for us for now – and, far more importantly, for Tuchel – he’s won the battle with Marcus Rashford.",
      "",
      "A better showing against Latvia really would have been even more persuasive but when you combine the fact Rogers has started four of England’s last five qualifiers, including each of the last three in the No. 10 position, with everything Tuchel has side about backing and continuing to select the men in possession who are doing the business for him it becomes impossible to conclude anything other than that at this moment of time Rogers is England’s first choice in that position.",
      "And, as ever, while we may call it ‘our’ F365 England Ladder it is always nothing more nor less than our best guess at figuring out the current England manager’s Ladder.",
      "Sweep away all the narrative and the discourse and the noise, and when viewed like that it’s pretty clear how the land currently lies.",
      "",
      "Resurrected his Tottenham career in spectacular style last season, culminating in Europa League glory and a long-awaited chance for another trophy-and-cigars photo op, and now spending this season making a momentous climb in the England standings.",
      "In the summer, we had him down at 47 among the ‘might be in with a shot if injuries strike, we suppose’ afterthought slots, far too close to Phil Neville for comfort. By last month he’d jumped into a tentative ‘could make the final squad, actually’ position. And now we think he’s Tuchel’s first-choice left-back. Fight us.",
      "He’s the best pure defender England have available among their vast array of full-back options, probably on either flank, and our argument would be this: if you’re starting him, as Tuchel did in both games here, in friendlies and straightforward easily-won qualifiers, then you are surely definitely going to start him in your actual tournament games where defending might actually matter.",
      "Despite starting his career the other way round, Spence is now definitely a left-back who can do a job at right-back, and for England that really is probably the more useful way round to be. Is clearly working on becoming a more effective contributor to the attacking side of the game, and, while Wales were startlingly and surprisingly flimsy opposition at Wembley, there were plenty of encouraging signs in the way he and Gordon linked up on the left flank that night.",
      "He just looks the right fit at the right time, and a potentially huge beneficiary of Tuchel walking the walk with his ‘backing the players who deliver for me’ approach to selection.",
      "READ: Roy Keane guilty of lazy stereotypes with Djed Spence ‘defensive side’ worries",
      "",
      "The elephant in the room and the press have basically already told us this is going to be the only talking point for the now-moribund November international break. With England qualifying in record time and flawless fashion (six games, six wins, no goals conceded remember) something has to be bad and terrible and that something is going to be the Bellingham Situation. It already is the Bellingham Situation, but next month’s Bellingham Week will plumb fresh depths.",
      "And there’s no way out of it for any of us now. It’s going to be all the media want to talk about, which they will combine with sad shaking of their heads as if they are not responsible for any of it. And this happens especially if Tuchel picks him in November, but especially if he doesn’t.",
      "Which brings us to the big question for our purposes. Will Tuchel in fact pick him? It does seem to have been almost entirely overlooked and/or forgotten that this is a player who’s played about 120 minutes of football this season and for whom a fortnight spent building up fitness and sharpness really might prove just more useful in the long term than playing in two really very low-key and low-pressure internationals for England.",
      "But we must also consider that Tuchel is not keeping secrets or playing games. He’s very, very clear: he will back the players who deliver for him, and across the last two Bellingham-less international breaks, England’s non-Bellinghams have delivered for him. Tuchel even suggested Bukayo Saka only got back in this time because Noni Madueke, in Tuchel’s eyes the man in possession, was injured.",
      "This one really does feel like it’s more about Bellingham now than Tuchel. The England manager has no vendetta against Bellingham and nothing he’s said suggests he has any problem at all with picking him again in the future. But Tuchel is evidently now very comfortable with not picking Bellingham, and England’s results mean only Bellingham can change that. He has to a) play and b) play well for Real Madrid.",
      "If he does that, we’re pretty sure Tuchel will pick him. But it still feels pretty wild to be having any of this kind of uncertainty about a player who has for several Ladders in a row now formed part of the straightforward default top five. A group including Kane, Rice, Saka and Pickford, where, sure, there might be some internal shuffling of the order amongst them but you were still always dealing with the core five inked-in certain starters. At the very, very least, Bellingham is no longer part of that little group.",
      "",
      "An international break that did absolutely no harm to Konsa’s rock-solid squad-member status. Did a perfectly passable job as right-back in the first game before slotting seamlessly into his more customary centre-back role for the second.",
      "Neither game was among the more arduous of Konsa’s career, but there was one excellent tracking run and last-gasp chance-snuffing tackle for the highlight reel in Riga.",
      "He’s still one player where we will deviate slightly from the general rule that Tuchel’s most recent starters are his starters, because there are explanations as to why Konsa started both games.",
      "We don’t think he starts when everyone is available, given the explanations at hand for why Konsa started these games – and did so in different positions.",
      "What he definitely hasn’t done is fall many rungs from his previous ‘just outside the starting XI’ position.",
      "",
      "Seems very unlikely Henderson could play his way into a first-choice starting role in England’s dynamic new midfield, but also feels even less likely he could now play his way out of his current squad role as canny senior pro and standards-setter.",
      "Again, we don’t need to overcomplicate this one. Tuchel has picked him in his squad at every opportunity, but started him in a game only once, with five further caps coming as a relatively late substitute.",
      "You don’t necessarily have to agree with it or like it, but you can’t argue with the role clarity on display here.",
      "",
      "A very lively cameo from the bench in Riga adds another layer of intrigue to the No. 10 battle, while Eze also obviously offers another tantalising option in the wide areas.",
      "Has made four appearances for England during this qualifying campaign, with three of those as substitute for the last 30-odd minutes.",
      "We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: we’re still getting to know Tuchel and his ways and, while we do think we’re getting the hang of him now, when he shows us how he sees a player with this level of clarity we will cheerfully go along with it.",
      "Eze is a valued and valuable member of the squad, a dynamic game-changing option from the bench, but not yet a regular starter. All of that is absolutely fine.",
      "",
      "Got himself a goal in a decent enough performance against Wales, and we have absolutely no problem at all with Watkins filling that all-important Harry Kane’s Back-up role that exists in any England squad.",
      "What we do have a problem with is the fact Watkins now appears to be pretty much as unchallenged for that particular role as Kane is for his.",
      "",
      "Deeply unfortunate injury timing given how well he was playing for both club and country, but when he returns we fully expect him to be a thoroughly capable and entirely trusted Saka back-up for both club and country.",
      "",
      "Came on for Gordon in both games this month. A slight curiosity of that is that this therefore represents a break where his place within the squad has become more assured even as he has slipped slightly further away from a starting berth.",
      "Does just feel like Tuchel prefers what Gordon offers on that left-hand side, but Rashford has done himself no harm with his form for Barcelona or work during this camp, and offers a nice level of international and big-tournament know-how in a squad that is still a bit of a mix of a handful of extremely experienced veterans and a whole bunch of excellent but quite inexperienced players, yet not all that many in the 40-80 cap sweet spot.",
      "",
      "Current reports suggest an eight-week lay-off for Livramento after that nasty looking injury against Arsenal. Could have been better, could also have been much worse. But it does mean that he’s also set to miss the November international break and hand Djed Spence further opportunity to bed himself in as England’s first-choice left-back, a position that had looked there for Livramento’s taking.",
      "",
      "Assorted injury hassles have restricted him to barely an hour of football for England during Thomas Tuchel’s reign to date, meaning he is one player it is still desperately hard to place. Is he a Gordon, or is he a Foden? We just don’t yet quite know exactly how Tuchel sees him.",
      "This is where we were with just about every player a few windows ago; it’s a relief at least that Palmer is now something of an outlier in that regard.",
      "",
      "Still the only other goalkeeper Tuchel has used besides Pickford during his eight games in charge, sitting on the bench in the No. 13 shirt for each of the other seven.",
      "Ergo: he’s the second-choice keeper until we see some kind of evidence that he isn’t.",
      "",
      "An obviously excellent footballer but perhaps the least starry of England’s many, many attacking options across both flanks.",
      "Yet we must again defer to the evidence Tuchel is presenting us. Bowen has been involved in all but one of the international breaks for which Tuchel has been in charge, and has made an appearance in five of the six games for which he’s been in the squad.",
      "And if you’re a fringe player who was going to miss out on one international break so far under Tuchel, you would definitely want it to be that grisly one in the summer where England scraped a wholly unconvincing 1-0 qualifying win over Andorra before losing a friendly to Senegal.",
      "Shrewd work from Bowen; the only other Tuchel game in which he’s played no part at all was the other game against Andorra, in which England were scruffy 2-0 winners.",
      "Causation and correlation be damned; the facts are that Bowen has played some part in Tuchel’s five most convincing matches as manager of England, and no part in the three least convincing. If nothing else, it’s a handy knack.",
      "",
      "A key rule of Thomas Tuchel England squads does appear to be that once you’re in them, it is up to someone else to force you out. And after seven years in the international wilderness, Loftus-Cheek is now very much in Tuchel’s England squads.",
      "",
      "In the squad again, and came off the bench against Latvia to perform a role that mainly amounted to being a very, very large target for England’s flurry of free-kicks and corners in the closing minutes of a long-settled contest.",
      "What it does do is tell us that he’s still one of Tuchel’s four centre-back picks at this stage, albeit clearly the least secure with Stones, Guehi and Konsa all looking like World Cup certainties.",
      "",
      "Look, third-choice keeper is rarely a position to worry yourself about unduly. If you reach a point in a tournament where you’re using your third-choice keeper, you’re probably already mired in deep and inescapable sh*t anyway.",
      "And the fact Trafford has sat on the bench as third-choice keeper for every single one of Tuchel’s games to date remains the most compelling data point available to us.",
      "But there’s an obvious cloud on the horizon here with Trafford having lost the No. 1 spot at Man City to Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Pretty hard to argue at this time that if England did find themselves having to actually use a third-choice keeper that you’d be more reassured to see Trafford out there than, say, Nick Pope.",
      "",
      "If you’re a promising young midfielder and Pep Guardiola says he wants to turn you into a full-back, let him. Earned his first senior call-up this month after Reece James’ withdrawal, and while he didn’t get his chance in the end against either Wales or Latvia nor did any other right-back.",
      "Which means under the rules of Tuchelism, O’Reilly is in until he isn’t. Because there has to be another full-back in there; you cannot possibly pick Reece James as your only specialist right-back and then rely on Spence or a shuffled-along centre-back as your only cover.",
      "Whether that ends up being O’Reilly or someone less rogue, time will tell. But again. Tuchel’s rules, not ours. Nothing we can do about that, apart from the times when we decide we’re simply going to break them.",
      "",
      "Did get some minutes against Wales, but did little with them really. He’s a damn fine player and one of our favourites, but very clearly now sits behind Morgan Rogers and probably Eberechi Eze and, when it comes down to it, almost certainly also Jude Bellingham among England’s really very good No. 10 options. And we’ve not even mentioned Cole Palmer or Phil Foden, until just now, when we did mention them.",
      "With Anderson’s emergence reducing the likelihood of any Bellingham return being alongside rather than in front of Rice in England’s midfield, it does all rather leave Gibbs-White looking like your classic ‘one of six players cut from the provisional squad’ next summer. The James Ward-Prowse role, if you will.",
      "",
      "You felt for him during the Latvia game. Just isn’t playing enough football for Arsenal, and short of a Riccardo Calafiori injury we’re really not sure that’s going to change. It was entirely understandable that he looked so far off it when handed a chance to impress in Riga, but the problem for Lewis-Skelly is that there isn’t really a huge amount he can do about it apart from just knuckle down and hope.",
      "Currently hard to shift the notion that with all things being equal and if nothing materially changes between now and next summer he will find himself behind both Djed Spence and a fit-again Tino Livramento in the pecking order.",
      "And third-choice left-back isn’t usually a great position to be in when tournament squads are being finalised and whittled down.",
      "",
      "Might be a slight case of heart ruling head here because we really do love Wharton and feel like England might have missed a trick with him. Elliot Anderson appears to have locked down a starting spot alongside Rice and that’s all good. We have no issue there; Anderson is a fine player and definitely seems to be one of those who just looks right at home in the international game.",
      "But it would be a massive shame if Tuchel can’t find at least a squad role for someone of Wharton’s supreme talent and ability to offer a fresh approach from an unusual angle. He’s your classic ‘footballer in an era of athletes’ kind of player, one who just sees the game slightly differently, capable of spotting and most importantly delivering the kind of passes others simply cannot.",
      "The concerns around his ability to cover the requisite ground for Tuchelball are valid if dreary, but we do love the idea of Wharton as a bench option for times when a particularly stubborn low block requires unlocking.",
      "And luckily we can bump him up the list slightly here without breaking any of our own rules, because Tuchel himself admitted Wharton was unlucky to be overlooked this time around given his Crystal Palace form.",
      "‘He deserves to be with us,’ Tuchel said after naming his latest squad. Yes, Thomas. Yes he does. If only there were someone who could make that happen.",
      "",
      "Has spent pretty much his entire England career being just about the hardest player to place in the Ladder and the one most likely to make us look very clever and then very stupid on a month-by-month rota basis.",
      "We still don’t have much idea what to do with him and precious little Tuchel-era data to go by. The positive spin on it might be that while Reece James does appear to be Tuchel’s first choice the manager didn’t take the chance to look at any other actual right-backs during James’ absence this month, which would indicate a door that remains there to be opened.",
      "Does, though, still feel like the question at the moment with TAA and the World Cup is not so much ‘Is he in the squad?’ but ‘How far away from the squad is he?’",
      "",
      "Could a great big grown-up year like 2026 really feature a good old-fashioned, full-throated Jack Grealish Clamour? It absolutely f*cking could, you know. We are so back.",
      "",
      "Remember when Tuchel started him over Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back that time? That was a good bit. And people say Germans have no sense of humour.",
      "",
      "The only way is down until something changes. And that change is going to have to be increasingly drastic while looking increasingly unlikely. Foden is currently destined for an absolute puzzle of an England career.",
      "",
      "Has impressed for Bayer Leverkusen after a summer move Liverpool might live to regret to a fairly hefty degree, and was on the bench for the Wales game before being forced out of the squad to face Latvia by injury. Stones, Guehi and Konsa appear absolute certainties for the final squad, but there does look like being at least one centre-back spot – currently held by Dan Burn – for which competition at least still exists.",
      "",
      "Playing Premier League and Champions League football – and playing them very well indeed apart from that costly 30-second wobble against Arsenal – while England’s third-choice goalkeeper rides the bench at Man City. Has to give him some chance, doesn’t it? And at the very least positions him as a non-panic-inducing option should some misfortune or other befall any of the three keepers currently ahead of him.",
      "",
      "That Senegal game really did hurt a lot of chances for a lot of players.",
      "",
      "You do occasionally just get those players where, for no apparent rhyme or reason, international football just passes them by. With each passing international break the fear grows that Branthwaite really could find himself alongside Steve Bruce on Sporcle quizzes 15 years from now.",
      "",
      "Permanently injured, which really doesn’t help your chances of an international recall. Yet a glance around the Premier League reveals just how little Solanke might have to do for Spurs if/when he does recover from injury to find his way back into the England frame should Ollie Watkins or, heaven help us all, Harry Kane get injured.",
      "",
      "Almost ever-present for Man United this year, but might actually be higher up this Ladder if he’d just simply been injured again. As it is, his very apparent availability and continued absence from Thomas Tuchel’s squad tells a pretty clear story for a man whose final England appearance now looks increasingly likely to be the Euro 2024 final.",
      "The fact he plays as the left of three centre-backs for United also doesn’t help his dwindling international recall hopes given his way in to a Tuchel squad would surely be at left-back.",
      "However, he cannot yet be entirely discounted purely due to doubts around other options. Newcastle pair Tino Livramento and Lewis Hall are both currently injured, and Lewis-Skelly is desperately short of minutes for Arsenal.",
      "It really might not take many more misfortunes to befall England’s left-backs before Shaw finds himself back in the fold.",
      "",
      "Still technically the most recent striker called up by Tuchel that isn’t Kane or Watkins, so technically we guess still third choice there? We should probably put him a place or two higher, really, given the rules. But just can’t quite bring ourselves to do so.",
      "",
      "41. Lewis Hall (44)\n42. Levi Colwill (38)\n43. Conor Gallagher (29)\n44. Kyle Walker (39)\n45. Kobbie Mainoo (33)\n46. Harvey Elliott (45)\n47. Ethan Nwaneri (46)\n48. Aaron Ramsdale (43)\n49. Harry Maguire (48)\n50. Phil Neville (50)",
      "Bayern Munich and England striker Harry Kane has given his latest update on whether he could return to Tottenham in the future.",
      "With one sentence, Roy Keane proved that he is basing his opinion on Djed Spence on something other than actually watching him play.",
      "It is literally impossible for the England ‘focus’ to be on anything other than the fan ‘backlash’ at Thomas Tuchel even after qualifying for the World Cup.",
      "Arsenal players enjoyed more success during the international break than any of their rivals, even if Tottenham pushed them mighty close…",
      "Harry Kane is showing no signs of slowing down but at 32 there will be a need for England to eventually look beyond him. And the options are scarce.",

      "Man Utd have bumped Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton above Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in their list of midfield targets, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have been showing similar inconsistencies to last season with Ruben Amorim’s side winning three, losing three and drawing one of their first seven matches.",
      "Man Utd improved their attacking options in the summer transfer window by spending around £200m in total on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Red Devils also brought in a new goalkeeper in Senne Lammens but many fans and former players think they overlooked the signing of a new midfielder.",
      "Man Utd are crying out for a quality defensive midfielder and were briefly linked to Baleba over the summer before it became evident the Red Devils couldn’t afford the huge £115m fee which Brighton were demanding for the Cameroon international.",
      "The i Paper claim that England international Wharton has ‘overtaken’ Baleba on the Red Devils’ list of midfield targets with Amorim ‘an admirer of the directness to the Crystal Palace midfielder’s game’.",
      "READ: World Cup turncoats include £50m Manchester United signing and iconic winner’s son",
      "The report adds: ‘Sources have told The i Paper that Wharton’s effortless ascendancy, along with the fact Baleba seems to struggle with the attention, having not completed a single full 90 minutes for Brighton this term, has caused several senior United figures to rethink their shortlist.’",
      "Transfer insider Graeme Bailey reckons Man Utd could sign a midfielder in January but a loan signing could be more realistic before a big signing in the summer.",
      "Bailey told United In Focus: “It could be the case that we see a midfield signing in January, maybe even a loan before we see a more permanent fixture in the summer.”",
      "On Baleba and Wharton, Bailey added: “And United are fully aware of the prices we are talking about, they know Baleba, Wharton and the like are not £50million or £60million players, they realise they are twice that. Ineos are backing United and know the sort of finances need to compete at the top.”",
      "Brighton chairman Tony Bloom insisted that Man Utd’s pursuit of Baleba was not a saga as the Red Devils very quickly “went away” after learning the midfielder wasn’t available for sale.",
      "Bloom said: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga.There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn’t available this summer and they went away.",
      "“So we’ve had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense.",
      "“Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he’s with us for this season.”",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim “would be vulnerable” if a UAE-based consortium push through a takeover of the club, according to a journalist.",
      "There was speculation ahead of the match that a heavy defeat could see Amorim facing the sack with the Portuguese head coach gaining just 37 points from 34 Premier League matches since replacing Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe came out last week and claimed he wants Amorim to remain in the position for three years to give him the best chance of making his mark.",
      "That is unlikely to happen if Amorim doesn’t improve and Daily Mail journalist Chris Wheeler reckons he’s even more likely to be out of work if a rumoured takeover by UAE-based consortium goes through.",
      "Wheeler said in a Q&A in the Daily Mail: “Ask any manager and they will tell you that new owners and good job prospects rarely go hand in hand. Erik ten Hag was on thin ice the moment Ratcliffe assumed the day-to-day running of the club, and eventually fell through it despite a late reprieve after winning the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "READ: World Cup turncoats include £50m Manchester United signing and iconic winner’s son",
      "“So Amorim would be vulnerable even if he was on a par with United’s expectations after bringing him in from Sporting Lisbon a year ago and spending heavily on new players to fit his system. A ‘haul’ of just 37 points from his first 34 Premier League games – not to mention no European football and a Carabao Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town – is well below par.",
      "“Ratcliffe and the hierarchy he has put in place at Old Trafford have invested heavily in Amorim, so it would be embarrassing in the extreme to pull the plug now. A new owner is unlikely to have any such reservations.”",
      "Man Utd spent over £200m on new signings over the summer transfer window with the Red Devils concentrating on improving their frontline.",
      "Many fans and former players reckon it was a mistake to not sign a midfielder but Wheeler insists Man Utd “won’t be short of a few quid” over the next couple of transfer windows as long as they comply with PSR.",
      "Wheeler added: “The latest financials released last month underlined the scale of United’s challenge: the club posted a record £666.5m revenue over the last year, but still made an overall loss of £33m – down 70.8 per cent on the previous year.",
      "“United do have money available, but they have to operate carefully within the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules. Ratcliffe has made investment in the first team his priority, which is why United spent another £236m on new signings this summer – roughly in keeping with previous years.",
      "“A central midfielder was the glaring omission among the five players brought in, which raised questions over the wisdom of signing two No 10s in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“Whether United need two central midfielders depends largely on the futures of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo, with Casemiro coming to the end of his contract and doubts over Manuel Ugarte’s performances. They will also look to strengthen elsewhere in the team.",
      "“United’s revenue streams will remain strong despite the absence of European football, and the losses are coming down. As long as they stay within PSR, United won’t be short of a few quid in the summer – or even in January – if needed.”",

      "The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell has a theory that the Glazers are trying to get some interest going in Man Utd before they attempt to sell in 2027.",
      "Speaking on the Talk of the Devils podcast, Whitwell said: “Some people will now say that it’s in the Glazers’ interest before February to get a new deal in place with somebody else because that creates competitive tension and they get a higher price for their shares.",

      "“So maybe all this kind of chatter, is it because the Glazers want to – I don’t know, I’m theorizing here – but there’s a world where they could want to get some interest around it to get something going before that deadline.",
      "“After that, they might not be able to get the same kind of price. It’s a fascinating dynamic.”",
      "Journalist Andy Mitten also had his say on the takeover rumours, he said: “I don’t have any evidence of the investment. And I’m a little bit sceptical because I’ve seen people before say stuff that doesn’t end up being true, and then they get caught out and say, ‘Whoa, I was only sort of saying what I’ve heard.’ And they realise that there’s a level of scrutiny to this, that they’ve got to back up what they’ve said.”",
      "Host of the podcast, Ian Irving, added: “You think he (Turki Alsheikh) would be aware of that, though, considering his position and considering his social media following. He knows what impact that tweet is going to make.”",
      "Mitten replied: “I would have thought Rio Ferdinand would have been aware when he said Manchester United are going to be taken over by Qatar, which was completely baseless. Sometimes people make mistakes.”",

      "And although Keane did not go as far as Scholes as he spoke about Rashford on ITV during their coverage of England’s World Cup qualifier with Latvia, he has said that Rashford cannot be exonerated for his part in making United a poor environment for players.",
      "You would have to say that Keane probably has a point – Rashford had very clearly checked out of Manchester United long before he actually left, though he might argue that the chicken came before the egg.",
      "Keane said: “Towards the end of his time at United, there was obviously issues. He was part of the problem with the environment, especially one of the most experienced players at United.",
      "“He should have been setting the standards and showing new people at he club what it’s like to be a United player. But that’s been well documented.",

      "Keane is at least mature enough to wish Rashford well, in contrast to Scholes, who pointedly said he struggled to feel happy for the former United trainee in his new life in Spain.",

      "While on international duty, Cunha gave a sit-down interview with Globo Esporte, one of his home country’s biggest sports programmes. In a 15-minute conversation, the Brazilian spoke of playing for his national team, of his new manager Carlo Ancelotti and of course Manchester United.",
      "It’s not quite Cristiano Ronaldo levels of s**ting on your own doorstep but Cunha was perhaps a little more revealing than he meant to be. After two months, Cunha admitted he felt like he had been at United for a lot longer because “of the club’s current situation”. He spoke of the pressure he felt to start getting results as quickly as possible because he is “a big signing”. At one point he even referred to himself in the third person.",
      "Cunha’s interview revealed that the catastrophic aura surrounding the club from fans and pundits is seeping through to the players. If Fergie’s United used to give players an air of invincibility, Amorim – and those who came before him – seem to instill a sense of crisis.",
      "With one billion fans across the world, the biggest challenge for any player moving to United is the weight of expectation and the pressure that comes with that. Usually a manager’s job would be to protect players but when he himself is facing daily questions about his tenure, it is understandable that the players get caught in the crossfire.",

      "At Wolves, the team was built around him, allowing him to line up on the team sheet as a centre-forward but not really play like one. In Amorim’s 3-4-2-1, there is no obvious space to do that.",
      "The Portuguese boss is not the first manager to fall in love with Mason Mount, which means his starting spot is pretty much locked down. Benjamin Sesko has scored twice since he started leading the line and Bryan Mbeumo is more suited to a wide-right role than Cunha.",
      "Cunha may well be a £62.5million signing that has no obvious place in the team. The player himself commented on this, bringing up his youth spell as a midfielder before 4-3-3 took over the game and he suddenly had to become a number nine.",
      "“I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number 9 shirt,” Cunha said.",
      "“I played my entire base as a midfielder, and when I became a professional, I encountered the world of 4-3-3. You have to adapt: either play centre-forward, winger, or ‘eight’.",
      "“They eliminated the midfielder position, and you have to adapt.",
      "“But I see it positively, as it has given me experience, many more positions, and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team.",
      "“Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.”",
      "While it’s true that versatility is a positive trait, it can also make it hard to nail down a position. Amorim began the season with Cunha as the centre forward but pulled him deeper after the signing of Sesko, and there is every chance that for United’s next game away at Liverpool, Cunha is again on the bench as he was for the win over Sunderland.",
      "Cunha started up front for Brazil in the first game of this international break and although he did not score, he did provide an assist. After his time with Brazil is over, he heads back to the doom and gloom of United and if it feels like a long time after two months, just imagine how long it will feel come the end of a most likely underwhelming season.",

      "Borson added: “It just seems to me that it would be quite odd timing, and given how thorough the process was before that didn’t flush out this kind of proposal, why now when things are worse would somebody be prepared to pay more?",
      "“It’s a harder deal to do now than it was two years ago, so why would that make sense now? The economic picture is not as good. They’ve got the stadium situation. You’ve got Jim Ratcliffe in the way.",

      "There’s countless good videos and articles on this (Athletic, Coaches Voice etc) but with an oversimplification, any formation that emphasises 3 at the back and two wingbacks is really a better out-of-possession than in-possession style team. If you want your team to be a smart counter-puncher prioritising quick turnovers and attacks, then it can be good, if you tailor your squad to that specific tactic. Oliver Glasner’s Crystal Palace are the best current incarnation of this.",
      "What this formation doesn’t give you however is an abundance of on-ball creation/high possession – in effect you sacrifice some midfield creativity to get that extra CB in, and in many cases, you now rely on your WBs to either provide the crucial width, or sometimes be the ones popping up in the half spaces in front of the boxes. Now they could be quite creative in their own right (Frimpong at Bayer) but they’re still not true attacking players, so when facing a set defence, they’re unlikely to offer the attacking threat of a dedicated winger/forward – they need to be in a mismatch situation.",
      "There are two notable exceptions – Conte’s Chelsea and Alonso’s Bayer – but both of those were a) one off seasons exploiting unique situations and b) successfully countered by the following season/underwent serious regression.",
      "Assuming you want United to dominate in a similar vein to the most successful teams of the last 30 years in the PL, you want to be consistently controlling possession, having the best attacking talent getting space in dangerous areas and generating high value chances whilst limiting them at the back. Even with the slight shift towards increased verticality in the PL this season, the better teams are clearly still prioritising controlling the midfield with men and quality.",
      "Now, clearly if you have flexibility within your formation (ultimately what made Alonso’s Bayer work was the sheer unpredictability of where any given player would be with their great passing interchanges) that can overcome some of these problems, but what makes Amorim such a poor coach (at this point) is both his formational AND tactical rigidity – he doesn’t just play the same structure, but within that structure plays the same way, making him exceptionally predictable.",
      "There are other elements (smaller pool of specialists that excel at these formations means less talent at a higher price point available to purchase) which IMO prevent 3-4-3 from establishing itself fully, but yeah in essence, more good attacking players having the ball often, and in better areas really should be United’s modus operandi, and 3-4-3 ain’t that.\nTom (also, Ian, that Liverpool team were… not that good) Leyton",

There is excessive drinking, property damage, fisticuffs. The whole experience. It would come as no surprise to any American that bedlam pursues sporting events like lies to a columnist. None of this touched upon. Similarly, the isolation of such troubles to England fans is a wilful misrepresentation of the reality. As things stand, football trouble is rife all over the world, from the stabby streets of Rome to the riotous banlieu of Paris. Let’s not touch on South American rivalry or Eastern Europeans training in combat before games. England fans are enriched by some real scummers for home Danny Dyer is keeping the old value alive. But football games around the world, at both national and club level, is a violent affair.",

      "Danny Murphy has used Arne Slot’s situation at Liverpool to explain why Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s recent comments about Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim were “ill advised”.",
      "The Red Devils had an awful 2024/25 campaign with Amorim failing to qualify for Europe in his first season at the club after Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "And it’s been similar so far this term with the Red Devils show lots of inconsistent form after winning three, losing three and drawing one of their seven Premier League matches, while they were knocked out of the League Cup by League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has picked up just 37 points from 34 Premier League matches since taking over from Erik ten Hag towards the beginning of last season.",
      "There were some rumours that a heavy defeat against Sunderland would have potentially cost Amorim his job after another shaky start to the campaign.",
      "READ: Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal stars in danger of missing out on expanded 48-team World Cup",
      "After that match, an interview was released in which Ratcliffe suggested that Amorim could be afforded three years to get it right at Man Utd.",
      "The Red Devils’ first game back after the international break is against defending champions Liverpool, who have lost their last three matches in all competitions, and former Reds midfielder Murphy insists Ratcliffe’s comments about Amorim’s future were “ill advised”.",
      "Murphy told BetWright: “I think Sir Jim Ratcliffe got cornered a bit and wasn’t especially well prepared for the interview where he talked about giving Ruben Amorim three years to turn things around at Manchester United. I don’t think he should have said that and it’s inevitably going to come back to bite him.",
      "“If United lose their next three or four games, the pressure from the fans will get too much and the board will have no choice but to sack Amorim.",
      "“Ratcliffe would have been better off saying that the board are backing the manager and that they’re being patient, whilst recognising that it isn’t going to be the easiest of tasks – but it would at least show that they are right behind him.",
      "“The reality is you can’t make any guarantees in football. You could argue that with Liverpool winning the league in Arne Slot’s first season at the club – you can’t make a guarantee that he will be there in three years and they’re flying.",
      "“In my opinion, it was ill advised of Ratcliffe to not have an answer prepared for each of those questions and it will probably come back to bite him in six months’ time.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim “would be vulnerable” if a UAE-based consortium push through a takeover of the club, according to a journalist.",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is demanding that the Red Devils invest in Inter Milan defender Federico Dimarco, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are one of two clubs hoping to do a deal for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jobe Bellingham in the winter transfer market, according to reports.",
      "Some Man Utd legends have been ‘approached’ by a UAE-based consortium looking to buy the club from the Glazers, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United can never dominate with a formation made for counter-punchers for reasons outlined in full here."

      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has “been found out” under Ruben Amorim, according to former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol.",
      "Man Utd don’t have any European competition to concentrate on this term and they have already been knocked out of the League Cup at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Their defeat to Grimsby was Mainoo’s only start in all competitions this season with his other five appearances coming off the bench in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim frustrated the Man Utd hierarchy when he publicly admitted that Mainoo was fighting captain Bruno Fernandes for a place in the starting XI this season.",
      "Knowing that ousting Fernandes from the line-up will be virtually impossible, Mainoo requested a loan move in the final days of the summer transfer window.",
      "READ: Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal stars in danger of missing out on expanded 48-team World Cup",
      "Jason Wilcox persuaded the England international to stay but Mainoo is likely to seek game time in January with the 2026 World Cup around the corner.",
      "Liverpool legend Nicol reckons Mainoo has “been found out” under Amorim and the Man Utd midfielder needs to improve his defensive game.",
      "Nicol told ESPN: “In my opinion, Mainoo is great with the ball at his feet but when the opposition has the ball, he doesn’t do enough.",
      "“In fact, he doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t stop people getting at Man Utd back four. And the fact that that is one of the biggest problems United have and this guy still can’t figure it out.",
      "“I think basically he’s been found out because at the end of the day, when you play for the top clubs and you want to be challenging, your players have to contribute on both sides of the ball.",
      "“And if there is one thing Mainoo doesn’t do, it’s contribute defensively.",
      "“The fact that Casemiro is starting over him consistently tells you that there is a problem and the kid is not as good as we thought he was when he first burst onto the scene.”",
      "When asked if Amorim could help Mainoo improve those aspects of his game, Nicol added: “It’s interesting you say work with him, because it looks like the work rate on that side isn’t there.",
      "“Any coach who has a player who he thinks isn’t giving their all, when it comes to having to play one guy or another, that guy is getting shoved away.",
      "“If you’re the coach at United and you’re watching Mainoo time after time letting people run off them and looking as though you are not that bothered about it, you’re going to the bottom of the pile.”",
      "Speaking of Mainoo last month, Man Utd boss Amorim said: “Like a lot of guys, he wants to play more.",
      "“I believe a lot in Kobbie but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done. I think he can do so much better. He can improve in a lot.",
      "“And sometimes I think for some guys it’s [the level he’s playing at now] enough. For him, it’s not enough. Maybe it’s not fair but I think I’m helping Kobbie Mainoo and that’s it.",
      "“He will have opportunities like the other guys. If I feel during the week that he’s the best player to play, he’s going to play and I proved that already to every player here.",
      "“I believe a lot in him. I have the same thing [opinion] that you have and that is a top, top player, but he can be so much better, so I’m focused on that.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim “would be vulnerable” if a UAE-based consortium push through a takeover of the club, according to a journalist.",
      "Man Utd are willing to accept a deal in the region of £30m for Joshua Zirkzee in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Marcus Rashford’s hopes of joining FC Barcelona from Manchester United permanently have been given a new ‘massive boost’.",

      "Nothing like an October international break in which England don’t even play a competitive game until the very last moment to leave you pondering choices. Your own, mainly, but also those of football clubs.",
      "Relentlessly silly, frequently stupid football clubs. The regrets. The f*ck-ups. Call them what you will, but here’s just 10 things Premier League clubs might now wish worked out differently.",
      "Some are entirely self-inflicted f*cktastrophes, some are unfortunate circumstance, and the rest some combination of the two.",
      "And then there’s Nottingham Forest, who are currently just some kind of insane f*ck-around-and-f*nd-out machine to the extent we’re not even sure regret has taken hold yet.",
      "",
      "There really is no other word for it. It’s the only word that adequately explains and conveys Nottingham Forest’s behaviour since about halfway through last season. This is a club that got dangerously high on the smell of their own farts and may now pay a ludicrously heavy price.",
      "They were very, very good at what they did last season under Nuno Espirito Santo. There was perhaps no other team in the league with a more clear-headed gameplan, delivered to consistent effect by a squad of players perfectly suited to the task.",
      "Even then, there were occasional glimpses. Occasional momentary lapses where Forest tried to be something different – something more? Something better? – than what had worked so well for them.",
      "There was one particular game against Newcastle, in which Forest had played their usual counter-attacking game to fine effect to lead 1-0 at half-time. Yet in the second they tried to play front-foot football that was not and is not their way and were picked off with ease by a grateful Newcastle, who ran out comfy 3-1 winners.",
      "That one match is now starting to look like a microcosm of these two seasons. The success in the first half has led them to a state of not-yet-earned giddiness and, yes, hubris.",
      "There is an arrogance for any club outside the cosseted elite to assume that their hard-won Premier League status is now entirely secure. The casual manner in which Forest allowed the Nuno situation to develop into an irreparable rift was extremely careless and far more risky than anyone from excitable owner down appeared to accept or even realise.",
      "And quite simply no Premier League team that is even dimly aware of the fact that relegation remains a theoretical possible fate would then bring Ange Postecoglou along into a season that has already begun, less still into a squad so unsuited to his wildly different methods.",
      "And no Premier League team thinking about anything but relegation is even looking at the Dyche button a few weeks later. That sound you can hear is a penny dropping far too late.",
      "A chaotic and potentially ruinous six-week misadventure that may now end with Forest right back with the sort of manager they had before, just a less good one. All while ensuring there is now absolutely no chance of Postecoglou’s undeniably entertaining nonsense ever featuring in Our League again. Cheers, lads.",
      "",
      "We’re not saying it was a bad idea to sign Alexander Isak or that he is anything other than a brilliant player. Even if someone mischievously puts that in the headline, which they might, the pricks.",
      "We’re just saying that signing Alexander Isak might not have been Liverpool’s best use of valuable time and resources as the final hours of the transfer window drained away.",
      "It is still very funny that by the time Liverpool actually got round to completing that Isak move they had already long before that signed Newcastle’s preferred replacement in Hugo Ekitike. But as more time passes, the more it looks like that joke is on Liverpool every bit as much as it was on Newcastle.",
      "Isak was the ultimate luxury signing. Not a player Liverpool needed, but one they could have. But by the time he came through the door Liverpool had already signed Ekitike and Florian Wirtz.",
      "Sure, Liverpool’s attack is stronger with Isak than without and it’s a long season with deep squads needed and all the rest.",
      "But by the time Liverpool were toing and froing to get that deal done it was far, far more necessary to perform some more prosaic but necessary remedial work in the defence.",
      "Sure, the extent of Ibrahima Konate’s struggles might have been hard to predict, but relying entirely on him and Virgil van Dijk – who is older than new Luton manager Jack Wilshere – was always a risk that didn’t need taking.",
      "Marc Guehi was right there. He was up for it, and so too were Palace until Liverpool turned such a fundamental transfer – Guehi wasn’t even a back-up, he’d have been straight in for Konate – into so much of an afterthought that Palace had no time left to get their own Guehi-less squad straight and thus pulled the plug.",
      "It is, obviously, not a straightforward either/or situation. Clubs can and obviously do work on multiple deals at once. But it’s hard to shake the notion that completing the more ostentatious and headline-grabbing deal left Liverpool with their eyes off the less exciting but more necessary prize. It’s a rare mis-step, but a potentially costly one.",
      "Guehi would be more useful and make more tangible positive difference to Liverpool right now than Isak is and does.",
      "READ: Isak, Gyokeres make red-faced return to Liverpool and Arsenal to resume Premier League flop fight",
      "",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe continues to paint himself into a distinctly difficult corner over his at-all-costs backing of Ruben Amorim. Maybe he’s right. Maybe it will eventually all come good. But that looks a massive odds-against gamble right now.",
      "Ratcliffe has doubled-down harder than ever with his ‘three years’ daftness, a quote that has a small chance of becoming his ‘I always win something in my second season’ and a very, very high chance of either becoming yet another point of United ridicule or further hindrance to taking a necessary step.",
      "Almost impossible now to believe that anything more than the stubborn refusal of Ratcliffe and INEOS to accept the embarrassing fact of their own error is keeping Amorim in the job, and that really is just a double victory for silliness.",
      "Just own it. Face up to it. It’s not like Forest appointing Postecoglou, is it? It’s not like sacking Erik Ten Hag and appointing Amorim was an obvious mistake literally the world could see from a mile away. Really, the only quibble people could reasonably have with appointing Amorim when United appointed one of the most impressive young coaches in Europe was why had they dallied in the summer rather than make the change then?",
      "Nobody seriously imagined the Amorim Era would be this bad. Lots of people, and we’ll put ourselves in this camp, thought it might be really quite good.",
      "But it isn’t. It’s really sh*t. And the damage in sticking with Amorim is already being done. United have already lost Marcus Rashford for what will ultimately prove to be a pittance, so in thrall are they to Amorim and not wanting to be embarrassed. They might well lose Kobbie Mainoo next.",
      "And nothing in his record at the club suggests he’s worth it. And the comparisons with Mikel Arteta’s early years at Arsenal just don’t hold water. Arteta came under serious pressure and rightly so; he could very easily have been sacked. But he never had Arsenal in anything like the dire straits that have become the new normal at too-big-to-succeed Man United.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest’s loss may now prove West Ham’s gain, and at the very least you’d expect Nuno Espirito Santo to get the Hammers playing halfway competent and broadly effective football that keeps them away from relegation unpleasantness.",
      "But they had that. With David Moyes. And they didn’t want that anymore, because they wanted to aim higher and dream bigger. Which is absolutely fine. For what it’s worth, we once again thought similarly. It probably was time for Moyes to move on and West Ham to see what they might be able to do with a more progressive front-foot manager.",
      "But then they appointed Julen Lopetegui, who is the Spanish David Moyes.",
      "When that didn’t work they finally took a more West Ham approach and went for Graham Potter. And then gave him absolutely nothing of what he needed in the summer.",
      "Throughout the struggles in the final weeks and months of last season, it was clear that Potter could not be fairly judged until he’d had a pre-season to get his ideas across, and ideally a few players to help make that transition.",
      "Potter himself is far from blameless. He may well not have succeeded even if given the conditions to do so. But now we’ll never know, because West Ham didn’t just fail to do what was needed during the summer; for large parts of it they didn’t even particularly seem to be trying.",
      "",
      "It may only be slightly exaggerating things to say that Leeds’ entire season on their return to the Premier League may come to be defined by the period between Daniel Farke responding to a creditable 0-0 draw against Newcastle on August 30 by asking for two new attacking players, and the window closing with Leeds bringing in no new attacking players.",
      "The frustration is two-fold. First, because Farke’s request was not unreasonable. This was not a moon-on-a-stick request. He was asking for Harry Wilson and Manor Solomon, not Lamine Yamal and Vini Jr.",
      "Two, Farke’s Leeds had already by then shown proof of concept. They had shown against both Everton and Newcastle that they were capable enough defensively of mounting a serious bid for survival, but were hampered by attacking inadequacies that had seen them manage just one goal in three games – and that a penalty.",
      "While there have been more goals since the closing of the window, with six in their most four Premier League games, three of those came at Wolves. And right now we’re inclined to consider those as roughly as irrelevant to any assessment of Leeds’ long-term survival prospects as conceding five goals at Arsenal.",
      "Leeds definitely still have a decent shot at staying up in a league that offers more opportunity to do so for a competent promoted team than at any other time in the last few years. But it really wouldn’t have taken a lot of activity in those last few days to make that decent shot a truly compelling one.",
      "",
      "We’ve already stretched the concept of ‘this season’ right back to include the entirety of the transfer window that precedes it, and that feels like it’s absolutely fair enough. The transfer window is surely part of the season that follows it far more than it is part of the season that preceded it.",
      "It is upon that following season that its influence is felt. But can we really claim things that happened in May during last season as being this season’s regrets and/or f*ck-ups.",
      "When it comes to Wolves, we’re saying yes. Yes we can. Our reasons are these.",
      "First of all, May is very much a month when cricket is played and is therefore summer. That’s just basic. Second, that very deliberate phrase we used just now about the transfer window: it is upon that following season that its influence is felt.",
      "And that’s exactly how we feel about the last four matches of Wolves’ 24/25 season. They meant absolutely nothing to 2024/25, Wolves having already secured survival with something to spare by winning six games in a row through March and April.",
      "But their influence on 25/26 already feels far more significant. Because this is very familiar Wolves territory: a bad end to one season bleeding into a bad start to the next.",
      "That winning run – albeit against three terrible relegated sides and the other three most ridiculous and feeble Premier League teams at that time in West Ham, Spurs and Man United – offered Wolves the chance to avoid that familiar end-of-season sinking feeling.",
      "They weren’t easy games in that final four, but we’re not asking for them to make that winning run 10 games or anything. Lose to Man City by all means if you really must, but even just a home win against either Brighton or Brentford would have taken Wolves into summer with some wind in their sails.",
      "It might not have been enough. The loss of key players would still have been keenly felt, but the bleak nature of their start, one that leaves them now as the only Premier League team still without a win having declined a Dr Tottenham prescription at the last moment, would have felt far less inevitably self-fulfilling.",
      "",
      "Breaking our own rules a bit here by treating Chelsea as a club where regrets and f*ck-ups are measured in the same way by the same metrics as football clubs, rather than what Chelsea now are.",
      "When correctly treated as a football player trading company, selling Noni Madueke made a fair chunk of sense. He was far from indispensable and even Arsenal’s fans didn’t particularly want him at the time.",
      "But Chelsea have often looked a weary side since their Club World Cup win and, with several attacking players currently underperforming and relying more and more on the increased goal contributions of Moises Caicedo, it might have been nice to keep Madueke around the place.",
      "And that’s before even considering the whole ‘strengthening a direct rival’ angle, one that allowed Arsenal to achieve what was previously thought impossible: suffer a minor Bukayo Saka injury setback without doom-laden proclamations about the sky falling in from long-suffering fans of the only club to ever suffer injuries.",
      "",
      "Not going badly for Spurs at all, really, all things considered, and this one is definitely far more in the ‘slightly irritating’ category than a lot of others on the list.",
      "They did some tidy transfer work in the end this summer, albeit with a couple of cartoonish bits of Spursy slapstick along the way, and so far the idea of replacing Ange Postecoglou’s ludicrous football with Thomas Frank’s not ludicrous football is proving an effective if not always necessarily exhilarating decision.",
      "Where Tottenham might have slightly missed the boat is behind the scenes. In hindsight, we perhaps should have seen Daniel Levy’s departure coming. There was a clear sense this summer of a man attempting to cement his legacy, most notably when even agreeing to sit down for a chat with dangerous far-left Commie firebrand Gary Neville.",
      "But he didn’t actually leave until after the transfer window. And the Lewis Family’s new-found interest in the day-to-day running of Spurs and injection of £100m of fresh capital has also come now specifically at a time when it cannot actually be used to better the on-field situation.",
      "And this is suddenly a season ripe with opportunities for Spurs. Arsenal look too good but are still Arsenal; Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City all look more vulnerable to some extent or other than had been expected, Manchester United are still in full clown-car more, Nottingham Forest have collapsed in on themselves, while neither Aston Villa nor Newcastle appear in quite as good a position to challenge as in the recent past.",
      "The margins between success (i.e. getting back in the Champions League) and failure (not doing that) are likely to be very tight again this season. A chairman who hadn’t actively antagonised every other club in the division and an extra £100m to throw around really might have meant more in August than it does in October. Or even January when it may be too late and, of course, Value Is Hard To Come By.",

      "",
      "Guess in a way the real one here would be ‘having an entirely unsustainable wages-to-turnover ratio’ but that’s all a bit heavy really.",
      "It feels like Villa spent the entire summer in something of a funk on the back of missing out on Champions League football in the manner that they did and the knock-on effect that had on what they could do and who they could bring in during the summer.",
      "The good news is that there really is a very good chance that, like with Spurs last season, it all ends up working out for the best and they get back in the Champions League anyway with a lovely shiny European trophy ending an uncomfortably long drought.",
      "But right now, despite a four-game winning run that has lifted the gloom and funk to a decent extent, it does look rather more likely that something is ending rather than beginning at Villa, that they will now slink back having so nearly but not quite muscled their way right in to England and thus Europe’s top table.",
      "",
      "Not entirely or even mainly their fault, but Newcastle’s summer was an awkward, distracting and distracted one. In a league where standing still is rarely good enough, theirs was a summer spent inevitably and uncomfortably trying to avoid tumbling backwards.",
      "The uncertainty – or perhaps the long, painfully drawn-out certainty – around Alexander Isak’s departure didn’t help make it any easier for Newcastle to identify and secure a replacement, with those potentially coming in understandably keen to know exactly where they might stand before committing to the club.",
      "They do seem to have just about got there in the end with Nick Woltemade, even if it they had to pay a hefty premium to avoid the catastrophe of bringing in no replacement striker whatsoever. The big German absolutely screams cult hero, but it’s an awful lot to ask for him to come anywhere close to replacing what Isak gave them, and Newcastle weren’t able to even attempt the always entertaining if not perhaps reliably successful ‘Sell Elvis and buy The Beatles’ approach.",
      "Jude Bellingham is an obvious point of interest in the latest England Ladder, but Thomas Tuchel’s willingness to walk the walk provides useful clarity elsewhere.",
      "With one sentence, Roy Keane proved that he is basing his opinion on Djed Spence on something other than actually watching him play.",
      "It is literally impossible for the England ‘focus’ to be on anything other than the fan ‘backlash’ at Thomas Tuchel even after qualifying for the World Cup.",
      "Arsenal players enjoyed more success during the international break than any of their rivals, even if Tottenham pushed them mighty close…",
      "Marcus Rashford has been described as “part of the problem” at Manchester United by a legend at the club. He’s not as harsh as Paul Scholes though.",

      "Are Manchester United up for sale? Why did the Saudi General Entertainment Authority chairman get involved? What do the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe think?",
      "You wait ages for a bus, then two come along in the space of a couple of years but the first lays everyone off and keeps making silly comments about free lunches, while the second might not actually exist.",
      "The Manchester United takeover machine has left the station again. But have the Glazers finally resolved to cut ties after being hit with a leveraged buyout-shaped guilty conscience two decades in the making? Has Sir Jim Ratcliffe decided he is too old to be willingly dealing with this nonsense? Or is there a mystery third option involving a sort of consortium which ‘can generate billions for the club’ and idolise Ousmane Dembele?",
      "It feels like a good time for a little Q&A session to try and shed some light on precisely what is going on.",
      "Certainly not ostensibly. Ratcliffe’s INEOS only completed the purchase of a 27.7% stake in the club in February 2024 for £1.25billion, increasing that stake to 28.9% in December 2024 when the last payment of a further £238m financial injection to boost the club’s infrastructure was made.",
      "That grants INEOS Limited – owned by Ratcliffe, Andy Currie and Manchester United board director John Reece – 28.9% of outstanding shares and voting rights, plus control over footballing operations, which has been exercised flagrantly and is unlikely to be relinquished soon or easily.",
      "Ratcliffe recently pledged to honour the entirety of Ruben Amorim’s three-year contract; those were not the words, nor have these been the actions, of a man who wishes to sell.",
      "Members of the Glazer family still control 48.9% of total outstanding shares altogether, with 67.9% of voting rights split between the six American siblings.",
      "The Glazers and INEOS are, as the club’s official website puts it, the only ‘two entities [who] hold greater than 10% of the voting rights in Manchester United plc’.",
      "While the changes to that ownership structure have not delivered the success INEOS will have craved or the Glazers perhaps expected, it is vanishingly unlikely either party will want to release their shares and offers are hardly being encouraged either way.",
      "It boils down to a couple of quotes chucked into the void of an international break.",
      "Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of the General Entertainment Authority, a government department charged with developing the entertainment sector in Saudi Arabia, sparked the furore by posting on X:",
      "‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",
      "He later clarified that he was ‘not the investor, nor are they from my nation’, and the reported deal ‘might not necessarily happen’ anyway.",
      "Then a few days later a familiar name cropped up again in the news cycle: Thomas Zilliacus was back to take any seat at the top table he could find.",
      "Having spent an uncomfortable amount of 2023 arguing with a fellow Manchester United bidder who Ratcliffe later suggested “nobody’s ever seen” and might not actually even “exist”, Zilliacus capitalised on the unexpected commotion to bring his ideas into the equation again.",
      "The Finnish former Nokia head and XXI Century Capital founder teased “joining forces with the right parties with the sole aim of bringing Manchester United back to where it should be as the number one club in the world”.",
      "He felt “the opportunity is still there” to invest, aimed another fan-friendly dig at the Glazers for “not doing what should be done”, said he would “have nothing against working with people like Jim Ratcliffe or any investor, whoever that may be”.",
      "Zilliacus also confessed his love for players like Ballon d’Or winner Ousmane Dembele while saying he would “never have brought a player like Neymar to Manchester United” in a definite blast at Ed Woodward.",
      "It was then claimed on Monday that a ‘United Arab Emirates-based consortium’ was ‘meeting Manchester United officials in London’.",
      "Manchester United have thus far dismissed the rumours privately to sources when asked; it does seem to be that there actually is a lot of smoke without fire here.",
      "It is impossible to know their intentions but there has been no indication that the Glazers are willing to sell any more of their shares.",
      "There is, however, some interesting fine print contained within the INEOS purchase of a minority stake which remains relevant.",
      "As part of that deal was a ‘drag-along rights’ clause which was scheduled to become active 18 months after the initial investment, lasting until February 2027. The mechanism came into effect in August.",
      "In short, it makes the full sale of a company theoretically easier by preventing a minority shareholder from blocking any deal those who hold the majority want to go through. In this case it means that if the Glazers found someone willing to buy 100% of the shares in Manchester United, Ratcliffe would be forced to sell his stake in the deal.",
      "If that deal is made before February 2027, the share price must be above the $33 Ratcliffe paid. After that, it can be lower.",
      "INEOS also had first refusal on any shares the Glazers wanted to sell, although that expired without needing to be activated in August.",
      "There is a belief within the club that the Glazers are more than happy with the ownership situation, providing as it does a useful lightning rod for criticism in INEOS and Ratcliffe while allowing them to maintain overarching control of an incredibly lucrative investment.",
      "There is one bidder conspicuous by his absence in the current speculation: Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani.",
      "His takeover bid failed in 2023 when he attempted to buy 100% of shares in Manchester United for £4.79bn but repeatedly failed to provide proof of funds.",
      "Chris Wheeler of the Daily Mail has suggested that while Jassim ‘has kept an eye on developments and is aware of the clause, there is ‘zero interest’ in acting upon it’.",
      "A few reasons are cited: Qatar’s desire to focus on other projects such as securing the 2036 Olympics; the success PSG have had making buying another club ‘less attractive because someone else has already been there and done it in Europe’; and the media doubt his interest drew – Jassim was said to have sent ‘legal letters’ to Manchester United and Ratcliffe at the time.",
      "The belief is that Jassim has ‘moved on’ but the Middle East would not be short of prospective buyers if given enough encouragement.",
      "If Manchester United were sold now at the $33-per-share minimum that Ratcliffe is legally entitled to, that would give the club a current valuation of £4.3bn – making them the most expensive football club ever sold.",
      "Finance expert Kieran Maguire believes it would cost even more, telling SPORTbible recently: “Manchester United are a premium brand, a complete buyout would be at least £5bn but then a significant spend would be required on and off the pitch.",
      "“Current stock market value is about £3bn which is 15 per cent lower than at the end of June, despite all the rumours circulating [around] the club, which suggests the market is sceptical about whether a full blown bid is likely.”",
      "If this absolute mess is worth at least £5bn, you can certainly see why there is more of a greater appetite to sort the myriad issues rather than sell up.",
      "Jude Bellingham is an obvious point of interest in the latest England Ladder, but Thomas Tuchel’s willingness to walk the walk provides useful clarity elsewhere.",
      "With one sentence, Roy Keane proved that he is basing his opinion on Djed Spence on something other than actually watching him play.",
      "It is literally impossible for the England ‘focus’ to be on anything other than the fan ‘backlash’ at Thomas Tuchel even after qualifying for the World Cup.",
      "Arsenal players enjoyed more success during the international break than any of their rivals, even if Tottenham pushed them mighty close…",
      "Marcus Rashford has been described as “part of the problem” at Manchester United by a legend at the club. He’s not as harsh as Paul Scholes though.",

      "But the main point here is that right now all of them are at serious risk of missing the World Cup, with Sweden already looking mighty relieved to have that Nations League-based safety net to get them into the play-offs because they sit forlornly right at the very bottom of their qualifying group at the halfway stage, nine whole points behind perennial qualifiers Switzerland and six behind second-placed Kosovo.",
      "",

      "A 3-1 return win over Finland means fears of missing out altogether have now eased, but even a win over Netherlands in the next international break is unlikely to save them from what will be tricky play-off routes in which 16 entrants of assorted quality are whittled down to four qualifiers.",

Galatasaray striker and Liverpool mini-crisis contributor Osimhen is perhaps the biggest global star from a squad that has underperformed badly to trail Benin and South Africa with just one match to go to try and salvage the situation, but he is far from alone.

      "Matheus Cunha believes the combination of signing for Manchester United in the summer and playing for Brazil represents a “spectacular personal moment”, and that’s just one of the worrying admissions he made while on international duty.",
      "Cunha joined United for £62.5m in the summer on the back of 15 goals and six assists in an outstanding 2024/2025 season for Wolves. But he’s yet to score or assist in seven games for his new club and was dropped to the bench by Ruben Amorim for the 2-0 win over Sunderland last time, with his replacement, Mason Mount, scoring and impressing in his stead.",
      "The Brazilian will be well aware of the number of quality players who have been signed by United for similarly hefty fees and failed to live up to expectations, and appears to already be feeling the stress.",
      "After leading the Selecao line in their 5-0 win over South Korea on Friday, Cunha admitted it feels as though he’s been at United for far longer than a couple of months amid his and his teammates’ struggle to pick up the positive results required to keep Ruben Amorim in the job.",
      "“I try as much as possible to adapt, to learn… it’s only been two months,” he said. “But it feels like I’ve been here for a long time because of the club’s current situation.”",
      "Christ, imagine how Luke Shaw feels.",
      "And Cunha is also falling into the familiar Old Trafford trap of ramping up the pressure on himself as a player signed for big money to right the United wrongs.",
      "He added: “I have to get results as quickly as possible because I’m a [big] signing… all of this helps a lot to find the adaptation faster and feel as good as possible in the national team.”",
      "But perhaps most worrying of all, and this has been a criticism aimed at innumerable United stars for over a decade since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, is Cunha’s belief that he has ‘arrived’.",
      "“We live in a constant search for something. Even though a difficult moment when you’re pursuing a dream and encountering some obstacles leaves you feeling a bit lost,” he added.",
      "“You want to understand, and despite having so much, you don’t feel fulfilled by what you’ve achieved.",
      "“You have to constantly remember where you came from to understand where you’ve arrived.",
      "“What I was searching for as a person more than anything else, I’m slowly finding. You constantly want to improve. That’s innate in human nature, but I can’t help but stop and enjoy this moment.",
      "“Feeling privileged to wear the jersey of the greatest national team in the world, one of the greatest clubs in the world… it’s a spectacular personal moment.",
      "“I have an incredible family, another little girl now, everyone is doing well and feeling healthy. I’m enjoying all of this in a positive way.”",
      "All too many players have seen United as an end-game; the point at which they’ve ‘completed football’. And while that was previously because it was the club where trophies were won, it’s more recently been the location to accumulate wealth while resting on laurels.",

      "In 15 damning words, a rejuvenated Marcus Rashford summed up the reason for his and almost all others’ inability to maintain peak performance levels at Manchester United, and why Sir Jim Ratcliffe is clinging to the increasingly false hope of Ruben Amorim turning things around at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford now has eight goal contributions in nine games for club and country, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has described him as an “unbelievable” talent and president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck. The £26m required to make his loan move permanent at the end of the season looks like an absurd bargain.",
      "But we’ve been here before with Rashford. After 43 goals and 22 assists across two seasons under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer he was being linked with £100m moves abroad. 30 goals in all competitions under Erik ten Hag in 2022/2023 saw United hand him a very lucrative five-year contract to ward away the same eager suitors. But troughs have followed those peaks.",
      "Rashford scored just five goals in Solskjaer’s third season and eight in Ten Hag’s second. Suggestions of complacency, overconfidence and distraction have all been aimed at Rashford by people who don’t and can’t know why he’s never been able to sustain the top level required to be labelled a world class footballer. But Rashford himself has perfectly sound justification for his own inconsistency.",
      "“I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time,” he said.",
      "The 27-year-old had been asked by ITV ahead of England’s World Cup qualifier against Latvia on Tuesday what he thought about Thomas Tuchel’s claim that the only thing preventing Rashford from being considered a truly elite footballer was his lack of consistency.",
      "“But I completely agree,” Rashford added. “I think consistency is what I need to bring into my game and I am looking to do that. I want to be at my best, not sometimes, but as often as possible.",
      "“When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life and the way you train.",
      "“We have just had so many changes so far in my career but I have to look forward and that it definitely one of the things I want to put right and improve on to be at my best more often.",
      "“When I am at my best I really enjoy everything about the sport.”",
      "Ten games for Barcelona is evidently too small a sample size to make any grand claims over Rashford’s consistency, but his comments do speak to the predicament Ratcliffe and Ineos now find themselves in with regards to Amorim’s future at the club.",
      "Whether he will be given this time or – as we suspect – not, Ratcliffe said last week that Amorim needs “three years” at United to prove he’s a “great coach”. And while that felt like an almost farcical vote of confidence in a manager who’s overseen their worst Premier League season ever and has accrued just 37 points in 34 top flight games, the quest for consistency goes a long way to explaining it.",
      "Because having just one player – Bruno Fernandes – you could reasonably pick out as being a consistently good footballer in over a decade isn’t normal, not just for a club like Manchester United, but any football club.",
      "It’s far too simplistic to suggest that the chopping and changing of managers is solely to blame – other top clubs with a similar approach don’t suffer in the same way – and blindly sticking with the latest recruit just because they happen to be in charge when this dawning realisation occurs could be catastrophic.",
      "But it makes sense that Ratcliffe, in a bid to build a team of consistent footballers, is desperate to avoid the inconsistencies that Rashford, and doubtless others who have either left Manchester United or remain in the midst of the madness, see as the cause of their struggle to remain at the pinnacle once it’s been reached at Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford has been described as “part of the problem” at Manchester United by a legend at the club. He’s not as harsh as Paul Scholes though.",
      "According to reports, Marcus Rashford’s hopes of joining FC Barcelona from Manchester United permanently have been given a new ‘massive boost’.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona ‘will trigger’ their option to sign Marcus Rashford permanently from Manchester United next summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already decided whether to give FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford a ‘surprise lifetime’.",
      "We all love to laugh at Man Utd players thriving away from Old Trafford, but Liverpool have more players in the top ten Premier League defectors of the season.",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck in landing Marcus Rashford from Man Utd over the summer, according to reports."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo is on track to reach an unprecedented scoring milestone but when he could hit his 1,000th goal? Between the Lines returns for a bonus edition to break down the numbers.",
      "Ronaldo set yet another scoring record when he became the outright top scorer in World Cup qualifying history with his double in Portugal's 2-2 draw against Hungary on Tuesday night.",
      "The goals put him on 41 from 51 World Cup qualifying games, moving him clear of the previous record-holder, former Guatemala striker Carlos Ruiz on 39, with Lionel Messi third in the list on 36.",
      "Ronaldo has now scored a record 143 goals in 225 games for his country in addition to 805 in 1,068 games at club level, putting him on a staggering combined total of 948 career goals.",
      "Ronaldo turned 40 in February but he continues to rack up impressive numbers at club level as well as internationally, albeit against weaker opposition in Saudi Arabia, where he has scored 104 goals in 117 appearances across four seasons with Al-Nassr.",
      "With 32 goals already for club and country in 2025, he is maintaining a remarkably consistent level of productivity in front of goal. Ronaldo has averaged more than 50 goals per calendar year since 2010.",
      "His highest scoring year came in 2013, when he smashed 69 goals and won the Ballon d'Or. Amazingly, his total has only dipped below 39 goals once in a calendar year in the last decade and a half.",
      "It seems there's a lot more to come from him too.",
      "With Portugal set to qualify for next summer's World Cup, and with two years to go on his Al-Nassr contract, Ronaldo is projected to become the first player in recorded history to reach the 1,000-goal mark in October 2026 based on his current scoring rate.",
      "Ronaldo's opening goal against Hungary was his 181st with his weaker left foot. His second was his 608th with his right.",
      "His double demonstrated his all-round threat attacking threat and Ronaldo is of course similarly dangerous aerially, with 157 of his goals, roughly 17 per cent, having come with his head.",
      "His goals have been split relatively evenly between home and away and neutral venues. His tally includes 178 penalties but he has also scored 135 times from outside the box, including 64 direct free-kicks.",
      "By competition, the biggest share of his goals has come in LaLiga, where he scored 311 times across nine seasons with Real Madrid.",
      "He remains the top scorer in Champions League history with 140 goals and also found the net 103 times across two spells in the Premier League with Manchester United.",
      "His favourite opponents, in terms of which sides he has scored the most goals against, are all based in Spain, with Sevilla, in particular, grateful to have seen the back of him.",
      "Ronaldo smashed 27 goals in just 18 appearances against the Andalucian side, with Real Madrid's bitter rivals Atletico and Barcelona also featuring high up in the list.",
      "Tottenham rank as his favourite English opponent, with Ronaldo having scored 14 times in 20 games against them, while Luxembourg are his favourite opponent internationally.",
      "On 948 and counting, Ronaldo's quest for 1,000 goals continues.",
      "On the subject of goalscoring, Monday's Between the Lines looked at England's reliance on Harry Kane and the worrying lack of other options. Where are all the English No 9s?",

      "Wednesday 15 October 2025 12:56, UK",
      "Which top performers are flying under the radar in the Premier League so far this season? We pick an Unsung Heroes XI...",
      "Henderson has been an integral part of Crystal Palace's recent club-record unbeaten run. The 28-year-old shot stopper started 18 of Palace's 19 unbeaten games between April and October and this season has kept six clean sheets in 11 appearances - no other Premier League goalkeeper has kept more clean sheets in all competitions this season.",
      "Henderson also boasts the best figures so far in the Premier League this season for xG prevented - he has conceded five Premier League goals this season despite being expected to have conceded almost eight goals.",
      "Signed permanently from Fiorentina this summer for £14m, Kayode has been one of Brentford's best attacking outlets this season. The 21-year-old Italian has started all of the Bees' seven Premier League games - either at right-back or right wing-back - and currently tops the charts for most successful dribbles of all Premier League defenders this season.",
      "He also ranks third of all defenders in the top flight this season for most passes played into the box (38) and fifth for most sprints (131).",
      "Senesi has been one of Bournemouth's key performers this season. He has been part of a well-marshalled defence which has helped steer his side to a club-record start to the season, with the Cherries winning 14 points from their opening seven Premier League games. The 28-year-old Argentine has started all of these games.",
      "His tenacity this season brings up a statistic that no other player in the division has made more clearances and interceptions combined than Senesi.",
      "Tarkowski has been very much Mr Reliable at the back in recent seasons for Everton. The 32-year-old has been ever-present for the Toffees in the Premier League this term and has helped them up into eighth position in the table - this time last season they were lying 16th.",
      "Tarkowski's strength is winning the ball for his team - of all Premier League defenders this season, only Patrick Dorgu has won more duels than the Englishman and only Virgil van Dijk has won more aerial duels.",
      "Mitchell has been another one of Palace's reliable constants in recent seasons with the 26-year-old having started 66 of Palace's last 67 Premier League games. It could be argued that he has been unlucky not to have added to his two England caps - the last of which came in 2022 - especially when you see that no player has won more tackles than him in the Premier League this season.",
      "He has also been productive offensively, whipping in seven successful open play crosses, the only defender with more this season is Wolves' Hugo Bueno.",
      "It seems the £29m paid by Everton for Dewsbury-Hall could be a shrewd piece of business. The 27-year-old started Everton's opening six Premier League games this season which was his best run of top-flight starts for two-and-a-half years. He started only two Premier League games for Chelsea in all of last season.",
      "When comparing his time so far at Everton to his previous four Premier League seasons for Leicester and Chelsea, we can see his passing accuracy has improved and he is creating more chances. His four chances created in the 2-0 win vs Brighton in August was the most he had made in a Premier League match since a game for Leicester in February 2023.",
      "Stach arrived from Hoffenheim for £17.4m this summer and the 26-year-old German hasn't looked back since. The 6ft 4in midfielder has started all seven of Leeds' Premier League games so far and has already recorded a goal and an assist - both coming in the 3-1 win at Wolves last month.",
      "His all-action game is backed up by the fact that only Elliot Anderson has covered more ground in the Premier League than Stach this season and only Bruno Fernandes and Jack Grealish have created more chances than the German.",
      "Ndiaye has been another one of Everton's bright sparks this season, the 25-year-old is the club's top scorer this season with three Premier League goals and, going further back, has nine goals in his last 18 league starts since January.",
      "The Senegalese attacker boasts a 50 per cent shot conversion rate this season, scoring from half of his six shots taken. No Everton player has shown more desire to win the ball back or to take a player on as the stats suggest.",
      "Minteh has arguably been Brighton's best player this season, the 21-year-old Gambian - signed from Newcastle for £30m in the summer of 2024 - has been an ever-present in the league and has recorded either a goal or an assist in three of Brighton's last four Premier League games.",
      "He currently ranks in the top two of all Premier League players this season for sprints (only Adrien Truffert more), touches in the opposition box (currently top with Jack Grealish) and successful take-ons (only Mohammed Kudus more).",
      "Anthony has made a blistering start to the season, having been involved in five of Burnley's seven Premier League goals scored so far. With four goals and an assist, only Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo have scored more goals this term. He has, in fact, scored four goals in his last six Premier League appearances, having scored just three in his previous 34.",
      "The 25-year-old - signed for just £8m from Bournemouth this summer - has outperformed his xG by +1.8 this season which is the fourth best record in the Premier League. Another standout stat is that the only Englishman to have scored more league goals than Anthony in Europe's major Leagues this season is Harry Kane.",
      "Brentford's No 9 has made an impressive start to the season having scored five goals in his eight appearances, including four Premier League goals - his first in the competition. Last season his campaign was disrupted with two knee injuries which is why the 24-year-old Brazilian made only one Premier League start for the Bees last term.",
      "Two of his four Premier League goals came inside the first 20 minutes in the 3-1 win vs Man Utd in late September - only Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney have scored more goals across Brentford's first six games of a Premier League season.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the minority owner at United, has said he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",

      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "Ultimately, this is a United side that is suffering from scars from a mentally tough previous season - finishing 15th as well as losing a European final. They have lost a lot of games as well, 21 of Ruben Amorim's 50 in charge.",
      "But despite disappointing losses and performances to the likes of Grimsby and Brentford, there is still a feeling of optimism inside the walls of Carrington.",
      "United feel, despite some of the poor results, that their data and metrics show that this side are improving. The eye test suggests that they are as well, looking at the performance against Arsenal, and first halves against Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "The Sunderland performance demonstrated flexibility from Amorim, something he has been accused of lacking. The team defended in a 4-4-2 and attacked in a 3-4-3.",
      "They look like they have a potential emerging No 1 in Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko had by far his best game for United so far, his pressing and ability to bring others into play were particularly impressive.",
      "United's ultimate aim for this season is a return to European football. Whether that is the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League - we will have to wait and see where this team can end up, but the reality is this team is still being rebuilt.",
      "The next run of fixtures will give all watching a better indication of what will be possible this season - with away trips to Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham and just the one home fixture to Brighton before the next break - no matter how the results go, we will learn a lot.",
      "The £200m new look front line of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha all look back to match fitness, as well as Mount, who scored a lovely goal against Sunderland before the break.",
      "If United can rescue a positive season from a rollercoaster start, there is room for optimism next summer in what could be an intriguing transfer window for United.",
      "With big contracts set to expire, there will have to be decisions made on the likes of Harry Maguire and Casemiro.",
      "There is a realistic prospect that the Brazilian's contract won't be renewed next summer and his three-year stay at United could come to an end.",
      "If that does happen, the freed-up space on the wage bill would represent an opportunity for United to strengthen in that area of the pitch.",
      "A midfielder remains a key area for United to strengthen next summer and although they have been long-term admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba, he is just one of a number of players they have looked at in the position.",
      "After a £50m redevelopment of the men's first-team training facility completed in the summer, United's next aim at Carrington is to upgrade their academy facilities.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe mentioned Arsenal's faith in Mikel Arteta when saying he would like to give Ruben Amorim three years at Man Utd, but how does his record in his first 50 games in charge compare? Have your say in our poll",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",

      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "\"We all know how football works. Before the next international break, Man Utd have got four games, Liverpool, Brighton, Forest and Spurs.",
      "\"What happens if they lose all those games? There will be another international break. Everybody will be talking about Ruben Amorim's future again.",
      "\"This is a very significant intervention by Jim Ratcliffe to come out and back Ruben Amorim. I personally think the backing is not 100 per cent. If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",
      "\"He's just saying 'Ruben needs to demonstrate he's a great coach over three years'. 'We have to be patient'. 'We have a long-term plan'. 'It isn't a light switch'.",
      "\"It's not a light switch, but Manchester United are one of the biggest clubs in the world. I would say the only clubs that really compare to them on a worldwide basis are Real Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "\"What would journalists in Spain who cover Real Madrid or Barcelona be saying if Real Madrid finished 15th in the table? What would they be saying if their new manager was bottom of the table when it came to results since he'd taken over?\"",

      "Amorim said ahead of the game that he is convinced criticism from within the media is affecting his players and their confidence in his much-maligned 3-4-3 system. He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me. So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys when you say the problem of our team is the system.\"",
