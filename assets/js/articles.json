      "Carlos Baleba's contract is believed to contain a sell-on clause that could potentially sting Manchester United. The Red Devils have made their interest in the Brighton and Hove Albion star known this summer.",
      "That's despite the Seagulls' insistence that their gifted midfielder isn't available, while they've also attached whacked a hefty price tag on him of around £100million. As a result, United bosses have reportedly conceded that a move before September 1 is now highly unlikely, and they already have an eye on next year.",
      "However, future attempts to secure the Cameroonian at Old Trafford could be hampered by a sell-on clause, as reported by Fabrizio Romano. It's claimed that Baleba's current deal includes a provision that 15 per cent of any sale from Brighton will go to Lille.",
      "Brighton were said to have agreed the clause with the Ligue 1 team when the two clubs negotiated a deal worth around £26m two years ago. This could shed light on Brighton's steep valuation of Baleba and their firm position in discussions about a sale.",
      "The Seagulls have a specific amount in mind they want to receive to let the young player leave the Amex Stadium, considering a portion of it will go to his former club. Theoretically, without the contract clause, United might have been looking at an £85m asking price for Baleba, as Brighton wouldn't be losing £15m of their £100m valuation to Lille in that scenario.",
      "Selling players would certainly ease the PSR pressure on the Red Devils. And while there's still hope that a deal can be struck to offload Alejandro Garnacho, with Chelsea reportedly closing in on the winger, other surplus players like Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony seem to be stuck in limbo.",
      "United have managed to cut around £12million from their wage bill after Marcus Rashford agreed to a year-long loan to Barcelona with an option to buy, although the club were hopeful of finding a permanent home for the academy graduate, who has fallen out of favour with Amorim.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund's future is uncertain following the arrival of Sesko from RB Leipzig in a £73.7m deal earlier this month. Despite being linked with loan moves to Napoli and AC Milan, the Dane is determined to stay in the north west and fight for his place in the new season.",
      "Amorim struggled last season with his ageing midfield, including Casemiro and Christian Eriksen, but it's not just the middle of the pitch that needs bolstering before the transfer deadline.",
      "Andre Onana, who cost a hefty £47.2m from Inter Milan in 2023, has failed to justify his price tag, making several costly errors in the Premier League despite being touted as one of the world's top goalkeepers.",
      "The Cameroonian has only just returned from a hamstring injury, leading to Altay Bayindir stepping in as Amorim's chosen keeper for United's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday. After United's 1-0 defeat, it remains to be seen whether they will make a last-minute bid for a new No. 1 before the transfer window closes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alexander Isak is seemingly happy to burn bridges left, right and centre in an effort to force his Newcastle exit. His latest shot came in the form of a statement, accusing Newcastle of broken promises.",
      "The Swede is currently refusing to train or play for the Magpies, making it known he's played his final game for them. All of that whilst his employers maintain he is not for sale despite Liverpool's well publicised interest.",
      "Isak has claimed that \"promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time.\" His downing of tools has come as a huge shock given his status as a hero on Tyneside, his role in Newcastle's recent rise and the way he's come across so far during his time in England.",
      "Alan Shearer admits he \"didn't think Isak had this in him\" as the player pulls out all the stops to get his way, despite having three years left on his deal. Reconciliation appears a long way away, perhaps even something that can no longer be achieved.",
      "Whilst the transfer market is open and Isak can get a way out, he'll continue to push, but if he's still at the club come September he may have to try and make amends. Especially with a World Cup to come this summer.",
      "Coming back from such depths may seem lightyears away now, but it has been achieved. Just ask some of the Premier League's greatest ever forwards. Isak isn't the first, and won't be the last, major name to decide he's had enough. Only to realise playing for the club he was desperate to leave is his only hope.",
      "Some regard Luis Suarez's efforts in 2013/14 as the best single season by a player in Premier League history. He scored 31 times in 33 games as he almost hauled Liverpool to their first title in decades. He picked up numerous individual accolades whilst doing so.",
      "But that summer it looked as if his time at Anfield was over as he publicly called out the club, demanding they sell him so that he could play in the Champions League. Liverpool had missed out on the top four and the Uruguayan seemingly didn't want to stick around with Arsenal circling.",
      "He said: \"I gave absolutely everything last season. Now all I want is for Liverpool to honour our agreement.\" Suarez went on to say: \"I am 26, I need to be playing in the Champions League. I feel I have done enough to be playing in the Champions League at this stage of my career.\"",
      "Four months later and, in the midst of an astonishing individual season, he signed a new long-term deal to become a top earner at Liverpool. Yes he would leave for Barcelona soon after, but his performances would win back over the red folk on Merseyside.",
      "Another man who won over those wearing red was one Wayne Rooney. He took on Sir Alex Ferguson, having been frustrated by the lack of ambition being shown by Manchester United in the transfer market. He wanted to know who was going to be signed and when.",
      "Rooney had seen Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo leave and was left firmly as the main man at Old Trafford. He spoke with major individuals at the club but they \"did not give me any of the assurances I was seeking about the future squad\" as Rooney made it clear he wouldn't sign a new deal back in 2010.",
      "Ferguson was frustrated by the matter and the Evertonian had to sit out whilst the initial anger came, which only amplified with talk of a move to Manchester City.",
      "48 hours later though and all was well. Rooney signed a new deal and vowed to do whatever he could to get the fans back onside. He said: \"Some fans may not take to me again very quickly. It may take time. But I will give everything. I will give 100 per cent and try to build that relationship back.\"",
      "That February Rooney would score a stunning overhead kick to down United's Manchester rivals - a goal that Ferguson would declare as the greatest he'd ever seen in his time at the club. The forward would spend another seven years at Old Trafford en route to becoming their all-time leading goalscorer.",
      "Another man heavily linked with City was Harry Kane, this back in the summer of 2021. Fresh from his efforts with England in the Euros, the Tottenham striker knew a rebuild was on the cards in north London. He was at the peak of his powers and still without a trophy.",
      "The champions were in the market for a new striker and wanted the England captain. He left Tottenham fans furious when in an interview with Gary Neville he put his own valuation on his head and suggested that him leaving would suit him and his club - which the latter clearly didn't agree with.",
      "Tottenham stood firm and refused to sell Kane, who had to sit out of the opening games as the noise around his future continued. In a similar situation to Isak, Kane felt an agreement was in place to let him leave and frustration mounted when he wasn't allowed to depart.",
      "Kane would cop boos from some Tottenham fans as he reintegrated himself into the team, albeit his performances were not always at the desired level. The striker is often referred to as \"one of our own\" in a song sung by the home crowd in Tottenham and he would enjoy his moment in the sun soon enough.",
      "He scored a brace to down City on his first meeting against them following his transfer saga. The following season and a winning goal against the same Manchester outfit would officially see him become the club's all-time record goalscorer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim didn’t do enough to convince Manchester United to sign Emiliano Martinez over the summer, it has been claimed. Despite an encouraging performance in Sunday’s defeat to Arsenal, United have something of a keeper crisis.",
      "Andre Onana has made a catalogue of errors since his arrival from Ajax two years ago, while Altay Bayindir has failed to convince in his fleeting appearances and was at fault for the Gunners’ goal when he flapped at a corner.",
      "It’s been clear for some time that United need a new stopper and Amorim is a big fan of Martinez, 32, who has played a key role in Aston Villa’s success under Unai Emery. Despite signing a new contract last year, the Argentine looked set to leave Villa after appearing to say an emotional goodbye to fans at the end of last season.",
      "At the time, Emery was non-committal over Martinez’s future, merely saying “we will see”. That appeared to leave the door open for a raid from United, who could have landed the World Cup winner for a fee of around £40million.",
      "However, United have reportedly seen an approach to sign Martinez on loan rejected by Villa. Amorim’s plea to sign the player outright was not supported by the United board, which has instead backed the head coach with attacking signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Argentine outlet TyC Sports reports that a deal to bring Martinez to Old Trafford was 'very close'. They added that Amorim 'could not convince' the board to splash out on a keeper with Onana still on the books and would only sanction a loan move. Villa, meanwhile, had agreed to let Martinez go, but for only for the right price.",
      "While United appear to have made strides following their shambolic 2024/25 campaign, which produced the club’s lowest league finish in half a century, their goalkeeping issues could undermine their progress. Following the Arsenal defeat, Amorim jumped to the defence of Bayindir, suggesting he could keep his place for Sunday’s game at Fulham.",
      "Amorim said of the Gunners’ goal: “You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way, the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.",
      "“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed, so he cannot defend it.\"",
      "Last season, Bayindir conceded directly from a Son Heung-min corner in a 4-3 Carabao Cup defeat at Tottenham, but Amorim rejected criticism of the Turkey international when asked if he had considered starting third-choice Tom Heaton against a team renowned for their threat from corners.",
      "Amorim added: “He suffered a goal like this, where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul.",
      "“Then, in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don’t remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay. I am happy with the three goalkeepers.”",

The club's woes between the sticks worsened on Sunday when Turkish international Bayindir flapped at a first-half corner, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to score the only goal of the match.",
      "Regular No. 1 Andre Onana was absent for the Premier League clash at Old Trafford after a hamstring injury saw him miss pre-season. The former Inter Milan keeper has also been under constant scrutiny for his performances since joining in July 2023.",
      "When asked in his post-Arsenal press conference if he should have selected veteran shot-stopper Tom Heaton, who shone during the summer friendlies, instead of Bayindir, Amorim became rather defensive. However, that's exactly what ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster believes the Portuguese head coach should do for their next game at Fulham this Sunday.",
      "That is despite the fact that the 39-year-old former Burnley star hasn't played in the Premier League since the beginning of 2020.",
      "While Foster thinks Heaton would be the most suitable short-term option, he has reiterated his recent call for United to sign either Emiliano Martinez or Gianlugii Donnarumma before the summer transfer window closes in less than two weeks or risk another disappointing season.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, Foster said: \"This is a massive problem for the next game. It asks all sorts of questions and there's going to be so much talk surrounding it coming into that next game.",
      "\"Do you start with Bayindir, whose confidence will be low now after the first game? With Onana, people will be going, 'Well, he's not much better.' There's a lot of pressure. Tom Heaton, I would trust him to give me a six-and-a-half out of 10 performance.",
      "\"It just forces Man United's hand to go and sign a proper goalkeeper. I think if you can get a Martinez or a Donnarumma, you've just got to do it. If you sign that player, it's going to be the difference between mid-table misery or really pushing for that top six.\"",
      "Despite the goalkeeping crisis at United, Amorim seemed satisfied with his current options when questioned about the situation after the Arsenal match.",

      "Bruno Fernandes had hoped for Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund to emerge as Manchester United's standout performers this season. But the duo appear to be heading towards the exit door as Ruben Amorim looks to offload more stars before the transfer window closes.",
      "Hojlund was left out of United's squad for Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, with AC Milan amongst the clubs showing interest in the striker. Meanwhile, Garnacho has found himself frozen out by the Portuguese manager following his criticism of Amorim's tactical decisions during their Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "The Danish forward has been training with the first team and participated in preparations for the 2025/26 Premier League season – but with Benjamin Sesko now at the club, Hojlund may have played his last match at Old Trafford.",
      "These developments will come as a blow to club captain Fernandes, who revealed his wish to see younger players claim individual honours rather than winning awards himself.",
      "Speaking to CBS back in May, the 30-year-old said: \"The main thing I want... and I was even joking with Josh [Zirkzee] the other day, we were talking about the awards and they were saying like, 'Oh, who's gonna win the award of Player of the Season?' They were kind of putting a joke.",
      "\"I said that I hope next year I am not even involved in the name – and do the same season as I did this year, and not be involved in the name of winning that trophy.",
      "\"Because that will mean you step up, Amad will step up, Garnacho will step up, Rasmus will step up... if they start scoring goals, start doing assists, start running backwards and tackling, they will be the ones having attention and not me, and I will be the most happy person in the world.",
      "\"I'm there to help my team-mates get the best out of them, and that's all I want to do because I know as soon as I can get the best out of them, my team will be much better.\"",
      "Despite these words from the Portuguese maestro, both Hojlund and Garnacho appear to have one foot out this summer at Old Trafford.",
      "AC Milan's sporting director, Igli Tare, recently revealed that the 22-year-old frontman remains on their radar -but he's not their sole target. He said: \"Hojlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.\"",
      "The Italian giants may reportedly abandon their pursuit of the United ace if they manage to land Dusan Vlahovic from Juventus instead. United have slapped a modest £30million price tag on Hojlund – a dramatic drop from the £72m deal they agreed with Serie A outfit Atalanta two summers ago.",
      "Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano has reported that Chelsea are now in advanced talks with United over the signing of Garnacho. The report suggests that the Blues' hierarchy have an excellent relationship with United chief Omar Berrada.",
      "The 21-year-old winger, who is only interested in joining the FIFA Club World Cup champions, recently rejected an offer from Bayern Munich. The Red Devils have placed a £50m price tag on Garnacho, but as it stands, Chelsea are only willing to pay about £30m.",
      "Garnacho and Hojlund join Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho as the quartet set to depart the club, with Roma, Besiktas and Atalanta all eyeing moves for the latter duo.",

      "Collyer, 21, is among a pool of young players who are very highly thought of at Old Trafford. However, the club have decided that a spell playing regularly in the Championship would be beneficial for the young midfielder's development with West Brom subsequently clinching Collyer's signature ahead of other second-tier teams.",
      "The youngster made his debut for the Baggies at the weekend in their 3-2 win away at Wrexham but he could have been plying his trade elsewhere amid suggestions that the former Brighton academy starlet could be used as bait in a swap deal for Carlos Baleba.",
      "Collyer, meanwhile, has been sent to the Hawthorns for the 2025-26 campaign to play regular football. And Mason, formerly of Tottenham, wants to play a big part in Collyer's development over the next 12 months before he returns to Old Trafford next year.",
      "Speaking at the weekend, Mason told reporters: \"Toby's a young player, but we know we're going to need him and he's going to help us. I've wanted Toby for a few weeks now. He's someone that I really believe in, which is important and I have that belief in all of my players.",
      "\"But when you go on loan to somewhere, I think you need to feel like you're wanted from the club and the manager and he certainly is that. Hopefully we can help him because if we help him improve and grow as a player, then it's certainly going to be beneficial to us.",
      "\"I think there's loads of room and loads of growth to develop. That's certainly going to happen on the training pitch. The reality is the game is the best teacher. The more game exposure you can get, the better, especially at a young age. I'm sure and I expect that Toby knows that I believe in him, which for me is super important.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Michael Owen has queried Matheus Cunha's attitude following the Brazilian's first Premier League outing for the club. Cunha, a £62.5million summer arrival from Wolves, played the full 90 minutes against Arsenal on Sunday, starting as a No.9 and then dropping back when Benjamin Sesko came off the bench.",
      "Owen is excited by Cunha's quality, having watched him at his former club. However, question marks remain when it comes to other aspects of his on-field behaviour.",
      "“I think Cunha has got a little bit of magic about him. I love watching him play,\" Owen told AskGamblers. \"The first moment I set eyes on him for Wolves, I just thought: “Oh wow, he’s a talented player. I really rate him, and I don’t blame Manchester United for getting him. I think he’s so talented.",
      "“My only question mark is his attitude. He gets sent off a lot, he waves his arms a lot, and you’ve already got someone like that alongside him in Bruno Fernandes. From a talent point of view, he’s absolutely there. And maybe being at Manchester United, being at a huge club like that, might put some manners on him.",
      "“You can’t go around grabbing people’s glasses off them after a game, getting sent off, arguing with referees, and causing fights on numerous occasions like he did at Wolves. But when you’re the outstanding player and when you’ve been carrying the club, when all that pressure’s on you and all those different things, then you can understand it a bit. When you go to Manchester United, you’re in the public glare even more, and you need to behave that way.\"",
      "Owen suggested Cunha can still be a success at United if he irons out certain aspects of his behaviour. He served two suspensions last season, though - one for an altercation with an Ipswich staff member and anoter for a red card against Bournemouth in the FA Cup.",
      "He was initially banned for three games after lashing out at Milos Kerkez in the Bournemouth game. It was then extended by an extra match, though, to go along with the two-game ban he served for the Ipswich incident.",
      "Cunha, who scored 15 league goals for Wolves last season, didn't net for United in pre-season but is warming to his new challenge at Old Trafford. “I really think the pressure at this club is a privilege,” the former Atletico Madrid frontman said in July.",
      "“It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and when Ruben came to me and showed me the project, I felt like it’s a challenge I want to do for my career. United is a club I needed to be at, and like I say it’s a big privilege.”",

      "Sevilla star Lucien Agoume is the latest name to be linked with Manchester United as the Red Devils seek out cheaper alternatives to Carlos Baleba. United appear unwilling to meet Brighton's nine-figure asking price for Baleba, having already splashed £200million this summer.",
      "Earlier this week, it emerged that Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton were both being considered, though neither would be straightforward signings. Sporting Lisbon want big money to allow Hjulmand to reunite with Ruben Amorim, while Palace may decide they can't afford to lose Wharton if his team-mates Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi also leave this month.",
      "According to reports in Spain (via Sport Witness), Agoume has a release clause worth just under £35m and might be available for even less than that. Other, unnamed Premier League clubs are also said to be in the mix, though one-time suitors Arsenal are unlikely to return for the Frenchman after previous links, having landed Martin Zubimendi in July.",
      "Agoume joined Sevilla from Inter Milan in a cut-price deal in 2024, and was a regular last season as the team narrowly escaped relegation from La Liga. He was also part of the French side which reached the semi-finals of the Under-21 Euros, playing in all but one of their matches and captaining the side against Poland.",
      "While Profit and Sustainability Rules make a move for Baleba unlikely this summer, a cheaper option such as Agoume could be the answer. However, much may still depend on sales elsewhere.",
      "United have signed off on loan exits for the likes of Marcus Rashford and Toby Collyer, but are still working on permanent exits for some other players. Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund are among those who could yet leave, though United and Chelsea remain at odds over a valuation for the former.",
      "There are also questions in the goalkeeper position, as links with Gianluigi Donnarumma persist. The arrival of the Italian might rely on United selling Andre Onana, with Inter Milan said to be interested in bringing the Cameroonian back to the San Siro.",
      "Despite losing to Arsenal in their opening league game, United are looking at the positives after a tough end to last season. “The group, for me, is just, I don’t know, there’s such a good vibe. We’re all invested in something,” forward Joshua Zirkzee told club media.",
      "\"You can really tell that we really want to make sure that we’re not doing what we did last season. Also, outside the pitch, there’s some good vibes. We’re doing a lot of team bonding. I feel we’re much closer than we were last season, and hopefully we can translate all of that onto the pitch and share it with you, you know, the rest of the world who’s supporting United.”",

The 21-year-old Cameroon international is under contract with Brighton until June 2028, and the Seagulls are unwilling to budge on their significant demands having sold Moises Caicedo for £115m to Chelsea two years ago.",
      "The Red Devils now have some alternatives in mind however, per The Athletic. Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton are now under the microscope as United attempt to strengthen Ruben Amorim's midfield.",

However, Amorim’s side came away without a share of the points after a mistake from Bayindir gifted Arsenal defender Riccardo Calafiori the winning goal.",
      "United have been linked with moves for PSG ’s Gianluigi Donnarumma and Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez during the transfer window. However, Porto shot-stopper Costa could be the man to solve United’s problem position after being the subject of a surprising transfer bid.",
      "Sky Germany reports that Galatasaray have submitted a £17million bid for Costa, which is expected to be rejected by Porto. It is claimed that the Turkish side view the Portugal number one as an alternative target as they continue to pursue a deal for Manchester City star Ederson. The club's focus on Costa and initial offer suggests they think they could sign the keeper for a relatively low fee.",
      "Costa, 25, has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford, having reportedly been among the options to succeed David De Gea at United before Onana joined the club in 2023. The goalkeeper is said to have a £63m buy-out clause in his contract, which has two years remaining.",
      "While Galatasaray’s offer will likely not be accepted, it shows that Costa could be available at a bargain price - and much cheaper than what United have been previously quoted for him - considering his pedigree. This could also present a simple solution for United, given City are reportedly rivalling the Red Devils for Donnarumma’s signature.",
      "It seems that Amorim does not have complete faith in Onana after leaving the former Ajax and Inter Milan star out of United’s matchday squad at the weekend. When asked if Onana’s omission was due to fitness concerns, Amorim said: \"No (he is not injured), he’s recovered but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that.”",
      "Bayindir took his place in goal for United but did little to stake his claim for being the team’s long-term number one. The 27-year-old has made just 12 appearances for United since arriving from Fenerbahce two years ago. His actions leading up to Arsenal’s winning goal were criticised by club icon Roy Keane.",
      "“You get in their face. Be aggressive. I've said it many times for a goalkeeper - come with violence. Take control of it. Far too easy. It’s like schoolboy stuff. Man United - weak and soft.\"",
      "Keane’s ex-team-mate, Gary Neville, echoed the thoughts of the former United captain. The pundit explained that he was in favour of United targeting either Donnarumma or Martinez due to their presence and personality, aspects he feels are lacking in the club’s current goalkeeper options.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters,” he said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man United need that.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sean Dyche claims he would make a better Manchester United manager than Ruben Amorim - pointing to his trusted 4-4-2 formation as the key to success. Despite being known for his no-nonsense, old-school style, the former Everton and Burnley boss believes he could excel at a club like United if given the chance.",
      "\"I may get hammered for it, but I bet I could win more games with that squad playing a 4-4-2,\" Dyche told ex-England manager Sam Allardyce on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast. \"People keep talking about his [Amorim's] philosophy and it isn't working. It's fine getting to five or 10 games, but once you get to 20 games, it clearly isn't working.\"",
      "After nine months in the Old Trafford hotseat, Amorim has won just 16 of his 43 matches in charge, giving him a win rate of just 37 per cent - only slightly higher than Dyche's career average of 34 per cent. He has also struggled to implement the fluid, high-octane style that defined his Sporting CP side, with United's squad finding it difficult to adapt to Amorim's three-at-the-back system.",
      "In a bid to address this, United have splashed over £200million on a brand-new front three this summer and spent £26m in January on Patrick Dorgu, a wing-back suited to Amorim's style. Dyche believes this is evidence that United don't currently have the squad to play Amorim's way, though he praised the club and its head coach for sticking to their principles.",
      "\"I might be wrong because they've brought in three big hitters this summer, so it wouldn't work with the players they had, but maybe the new players will do better,\" he said.",
      "\"On the one hand, I like the fact they're sticking with it, and it is Man United. You're under massive pressure to get it right. But on the other hand, you wouldn't normally survive that situation. Amorim's been given more time than most.",
      "\"People forget that in Pep's first season, he made so many changes to the squad and played so many formations and finished 13 points off the top, nobody blinked. If he was at Real Madrid, he would have been sacked. But he learned and won the Premier League the next season.\"",
      "Dyche's record in the Premier League demonstrates his ability to overperform with limited resources. At Burnley, he consistently transformed modest squads into disciplined, competitive teams, steering them clear of relegation and even pushing close to European qualification.",
      "His teams were always difficult to beat, well-organised, and capable of exceeding expectations despite financial and squad constraints.",
      "At Everton, Dyche faced a different set of challenges, navigating financial problems while maintaining competitiveness and stability. His pragmatic, hard-working approach allowed him to keep teams solid and focused, even when expectations were low.",
      "Yet despite these achievements, Dyche has never been given the opportunity to manage an elite club capable of playing expansive, attacking football. It's hard to say whether his confidence in successfully implementing a 4-4-2 system at United is entirely justified, but his track record of achieving under limiting circumstances speaks volumes.",
      "The Red Devils spent much of last season perilously close to the relegation zone, losing 18 times and finishing 15th in the table. Amorim will hope for much better this season, but despite an improved performance, his United side started the new season with a 1-0 defeat against Arsenal.",

      "Jadon Sancho has already experienced plenty of transfer drama as the winger remains in limbo over his Manchester United future. The winger is one of several players expected to leave Old Trafford this summer, but he is currently still a United player.",
      "The 25-year-old joined as a blockbuster signing in 2021 following his starring displays for Borussia Dortmund. Yet Sancho's time with the Red Devils has proved disappointing, with the England international spending recent seasons back at Dortmund and on loan to Chelsea.",
      "Sancho is likely to leave United this summer and was presented with two offers this week from Roma and Besiktas, but turned down both moves. The 25-year-old expects more opportunities to arise before the window shuts, but his high wage demands could complicate potential moves. With Sancho's future up in the air again, we take a look back at the transfer sagas involving the winger...",
      "Coming through the youth system at United's rivals, Manchester City viewed Sancho among the club's brightest academy talents. Although Pep Guardiola admitted he was keen to retain Sancho, the then-17-year-old winger was said to have gone back on a handshake agreement to sign a new contract before completing a move to Dortmund in his quest for regular minutes.",
      "\"We offered him a huge deal and we shook hands,\" Guardiola said after Sancho's departure was confirmed in 2017. \"But before we went to the States, he said, 'I am not going to sign.'\"",
      "Sancho never made a first-team appearance for City, but quickly thrived at the German outfit following his £8m switch. He scored 50 goals and provided 64 assists across 137 outings for Dortmund, though Guardiola maintained he held no resentment towards Sancho for choosing to leave City.",
      "\"I've said many times, it is not a regret,\" Guardiola said in 2021. \"He decides. He's doing really well. Congratulations, he's an exceptional player. He is a national team player with huge quality, doing really well in Dortmund.",
      "\"We wanted him to stay but he decided to leave, and when people decide to leave all we can do is (let them) leave. I wish him all the best, except when he plays against us. No regrets at all. If he's happy, I'm happy.\"",
      "United had tried to secure Sancho's signature a year before his eventual arrival at Old Trafford. In 2020, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team reportedly tabled an opening £73m bid, potentially rising to £91.3m, but this came up short of Dortmund's £108m valuation.",
      "\"I wasn't 100 per cent expecting him to stay, but I hoped he would,\" Burki told Kicker. \"It has always been clear that you have to pay a certain amount of money to buy a player of his quality, but because of the coronavirus pandemic, it's not as easy for the clubs as it was before.",
      "\"I don't believe Jadon is sad that he will continue with Borussia Dortmund. He comes to training with a smile on his face and is happy to be with us. Jadon is still a top player next year.",
      "\"Time is not running out for him. Besides, he has developed as a personality. I am not aware of any current events that give cause for criticism. Jadon hasn't done anything wrong in two and a half weeks of pre-season so far.\"",
      "United eventually secured his signature the following summer for £73m to finally bring an end to one of the longest transfer sagas in recent memory.",
      "Sancho is currently hunting for a new club after Chelsea opted against making his loan spell permanent. Enzo Maresca's team were forced to pay a £5m penalty fee to United having previously agreed an obligation to buy worth up to £25m.",
      "The ex-Dortmund ace featured 41 times as Chelsea secured fourth spot in the Premier League and claimed the Europa Conference League crown last season, chipping in with five goals and 10 assists. Yet the Blues chose to pay £5m rather than sign him on a permanent basis, instead bringing in Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens and Brazilian wonderkid Estevao this summer.",
      "This isn't the first time Sancho has had to make a return to United. After a disagreement with former United manager Erik ten Hag, Sancho was loaned out to Dortmund in January 2024. Despite making 21 appearances and even starting in the Champions League final, Dortmund were unable to secure a permanent deal for the forward.",

      "Italian giants Atalanta are closing in on a deal for Lecce striker Nikola Krstovic after a £40million deal for Rodrigo Muniz fell through. Fulham have been resolute in saying they must bring in a replacement before allowing Muniz to leave and talks have now collapsed.",
      "The news comes as a blow to Manchester United as Fulham were considering a move for out-of-favour striker Rasmus Hojlund as a potential replacement for Muniz. Hojlund will be allowed to leave Old Trafford after the Red Devils spent £200m on a new forward line this summer of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Hojlund was left out of the squad for United's opening game of the season against Arsenal on Sunday, with Cunha starting up front and Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee making the bench. When asked about Hojlund's absence, Ruben Amorim said: \"It is going to be like this during the season.",
      "\"We have more options, we have to choose the right players for each game. Sometimes, it's not just thinking about 11 guys that start the game and imagine how we are going to finish the game and win the game.",
      "\"They are in moments of a few training sessions for Josh and, with Sesko, he changed his life in one week. We tried to choose the best team to start and then, during the game, we will see.\"",
      "AC Milan, though, are looking to sign a new striker this summer and sporting director Igli Tare has confirmed the club are interested in Hojlund. Speaking to Sport Mediaset, Tare said: \"Hojlund is a good option for us.",
      "\"We are evaluating him these days, but the transfer market is unpredictable. We know that we have to intervene in that position and we also know that they must be players who can give something more to this group.\"",
      "Hojlund joined United from Atalanta for a fee of around £72m back in 2023, but he has struggled to make much of an impact after managing just 26 goals in 95 appearances across all competitions.",
      "However, when asked about his future earlier this summer, Hojlund said: \"I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland ).",
      "\"But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "While the door has been closed on some possible escape routes, Chelsea are ready to do business on the Senegal striker if he pushes to leave amid increased competition from Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "Newcastle and Villa remain live possibilities with Jackson likely to go before the window shuts on September 1. It will give Chelsea new spending power as they look to bring in RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons and they remain keen on Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho even if they are at least £10m apart on valuation.",
      "The Blues have already spent big on Jamie Gittens, £65m on Pedro, they paid £37m for Jorrel Hato and £30m on Delap while they had already long since done a deal for Brazil teenager Estevao Willian.",
      "But they will carry on spending big with Argentina international Garnacho in their sights although United want over £40m while Chelsea know he is not in Ruben Amorim’s plans and their valuation is closer to £30m.",
      "Simons has set his heart on Chelsea but RB Leipzig value him at £60m and, despite them being closer on this deal and with personal terms in place, the deal is unlikely to go through until at least later in the week.",
      "Blues boss Enzo Maresca has made it very clear that he wants a new defender - with Levi Colwill out injured - but the club make a habit of investing in forwards.",
      "Chelsea’s habit of buying and selling to keep the finances turning over has worked to a degree but it is also the reason why Jackson and a raft of other players find themselves available for the right price.",
      "They are not in a rush to sell Jackson but equally if he wants to go - with Pedro and Delap seemingly ahead in the pecking order and ready for Maresca’s rotation policy - then they are open to a sale.",
      "It is Jackson’s agents who are now trying to find the right club for the striker who joined for £30m two years ago from Villarreal and has had mixed fortunes. But his strength, goals and potential to improve is why clubs are attracted to the 24-year-old who has 24 goals in 65 games.",
      "Chelsea are also looking to offload Raheem Steriing as the England international has two years left on his current deal and is currently training with the “loan group.” There seems no way back for Sterling who would prefer a move in London after spending last season at Arsenal but would be open to the right offer. Fulham could be an option.",
      "Chelsea have rejected a loan approach from Bayern Munich for Christopher Nkunku as they would prefer to do a permanent deal. However, there is a belief that he is likely to go for £35m-plus which again provides Chelsea with more turnover and cash as they look to shake up the squad again.",
      "Borussia Dortmund are likely to come back for Carney Chukwuemeka after seeing one bid turned down. Ben Chilwell also wants a fresh start to get his career back on track while Axel Disasi, Renato Veiga and Tyrique George could also go before the end of the window.",

Manchester United suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Super Sunday in arguably the biggest game of the weekend, while Manchester City looked rejuvenated as they secured a 4-0 triumph over Wolves on Saturday evening.",
      "By that point champions Liverpool had served notice of their title intentions, Arne Slot's men winning 4-2 against Bournemouth on Friday night thanks to late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah. If Chelsea are to be contenders, they'll need to be much better than their goalless stalemate with Crystal Palace, where VAR controversy stole the headlines.",
      "So, it's one week down and 37 rounds of matches to go before this season's climax. But before we move forwards, with help from stats specialists Opta, we've taken a look at the opening weekend of action and compiled a table based on the expected goals for each team. Expected goals (xG) is a metric calculated based on the value of opportunities and shots on goal from each Premier League team and has become a widely-used measure to evaluate teams and performances. It provides an estimate of the number of goals a team should have theoretically scored.",
      "Unsurprisingly it is City who top the xG table after their thumping win at Molineux. They registered 2.5xG and also boasted the biggest xGD (expected goals difference) from the opening weekend matches, at 1.9. Wolves don't sit bottom of the xG table however because at least they offered an attacking threat.",
      "Instead, it's Aston Villa, who drew 0-0 with Newcastle, who had the least to show - in a goalscoring sense - from the weekend. Newcastle's defensive performance, statistically in terms of xGA (expected goals against) was the best of the opening round.",
      "Spurs, 3-0 winners over Burnley, are second with an xG of 2.3, slightly ahead of Liverpool and newly-promoted Leeds United (2.1); Daniel Farke's men defeated Everton on Monday night thanks to Lukas Nmecha's controversial penalty.",
      "Despite failing to score in their loss to Arsenal at the weekend, United registered an xG of 1.5 with new signings Bryan Mbeumo (£71m) and Matheus Cunha (£62.5m) both having opportunities, while star striker Benjamin Sesko made his debut (£73.7m). Arsenal boasted an xG of 1.3 in their win, but the majority of that came via their winner, Riccardo Calafiori turning in on the goal-line after Altay Bayindir's error. It really is a case of take away that moment and that game, as a whole, looks completely different.",
      "The Red Devils return to Premier League action this weekend as they head to Craven Cottage to take on Fulham, where Ruben Amorim will hope their finishing is a little bit sharper. City are making the journey to London too, to face Tottenham. Arsenal host Leeds before Monday night's mouthwatering meeting between Newcastle and Liverpool at St James's Park.",

      "Manchester United youngster Kobbie Mainoo was an unused substitute against Arsenal last weekend.",
      "There have been concerns about where Mainoo fits into Ruben Amorim's plans, but we're just one game into the new Premier League campaign and it's certainly not time to panic.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro started in the pivot against Arsenal. Manuel Ugarte was introduced for Casemiro in the 65th minute of the contest and Mainoo was left on the bench, clearly for tactical reasons.",
      "Ugarte has a different profile and Amorim decided his qualities were best suited to replace Casemiro. Mainoo started two games in pre-season and they were both alongside Ugarte in the pivot.",
      "Fernandes made a few appearances in the No.10 role in pre-season, which allowed Mainoo a chance to start in the deeper role, but it seems like the pair are competing for the same role in the pivot.",
      "It seems Amorim views Ugarte and Casemiro as competitors for one of the deeper midfield positions, and views Fernandes and Mainoo as competitors for the partnership's other side.",
      "Amorim has tinkered with Mainoo's position since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon in November, which hasn't been particularly helpful, but it appears he has decided on which role is best for him.",
      "\"I think he [Mainoo] can play in both positions in the midfield. Last year, he played more in front. I think his perfect position is more near the ball, always with the ball,\" explained Amorim in the USA.",
      "\"I think he is a big talent, and you guys know better than me that he is a big talent. I think he needs to increase the rhythm, the pace. I'm always on top of that with Kobbie, because he is so good sometimes but he can be better. So I have big plans. But again, like I said, one game per week, the competition is going to be huge.\"",
      "Amorim also said Fernandes' best position in his system is 'closest to the ball' and he started him in the deeper role against Arsenal, so it's fair to conclude that's where he sees Mainoo's future.",
      "There were valid concerns about Amorim's handling of Mainoo last season, with the signs suggesting his future might be elsewhere, but there was a change of tone when Amorim spoke about him this summer.",
      "Amorim was notably positive and seemed enthusiastic about working with Mainoo, however, he tempered expectations last season and said he still has a long way to go in his development.",
      "At 20 years old, Mainoo is obviously far from the finished article, but he is a supremely talented young player, and it would be a travesty if Amorim couldn't make it work this term.",
      "Not coming on from the bench against Arsenal is not a big deal and Amorim should be given a few months to work with Mainoo before any concrete judgments are made on his future.",
      "If Mainoo is a peripheral squad member by November, then alarm bells will be set ringing. United are competing in the Premier League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup this season, which means fewer opportunities, but Mainoo has enough talent to merit regular starts in Amorim's team.",
      "There is huge interest in Mainoo, given he is an academy graduate and was so brilliant in 2023/2024, but supporters will have to wait and see how the situation unfolds before rushing to panic stations.",
      "Remember Mainoo's performance at Goodison Park on his Premier League debut? Remember his matchwinner against Manchester City in the FA Cup final? Amorim must make it work with the Stockport-born lad.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Rasmus Hojlund still remain at Manchester United.",
      "Garnacho, Sancho, Antony and Malacia have all trained alone at Carrington since communicating their desire to leave. Marcus Rashford is the only member of the 'bomb squad' to have sealed a departure.",
      "Chelsea are the front runners to sign Garnacho, but United are determined not to allow the youngster to leave for a fee below his market value in the final weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Roma have contacted United to discuss Sancho on loan, with an obligation to buy for £20million next summer, but it remains to be seen whether the Italian club can agree personal terms.",
      "Sancho's move to Chelsea broke down due to his wage demands, so the London club decided to pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break their obligation to sign the winger.",
      "Antony is believed to be holding out for a transfer to Real Betis. The Brazilian was hugely successful during his loan with Betis last season, but the Spanish club are struggling to finance a permanent deal.",
      "The player's agent has left the door open to Saudi Arabia. \"What I can say is that the player is on the market, and there are several clubs that want to know his current status,\" he said. \"We listen to the projects and analyse them. But he is open to moving to Saudi Arabia. Anything is possible.\"",
      "United would have to sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) loss.",
      "Malacia celebrated his 26th birthday this week and interest has been thin on the ground following his loan with PSV, although Roma have been linked with a move for the defender.",
      "Hojlund was dropped from the squad to face Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. The Denmark international watched the game in the directors' box and is set to leave after the signing of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Speaking after Arsenal, Amorim said: \"It is our player - we have to make choices. We have players that have to stay helping the team from the outside. He has to fight for his place. We will see what's going to happen. Rasmus has the same characteristics as Sesko, so sometimes we need to choose.\"",
      "AC Milan are interested in Hojlund and their sporting director, Igli Tare, recently said: \"Højlund is a good option for us. We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.\"",

      "There is a Rolls-Royce outside The Midland, accompanied by a plaque that commemorates the meeting between Charles Stewart Rolls and Frederick Henry Royce at the Manchester hotel in 1904. Matheus Cunha is a Rolls-Royce of a footballer.",
      "Cunha, voted United fans' man of the match in the 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, produced a performance that trumped goalscoring debutants at Old Trafford in recent years. Another Brazilian, Antony, claimed the glory in United's last defeat of Arsenal in the Premier League three years ago yet he was as noticeably one-paced and one-dimensional on his first appearance as he was on his last.",
      "In 90 goalless minutes, Cunha had four attempts at goal, with three on target. He forced the one genuinely good save from David Raya all afternoon in the first half. There were six attempted dribbles and only two of Cunha's 16 passes were misplaced.",
      "We should get used to the sound of plastic seats clattering whenever Cunha receives the ball. He is a talent that brings matchgoers to their feet. The racks of shirts bearing his name and number '10' in the Megastore will have to be replenished more regularly.",
      "One of the most reassuring aspects about Cunha's performance was his work rate. Nobody walked more than he did in the Premier League last season, a curious if misleading stat that predictably gained greater exposure in the wake of his £62.5million move to United.",
      "The other walkers in the top four were Virgil van Dijk, Murillo and Ezri Konsa, three centre backs. Cunha is a playmaker who often occupies the left-hand channel.",
      "Yet he was playing for Wolves, who indulged his maverick nature. He was so pivotal they remunerated him midway through the season with a new contract and a release clause. However much Cunha walked and however often he crossed a line - as he did against Ipswich Town and Bournemouth to serve suspensions totalling six matches - he was well worth the expense.",
      "A good forward picks and chooses his moments. Cunha had plenty, scoring 15 goals. \"I played against him last season and he doesn’t stop,\" the former Wolves defender Conor Coady said on Five Live.",
      "\"I spoke to the Wolves boys about Matheus Cunha and they didn’t mind a suspension here and there because, and it sounds really stupid, but it’s because of what he brings to games and how he could help win those games.\"",
      "Against Arsenal, Cunha clocked up 9.4 kilometres in 90 minutes whilst effectively playing out of position. Only Leny Yoro, Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu and Bryan Mbeumo ran more for United. One lung-bursting run from Cunha was recorded at 34.5km/h.",
      "\"Players like Cunha, like Bryan, in one moment can elevate the stadium,\" Ruben Amorim said. \"So, I think the most important thing [was] we were not boring.\"",
      "It is not the most important thing but one cannot underestimate how vital it was that United were watchable on the opening weekend. Defeat is palatable for matchgoers if there has been determination and enterprise from the team, that they have gone down with a fight.",
      "Too many of United's performances in home losses last season were so drab that supporters were left catatonic, numb to the team's plight. A United defeat was not always worthy of space on the newspapers' back pages.",
      "On Sunday, those at Old Trafford went through the ringer. Hardly anyone left before full-time. Cunha and Mbeumo were heavily responsible for that.",
      "United fans chanted, \"Cunha, Cunha, Cunha\" when the playmaker was introduced to the crowd before kick-off against Fiorentina earlier this month. It was a familiar war cry, one to a tune usually reserved for Bruno Fernandes. Sooner or later, Fernandes will not be able to paper over the cracks and someone else will have to take up his mantle. Heads will turn to Cunha.",
      "Cunha ended Wolves's Boxing Day victory over United with the captain's armband strapped to his bicep. He swung in the winner and was named the man of the match. On a foggy evening, United players had brain fog dealing with Cunha, who was fouled five times and elicited three yellow cards. He possesses that Fernandes factor.",
      "\"We deserved so much more!\" Cunha wrote on Instagram after the Arsenal fixture. \"What an honor to debut in this environment. We will continue to improve. It’s just the beginning.\"",
      "United are at Craven Cottage on Sunday, the scene of Cunha's majestic double last season when Wolves won 4-1. Do likewise this weekend and he will be on a roll.",

      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were named in the starting XI, while Benjamin Sesko made his debut off the bench. However, it was Riccardo Calafiori who scored the decisive goal, handing Arsenal all three points.",
      "Attention now turns back to the transfer market, with United continuing their search for reinforcements to bolster Ruben Amorim’s squad. Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is a player the head coach is understood to admire, and he’s now firmly on the club’s radar.",
      "Interest in Wharton follows reports that a move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the transfer deadline. United are said to be relaxed about the situation and open to revisiting the deal next year.",
      "Meanwhile, outgoings remain a key focus. Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Højlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia are all expected to leave the club before the window closes.",
      "Manchester United may have to move quickly if they want to sign Gianlugi Donnarumma with Manchester City said to have opened talks with Paris Saint-Germain over a move.",
      "City have already signed James Trafford this summer but Galatasaray want Ederson and Manuel Akanji in a double deal and that could open up the door for Donnarumma to sign.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer news blog on this fine Thursday morning.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest updates and rumours from Old Trafford throughout the day...",
      "Talks are underway between Napoli and Man United, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Taking to X, he wrote: \"Napoli have made new contact with Man United today for Rasmus Hojlund deal. Hojlund’s camp also in talks with Napoli as player’s keen on the move while also wants guarantees to stay at the club in future, not a simple loan. Negotiations ongoing.\"",
      "According to journalist Jorge Nicola, Antony is not interested in a return to Brazil at this stage of his career.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Nicola said: \"Despite links to Botafogo this summer, there is no possibility of Antony returning to the Brazilian league at the moment. This morning (Wednesday), I spoke to Antony's agent, Junior Pedroso, who is currently in Europe working to resolve Antony's future.",
      "\"He assured me that a return to Brazil is not part of Antony's career plans right now. John Textor [Botafogo owner], did reach out to Antony's entourage some time ago over a potential deal, but that was not possible. São Paulo are also aware of the financial demands and, as a result, have not even approached Pedroso. The most likely outcome is a return to Real Betis, where Antony enjoyed an impressive loan spell last season.\"",
      "Man United's 'Bomb Squad' is proving to be more difficult to move on than first thought and with less than two weeks until the transfer window closes, it's proving a critical problem.",
      "At the start of the summer, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, , Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Jadon Sancho all informed the club of their desire to leave. Fast forward to today and only Rashford has left the club. Unfortunately for United, Malacia, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony remain on the books and moves away don't seem to be close. Garnacho has recently reportedly rejected a move to Bayern Munich in favour of Chelsea, though that is no closer to being finalised than before, while Antony continues to be heavily linked with returning to Real Betis.",
      "Sancho, who has spent the last season-and-a-half on loan away from Old Trafford, is the subject of interest from AS Roma. Sky Italy have reported that both teams have reached an agreement on a deal worth €19million (£16.4m) plus €5m (£4.3m) in add-ons. Personal terms have been a problem and it was suggested earlier this week that Sancho turned the Italian outfit down.",

      "According to talkSPORT, Garnacho has already informed friends that he plans to join Chelsea before the summer transfer deadline.",
      "The Blues are in talks with Manchester United over a transfer fee, but a significant gap remains between the clubs’ valuations of the 21-year-old winger.",
      "The report adds that Chelsea executives have advised Garnacho to be patient as they gear up to speed up negotiations with his current club over his transfer.",
      "There is a chance goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma could end up at Man United, according to ESPN journalist and former Premier League star Jan Aage Fjortoft.",
      "Taking to X, he wrote: \"Manchester United need a new goalkeeper if they are to have any realistic hopes of finishing in the top six. Donnarumma is a world-class keeper, and I understand there’s still a chance he could end up in Manchester….on the red side of the city.",
      "\"The challenge for United, though, is that they’ll need to move at least one goalkeeper out before that becomes possible.\"",
      "Sky Sport Italy report that Hojlund is pushing for a permanent transfer, with Napoli having held talks with Manchester United.",
      "According to the report, the striker’s preference is a permanent return to Serie A rather than a loan deal with an option to buy.",
      "AC Milan had previously held extensive discussions over signing Hojlund from United this summer, but the club are now said to be close to an agreement for Victor Boniface on loan from Bayer Leverkusen, with a €30m (£25.9m) option to buy included.",
      "Bruno Fernandes wished for Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund to step up and become Man United's best players over the new season.",
      "Garnacho fell out of favour with Ruben Amorim long before pre-season began, after criticising Amorim's substitutions during their Europa League final defeat against Tottenham Hotspur. Hojlund has trained with the squad and took part in the preparations for the 2025/26 Premier League campaign – but with Benjamin Sesko now in the building, the Danish striker could have graced Old Trafford for the final time.",
      "Speaking to CBS back in May, Fernandes said: \"The main thing I want… and I was even joking with Josh [Zirkzee] the other day, we were talking about the awards and they were saying like, ‘Oh, who’s gonna win the award of Player of the Season?’ They were kind of putting a joke.",
      "\"I said that I hope next year I am not even involved in the name – and do the same season as I did this year, and not be involved in the name of winning that trophy. Because that will mean you step up, Amad will step up, Garnacho will step up, Rasmus will step up… if they start scoring goals, start doing assists, start running backwards and tackling, they will be the ones having attention and not me, and I will be the most happy person in the world.",

      "The club is reportedly considering an offer close to €80m (£69m) for Camavinga, whose valuation by the Spanish side is in a similar range.",

      "Manchester United may have enjoyed a positive summer transfer window so far but there are still two glaring priorities they need to solve.",
      "United emerged from their opening day Premier League clash with Arsenal with a lot of credit, despite their 1-0 defeat, and a lot of that stemmed from the positives on display in the forward areas of the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were excellent in United's front three, while Benjamin Sesko looked bright from the bench. All three players were signed this summer for a combined fee north of £200million but the signs are looking good that they prove to be a success.",

      "If Manchester United needed proof that they've signed the right players this summer - Sunday's performance against Arsenal offered some positive indications.",
      "Time will tell if Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo go on to have successful careers at Old Trafford. The new double act were still part of a United side which slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal in their opening fixture of 2025/26.",
      "There was also a worrying repeat of United's inability to convert their chances, with Ruben Amorim hoping that Benjamin Sesko will fix that gaping hole in his team. And yet the Reds' overall performance against a likely Premier League title contender offers some room for optimism.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo has received a response from Carlos Baleba on social media.",
      "United are reportedly interested in a swoop for Baleba this summer, as they aim to boost up their midfield before the transfer window shuts on September 1. The Seagulls reportedly value their midfielder at over £100million, with some reports hinting at a price tag closer to £120million.",
      "However, a recent report in The Athletic suggested that United have now 'ceased' their pursuit for Baleba for this summer. Despite that, the midfielder continues to be linked with a high-profile move to Old Trafford, although any potential transfer is unlikely to materialise until next year.",

The Danish international was an unused substitute for United's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina and was left out of their squad entirely for Sunday's season opener at home to Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund arrived in August 2023 but has struggled to become the consistent goalscorer Ruben Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag have badly needed. The former Atalanta forward scored 16 goals in his first season but only managed 10 last term.",

It continued a worrying trend for the Turkish shot-stopper who made several mistakes last season under Ruben Amorim - the nadir being in United's heavy 4-1 loss at Newcastle, where he made several blunders.",
      "Bayindir started against the Gunners with United's regular No.1 Andre Onana having only recently recovered from a hamstring injury after missing the entirety of the Reds' pre-season schedule.

Rashford's exit to the Catalan capital is thought to save United around £12million in wages, but it's sales that will move the dial with PSRs (Profit and Sustainability Rules).",
      "United's performance in defeat to Arsenal on Sunday was encouraging. Ruben Amorim's side looked a much more cohesive unit, despite beginning a crucial campaign with another loss.",

United netted just 44 times in the Premier League in 2024/25. It was no wonder they endured their worst campaign in a generation.",
      "Sesko has the physical and technical characteristics to succeed in English football - hinting at a better future for Ruben Amorim's team.

      "It's said that the 21-year-old winger, who only wants to join the Club World Cup champions, recently turned down an approach from Bayern Munich. Garnacho has reportedly been priced at £50m by the Reds, but Chelsea are only prepared to pay about £30m.",
      "Marseille have announced that Adrien Rabiot will be made available to sign this summer. The 30-year-old midfielder has been linked with United in the past, but a move never materialised.",
      "An official statement from the French giant reads: \"Olympique de Marseille announces that Adrien Rabiot and Jonathan Rowe have been placed on the transfer list by the club.",

      "The report claims that United are currently weighing up a bid for Lammens, who has also been tracked by Inter Milan. It's said that the Reds were keen to sign Emiliano Martinez on loan earlier in the window, but Aston Villa outlined that it had to be a permanent move or bust.",
      "Team Talk reckons that the Argentina international was willing to swap Villa Park for Old Trafford, but United baulked at his £40m price tag...",

      "\"If it were up to [Max] Allegri, they would sign Vlahovic and not Højlund. Then maybe Højlund arrives, but for them, Vlahovic is more of a priority in terms of importance. Because Vlahovic is a better player than Højlund.",
      "\"Vlahovic can guarantee you 15-18 goals. Højlund is a question mark, I don’t know. Because Højlund, when he was in Italy, when he left Atalanta to go to Manchester United, had scored 7-8 goals. He hasn’t scored a lot of goals at Manchester United.",
      "\"Therefore, for Juve, who want to bring back Kolo Muani this week, they could find themselves with three attackers: Jonathan David, Dusan Vlahovic and Randal Kolo Muani. But I think that we have to pay attention to Vlahovic until the end of the window.\"",
      "According to Spanish outlet Orgullobiri, United are monitoring Lucien Agoume's situation at Sevilla. The 23-year-old midfielder joined the Spanish outfit last year after an initial spell on loan, having failed to break into the starting lineup at Inter.",
      "The report claims Sevilla want €30m (£25.9m), which happens to be lower than his €40m release clause, making Agoume a much cheaper alternative to Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Eduardo Camavinga."

      "Manchester United have already sanctioned 11 loan exits this summer and more could follow in the final 10 days of the window.",
      "The most high-profile loan departure has been Marcus Rashford's move to Barcelona, but the club have also allowed several of their promising youngsters to leave. Toby Collyer was the most recent, departing for Championship side West Brom last week.",
      "Goalkeeper Radek Vitek will also spend the season in the second tier having joined Bristol City. Midfield pair Dan Gore and Jack Moorhouse have joined League One sides Rotherham and Leyton Orient respectively while striker Ethan Wheatley is also in the third tier with Northampton Town.",
      "United also moved a trio of prospects into League Two with Joe Hugill (Barnet), Elyh Harrison (Shrewsbury), Sonny Aljofree (Notts County) and Habeeb Ogunneye (Newport County) spending the campaign in the fourth tier. Highly-rated forward Enzon Kana-Biyik, who joined United earlier this summer, has moved to Switzerland to join Lausanne-Sport.",
      "Despite that lengthy list more temporary departures are expected. Here are four United starlets who could spend the campaign away from Old Trafford.",
      "United are reportedly prepared to let the teenage forward leave on loan.",
      "The 18-year-old impressed at academy level last season and has been involved in first team training under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Biancheri has also trained with the senior Wales squad and is also eligible for Canada, who have made a play for his services at international level ahead of next summer's World Cup in North America.",
      "Welsh clubs Cardiff City and Newport County have been credited with an interest in taking Biancheri on loan this term.",
      "The left-back is widely expected to depart on loan in the coming days with United keen for the 18-year-old to play regular football.",
      "After internal discussions and the arrival of Diego Leon this summer, Amass was earmarked for a loan exit. Ruben Amorim gave Amass his first-team debut against Leicester in March and the youngster made seven first-team appearances last season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday are leading the race for the youngster, with other Championship clubs also interested.",
      "The 19-year-old winger was a late call up to the United squad for the summer tour of America.",
      "He scored in the 4-1 win over Bournemouth in Chicago and caught the eye with his performances.",
      "United are prepared to sanction a loan move and he has been linked with League One pair Stockport County and Barnsley.",
      "The centre back impressed in senior showings last season and may well be retained by Amorim for the forthcoming campaign.",
      "But the imminent return to fitness of Lisandro Martinez and the return to the XI of Luke Shaw mean United have plenty of options in defence when everyone is available.",
      "Fredricson was on the bench for the season opener against Arsenal alongside fellow defenders Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven, who are both ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Once Martinez is fit, minutes could be hard to come by at senior level for Fredricson and a loan could be explored, but given the injury issues that blighted United last term and the need to carry at least five centre back options to cover the back three formation, the chances are the 20-year-old remains at Old Trafford.",

      "Does anyone remember Tyrell Malacia? He's still on the books at Manchester United.",
      "Malacia was placed into the 'bomb squad' in July, alongside Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, but it felt slightly harsh to categorise Malacia in that group.",
      "The Dutchman has not worked his ticket like Rashford, Garnacho and Sancho. Malacia is simply not good enough for United. Ruben Amorim looked at Malacia after his arrival from Sporting Lisbon in November and quickly decided he should look for a new club in the January transfer window.",
      "Malacia was shipped out to PSV Eindhoven on loan and he made just six starts in all competitions during that stint, which confirmed ahead of the official decision that PSV would not be signing him permanently.",
      "PSV won the Eredivisie last season, so perhaps it was unrealistic for Malacia to break into their side after joining in the middle of the campaign, but Malacia's performances since his return from a serious knee injury last season suggest he might need to lower his sights for his next move.",
      "Interest has been thin on the ground in Malacia since his delayed return to Carrington. The left-back has been training on his own and his agent is working to arrange an exit before the transfer deadline.",
      "Malacia's dream of succeeding at Old Trafford is over and he must be given a degree of sympathy because a knee injury curtailed his time in Manchester. Would Malacia have been a success at United without that injury? Maybe not, but it was a challenging period and he's probably just happy to be playing again.",
      "The 26-year-old initially played through the injury at the end of the 2022/2023 season. Injections were used to get through games. Malacia then underwent surgery but required further surgery after a botched first attempt.",
      "After 517 days on the sidelines, Malacia made his return for the Under-21s against Huddersfield in November, and an interview about his recovery was published on the following day.",
      "\"We spoke to the guy who did my [first knee] surgery and then we made the decision: we had to do something else. I had to start my rehab over, basically… I had one day to be disappointed,\" Malacia told The Athletic.",
      "\"Then I had to be like, ‘OK, we go again’. I think at the end of the day, everything I did, even if it was a mistake or something, I won’t even see it as a mistake because it’s a lesson.",
      "\"I think everything in life is already written for me. I had to go through this whole process to be where I’m at now, so I wouldn’t do anything different.",
      "“You can ask the guys at the club — every time I came in, even though I was feeling s***, sometimes they were like, ‘Oh, your energy is so good, you give me energy again… how is he still smiling, or how is he still working after this and this happened to him?’.",
      "“Of course, I’ve had some moments where I was like, ‘Oh, I’m getting tired of this’ but there’s no way I could ever give up. It’s not my system, it’s not in our family.\"",
      "Malacia was on a long road to recovery, but when he returned, he was not provided with respite because he faced an even bigger challenge: fighting for his future at Old Trafford.",
      "The defender was recently spotted training with a private coach at non-league club Trafford FC. He has trained alone at Carrington over the last month and was recently pictured leaving the training ground with Sancho.",
      "Malacia's time at the club hasn't worked out as hoped and all parties are hoping the chapter is closed this summer. United want to arrange a permanent departure and Malacia will be hoping for the same.",

      "Manchester United's transfer priority in the final 12 days of the window has never been clearer: sign a new central midfielder.",
      "For all United's overall performance in the 1-0 defeat to Arsenal was positive, and they have spent north of £200million on a dangerous new front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, their need for a new midfielder is glaringly obvious.",
      "It is no secret Ruben Amorim wants fresh energy to play alongside captain Bruno Fernandes at the base of his midfield and it is clear, despite starting on Sunday, 33-year-old Casemiro isn't that man.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, who was an unused substitute against the Gunners, is out of favour and Manuel Ugarte has been underwhelming since signing from PSG last summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "As such, United have been linked with the likes of Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, Sporting CP star and Crystal Palace ace Adam Wharton but this weekend they will come up against a player they almost signed for the position just last summer.",
      "United made contact with Burnley over a possible deal for Sander Berge and it is believed the former Sheffield United midfielder was keen on a move to Old Trafford. Despite the Clarets' relegation from the Premier League, Berge had impressed in his only season at Turf Moor and it was believed a £25million move could have been struck.",
      "However, as it transpired, United signed Ugarte and their interest in Berge was ended. He made the move to Fulham for £25million instead and he was at the heart of Marco Silva's side's positive campaign last season.",

      "Manchester United have just 11 days to complete more deals in this transfer window before the September 1 deadline.",
      "So far, Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have been the new additions at Old Trafford. Cunha and Mbeumo both started in United's Premier League opener against Arsenal, while Sesko came on in the second half, replacing Mason Mount.",
      "It remains to be seen whether the final days of the window will bring another addition or two. In the meantime, the club continues working behind the scenes to finalise exits for Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, and Antony before the deadline",
      "Here, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest headlines from in and around Old Trafford.",
      "Former Norwegian forward and now journalist Jan Age Fjortoft believes there is a 'chance' Donnarumma could end up at Old Trafford despite links to Manchester City.",
      "Taking to X, Fjortoft wrote: \"Manchester United need a new goalkeeper if they are to have any realistic hopes of finishing in the top six. Donnarumma is a world-class keeper, and I understand there’s still a chance he could end up in Manchester….on the red side of the city.",
      "\"The challenge for United, though, is that they’ll need to move at least one goalkeeper out before that becomes possible.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: Securing a top-class goalkeeper in this transfer window should be a no-brainer for United. Donnarumma is widely regarded as one of the elite shot-stoppers in world football.",
      "With his anticipated departure from Paris Saint-Germain, the opportunity to bring in a goalkeeper of his calibre should be enough to encourage the United hierarchy into action.",
      "Adding someone like Donnarumma would not only strengthen the squad defensively but also signal the club’s ambition to compete at the very highest level once again.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, the French midfielder is expected to be offered to several clubs, including Manchester United, in the final days of the transfer window.",
      "Marseille have issued a statement announcing that Rabiot and Jonathan Rowe have been placed on the transfer list due to what the club describes as 'unacceptable behaviour.'",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano said: \"The club decided to put Adrien Rabiot and another player out of their squad, so Rabiot is available in the market. Olympique Marseille even released a statement saying he was up for sale and they want around €15-€20million (£13m-£17m) to let him leave.",
      "\"Those close to Rabiot's camp are proposing the opportunity to offer Rabiot to clubs, for example also to Manchester United. He's a player, who was a target for United many years ago but recently, it was never close. At the moment, I'm not hearing anything concrete on United but he's going to be offered to them and many other clubs.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: This is an intriguing development. United have long been admirers of the France international, but previous attempts to bring him to Old Trafford have failed to materialise. Could this be the time we see him in a Reds' shirt? That said, Romano claims he will be offered to a number of other clubs as well, which could put United at a disadvantage.",
      "Competing teams with European football may be more attractive to the player, especially given United's absence from continental competition this season. Nonetheless, the club’s stature, history, and potential for domestic success could still make them a viable option in the final days of the window.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The striker was not included in the matchday squad for the Premier League defeat to Arsenal on Sunday, fuelling the speculation even more.",

      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were excellent in United's front three, while Benjamin Sesko looked bright from the bench. All three players were signed this summer for a combined fee north of £200million but the signs are looking good that they prove to be a success.",
      "However, what was clear in their loss to the Gunners was United's need to strengthen their goalkeeper and midfield departments. Altay Bayindir was too weak for Arsenal's goal and offered another reminder he is not good enough for United.",
      "If Andre Onana remains United's number one, in an ideal world United must strengthen his competition. The noises from Old Trafford suggest that isn't deemed a major priority in the final two weeks of the transfer window.",
      "But a new midfielder is. And while Bruno Fernandes looked at home in a deeper midfield role, he needs a player with excellent physical attributes to play alongside him.",
      "33-year-old Casemiro, who started on Sunday, isn't that man while Manuel Ugarte has been largely underwhelming since signing from PSG last summer. Kobbie Mainoo was an unused substitute and where his long term future lies under Ruben Amorim remains shrouded in doubt.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has been touted as a potential signing although the Seagulls are known to be tough negotiators. Morten Hjulmand of Sporting CP and Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton have also been mentioned as possible alternatives.",
      "But one avenue into recruiting a quality midfielder could present itself while United look to offload Rasmus Hojlund. Despite the Dane's desire to remain at the club, his opportunities look limited at Old Trafford after he was left out of the matchday squad on Sunday.",
      "The 22-year-old has managed just 14 Premier League goals across his two seasons at the club and his days look numbered following the arrival of Sesko.",
      "A return to Serie A looks most likely and former club Atalanta are said to be considering making a loan move for the Danish international.",
      "Brazilian midfielder Ederson, who has been linked with United in the past, plies his trade with the Italian side and United could do worse than turning their attention towards the 26-year-old this summer.",
      "Ederson has been described as a 'relentless work horse' in the Italian media and would be the perfect foil for Fernandes in United's engine room. He has two years left on his deal in Bergamo and United could potentially use Hojlund as a makeweight in any potential transfer.",
      "With just 12 days until the transfer window slams shut and United needing to offload players as well as signing a midfielder, a creative solution like that cannot be off the negotiating table.",

      "As such, Rabiot's future now looks likely to be away from the Stade Velodrome and potential suitors have been put on high alert over his potential availability.",

      "Marcus Rashford has opened up on how he is settling in at Barcelona after securing a season-long loan move from Manchester United.",
      "Rashford is the only member of the United 'bomb squad' to have moved away from Old Trafford so far this summer having completed a loan move to Barca.",
      "The United academy graduate was left out of the squad for the Manchester derby by Ruben Amorim last December and did not play for the club again, only appearing in one matchday squad before completing a loan move to Aston Villa in the mid-season transfer window.",
      "With his United career over, Rashford is hoping to make his mark in La Liga as he aims to make his temporary move permanent next summer.",
      "Rashford was asked how he has been welcomed by the Barcelona squad, revealing his teammates have a slightly unusual nickname for him.",
      "\"When they're having fun with each other, they call me 'sweetie'. I don't know what it means, but it's funny when they talk to you like that,\" he told Spanish outlet SPORT.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, they know I'm trying to learn Spanish. I think it's important for me to learn as soon as possible. So it's stimulating. You're always learning, and that's good.\"",
      "Barcelona have an option to buy Rashford next summer, and the United loanee is keen to make his mark at Camp Nou.",
      "\"In such a historic club, all the players only play a small role,\" he said. \"It would be great for me to be able to contribute to that history. But, as you say, this is just a loan for now, so I have to take it day by day, do my best, and enjoy the journey.\"",
      "A number of managers have trialled playing Rashford as a striker throughout his career, despite his best form coming on the left wing. Barca boss Hansi Flick has already played Rashford as a No.9 as well as on the wing, and the 27-year-old was asked which of the two he prefers.",
      "\"I can play in both positions, but in the end, what matters is helping to score and assist, he said. \"I don't care what position I play in. I think the players around me are very good and make good passes, so if I make good runs and time them right, I can always create and score goals.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho may have been sent the clearest indication that he needs to secure a transfer away from Manchester United before the summer window closes.",
      "Garnacho has been heavily linked with a move away from United all summer and seemingly does not feature in Ruben Amorim's plans for the season ahead. The Argentina international informed United of his desire to leave the club earlier in the summer, but a transfer has yet to materialise.",
      "United did not include Garnacho in their pre-season tour of the United States, and he was not involved in the defeat to Arsenal on Sunday in the Reds' Premier League opener. A move away from Old Trafford seems increasingly likely, and there may be another reason to make the transfer happen.",
      "Argentina have named their squad for their World Cup qualifiers taking place in September, where they will take on Venezuela and Ecuador.",
      "Garnacho has not been included in the 31-man squad by head coach Lionel Scaloni, which does feature Manchester City forward Claudio Echeverri and Real Madrid summer signing Franco Mastantuono.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Even though Argentina have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup, which will take place in the United States, Scaloni will still want to see which players he will be able to rely on in next summer's tournament.",
      "Garnacho has not played a competitive match for United since the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur back in May. Chelsea have been heavily linked with signing the forward but a deal has not yet been agreed between United and the Londoners.",
      "With a World Cup looming for Argentina, which will see the country defend their crown, Garnacho will be determined to be part of the squad that travels to the United States for the tournament. For that to happen, a move away from United is almost certainly going to be needed.",
      "United have until September 1 to complete their transfer business, after which point the Reds and Garnacho would then need to wait until January for a move to be possible once again.",
      "It remains to be seen if a deal can be agreed before the deadline, but if one can it would likely boost Garnacho's hopes of starring for his country on the biggest stage next summer.",

      "Now that the new attacking trio are in place, United can turn to issues that they deemed a lower priority at the start of the transfer window.",
      "Andre Onana expects to be the first-choice goalkeeper for the upcoming campaign, but Altay Bayindir may still want a move away for more playing time - while Tom Heaton hasn't started in a Premier League match for years and United may want to strengthen the depth available to them here.",
      "The clamour for Carlos Baleba recently - and a loan exit to continue young Toby Collyer's development - could be seen as a sign that United want a fresh midfielder to support their defenders. Much will depend on if and how the club can sort out transfers for players that are surplus to requirements, like Alejandro Garnacho or Jadon Sancho.",
      "The opening-game loss to Arsenal has fans focused on these two areas. Reader MickyFinn says: \"The solution is to bring in a new 'keeper in this window, it's that simple. Utd also really need a midfielder, but we may well see neither materialise because of the reported stance of the board and the lack of player sales.\"",
      "Commenter Garth123 writes: \"The attacking signings are all good signings, but it isn't enough if their target is the top-six. We all saw on the tour how the midfield was overrun at times, even against West Ham, with just one pass, played a forward in onto our defence.",
      "\"Then on Sunday we also saw how vulnerable and weak our goalkeeping situation is. Too many mistakes will happen and we will lose games like the Arsenal game. For me it's just a 6/10 transfer window, as it looks like no others are in the pipeline after the Baleba pursuit failed at the final hurdle as Brighton didn't want to sell. As usual United have left things too late. Too much time wasted on the Mbuemo deal.\"",
      "AndrewKoizumi says: \"Finding a suitable 'keeper before the trading window closes will be very difficult, but it could be done. I hope Amorim finds the right 'keeper that will shine at United. I pray for that.\"",
      "Glazerclowns writes: \"Will be interesting how many players we bring in before end of window. A new midfielder and goalkeeper needed at minimum.\"",
      "Doctor7 says: \"Happy with the new signings, made a positive impact, midfield and goalie needs adjusting.\"",
      "Fanatic writes: \"Unless a decent 'keeper is signed then we will keep losing games, it's as simple as that. If we don't sign a decent 'keeper then that's a serious error of judgement. Amorim was right not to call him out in public. However, he's stuck with two 'keepers that he isn't happy with. It's true that his best 'keeper is third choice. I would sell both and use that money to buy a new 'keeper. [Tom] Heaton could be No.2 to the new 'keeper.\"",
      "Red99 says: \"Bayindir is an accident waiting to happen every single game he plays, same for Onana. Heaton would be my choice, until we get a new goalkeeper in.\"",
      "Have your say! Do you agree with a harsh assessment of United's goalkeepers and midfielders? What business is left to be done? Comment below, and join in on the conversation.",

      "It was nearly 8pm on Sunday and Ruben Amorim was only at the start of his post-match signing session outside the Stretford End tunnel.",
      "Hundreds of Manchester United supporters had waited patiently. They tend to, whatever the result and whatever the weather. Before full-time on the final day of last season, a couple of narky Mancunians asked some innocent fans why they were waiting for the lot that had just finished 15th. United are still 15th.",
      "Amorim was happier after a press conference that clocked in well at a meagre three-and-a-half minutes. He was incredulous that his choice of goalkeeper was questioned and the debrief centred so heavily on the 'keeping situation it was wrapped up quickly.",
      "Perhaps Amorim bristled at the lack of focus on United's performance. That they were better than Arsenal was undeniable and will have been reflected in any sensible piece filed from the press box in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand.",
      "United were good and easy on the eye, which may have accounted for the large phalanx of fans outside. United were a chore to watch for almost the entirety of last season, particularly in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal, once such a sanctimonious club under Arsene Wenger that performances took precedence over results, have flipped it. They are a throwback to the George Graham era and actually revel in defending leads. This was their third 1-0 win at Old Trafford under Mikel Arteta and they have all been gritty performances.",
      "Winning ugly is an essential trait for title winners. United just need to win. Sunday marked their 19th home defeat since the start of the 2023-24 season.",
      "The players and staff still embarked on their dubious full-time lap of honour. There was appreciative applause from those who remained. It was noticeable that hardly any supporters left before the game had concluded.",
      "But the bottom line is United lost with a team littered with contentious calls: the goalkeeper, the left-sided centre back, the defensive midfielder, the right winger and the number seven.",
      "Amorim seemed to settle on a more becoming balance in pre-season, with Amad on the right. He was one of two players to start all five friendlies, which made Amad's demotion to the bench such a strategic shame.",
      "Suddenly, there were seven defensive players - a goalkeeper, three centre halves, two full backs, a defensive midfielder - picked for a home game. If Arsenal were at the races, they would have won at a canter.",
      "Instead, United did almost all of the running. Aside from the winning goal, Arsenal did not create a genuine chance worthy of the Match of the Day highlights until Bukayo Saka latched onto Martin Odegaard's disguised dink in the 92nd minute.",
      "Yet they did not need to. Including the seven minutes of added time, Arsenal defended their slender advantage for 84 minutes against a team that did not start a striker.",
      "United had £182.12million worth of strikers in the stadium: one in the directors' box, one on the bench and one on the pitch for the final 25 minutes. Warming up for Arsenal with strikerless sides against Everton and Fiorentina was a gear-shift from Amorim. He refused to consider that set-up in the run-in last season, despite Rasmus Hojlund's hopelessness in front of goal.",
      "Amorim dropped Hojlund after he strolled into the mixed zone in Chicago and outlined his intention to stay. Hojlund is small-fry for Amorim after he dispensed with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, but the United head coach has cut off his nose to spite his face. United's strongest performances in pre-season were with the Dane starting up front.",
      "There was still £193.5m worth of attackers in United's front three. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo complemented one another auspiciously and their willingness to get on the ball and put opponents on the back foot is not a sight United fans are accustomed to from attacking debutants.",
      "Antony scored on a victorious debut against Arsenal three years ago. He did little else and looked one-paced and one-dimensional during a self-indulgent hour. Cunha and Mbeumo did not get on the scoresheet but their movement, fluidity and presence in attacks bodes well. Amad offered another dimension when he was summoned early into the second half.",
      "Picking Mason Mount over a more suitable starter backfired in the Europa League final for Amorim and did so again. Mount is intense and competitive but he has not played properly well in the league two years into his United career yet Amorim is still crowbarring him into the team.",
      "It is impressionable of Amorim, too. Mount gained his place against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao on the back of his two-goal cameo in the semi-final second leg. Against Everton in Atlanta, he emerged to score United's final goal of their tour and has since returned to the starting XI.",
      "Another blind spot is Altay Bayindir. United needed a new goalie this summer not to outright replace Andre Onana but to offer credible competition. Bayindir was fortunate to play for the club again after he punched thin air from Son Heung-min's corner at Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals eight months ago.",
      "\"Without VAR,\" an impassioned Amorim reminded us. \"With VAR, it's a foul.\" It wasn't.",
      "Then Amorim reminded us Bayindir was \"unbelievable\" in the FA Cup tie at Arsenal last season. He was after the superb game-changing denial of Odegaard from the penalty spot. Before that, he was constantly kicking the ball into touch.",
      "In the press conference room, Amorim eventually said he was \"happy\" with his three goalkeepers. Deep down, he can't be.",
      "Those United fans would also likely wait around outside the Stretford End for a goalkeeper signing.",

Arsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second.",
      "\"I do feel they'll get there at some point. Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals. City have an unbelievable spine. I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important.

      "Manchester United see £50m for Alejandro Garnacho as a ‘fair and accurate’ price, while Chelsea don’t want to pay more than £30m. Neither club is wrong – both valuations are entirely reasonable. Which is why rather than meeting in the middle to leave both United and Chelsea £10m unhappy, we propose a significant level of Pr*ck Protection to ensure the perfect transfer.",
      "Chelsea are in an excellent negotiating position. Garnacho is a desire rather than a need; if they don’t get him, they’ll either sign someone else or no-one at all and be just fine. He’s desperate to join them, with his ‘Chelsea or nothing’ vow tested and affirmed this week as he said no to Bayern Munich. And United are obviously very open to offers for a man who’s played his last game for them.",
      "The smart money would be on United lowering their price tag to bring in some of that sweet ‘pure profit’ cash to aid in the PSR stakes and perhaps put towards a new midfielder or goalkeeper.",
      "But there must be more than a temptation – after Garnacho told them “Chelsea or I stay here and don’t play football for 6-12 months” – for the United bosses to test that resolve given his off-field antics this summer.",
      "He’s only on £50,000 per week; they might see £2.6m as an annual price they’re willing to pay for the cathartic suffering of their academy graduate. If we’re making knee-jerk assessments on the opening day of the season – and of course we are – United will be just fine without further additions while Garnacho rots at home.",
      "And just imagine the malicious joy Ruben Amorim would take in Garnacho coming to his office in October with his tale between his legs asking him to play football in a World Cup year. “Still got the Marcus Rashford shirt, mate? Yeah, shut the door on your way out.”",
      "Between his donning of that Aston Villa top, labelling United’s season “sh*t” after being dropped for the Europa League final and spending most of their post-season trip of Asia ‘flipping the finger to fans’, supposedly in jest, Garnacho didn’t leave much space for reintegration after Amorim informed him he wasn’t in his plans.",
      "It does make you wonder just how much of a childish little arse a talented footballer has to be for other clubs not to be interested in signing them at all, though our guess is there will always be a manager with an ego big enough to believe they can be the ‘fix’ for a lost soul no matter what they’ve done, within the boundaries of the law.",
      "Enzo Maresca isn’t alone in thinking Garnacho’s quality and potential outstrips his infantile behaviour, with Aston Villa’s Unai Emery and Bayern’s Vincent Kompany seemingly of a similar mind.",
      "And Chelsea’s belief that the 21-year-old can become a ‘key player in the right environment’ isn’t without reason. Although their own experience with Jadon Sancho suggests Stamford Bridge perhaps isn’t the best landing spot for Red Devil outcasts, fellow bomb squad members Rashford and Antony both thrived having escaped United last season.",
      "Chelsea only sign footballers they believe will be worth more than what they paid for them in the future. It’s a model we scoffed at but is now reaping rewards. And there’s no doubt that Garnacho represents a big market opportunity.",
      "It was barely a year ago that United deemed him untouchable as a £100m player in the making, before setting a £70m asking price that’s now dropped to £50m. That dip in valuation is thanks to what we’ve been told is a need for the club to make money through player sales, a lack of progression on Garnacho’s part in that time, his unsuitability to Amorim’s system and United’s bizarre bid to secure the lowest possible transfer fee for their footballers by telling the world they’re desperate to be rid of them.",
      "We would suggest – and this may well be Chelsea’s position – there has been no allowance made by United for just what a knob he’s been in the last three months. And thus we present to you: Pr*ck Protection.",
      "The issue we foresee in Chelsea drawing up a contract which includes this £20m-worth of Pr*ck Protection, or add-ons as they’re more colloquially known, is the subjectivity of pr*ckery. We’ve all met several pr*cks in our lives and often what makes them a pr*ck is intangible – it’s something you feel in your bones. “Why don’t I like them? Don’t know, just a bit of a pr*ck.”",
      "And even the things that could possibly be measured – number of social media posts involving you wearing the shirt of a rival club, a sulk to goals ratio, volume of bullsh*t spouted on your behalf by your loud-mouthed sibling – aren’t typically the things written into a contract, with add-ons tending to be based on players achievements rather than stuff they’ve managed to avoid.",
      "Chelsea may have to rely on the usual appearances, goals, assists bonuses to serve a similar purpose – Maresca won’t pick a pr*ck  – but in whatever guise, they will feel they should be afforded some insurance from United: financial recognition of the risk they’re taking on a player who probably is worth £50m, but only if he stops being a pr*ck.",
      "Suggesting that Newcastle are the wronged party in the Alexander Isak affair has Liverpool fans feeling aggrieved to be portrayed as the villains…",
      "Alexander Isak went for the nuclear option – but it seems to have had little immediate effect. Elsewhere, what will Yoane Wissa do now Brentford have rejected another Newcastle bid?",
      "Alexander Isak has behaved pretty ‘pathetically’ according to pretty much everybody but Liverpool fans.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working to finalise the signing’ of Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho amid a ‘discreet offer’.",
      "Curse you Liverpool and curse you Alexander Isak for making us feel sorry for Newcastle United. They have done nothing wrong in this.",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔼 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Manchester City\nBack on the agenda after the winger remained an unused substitute in Real’s La Liga opener. City are keen, but only if Tottenham take Savinho. Which few at the Etihad are convinced is a wise idea.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Which probably scuppers whatever hope Napoli might have had of filling their Romelu Lukaku void with the Dane.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Andre Onana – Manchester United to Inter Milan\nThe story goes that Inter are keen to bring Onana back to the San Siro, the memory of some level of goalkeeping competency apparently still fresh enough to look past the last two seasons at Old Trafford. Yann Sommer is 37 before Christmas so it makes sense for Inter to make succession plans. But we cannot imagine them presenting anything but a loan offer. Maybe that will be enough because United simply cannot afford to continue with their present goalkeeping situation.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too. Friday night’s chaos against Bournemouth might spring them into action, mind.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Though things have since gone quiet again while Spurs have all the talks with Palace over Eze.",
      "",
      "",
      "14) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Aston Villa\nYou can’t blame Chelsea for trying to maximise the fee they eventually bank for Jackson but £80million is just daft. It does, however, make £60million sound more palatable to the likes of Villa and Newcastle, who are more motivated to move as the deadline approaches. Villa are said to be looking at a loan-to-buy deal, which could still cost them a total of £70million. Which seems awfully steep for a one-goal-in-three striker who Chelsea clearly have little use for.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will want big money since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs were close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million. Maybe the performance at Leeds will persuade Everton to pay up.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. After the Instagram tantrum, we wait in anticipation of Wissa’s next move.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million but at least they seem tohave warmed to the idea of taking back Christopher Nkunku. Which would free up some of the funds to sign Simons.",
      "",
      "8) ↔ Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option on Tuesday night with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him, which they have not yet shown a firm desire to do. If Liverpool had not taken Hugo Ekitike from under Newcastle’s noses, Isak would quite likely be in red by now. He’s not, and while we won’t rule out the prospect of Liverpool going big, it’s no more likely to happen than it was before Isak hit ‘share’ on his Instagram story.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "7) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed. If only there was another club in Manchester who desperately need a competent goalkeeper…",

      "6) 🔼 Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nCity say Ederson stayed in Manchester rather than travel to Wolves on Saturday because he had a dicky tummy. It was just a coincidence that it occurred around the same time an £8.6million offer arrived from Galatasaray. If City have decided they want Donnarumma, then Ederson will be off. They want double the amount offered by the Turkish but the expectation is that a compromise can be reached. Galatasaray appear to be trying to speed City along by making it known they quite fancy Diogo Costa too.",

      "5) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get id. RB Leipzig’s renewed interest could give Bayern the shove they need.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nArsenal’s faffing has given Spurs a window and the way Eze lingered in front of the travelling Palace fans on Sunday could be viewed as a possible farewell by those who really want to interpret it that way. The latest update suggests Tottenham and Palace are talking after Eze expressed a willingness to move. Spurs currently offering £55million plus £5million in add-ons.

The Brazilian has been pants in Italy but his performances for Villa are still fresh enough in the memory to believe that this could be a fine addition. Ornstein reckons a deal is agreed for Forest to take Luiz on loan for a season before a £25million obligation if he plays a specified number of games. Which seems like a very sweet deal for Forest. Luiz is likely to have a medical on Thursday.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed his clear “feeling” on Alejandro Garnacho’s situation at Manchester United amid interest from Chelsea.",
      "Garnacho is not part of Ruben Amorim’s plans at Man Utd as the winger had a major fallout with the head coach towards the end of last season.",
      "United’s academy product was criticised over his poor form and attitude last season as he struggled to adapt to Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation and dropped in the pecking order during the run-in.",
      "Garnacho was included in Man Utd’s so-called bomb squad after hitting out at the club following their Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, but he is still waiting on a move elsewhere.",
      "On Tuesday evening, Romano reiterated that Garnacho only has eyes for Premier League rivals Chelsea and that this “deal is advancing” after Bayern Munich made a move to hijack the transfer.",
      "“My feeling is that Garnacho will go to Chelsea and I maintain my position,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Seven glaring transfer priorities highlighted by Premier League opening weekend",
      "“I can guarantee to you that this deal is advancing. Manchester United and Chelsea are talking. The CEO of Man Utd Omar Berrada has a good relationship with the hierarchy of Chelsea. Conversations are underway over the transfer fee – there is a gap.",
      "“In the last 48 hours, Bayern called Garnacho’s camp but were told: ‘Thanks, but I only want to go to Chelsea.’",
      "“For Garnacho, it’s very clear: he will not go to any other club. Either he goes to Chelsea, or he stays at Man Utd, even if he’s out of the squad. For him, it’s OK. Stay there, train and see what happens.",
      "“We know that his relationship with Man Utd is completely broken, so it’s Chelsea or nothing.”",
      "Romano has also revealed that the Red Devils are set to be given the opportunity to sign long-term target Adrien Rabiot as the Frenchman is “no longer part” of Marseille’s squad and will leave in the closing stages of this window.",
      "After landing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, Man Utd’s next two priorities are a midfielder and a goalkeeper, though Romano has explained why a move for Rabiot is currently unlikely.",
      "“There was this tense situation at Marseille that led to the club putting Rabiot and Jonathan Rowe out of the squad. Rabiot is no longer part of Roberto De Zerbi’s squad and is available,” Romano added.",
      "“Marseille even released an official statement to say he’s up for sale. They want something like €15-20m to let him leave.",
      "“He was a target for Man Utd many years ago but in recent years was never very close. I’m not hearing any concrete about them being in negotiations or talks for Rabiot. He’s going to be offered to Man Utd and many other clubs as an opportunity. But it’s an open situation.",
      "“I think United wanted to go for Carlos Baleba for his intensity. Rabiot is a different profile.”",
      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working to finalise the signing’ of Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho amid a ‘discreet offer’.",
      "It has previously been suggested that Xavi Simons to Chelsea is ‘advanced’, but new reports have claimed that this transfer could collapse for two reasons.",
      "Chelsea have reportedly made a ‘whopping offer’ for a defender, while Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons.",
      "Arsenal have rejected the opportunity to sign Man Utd winger Alejandro Garnacho this summer in favour of Eberechi Eze, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Alejandro Garnacho’s potential transfer from Man Utd to Chelsea is now ‘very, very advanced’."

      "The Italy international is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, but he is set to leave PSG before this summer transfer window closes.",
      "Donnarumma looks to have had a bust-up with PSG’s hierarchy over a new contract as they are looking to cash-in on the goalkeeper after the two sides failed to come to terms on a deal to extend his stay beyond 2026.",
      "PSG have already replaced Donnarumma by signing Lucas Chevalier from Ligue Un rivals Lille, with their former number one likely to cost around £30m.",
      "A move to Man Utd initially looked likely for Donnarumma as they are in the market for a new goalkeeper to replace Andre Onana and the opportunity to sign the PSG star for a cut-price fee is too good to ignore.",
      "READ: Potter sack, Arsenal trophy, Liverpool record and more kneejerk reactions from opening Premier League weekend",
      "However, Man City are moving to beat Man Utd in the race to land Donnarumma and they appear to have moved to the front of the queue for his signature, with journalist Nicolo Schira revealing on Wednesday morning that the player and club have reached an ‘agreement in principle’.",
      "Schira said on X: ‘Excl – Agreement in principle between Gigio #Donnarumma and #ManchesterCity for a contract until 2030.",

      "Rodrygo has been heavily linked with several Premier League clubs in recent months as he has dropped in Real Madrid’s pecking order following the arrival of Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The talented winger was an unused substitute as Real Madrid beat Osasuna 1-0 on Tuesday night, with football finance expert Stefan Borson claiming to Football Insider that his move to Man City could be “effectively done”.",
      "He said: “Well, I think the cost is the only inhibitor. I think the player would come.",
      "“I think that there are whispers that the deal is effectively done, certainly on the player side and has been for some months because he’s desperate to get out of Real Madrid. And again, as with Donnarumma, Real Madrid want him out.",
      "“He started almost none of the Club World Cup. I think he started the first game only. He didn’t start the friendly last weekend. I think Real Madrid have had enough, so it’s definitely a feasible deal in that respect.",
      "“My understanding is his wages are actually not as big as you might have expected. I mean, don’t get me wrong, it’s still hundreds of thousands.",
      "“I would think a top-10 earner at City, so still very substantial, but maybe not starting with a four on the basic. That might make it more achievable.”",

      "We are one gameweek down and with less than two weeks until the transfer window closes, plenty of Premier League clubs have some glaring holes in their squads.",
      "From goalkeepers flapping at corners to £27m strikers managing two shots, here are seven much-needed transfers highlighted by the opening weekend.",
      "On another day, Altay Bayindir may well have got the free-kick he was asking for having flapped at the ball for Arsenal’s goal but his performance shone a spotlight on United’s most pressing need: a new goalkeeper.",
      "Even in the dark years, United have tended to have decent shot-stoppers with David de Gea carrying the team for a number of seasons, but his replacement Andre Onana and his deputy Bayindir do not inspire confidence.",
      "Fixing that problem is key and the club have been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emi Martinez, both of who would be upgrades on their current options.",
      "Away from the keeper, United also need a new midfielder with 33-year-old Casemiro looking past his best. Adam Wharton would be the best replacement but it may be hard to convince Crystal Palace to sell with Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi likely to leave before the window closes.",
      "The headband-wearing Antony Gordon’s impression of Bjorn Borg was better than his impression of a No.9 against Aston Villa as Newcastle looked particularly toothless up front.",
      "Alexander Isak being the clear first choice meant Newcastle have had the luxury of not needing to spend too much time thinking about squad depth but this summer has proved just how hard it can be to secure the top striking talents.",
      "Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko have both gone elsewhere with Isak sulking in an unknown location, leaving Gordon to try to impose himself on opposition defences.",
      "The result was an expected one. All but one of his shots inside the box were blocked and of his seven efforts, just two hit the target. Crucially, they were efforts taken outside the box and to the left, his more natural position.",
      "With Isak in the wilderness and Callum Wilson now at West Ham, Newcastle need to get a striker in and, even if PSR will prevent getting a replacement close to Isak’s level, anything is better than nothing at this stage.",
      "A 3-0 win to start the year suggested Tottenham may not miss the creativity of James Maddison following his long-term injury but they will come up against far better opposition than Burnley this season.",
      "Against the Turf Moor side, Thomas Frank started a very young midfield of Lucas Bergvall, Archie Gray and Pape Sarr but as the season goes on and tougher games take place, you get the feeling they could do with some more experience in there.",
      "The obvious link is Eze who has been reported as ‘one step away’ from signing with the north London club but with Yves Bissouma looking like he may leave, Spurs could do with even more reinforcements than just the Palace man.",

      "Monday’s loss to Leeds United was a humbling way for Everton fans to start what was supposed to be a season of positivity.",
      "A brand new stadium may soon be filled with the same existential dread that painted the walls of Goodison and while it is easy to answer the question with ‘How do you fix Everton?’ by replying ‘Get a whole new team’, realistically, they should focus on the forward department.",
      "Their back line is solid and would have kept a clean sheet had a harsh VAR call not gone their way while the summer reinforcements of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish look like smart acquisitions, but it is the No.9 spot that Everton have struggled with for years.",
      "The perennially injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin has joined Monday’s opponents and while Beto scored five in five back in February, a run of eight games without a goal is perhaps more representative.",
      "Against Leeds, the Guinea-Bissau international registered the fewest touches of any player to last the full 90 and managed just one shot. The fact he played the whole game only demonstrates how hamstrung David Moyes is in that area. New signing Thierno Barry was only trusted for a few minutes.",
      "The Toffees have been linked with Reims forward Adama Bojang and out-of-contract Jamie Vardy but Moyes needs something if they are to avoid the drop this year.",
      "Where to even begin?",
      "If West Ham fans were not already worried, a 3-0 thumping at the hands of newly promoted Sunderland was enough to send even the calmest head into panic mode.",
      "The weakness of last season’s promoted teams and the laughable chaos at Spurs and United allowed West Ham to reach the flattering spot of 14th but it is already looking like it would need a miracle for them to do so again this time round.",
      "Their xG against the Black Cats was only better than Wolves (who played Manchester City) and Villa (who played Newcastle with 10 men). At the other end, the xG conceded was not awful at 0.8 but the team look so toothless going forward as the tactic of ‘pass the ball to Bowen and hope for the best’ reaches its limit.",
      "The worst offender was Niclas Fullkrug who managed just two shots in the full 90 minutes and lost all but three of his 19 duels. The decision to sign him for £27m only a year ago now fits neatly into West Ham’s woes with strikers.",
      "The Hammers are said to be competing with Everton for Bojang but it is hard to see why any player would choose this ‘project’ at the moment.",
      "If it continues like this, West Ham’s most important signing may well be a new manager.",
      "For a team that had eight goalkeepers on their books only a year ago, Chelsea sure have found it difficult to find a decent one.",
      "In Chelsea’s 0-0 draw to Palace, a technicality saved Robert Sanchez from conceding a free-kick he really should have stopped and although he came away with a clean sheet, he only had to make four saves with Palace’s total xG at only 0.66.",
      "Tougher tests will come but Sanchez is not a keeper that inspires a huge amount of confidence. Despite this, the club insist hey are not in the market for a new shot-stopper. The fools.",
      "When your own manager is describing your transfer window as “passive”, not much more needs to be said.",
      "Fulham owners the Khans have typically been late spenders but Fulham have parted with less than £500k this summer. Five League One clubs have spent more than that.",
      "Marco Silva wants four new signings before the window closes but it should be in creative areas that the club focus on.",
      "Away at Brighton, they created just one big chance and had an xG of 0.76 and next face the visit of Manchester United.",
      "",
      "Alexander Isak went for the nuclear option – but it seems to have had little immediate effect. Elsewhere, what will Yoane Wissa do now Brentford have rejected another Newcastle bid?",
      "Alexander Isak has behaved pretty ‘pathetically’ according to pretty much everybody but Liverpool fans.",
      "Curse you Liverpool and curse you Alexander Isak for making us feel sorry for Newcastle United. They have done nothing wrong in this.",
      "Newcastle United have apparently behaved appallingly by trying to keep hold of their best player; just give in to Liverpool, guys.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have ‘approved’ a ‘£165m double deal’ as they look to close the signings of Alexander Isak and another top target.",
      "Cole Palmer has gone 17 games without a open play goal in the Premier League but rather than a dip in form, is this the new normal?"

      "Sancho has been deemed surplus to requirements this summer, with United making clear they want him gone before the market closes.",
      "His contract, worth upwards of £250,000 per week, has only added urgency as the club looks to free space on the wage bill and raise funds for reinforcements.",
      "United have already invested heavily in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, so any extra relief they can generate by moving Sancho on and securing a fee could be vital in funding further late-window business.",

      "Other approaches have also been dismissed, with Amorim unwilling to reintegrate him regardless of how long he remains at Old Trafford.",
      "That backdrop leaves United desperate for a resolution before September 1.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, however, Sancho is more relaxed about the deadline. The winger is prepared to wait beyond this window if the right permanent opportunity does not emerge and would even consider reassessing his options in January.",
      "That stance is designed to protect his long-term future, with Sancho conscious that he could secure a stronger move if he holds his ground.",
      "But it collides directly with United’s urgency to close the door now and stop one of their highest earners drifting through the autumn without a role.",
      "The concern for United’s hierarchy is that Sancho’s patience forces their hand. They may be left with little choice but to sanction a loan on deadline day, knowing that a permanent fee looks unlikely unless he changes his position.",
      "For Amorim, the timing could not be worse. United’s manager has already moved Marcus Rashford on to Barcelona and wants the chance to reshape his squad with fresh signings before the window shuts.",
      "Instead, Sancho’s stance risks leaving him with an expensive outcast who will not feature in his plans but still weighs heavily on the club’s books.",

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, but Liverpool want a word.",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Newcastle United – £126.3m\nIt’s been a slow and frustrating summer – and there’s still no sign of a new striker – but Jacob Ramsey has arrived for £39m to join Anthony Elanga and Malick Thiaw. They still need to spend a whole lot more.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £142.59m\nNine first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £148.1m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "19) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "18) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start – losing to Leeds in that manner is one example – but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "12=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "12=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "12=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "12=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "10) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "7) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "6) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Manchester City) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Sunderland) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Liverpool) – £45m",
      "5th (Nottingham Forest) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Arsenal) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Leeds) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Brighton) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Fulham) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Aston Villa) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Chelsea) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Crystal Palace) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Newcastle) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Everton) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Manchester United) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Bournemouth) – £13.3m",
      "17th (Brentford) – £10.7m",
      "18th (Burnley) – £7.9m",
      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "Graham Potter is doomed at West Ham, much like Scott Parker and Burnley. But Sunderland and Leeds are staying up and the Big Six is officially back, baby.",
      "",
      "10) Liverpool will break the goal record\nArne Slot basically telling Jamie Carragher to support a different team if he was “worried” about Liverpool committing too many players forward in a 4-2 win was enjoyable.",
      "“We are a team that likes to attack. We are a team that wants to score goals,” he said, as if adding a £69m striker and £100m playmaker to a group of options also including the third-highest scorer in the club’s history had not already underlined, italicised and emboldened the point.",
      "It did make the £150m record pursuit of another forward seem like a bit of a luxury but Liverpool are blessed with quality rather than quantity across their frontline. Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez and Ben Doak have been sold for almost as much as Alexander Isak would cost.",
      "Another ingredient might well be added to the mix before the deadline but even without it, the 106-goal platter Manchester City delivered the first Pep Guardiola title on should be a tentative target.",
      "",
      "9) At least one of the four out-of-contract managers announce their exit before the end of the season\nBournemouth and Wolves were beaten by Premier League title challengers, while Crystal Palace and Fulham emerged from difficult away assignments with creditable draws.",
      "That only reinforced the frustration felt by three of those four desirable Premier League coaches in the final year of their deals.",
      "Andoni Iraola has since been endowed with an overdue centre-half and attacking depth in Bafode Diakite and Ben Gannon-Doak. But Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva and Vitor Pereira have all reiterated the need for new and ready-made signings.",
      "Perhaps the clubs involved would prefer a more long-term show of commitment from those who expect to be supplied expensive new toys, but each of those managers could feasibly punch a little higher in their relationships.",
      "",
      "8) Parker and Potter are sacked\nIt is a point worth repeating from the first Winners and Losers of the season: bemoaning an inability to do “the basics” against a newly-promoted side or blaming “fine margins” as a newly-promoted side, both in 3-0 defeats, does not augur well on the opening weekend.",
      "Burnley might have expected to be in for a long season and Scott Parker deserves credit for taking a different approach to his latest bid for survival. But this one looked roughly as doomed as his previous attempts even before a ball was kicked.",
      "Graham Potter was an early sack race frontrunner after the general misery with which last season ended at West Ham, and such a chastening defeat to Sunderland meant the wait for any semblance of an identity to emerge under his tutelage has reached 20 games and a pre-season.",
      "The recruitment has not been nearly good enough for either club to achieve their objectives, but ultimately two managers who have suffered their fair share of sackings know where the buck stops for fidgety owners. The race to appoint Sean Dyche will be unseemly.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds and Sunderland will stay up\nFor the first time since 2021/22, and only the third time ever in Premier League history, as many as two newly-promoted teams won on the opening weekend.",
      "The scorelines were slightly different for Sunderland and Leeds, the first Championship winners to start in the top flight with a win since the Black Cats in 2007. But both overcame established members of what has proven a particularly closed shop in the past couple of seasons.",
      "There has been a slight overegging of the pudding in terms of fretting about the gulf between the Premier League and Football League based on six laughably underprepared and low-quality sides coming up to go straight down – especially as the four most recent sides to survive that jump seamlessly became part of the apparently unmovable furniture.",
      "But in sinking those early six-pointers, leaving a mark on teams they can feasibly usurp and building momentum in front of raucous home crowds after solid to spectacular summer recruitment drives, Sunderland and Leeds have already shown enough to suggest they can hold their own.",
      "",
      "6) Brentford will go down\nThat does require the demise of two supposedly protected and untouchable teams, but Brentford always felt unsuited to that elite casting and the vultures have done a number on them.",
      "Dango Ouattara has signed, Mikkel Damsgaard will return and Jordan Henderson should bring experience and nous to a team suddenly lacking in both, but it is difficult to envisage Keith Andrews making much sense of the hand he has been dealt.",
      "But ultimately the biggest count against Brentford might be that there is no obvious firefighter appointment for when the panic sets in. They are not tempting the Sam Allardyces, Alan Pardews or Tony Pulises of this world off the after-dinner circuit, but absolutely could do the sort of absurd thing data-led clubs do when the wheels come off a little and make a damning call to someone like Jesse Marsch in February.",
      "",
      "5) Erling Haaland will break his own goal record\nThere is definitely a shout for Tijanji Reijnders to win the PFA Player of the Year award after proving that the tough First Guardiola Year is not actually a prerequisite for any new Manchester City signing.",
      "But a safer bet might be Haaland recovering from the shame of 38 and 34-goal seasons to start testing the structural integrity of Dixie Dean’s legacy again.",
      "A ludicrous level of attacking quality, depth and variety is contained within that Manchester City squad, spearheaded by a striker whose brilliance has been normalised. The goal record he set in his debut season is going to fall.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal will win a trophy\nIt is difficult to recall another manager or team at the start of any Premier League season whose success or failure was so specifically dependent on the procurement of trophies.",
      "Mikel Arteta promised to “give my life” to deliver silverware at the end of last season and a great many critics appear to have taken that literally, stating that this phase must be his last if he cannot drag Arsenal over the line.",
      "Oliver Glasner matching his trophy haul in a fraction of the time and on a fragment of the budget at Crystal Palace has not helped but Arsenal do feel set up to book that open-top bus tour soon.",
      "Say what you want about their entire attacking ethos centering around set-pieces, or everyone at the club being willing to sacrifice friends and family members for the mere chance at keeping a clean sheet. But this is surely a side designed to excel in knockout football once Viktor Gyokeres gets up to speed – if indeed the pub striker ever will.",
      "",
      "3) Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace will reign in Europe\nUEFA would be obliged to change the Super Cup regulations – presumably without sending any correspondence to Selhurst Park – so that the Europa League and Conference League winners would compete in a blood feud as the Champions League winners step aside.",
      "But after watching Premier League sides go deep or even win either competition in recent years, there is a sense that things might work out in the end for both teams.",
      "If Spurs can win the Europa League then Forest are absolutely capable out of sheer Morgan Gibbs-White-based spite, while Glasner has already delivered continental glory to Eintracht Frankfurt so can help continue the proud Premier League tradition of bullying teams they have a laughable financial advantage over.",
      "",
      "2) There will be an England bolter\nTake your pick from the expensive uncapped Englishmen capable of snatching the spotlight who have been signed this summer alone: Jamie Gittens, Jacob Ramsey, Omari Hutchinson, Jarell Quansah, Liam Delap, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, James Trafford.",
      "Then there is Elliot Anderson and Archie Gray, who could easily time their pushes perfectly to catch the eye of Thomas Tuchel.",
      "It wouldn’t be an international tournament season without an England bolter and the options this time around are plentiful.",
      "",
      "1) The Big Six is the top six\nIt is a common misconception and refrain that the branding of the Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs cabal is not reflective of the actual league table.",
      "The fact is it was never meant to be: those are simply the richest Premier League teams in a football sense. Their owners are not necessarily the most wealthy but the clubs themselves are more marketable than the rest in the country by an absurd margin and so can pay the highest transfer fees and wages with less pressure on sales.",
      "It is why talk of there being a Big Eight with Newcastle or Aston Villa included is nonsense, similar to suggestions that the Big Six are no longer a thing when one or even multiple members endure historically poor seasons. Manchester United and Spurs responded by just signing everyone else’s best players because they could.",
      "And they looked better for it. Manchester United leapt over a hilariously low bar against Arsenal, granted, and Spurs passed the test of playing a promoted Scott Parker side at home. But the improvements were clear and fuelled at least in part by weakening many of their rivals this summer.",
      "The so-called Big Six has been the top six in some order or other on precisely six occasions: 2010/11, 2014/15, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19 and 2021/22. This will be lucky number seven.",
      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’.",
      "Suggesting that Newcastle are the wronged party in the Alexander Isak affair has Liverpool fans feeling aggrieved to be portrayed as the villains…",
      "Alexander Isak went for the nuclear option – but it seems to have had little immediate effect. Elsewhere, what will Yoane Wissa do now Brentford have rejected another Newcastle bid?",
      "Alexander Isak has behaved pretty ‘pathetically’ according to pretty much everybody but Liverpool fans.",
      "Curse you Liverpool and curse you Alexander Isak for making us feel sorry for Newcastle United. They have done nothing wrong in this.",
      "Newcastle United have apparently behaved appallingly by trying to keep hold of their best player; just give in to Liverpool, guys."

      "The 27-year-old criticised the way United was being run, accusing them of being in a transition without ever actually making a change.",
      "“You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time: they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles. Whereas at times I feel like United have just been … we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary.",

      "And that’s the bottom line\nAnd so it came to pass on the opening day that anyone with half a brain could have told you would happen.",
      "A marginally better Manchester United – mainly down to their new forwards – still losing a football match.",
      "The bottom line is this. It’s pointless buying lovely new furniture from IKEA if your foundations are still wobbly and the roof is still leaking.",
      "Behind the three shiny new toys up front remain the same old problems. Really crap goalkeepers. Slow, cumbersome centre backs (they didn’t really get tested by Arsenal yesterday, but they will soon enough). A disjointed central midfield into which they have to shoehorn Bruno (not his best position) alongside the knackered Casemiro or the frankly really bad Ugarte.",
      "Here’s how it’s going to go. Amorim will be gone by November. Then, United being United, despite spending 9 months buying players for his silly 3-4-3, will appoint a 4-2-3-1 coach. Who will then inform Jason Wilcox that he needs a keeper, his centre backs are only fit for a back 3, and he needs full backs not wing backs. More churn will ensure. And off we go again, rubbernecking at the latest car crash.",
      "It’ll never not be funny.\nAndy H, Swansea.",
      "",
      "All about Arsenal\nI was listening to the radio for some build up before the Man U v Arsenal match and someone mentioned that once the opening day fixtures were set then it was inevitable that the biggest headline will be generated from this match – with a bit of an assumption that there was a winner and loser to the match rather than a draw.",
      "It was a very agreeable point.  What I didn’t expect is for Arsenal to win AND be the team that faced an absolute mountain of criticism.  Man U meanwhile getting plenty of plaudits for showing signs of improvement.",
      "Of course an element of this shows where the expectations stand for each side this season but come on, its been a bit over the top right?  Man U with their reshaped attack will clearly not be as toothless as they were last season and so will give most sides a damn good game at home.  Arsenal had by far the hardest opening day fixture of all the big teams and went and won ugly and got the 3 points.",
      "If you offered Liverpool, City and Chelsea that same result delivered in the same fashion they’d snap your hand off right now.  I can say with some certainty that fans of those 3 clubs (plus others) will have watched that game thinking it was a real chance for early dropped points from a potential title rival.",
      "It feels like Arsenal more than any team in the league is going to drive headlines, agendas and narratives more than ever this season. Gyokeres is the most scrutinised and under pressure player in the league before a ball was kicked despite plenty of more expensive players and strikers being signed by other teams,  and every Arsenal result will be followed by a ridiculous over reaction swaying to the negative as much as possible.  I understand some sections of Arsenal fans are also prone to this boom or bust emotive responses to each result but you’d hope for more balance in the media.",
      "I find the narrative around Arsenal and Arteta strange.  There is a lot of talk about how Arsenal MUST win the title or champions league this season, despite not winning the former for 24 years and never winning the later.  Why is it only Arsenal who MUST win it – surely the same must apply to Liverpool and City in the context of a failed or successful season?  Some people say Arteta MUST be sacked if he doesn’t win it – its such a weird stance to take without applying any context (or any knowledge of how the Arsenal board traditionally treat their managers – stability overides dreaming and ambition).  What if Arteta did a Klopp and got 97 points but finished 2nd – is that worthy of the sack?",
      "Finally, those who talk about the two things above will often happily talk about the plethora of flaws in this Arsenal team.  Too reliant on set pieces, don’t score enough goals, lack creativity, don’t have a killer goalscorer, poor on transitions, play sideways football, no superstars to win games on their own, etc etc.  So a long list of reasons why Arsenal will fall short and are not as good as Liverpool or City but also they MUST win the title.  Talk about having your cake and eating it.",
      "The season is 1 game old and Arsenal have won a very tough game whilst not being anywhere near their best, not everything needs to provoke such extreme and often negative reactions that a lot of people seem to fall in to with Arsenal more than anyone else.\nRich, AFC",
      "",
      "It all began with the set-pieces\nIt’s hard to believe it is the same manager that was in charge of Arsenal in 2022/23 season. Without the early season expectation of a title challenge, Arteta masterminded some of the best attacking display in the premier league, certainly the best of his own career.",
      "But since then it seems he’s crumbled under the pressure of actually being considered a contender. He’s become more pragmatic and dull every subsequent season, stockpiling big burly defenders and relying heavily on set-pieces.",
      "Ah. Set-pieces. The exploitation and subsequent reliance on it has become the beginning and apparently the end of Arsenal’s attacking creativity. Arsenal’s set-pieces, initially the clever aside, the unexpected dagger from the shadows, have become the entire arsenal (pun intended). What began as a complement, a glimmer of ingenuity, now stands exposed as the only idea, leaving the rest of the attack muted, meek and mechanical.",
      "And you can feel it in the players. The thrill is unmistakable — the flicker of excitement, and perhaps more worryingly, the sigh of relief, when they’ve won a corner. Watch them: the way they jostle for positions in the various needlessly elaborate routines. The training ground has become a theatre for the mastery of set-pieces, endless hours spent perfecting patterns that mask the withering of invention elsewhere. Why strain to carve an opening against opponents who are not utterly hapless, when the shortcut is so simple — a well-struck delivery to the big lads waiting in the box?",
      "And it’s not confined to the players. The set-piece coach now struts into the limelight, basking in the role of architect, eager to collect his applause for another blueprint executed to the letter.",
      "And it works — wildly so. The numbers speak for themselves, and the goals have flowed from corners and free-kicks in recent years. Yet the truth gnaws at the edges: it isn’t enough. It was never going to be.",
      "Because when the smoke clears, when the scraps are tallied, Arsenal’s reliance on dead-ball ingenuity exposes a deeper, more troubling stagnation. Their chief creator, Ødegaard, once the conductor, now looks dulled, his artistry blunted by the straightjacket of Arteta’s rigid design. What was once improvisation and daring has congealed into repetition and habit.",
      "If Arsenal are to make the final leap — from contenders to champions, from hopefuls to holders — they cannot climb there on corners alone. Arteta, too, must evolve, must rediscover the courage to let his side breathe and create in open play.",
      "If the football does not grow sharper, braver, more alive, the dream of a league title will remain just that — a dream, slipping further away with every set-piece celebrated like salvation. And the only thing truly set in stone will be the manager’s fate.\nAYK",

      "I need to do the job that the FAILING FAKE NEWS MEDIA will not do, and push back against the Trumpian stream of lies and misinformation emanating from the Cult sheep that worship at that altar of Antonio El Pulizon aka “Arteta Fanboys”. Here is a sample of the demented Trumpian lies and bullshit that the unhinged “MAKE ARTETA GREAT AGAIN” loons are flooding you with.",
      "Exhibit A: Outright lies and misinformation from Rob AFC:\n“ Arteta is on 10m not 15m”",
      "Factually incorrect. 365 literally have an article breaking down salaries, which is backed up by various sources. You’ll see clearly that Arteta is on £15.6m a year – Google AI also confirms the exact same figure of £15.6m. So the question is: why are Arsenal fans lying? 🤔",
      "Exhibit B: Demented unhinged nonsense from John Matrix AFC",
      "“ There is a reason why Chelsea, Liverpool, City, United and Spurs fans keep heaping pressure on Arteta to win, and that’s because none of those teams have beaten us in like 800 days”",
      "Yes. Nothing to do with El Pulizon being paid insane wages for failure, nothing to do with the perpetual arrogance and egotism of a delusional fanbase that continues to insert themselves and Arteta into “elite” conversation (despite having less PL pedigree than Championship Leicester over the past 20 years!) Indeed, fans of Liverpool must be incandescent with that paltry PL title, Chelsea with their club World Cup, and Citeh with their 4 PL titles in the past 5 years, whilst Arsenal and Paella Pulis have been a punchline eh! 😂. Not being able to clap back at even Newcastle and Palace in fact is shameful and a humiliation.",
      "In fact… I’m sure even the Spurs fans spend every waking hour wishing they’d beaten Arsenal in a meaningless PL fixture, instead of that European trophy they just lifted. This exposes the difference in mentalities: other clubs focus on actual trophies, Arsenal fans simply invent parallel reality trophies (“the unbeaten v Big Six” Trophy being the latest). Remember what El Fraudo said: “Arsenal have more points than any team over the last three years” their dear Leader told the sheeple. And the MAGA loons swallowed the lie. whole! Not one of them has yet been able to explain this outright lie. Weird eh?",
      "Exhibit C: pure unhinged imbecility, Tom in Leyton",

      "The most amusing Trumpian display of rank stupidity I’ve read of late. It’s Alan Partridge-esque. All that’s missing is for lil Trash-talkin Tom to sign off with “THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER” 😂",
      "Really simple one this: opinions are subjective debatable points, based on an individual’s personal worldview. Hence why eg newspapers have “opinion” sections. An individual is free to supplement that opinion with facts (eg it is my opinion that Arteta is an overpaid fraud, supplemented by evidence of a €1bn + spend, zero PLs, zero CLs, zero trophies in five years, spanked by first season Slot etc).",
      "The onus to supplement a viewpoint with hard evidence is incumbent when that point of view is presented as Fact – not an opinion 🙄🙄",
      "So, for instance, when your Dear Leader flagrantly lies in a press conference and says “Arsenal have more points than any team over the last three years”, this is a statement of Fact – and it should be backed up with hard evidence. Same as claiming “Luis Enrique told us we were the better team” – another lie, laid bare by Enrique contradicting it immediately. That factual clarification never happened because Arteta is a fraud who is telling lies to cover for his ineptitude. Utterly demented these AFC fans LOL",
      "Exhibit D: rank shameless Trumpian hypocrisy – Damola in Bremen",
      "“ We will never apologise to you for the way we play”",
      "How interesting a take this is, given the years of sanctimonious bollocks we heard from Arsenal fans about Mourinho “anti-football” and “I would never want to win playing such a brand of dour football after all the money spent”. Reminds me of when MSNBC takes a months-old clip of a Trump sycophant making excoriating statements on Biden “It’s a disgrace Biden would ever have discussions with Putin”…and then show you that exact same boot-licker hypocritically making the opposite point, months later “President Trump is a hero for hosting Putin” 😂😂😂",
      "It’s like claiming you “cannot compete with Citeh oil money” as your same fans put Liverpool as preseason title favourites. How does that square? Aaaah cognitive dissonance!",
      "I repeat: what do you call spending over €1bn to bore the living shit out of the football populace and win sod all? Least Mourinho won!",

Obviously gambling ads all over the place too, because of course. I didn’t see any of Redknapp’s Skechers advertised on there, Werthers, or a Jane McDonald album, but I may have missed those.",

      "*For all that Chelsea fans were understandably excited to see their expensive new signings, they were kept relatively quiet by a Crystal Palace team that finished last season so strongly. I think it’s good that Trevoh Chalobah is still getting regularly opportunities to start for Chelsea, plenty of us feared the worst for his progress when he was recalled from his Palace loan spell last season but he’s played well, and played a big part in keeping Jean-Philippe Mateta relatively quiet this weekend.",
      "*Eberechi Eze’s free kick goal was correctly ruled out, but it was still an understandable source of frustration. Palace were correctly punished for Marc Guehi being too close to the defensive wall when the ball was struck, but all that did was highlight how often teams are not punished for the same infringement. Still, the easiest way to not be penalised for something is to not do it in the first place.",
      "*Eze and Guehi’s futures at Palace have been the subject of a lot of speculation recently, as tends to happen with standout players outside of the biggest clubs. It’s to their credit that they didn’t seem to let any of it affect their performances. At least we’ve been largely spared the use of body language experts this time. Oliver Glasner casually mentioning after the match that Eze’s release clause had expired was a fun moment, and should Arsenal miss out on signing Eze, it’ll only serve them right.",
      "*One thing Arsenal can take comfort from is something Glasner said about his signings last summer. Palace made a slow start in part because their signings took a while to get up to speed. He mainly meant this about Ismaila Sarr, but it also applies to Eddie Nketiah, appropriately enough for Arsenal. As soon as it became apparent there was interest from Palace in signing those players, they were ostracised from the first team so as not to taint the atmosphere and as a result missed a lot of preseason. It is entirely possible that Sporting took similar action with Viktor Gyokeres, which perhaps explains why he was so far below expectations against Manchester United.",
      "*Ben Doak to Bournemouth looks set to go ahead for relatively big money. Unlike Jordon Ibe or Dominic Solanke, he won’t be their record signing (never break your transfer record to sign a Liverpool player), so he should do well for them.",

      "Old Trafford is a difficult place to go, especially on the opening weekend, but Arsenal found a way to win.",
      "They will need to improve because it wasn't the greatest of displays. They had to rely on a set piece again, but they got their goal, and the defence was rock solid. They got themselves over the line for a vital three points, especially with the game against Liverpool coming up soon.",
      "It was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.",
      "But advantage Arsenal. The way I see it now is Liverpool and Man City have to go to Old Trafford to win to match Arsenal, and that's a huge positive at such an early stage of the season.",
      "Special mention for Martin Odegaard. I thought he was back to his best.",
      "There were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.",
      "If he can maintain those levels that is a big plus for Arsenal.",
      "No-one has really even mentioned Man City in the build up to the season.",
      "It's like no-one knew what to expect from Pep Guardiola and his side, but they really impressed me. It's like we forgot how good they can be because of how bad they were last season. People are starting to take notice now, however.",
      "The win at Wolves was a warning to the other sides wanting to win the title.",
      "I know it wasn't the hardest game in Wolves, but winning away from home 4-0 on the opening day of the Premier League is no mean feat.",

      "He needs some support. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.",
      "But he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.",
      "It's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.",
      "It's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.",
      "You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.",
      "I'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.",
      "That was a must-win game against Burnley. I expected it to be a bit tighter so credit to Spurs for that, but it would have been a shock had they not got all three points at the weekend.",

      "People were going mad about the PSG performance but there's still a long way to go for Spurs.",

      "You don't need to be Albert Einstein to work out how to play against PSG. You need as many defenders as you can on the pitch. Then, against Burnley, you need as many attackers on the pitch as you can to keep causing them problems.",

      "INCIDENT: Eberechi Eze free kick disallowed by VAR after Marc Guehi interfered with the wall.",

      "Where they set up, Guehi initially is not deemed to be in the wall, he's between two players to the right of the wall, but as the ball is kicked, Guehi's movement is towards Caicedo and without doubt, he's not a metre from it.",
      "The IFAB Laws of the Game for 2025/26 state: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\n\n\n\"If, when a free-kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from a 'wall' formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free-kick is awarded.\"",

      "Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.",
      "City have an unbelievable spine.",
      "I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.",
      "Jamie Carragher - Liverpool, ahead of Man City",
      "What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.",
      "A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.",
      "I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.",
      "Neville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd",
      "I've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!",
      "It was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.",
      "And I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.",
      "Carragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "I think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.",
      "Neville - Nottingham Forest",
      "For Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.",
      "Neville - Leeds, Burnley, Wolves",
      "Brentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…",
      "Carragher - Wolves, Sunderland, Burnley",
      "It's easy to put the three promoted teams there. I'm desperate for someone to stay up. I don't want to be talking about the three [promoted] teams going down. I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.",
      "Neville - Brentford",
      "It will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.",
      "Carragher - West Ham",
      "It wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.",
      "Carragher - Erling Haaland",
      "Mohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.",
      "Neville - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "I thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.",
      "He's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.",
      "Carragher - Florian Wirtz",
      "It's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.",
      "Carragher - Estevao",
      "He's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake. He's still a young player and isn't the finished article but he was one of them where you think, it won't be too long before he's first choice.",
      "Neville - Adrien Truffert",
      "I was watching Liverpool vs Bournemouth on Friday night - if you were looking at a left-back on the pitch that was the best one, it was the one wearing the Bournemouth shirt. Milos Kerkez looked like he was a little bit rash. His first game at Anfield, so you have to give him time to settle in. Truffert was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off him.",
      "Neville - Ruben Amorim",
      "There's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure.

      "United's new-look attack - consisting of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - impressed throughout the fixture as Amorim's side played with a fresh impetus going forward.",
      "The hosts unleashed a total of 22 shots towards the Arsenal goal, with nine of these coming from Mbeumo and Cunha, as well as two from fellow new arrival Benjamin Sesko off the bench.",

      "​​​​​​​In the aftermath of the defeat, Amorim chose to focus on the positives from the performance, where he applauded their improved bravery and aggression in comparison to last season.",
      "\"Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home.",
      "\"We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.",
      "\"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.",

      "\"The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary [Neville] said on commentary, everyone is OK with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better,\" Keane said on Super Sunday.",

      "\"We know that performance isn't enough sometimes. Arsenal have got real resilience and can grind out 1-0 victories.",
      "\"There were some positives. Mbeumo in the first half and Cunha in the second half. They showed they can handle a big game at Old Trafford, they showed they have got the quality and ability. We obviously know that from Wolves.",
      "\"This is a tough start. Arsenal are a tough team to break down. I'm not too downhearted. I thought the system worked better and the back three did better.",

      "Arsenal clinched a 1-0 win over Man Utd at Old Trafford thanks to Riccardo Calafiori's goal from a corner but the performance also highlighted the key areas for improvement this season; Viktor Gyokeres struggled to make an impact on his debut",
      "Sunday 17 August 2025 21:07, UK",
      "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.",
      "They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.",
      "No other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.",
      "They are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.",
      "Even finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.",
      "They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "Their experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.",
      "\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"",
      "The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.",
      "The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.",
      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "Monday 18 August 2025 15:56, UK",

      "Despite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.",
      "The game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.",
      "On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.",
      "\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.",
      "\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.",
      "\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.",
      "\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.",
      "\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"",
      "Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.",
      "\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.",
      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",
      "More from Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim on Arsenal's winning goal:\n\n\n“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.\n\n\n“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed so he cannot defend it.\n\n\n“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…",
      "\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"",
      "\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: \"If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.",
      "\"I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…\"",
      "That prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.",
      "\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.",
      "\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"",
      "Keane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",
