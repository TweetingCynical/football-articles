      "Adam Wharton will want to play Champions League football in the near future as he continues to excel for Crystal Palace - as their chairman Steve Parish sounds a warning to interested parties.",
      "Wharton has enjoyed a meteoric rise since he joined the Eagles for £22m in January 2024 from Blackburn Rovers. The 21-year-old has proved himself as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and is now tipped as an England regular for the next decade.",
      "He already boasts an FA Cup and the Community Shield on his CV with Palace enjoying one of the most successful periods in their history - which has seen reports claim Manchester United are considering making a £60million bid next summer for Wharton.",
      "Those at Old Trafford were looking to add a midfielder in the summer, leading to their interest in Brighton's Carlos Baleba, but failed to get a player through the door. They're now linked with Wharton as they look to revive their fortunes.",
      "But Parish has laid down the law to anyone who wants Wharton, insisting he wants to play at the top table of European football, something the Eagles may struggle to provide, but United are equally miles off being able to offer that.",
      "He told talkSPORT: “I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club. He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "“He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had that a lot of young players get. I think this season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday. It's a difficult programme for us right now. I think he's very committed to the club. I don't know where all this stuff comes from.\"",
      "Palace have had to deal with the loss of a key player in each of the last two summers. Michael Olise left for Bayern Munich in 2024 and Eberechi Eze joined Arsenal in the summer. There is now talk of Marc Guehi leaving once his contract expires next summer.",
      "Parish though is confident that Wharton, who has more than two years left on his deal, has no desire to leave with the club in a strong position. He said: \"There's no pressure on us to do it, and I don't think there's any real pressure from the player either.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The international break has done little to quell the speculation surrounding Ruben Amorim's future at Manchester United. That's in the wake of reports suggesting club bosses have been in discussions with key players to gauge the current mood within the squad.",
      "Amorim, 40, is fast approaching his first year anniversary at Old Trafford, having taken over from Erik ten Hag in November 2024. However, after guiding the team to a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season, progress has been slower than many had hoped.",
      "United hit another low this season when they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town. With Amorim's men still yet to secure their first away win of the campaign, club chiefs have turned to certain players for their take on how things are progressing.",
      "This situation echoes the circumstances that led to a marathon seven-hour meeting between Ten Hag and his former superiors this time last year. And it wasn't long after the tactician was sacked from his role.",
      "Co-owner Joel Glazer, chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox all convened at Ratcliffe's Knightsbridge offices in London to discuss the state of the club. Board member Jean-Claude Blanc, chief operating officer Collette Roche and chief financial officer Roger Bell were also understood to have been part of the summit.",
      "Ten Hag survived just three weeks following that lengthy meeting. And it may not be long before United's top brass are forced to convene once again as issues on the pitch continue to pile up.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox are understood to be leading recent discussions between the club's hierarchy and the playing squad. Captain Bruno Fernandes is among those who have been consulted, while other opinions have also been sought.",
      "It has been suggested the conversations were casual in nature and not necessarily designed to evaluate Amorim's standing at the club as such. Nevertheless, it is not the sort of activity one would normally witness at a club where everything is functioning seamlessly.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has repeatedly been compelled to field questions regarding the manager's future. The Ineos billionaire has defended his head coach, indicating he expects the Portuguese boss to remain at the club for the foreseeable future.",
      "\"He has not had the best of seasons,\" Ratcliffe said on the debut episode of The Business Podcast after describing Amorim as a decent bloke. \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be [on the topic of sacking Amorim].\"",
      "The remarks arrived amid growing anger from supporters about how the club is being operated. The Glazer family's stewardship of United has remained a significant source of frustration for fans, and Ratcliffe has found it difficult to shift sentiment since acquiring nearly 30% of the club and assuming control of daily operations last year.",
      "Oliver Glasner, Eddie Howe, Gareth Southgate and Diego Simeone are among the managers who have been mentioned in connection with the United position recently. Yet it seems the current boss is staying put for now.",
      "Despite overseeing 50 Premier League matches, United's boss Amorim is yet to secure back-to-back victories in the competition. The Red Devils have enjoyed a winning streak at home and beat Sunderland 2-0 just prior to the international break but their away performance continues to be a major worry.",
      "Currently positioned 10th in the league and two points shy of the top six, United face a daunting run of fixtures. Over the next month, they'll be squaring off against threats like Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Neville has been backed to manage Manchester United by one of his former Valencia stars. The former Red Devils defender took one ill-advised venture into management back in 2015 as he took the reins with the Spanish side.",
      "But it turned into a disastrous spell as he was sacked after just 28 games. During his time at the Mestalla, he won just three league games.",
      "Despite that, former Valencia and Manchester City star Alvaro Negredo believes the 50-year-old could be a good candidate for the Old Trafford hotseat given the ongoing crisis under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Speaking to Coin Poker, the former Spanish striker said: “It also depends on the situation at Manchester United. I think he was a very important player for Manchester United. He's a player who gave a lot to English football.",
      "“Perhaps, similar to Valencia at that time, it’s a United team who haven't been consistently at the top for a long time, and perhaps now wouldn't be the best moment.",
      "“But it is also true that changes come when the team is not in a good moment. I would try him, because, as I say, as a coach, I did like him.”",
      "Negredo has admitted he thought Neville would be back in a dugout a lot sooner. He added: \"Yes, it surprises me because I considered him capable and qualified.",
      "“Perhaps in Spain at that time, due to the language barrier, he didn't get more opportunities, but in the Premier League, I would have given him more, based on my experience. For me, he was a good coach who, as I said, came with a very good attitude and a desire to improve.",
      "“He had been a player, so he also possesses knowledge of the football world. These are decisions that perhaps he didn't want to continue experiencing, and he hasn't had the opportunity to continue coaching.\"",
      "It remains to be seen if Neville’s next role in management comes at Old Trafford or not. But as it stands, United are sticking by Amorim despite the club’s woeful start to the campaign.",
      "United currently sit tenth in the table after winning just three of their opening seven games of the campaign. Amorim’s side are next back in action next weekend as they take on fierce rivals Liverpool at Anfield.",

      "Barcelona already want to make Marcus Rashford's loan from Manchester United into a permanent deal. The England international has impressed for the Catalan side in his early weeks with the club and the La Liga giants cannot believe their luck.",
      "Rashford, 27, is said to be available to Barca for £30million at the end of the season. The option to sign him permanently is available for £25m, plus a further £5m in add-ons, with United also holding a share of any future sell-on fee.",
      "Barcelona have been pleasantly surprised by Rashford's quick start, after they had a degree of hesitation over completing a deal. While the club had its own financial issues as an initial barrier, there was an element of distrust over why the Red Devils were willing to let him go.",
      "Barca chiefs initially feared there could be something wrong with the star forward, but Rashford's representative, his brother Dwaine, convinced them that the United academy product would not mess them around, according to reports. The Spanish side now believes they have a bargain available to them.",
      "Rashford has bagged three goals and five assists in his ten appearances, despite not adding a goal contribution in the first three of those outings. The forward has more goals and assists than any of his team-mates so far this term.",
      "And Rashford appears equally as enamoured with Barca, as the club is with him. The goalscorer only has eyes for extending his stay despite interest from the likes of Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "\"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can.\"",
      "After an impressive display against Newcastle United in the Champions League, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick was effusive in his praise. \"I am not surprised [by his goals],\" Flick said.",
      "\"I think he's a fantastic player. His skills are unbelievable and his finishing is unbelievable. I think also in the first half, he tried to create chances, but the finishing wasn't there. In the second half it was.",
      "\"For a striker, it's always good to score. I am really happy. He is an important player. When we spoke before the season about what we needed in the team, we felt we needed a player like him. When we had this chance [to sign him], I said we have to do it. He's an outstanding player.\"",

      "Senne Lammens has boosted the confidence of the Manchester United dressing room after just one match, according to former defender Wes Brown. At the beginning of the summer transfer window, previous first-choice goalkeeper Andre Onana was reassured that he remained part of the plans at Old Trafford.",
      "However, an injury kept him out of the pre-season tour of the USA with deputy Altay Bayindir taking on the reins. Even after recovering, Onana was still overlooked until his nightmare appearance against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "The Cameroon international was arguably at fault for both of the League Two club's goals while the penalty shootout failed to redeem him. After that appearance in North Lincolnshire, the writing was on the wall for Onana.",
      "On deadline day, Ruben Amorim chose to take a punt on Royal Antwerp 'keeper Lammens and shortly after the window closed, Onana moved to Trabzonspor for the season. While his time at United will not officially end at the culmination of this campaign, those with inside knowledge of the situation believe that Onana is as good as done at Old Trafford.",
      "Therefore, the weight of expectation now rests with Lammens. Immediately following Onana's exit, Bayindir was kept between the sticks.",
      "But, a poor display against Brentford was enough for Amorim to call upon Lammens. Despite being just 23, the Belgian managed to rise to the pressure against Sunderland.",
      "He was competent and made a couple of decent saves to ensure it was a relatively relaxed afternoon for the United fans and defence. Speaking to 10bet Casino, Brown believes that Lammens, after just one match, has already impacted the Reds' dressing room for the better.",
      "\"I think there were a couple of positive things. First of all, and maybe the most important, was Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper,\" he explained.",
      "\"He gave a very confident display, and I think that gives encouragement to the rest of the team. We had more consistency and what I mean by that is the defence was solid, and the keeper was solid.",
      "\"We were creating chances, and obviously we got two goals out of that. And you just want to see smiles on faces.",
      "\"When you're playing football, when you're scoring goals, defending well, it gives you a big smile. I think going into the next game, the confidence obviously against Liverpool will be at a good state and you have to try and take it into the game.",
      "\"But, consistency is the big thing for us at the moment. You know, one game we play well, one game we play bad and somehow we've got to change that.",
      "\"We know how well we can play in certain games, but we've not been able to take that into the next game. So the mentality, hopefully having the confidence from the Sunderland result gets the lads fired up for the Liverpool game after the international break.\"",
      "As Brown alluded to, Lammens' next test is arguably one of the biggest a United player can have - a trip to Anfield. In recent years, clashes with Liverpool have been difficult for United fans to stomach.",
      "They have only won two of their last ten against their bitter rivals. United's last victory was the 4-3 thriller in the FA Cup at Old Trafford where Amad wrote himself into the history books.",
      "Incredibly, United's last victory at Anfield came all the way back in 2016. Back then, Louis van Gaal was still in charge and Wayne Rooney scored the winner.",
      "Fortunately for Amorim, he will take confidence from their last visit to Anfield where they so nearly took all three points against the runaway leaders. But if they are to manage that next weekend, they will need Lammens to be on top form.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Zilliacus and his XXI Century Capital launched a bid for United in 2023 when the Glazer family made it clear they would consider offers. He rivalled the likes of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim.",
      "But this bid came too late and it was Ratcliffe's Ineos that secured a nearly 30 per cent stake in the club. New rumours suggest that United could be taken over with whispers of a bid from the UAE and \"advanced negotiations\" being reached.",
      "He said: \"I mean under Sir Jim Ratcliffe it hasn't been a roaring success. I don't think anybody could claim that. So no criticism of him. I'm sure he has done the best he can. But unfortunately, in my opinion, there have been some poor choices regarding players. The new manager, it is maybe a bit early yet to say whether he can turn the ship around.",
      "\"It's not, of course, just the manager but the squad that he has… A lot of money has been put into the club and we still haven't seen the results. I think that also reminds us of another very important thing, that this is a team.\"",
      "The Finnish former Nokia chief then elaborated on which areas of the side he would improve were he to be handed any control. He specifically played down the signing of superstars.",
      "\"I mean, football is at the end of the day a pretty simple game,\" Zilliacus continued. \"It's about scoring more goals than you let in. You need to have a good attack, you need to have a good defence and in between that you need to have a good midfield.",
      "\"I think that I would honestly look at all parts of the team, I think that while there are some very good players, there is always room for improvement. But it is not about going out and buying the biggest star that is around.",
      "\"A good example, although he's already over the hill, is Neymar. Even at his peak, I would never have brought a player like Neymar to Manchester United because that's a player who expects everybody else to play for him.",
      "\"I would build a club very much on the basis of young, strong players who already have proven that they are really good top-class, but who still have a hunger to prove themselves in order to go even further.",
      "\"That should be the backbone of the team. Then you can have a few experienced guys in the gel as well. I think it's always good to have a mix because the more mature guys, the more experienced guys, they also know how to act when things don't go well.\"",
      "While he would have passed on Neymar in his prime, Zilliacus did name one player who he thinks fits the sort of character he admires. That star is Ousmane Dembele, who once cost Barcelona £125m.",
      "\"Look at PSG. Ousmane Dembele is such a perfect example,\" he added. \"Barcelona were pretty happy to see him go. Now he's got the Ballon d'Or and he's the star player in a team where he is allowed to play the way he should. But I also think the manager has managed to get him to understand that if he wants to be a star, he has to work. And now he's doing it.\"",

Since under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim secured a crucial win over Sunderland to take United within six points of the Premier League summit, takeover talk has surprisingly resurfaced thanks to Saudi Arabia sports mogul Turki Al-Sheikh.",
      "The chairman of the country’s General Entertainment Authority sparked speculation with a social media post regarding a possible investment. While it is believed the Glazers could consider a full sale for £5bn, club insiders were said to be taken aback by Al-Sheikh’s declaration.",

      "Thoughts will soon return to matters on the pitch and the not-so-small matter of a trip to Liverpool next Sunday, when Amorim will aim to secure back-to-back wins for the first time as United boss. But there is also one eye on the future, with defenders at the opposite ends of their careers in the spotlight...",
      "Harry Maguire could reject a mega-money offer from Saudi Arabia to extend his United career. The defender, whose Old Trafford contract is up at the end of the season, has been linked with Al-Ettifaq and Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr, who are prepared to offer him in the region of £500,000 a week.",
      "It’s an opportunity the 33-year-old has been seriously considering as he approaches the end of his career, given United have been cool on offering him a new deal. But the Red Devils are considering offering Maguire a final contract after all, with talks to take place over the next few weeks.",

United's target became one of Blackburn's top stars before joining Crystal Palace from the Lancashire club for £18m in February 2024. Wharton quickly settled into the Premier League and earned a spot in Gareth Southgate's squad for the Euros that summer.",
      "And the midfield ace has earned an integral role under Oliver Glasner at Palace as they earned FA Cup success and qualified for European football. Wharton's reputation only continues to grow.",
      "United opted to spend £200m on their forward line this summer, adding Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to their squad in an attempt to solve their goalscoring woes. And now early work is being planned to tempt Palace into letting go their most promising star, after he was already linked to a move in August.",
      "The Eagles have proven willing to part ways with their top talent for the correct price. Over the summer, they sold Eberechi Eze to Arsenal in a £67.5m deal , while Michael Olise departed for Bayern Munich 12 months before.",
      "Amorim could find himself short a midfielder before the end of the season. Napoli are confident of landing Mainoo, who like Wharton enjoyed a meteoric rise for a place at Euro 2024, on loan in January.",

      "Harry Maguire is ready to snub a £500k-a-week deal to move to Saudi Arabia to stay at Manchester United - if they offer him a new contract.",
      "Maguire is out of contract in June and, as revealed last week, has become a target of Saudi outfits Al-Nassr and Al-Ettifaq.",
      "The veteran England defender will be free to open talks with clubs in January, and a move to the Middle East could see him land a mega-money contract as he enters the twilight of his career. Maguire turns 33 in March.",
      "There is a temptation on the player's part to cash in on what would be the last lucrative move of his career - particularly if United stick by their decision to look to the future and don't offer him a new contract. They took up the option in Maguire's current contract last summer, something he, ultimately, didn't have a choice in.",
      "But new suggestions are that United are indeed considering handing the defender a contract extension. Talks will take place in the coming weeks, but Maguire will want assurances the deal is right for him.",
      "Maguire knows joining the Saudi Pro-League would damage his chances of extending his England career, whether that's under Thomas Tuchel - if he continues after next summer - or a new boss.",
      "And if he pledges his future to United, he wants to know he will remain an integral pat of the club's plans, whoever is the manager.",
      "In an ideal world, Maguire would be willing to see out the rest of his career at Old Trafford. But he is mindful the next deal he signs will be the last major one of his career, and the terms would have to be right.",

      "A comprehensive report from The Athletic supports the notion that a complete takeover is unlikely until after 2026.",
      "This is due to the current share prices for a stake in United, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe having paid $33 per share and a 'drag-along rights' mechanism being triggered 18 months after his purchase.",

      "However, after this date, the Glazers can accept any offer, potentially resulting in the Ineos chief losing millions.",
      "Given these circumstances, it's more probable that any potential investors will hold off until after this date to pay less, as the price per share will be significantly lower.",

However, Rashford is focused on playing well enough to secure a permanent move to Barcelona next summer, as it was his dream to play for the Catalan club when he left Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has admitted that he needs to 'study better' after his woes from the penalty spot this season. Fernandes, 31, has taken three penalties since the new Premier League campaign began but he's only scored one.",
      "That was a stoppage-time winner against Burnley to seal a 3-2 win that some believe saved Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim's job. But the week before during the 1-1 draw at Fulham, Fernandes blazed his spot-kick over the bar, having bumped into the referee during his preparation.",
      "Last month, Fernandes had the chance to level the scores in United's trip to Brentford. But his effort was saved by Caoimhin Kelleher, as the Red Devils suffered a 3-1 defeat.",
      "Fernandes is set to come up against Kelleher on Saturday when Portugal take on the Republic of Ireland in World Cup qualifying. The midfielder was asked about his penalty record in a press conference and replied: \"This season, out of three, I ended up missing two.",
      "\"I don't want to miss any of them. It's something I need to study better. I'll always do it with full conviction because there's a coach who trusts me.\"",
      "Although he's unlikely to take a penalty against Kelleher, given that Cristiano Ronaldo is his team-mate for Portugal, Fernandes was asked about facing the Brentford goalkeeper once again. \"Every day is a good day to settle scores,\" the United star added.",
      "\"He was stronger. He did very well, and I didn't. But it's not something that affects my head. In a football team, there's something bigger than individuality. Winning is much more important than settling scores with the Irish goalkeeper.\"",
      "Fernandes was also quizzed on his future at Old Trafford. The 31-year-old was the subject of interest from Saudi Arabia in the summer transfer window, with Al-Hilal ready to launch a £100million bid and give Fernandes a contract worth £200m.",
      "He rejected their advances and stayed at United, where he's under contract until 2027. \"I didn't close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup,\" Fernandes affirmed.",
      "\"That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That's all there is to it.",
      "\"I like to enjoy the moment, and the most important thing for me now is representing the national team, because it's a source of enormous pride to be able to play tomorrow [Saturday], and I still don't know if I'll play, let alone if I'll leave Manchester United in a year. I'm happy where I am; otherwise, I wouldn't have stayed, but it's something that doesn't affect me.\"",

      "Former Premier League striker Matt Jansen has no regrets about turning down Manchester United on two separate occasions. Jansen was amongst English football's brightest prospects in the early 2000s and looked destined for the 2002 World Cup before Sven-Goran Eriksson made a late decision to take an additional defender, Martin Keown, instead.",
      "Later that summer, he sustained life-threatening injuries in a scooter accident while holidaying in Rome. Although he made a comeback to the game, Jansen was never quite the same player. He eventually dropped down the levels before transitioning into coaching, managing non-league Chorley before joining Stockport County, where he is now assistant first-team coach.",
      "During his playing days, Jansen turned down two chances to join Sir Alex Ferguson's dominant side. The first opportunity arose while he was at hometown club Carlisle, then under the ownership of Michael Knighton, the businessman who almost bought the Red Devils in the late 1980s.",
      "Jansen remembered being \"touted around\" alongside fellow prospect Rory Delap by Knighton and spent a week training with the Old Trafford club. He was then presented with a straightforward choice between United and Crystal Palace, opting for the Eagles as it guaranteed more first-team opportunities.",
      "\"My father gave Michael Knighton an ultimatum: give me a new contract or sell me,\" he said in association with Palentir Financial Planning.",
      "\"He came back to us and said the two biggest bids had come in from Palace and Manchester United, £1m plus add-ons. The decision was over to me.",
      "\"I'd just broken into the first team at Carlisle. I was loving the adulation and buzz from playing first-team football. I thought I'd have a better chance of continuing that at Palace, so opted for them over United.\"",
      "However, as Jansen's star rose in south London, Palace found themselves in dire straits both on and off the pitch. He was told he was crucial to the Eagles' survival when larger clubs, including United, showed interest.",
      "Jansen was advised that choosing Blackburn would be financially beneficial for the struggling club. He recalled: \"I loved playing in the Premier League for them but unfortunately we went down. The club then got sold. It was a whirlwind of an experience.",
      "\"Terry Venables came in [as manager], Mark Goldberg bought the club off Ron Noades. But the money dried up and I became an asset they needed to cash in on.",
      "\"I came in one morning and [manager] Steve Coppell said to me, 'You're not playing today, we've accepted a £5m bid from Juventus. I was like 'Wow!' I was buzzing with that. The next minute it was Chelsea, Newcastle, Arsenal and again Manchester United, all £5m bids. I had a choice to make.",
      "\"At the 11th hour, Blackburn came in. Jack Walker [Blackburn's owner] said he would pay £4.1m but he was going to pay it all up front. Palace told me it would have saved the club. I don't know if it would have saved the club or not, but they asked me if I would be willing to go there.\"",
      "At that point, Blackburn were a well-established Premier League outfit who had pipped United to the title just a few seasons prior. Jansen explained: \"Brian Kidd [Ferguson's long-time assistant at United] had become manager. I knew him from my week training at United.",
      "\"So to help Crystal Palace out, I opted to go to Blackburn, which I don't regret. I loved it there. Unfortunately, we got relegated and Brian got the sack. In came Graeme Souness. He steadied the ship and we got promoted.\"",
      "Jansen subsequently helped Blackburn to League Cup glory in 2002, netting the opener before setting up Andy Cole's winner in a 2-1 victory over Tottenham in Cardiff.",
      "Jansen harbours no regrets about rejecting United and passing up the opportunity to play under Ferguson. He said: \"At Crystal Palace, I was playing first-team football and was quickly turning heads with Juventus, Arsenal, Newcastle and United again [showing interest].",
      "\"I loved my time at Blackburn. My career was progressing and, who knows, if I hadn't had the accident, the time may have come for me to go to Manchester United.",
      "\"At that time, it was just too soon [to go to United] I thought, so I decided to go to Palace. And going to Blackburn was the right decision. The wrong decision was getting on a scooter in Rome!\"",

      "The 27-year-old spent time in the youth academies of Southampton and the Blues, before enjoying a four-year stint with Leicester City but left in 2020 without making a first-team appearance.",
      "It was that same year that Bolkiah signed his first professional contract with Maritimo. After making just two appearances for the Portuguese club, he made the move to Thailand with Chonburi and since 2023, he's represented Thai League 1 side Ratchaburi.",
      "His determination to carve a career for himself in the sport given his family wealth is certainly admirable considering he could hypothetically cough up the £5.2bn the Glazer family are said to want to green-light a sale for the Red Devils. There is, of course, no suggestion that he is interested in doing any such thing.",
      "While United's current value stands at £2bn, the Floridian businessmen are thought to want double that figure. The significant premium could be based on future increases in the club's value such as plans for their new stadium. Speculation about the future of United arose earlier this week when Saudi billionaire Turki Al-Sheikh stoked the fires on social media.",

He wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor ... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "Amid excitement online over the potential departure of the Glazer family, who've been subject to many protests from the United fanbase during their 20-year reign at Old Trafford, Al-Sheikh later confirmed that he was not the investor.",

      "While the Glazers remain majority owners, Ratcliffe admitted during his appearance on the The Business podcast that if he was instructed by the Americans to sack Ruben Amorim, he'd refuse.",

      "\"I didn't close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup,\" he stated. \"That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That's all there is to it.\"",
      "Fernandes refused to engage in conversation over the possibility of departing next summer. Nothing appears imminent for the moment.",
      "\"That's an impossible scenario to imagine, because it's nothing that's been discussed with me,\" he said. \"When it was discussed with me, I spoke openly with you at a press conference before a Nations League match.",
      "\"I like to enjoy the moment, and the most important thing for me now is representing the national team, because it's a source of enormous pride to be able to play tomorrow [Saturday], and I still don't know if I'll play, let alone if I'll leave Manchester United in a year.",
      "\"I'm happy where I am; otherwise, I wouldn't have stayed, but it's something that doesn't affect me.\"",
      "Fernandes will hope to start Portugal's World Cup qualifying clash against the Republic of Ireland on Saturday evening. The Nations League champions hold a perfect record so far in Group F after wins over Armenia and Hungary to open their campaign to reach North America next summer.",
      "\"We have to take it game by game, even though we know we want to reach the World Cup as quickly as possible,\" the 31-year-old told Channel 11 via O Jogo. \"Our main goal is to win every game, and we’re focused on that, knowing that the dream of the World Cup is always present.",
      "\"Since I was little, I've dreamed of winning the World Cup, and it’s not just my dream, it's the dream of all Portuguese people. First, we’ll do everything we can to be there, and then we'll do everything we can to make that dream come true.\"",

      "Gareth Southgate spoke at the 11th Aspire Academy Global Summit in the US this week. The 55-year-old has been out of a managerial job since stepping down from England after Euro 2024 last summer.",
      "However, he has evidently kept busy in the year since. The Aspire Academy Global Summit brings people from all walks of professional football together to share their wisdom on the game.",
      "This year's event was hosted in Philadelphia, as Southgate was joined by the likes of Rafael Benitez - who presented a master class - as well as Carli Lloyd, Wilfried Nancy and Alessandro Nesta, among others. Speaking at the summit, Southgate said: \"The most important thing for developing football is developing coaches.",
      "\"We are all constantly learning. Bringing people together to share experiences and ideas helps us all grow, especially as the game continues to evolve.\"",
      "It comes as Southgate has been linked with taking up tenure at Manchester United in the event that Ruben Amorim is sacked. The Portuguese head coach has struggled to make much of an impact since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "They could only muster a miserable 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season, while this term has seen a mixed-bag of ups and downs. At the time of writing, United sit tenth in the league table with three wins, three losses and a draw to their name.",
      "They were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup in August after a penalty shootout with League Two side, Grimsby Town. While many fans have started to grow tired with Amorim's style of management and lack of results, he may have bought himself a little more time with a 2-0 win over Sunderland AFC ahead of the international break - with Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko clinching all three points for the Red Devils.",
      "As a result of his tough tenure with the club, a number of potential candidates have been linked with replacing Amorim as of recent, from Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler and Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner, to La Liga legends like Zinedine Zidane and Xavi Hernandez.",
      "And while Southgate has also been linked with taking up the top job at Old Trafford, the former Middlesbrough was recently suggested to hold a number of demands that the board may not be able to meet. As per the Sun, sources suggest that United executives would have to stick to any long-term plans.",
      "It is also claimed that Southgate harbours concerns that the board would need instant success from him, despite him taking a gradual approach over a prolonged period. Southgate hasn't managed in the English top flight since Middlesbrough were relegated in 2009.",
      "Instead, he has dedicated the last decade or so of his life to international football, taking the reins of England's U21 side in 2013, before gaining promotion to the first-team three years later.",
      "While he failed to win a major title with the Three Lions, Southgate successfully guided England to runner-up places at Euro 2020 and Euro 2024, as well as a third-place finish in the 2018/19 UEFA Nations League.",

      "Manchester United could see an 87-year record broken if midfielder Kobbie Mainoo leaves the club. The academy graduate has struggled for regular game time under Ruben Amorim so far this season.",
      "After being an unused substitute for the opening two Premier League games, Mainoo has been used off the bench in the last five games but is yet to be named in a starting line-up. His only start this season came in the Carabao Cup loss to League Two Grimsby Town back in August.",
      "Mainoo was linked with a move away from Old Trafford in the summer transfer window, with the England international outlining his desire to go out on loan. United, however, wanted to keep the player and resisted any approaches.",
      "The lack of starts has seen Mainoo linked with a transfer in January, with Serie A club Napoli said to be confident of a deal . The Italian side were one of the clubs linked with an interest back in the summer.",
      "ESPN now report that United are set to hold talks with both Mainoo and teammate Joshua Zirkzee over their future, ahead of the transfer window re-opening in the new year. Both players are reported to have concerns over their lack of game time.",
      "The outcome of those talks could have an impact on the transfer decision when the January window comes around. If United do decide to let Mainoo leave, then a record that has stood since 1937 could be on the line.",
      "United have had an academy graduate involved in every matchday squad since October 1937, an 87-year streak. However, against Sunderland before the international break, Mainoo was the only member of the squad to come from the academy.",
      "Without Mainoo in the squad, that record could potentially come to an end. That could be potentially be another thing going against Ruben Amorim, who has found himself under pressure after a mixed start to the new Premier League season.",

      "Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus has unveiled a fresh strategy to attract investors in a bid to buy Manchester United. He had previously proposed a plan that could have netted the club a whopping $20billion in 2023.",
      "Zilliacus was among the contenders, including Sheikh Jassim and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, when the Glazer family considered selling part or all of the club two years ago. Despite his fan-led proposal not making the cut, he insists it could have been a profitable venture.",
      "The ex-Nokia official revealed that his team was working on an app that would have allowed fans to gain a small stake in the club and some control in how it's run for a fee of $400. This \"Swedish model\", as he called it, had been trialled and in theory could have generated up to $20b if just five per cent of his estimated one billion United fans worldwide were targeted.",
      "Zilliacus has now stated that he is once again open to investing in the club. His updated position includes a willingness to collaborate with other backers, including the Glazers, amid ongoing rumours that the club is on the market.",
      "\"But at the same time, the club could be developed so that it becomes once again, the best club in the world. And the fans are happy and everybody's happy. That's the way I see it.\"",
      "Zilliacus reckons that irrespective of his fresh proposal and his willingness to collaborate with the existing majority shareholders, the Glazer family will shortly offload their stake. He also suspects they will demand more than the club's actual value.",
      "When quizzed about whether the Glazers will shortly exit Old Trafford, Zilliacus responded: \"I would think so. I mean, they have already made so much money out of the club.",
      "\"They have not gelled well with the fans. I don't think people want to forever be involved with assets where they get a lot of negative feedback as owners, as the Glazers continue to do.",
      "\"So I would think that if the price is right, yes, they want to sell. That's how I would see it. I think that the time for that to happen will be pretty soon.",
      "\"But looking at the experience two years ago, I think they will demand a hell of a lot and they will ask for more than what the club really is worth. But then again, there are two ways to look at the club.",
      "\"One is what is it worth today and the other is what it can become. What can it be worth with the right decisions made? The program that I have to engage the club to perhaps a billion fans around the world, that is where I see the real value.",
      "\"That value is very high, which means that you could actually justify a higher price than what the valuation is today, because of the potential that fan base holds.\"",

      "It's been a turbulent start to the season for Manchester United, who are still searching for consistency under Ruben Amorim. Last weekend's 2-0 victory over Sunderland offered a rare boost, injecting some much-needed optimism ahead of the international break.",
      "However, the victory, while promising, merely masks some fairly large cracks. United have already suffered three Premier League defeats this season, and the humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town back in August still stings.",
      "It's also worth noting that their three league victories came against two newly promoted sides and a Chelsea team that spent almost the entire match with 10 men. Even so, there have been encouraging signs of progress in recent weeks.",
      "Summer signing Benjamin Sesko has found the net in consecutive games, while fellow newcomer Senne Lammens impressed on his debut between the sticks against the Black Cats. Amorim's tactical philosophy is also beginning to take shape, with United occasionally looking sharper and more fluid in possession than under the Portuguese coach last season.",
      "Senne Lammens made a strong case to become United's permanent No. 1 with an assured display against Sunderland. Having spent the early weeks of the campaign behind Altay Bayindir, the Belgian seized his opportunity in style - keeping United's first clean sheet of the season and exuding a composure that's been sorely lacking between the posts in recent years.",
      "Confident with the ball at his feet and decisive when called upon, Lammens' performance may have gone some way to convincing his team-mates that he's the right man for the job - amid reports he wasn't universally backed in the dressing room when he arrived at Old Trafford last month.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, sections of the squad had \"strongly pushed\" the club's hierarchy to sign Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez instead. The 33-year-old was heavily linked with United throughout the summer, following what appeared to be an emotional farewell to Villains fans on the final day of last season.",
      "Many within Amorim's coaching circle were said to be admirers of Martinez as well, but United ultimately chose to pursue Lammens. Whether the 23-year-old - who joined for £18.5million from Antwerp on Deadline Day - is aware of those early doubts remains unclear. If he is, his performances suggest he's using them as motivation rather than a burden.",
      "Manchester United's ownership saga shows no signs of abating, with Finnish billionaire Thomas Zilliacus confirming fresh interest in acquiring a stake in the club - or potentially the whole thing. The 61-year-old entrepreneur, a lifelong Red Devils supporter, revealed he's drafting a new proposal to rally investors, including a possible reunion with former rival bidder Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani.",
      "Zilliacus previously fronted a fan-backed consortium during the 2023 sale process, but his late entry missed the window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos secured a 27.7 per cent minority stake and control of football operations for £1.25billion. Undeterred, Zilliacus insists this time around would be a collaborative effort, not a hostile bid.",
      "\"This is about joining forces with the right parties with the sole aim of bringing Manchester United back to where it should be as the number one club in the world.",
      "Zilliacus emphasised that his plan would include a fan-led model rather than a traditional takeover, something he believes the Glazer family currently rejects. \"I think the Glazers, unfortunately, are a good example of somebody who is not really looking out for the club, but rather using it as a cash cow,\" he said.",
      "\"I have a program that involves the fans who are overseas, who cannot come to watch a game. And my program can evolve in a way that can bring significant new revenues to the club.\"",
      "He also expressed openness to working with other investors, including Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim. \"I actually have nothing against working with people like Jim Ratcliffe or any investor, whoever that may be. Because I'm not in this to have a trophy that I can show off to other people,\" he said.",
      "\"When I had made my bid I realised that the Glazers were playing a game where Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim and myself were just trying to outbid each other... I publicly said that this is madness… So I said, 'Why don't we join forces and take over the club together?'\"",
      "Zilliacus concluded that he remains \"completely open\" to renewed talks with potential partners, reaffirming his ambition to restore Manchester United to \"the best club in the world.\"",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Ruben Amorim will have taken Sir Jim Ratcliffe's public vote of confidence in him one of two ways.",
      "The Manchester United head coach may have welcomed his boss's public endorsement of him, along with Ratcliffe's belief that Amorim needs to be judged over the length of his three-year contract.",
      "Or Amorim will have viewed the backing from Ratcliffe, like so many did, as the dreaded vote of confidence, the precursor to the inevitable sacking, having been so publicly supported by the man in charge.",
      "Either way, Amorim knows the only way for him to remain in charge of United long-term and to continue to have the backing of the club's hierarchy, is with an upturn in results.",
      "A haul of 37 points from a possible 112 is the kind of return that sees teams relegated and one Amorim knows cannot continue, even with Ratcliffe's three-year security blanket for comfort.",
      "Ratcliffe, chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox will not hesitate to pull the trigger on Amorim if results do not improve significantly with immediate effect.",
      "In the interview in which he endorsed Amorim, Ratcliffe may have referenced the clamour for Sir Alex Ferguson to be sacked after a poor start to his United reign, before the era of unprecedented success he oversaw at Old Trafford.",
      "Ferguson took four years to win his first trophy at United, the FA Cup in 1990, but time is not a luxury managers are afforded in today's game, despite Ratcliffe's insistence that Amorim needs time to prove his is, in his words, a “great coach”.",
      "There is no doubting Amorim's coaching prowess – two Primeira Liga titles with Sporting Lisbon is testimony to that – but his intransigence in terms of his system and playing philosophy may ultimately be what costs him the United job.",
      "In defending his contentious 3-4-2-1 system, Amorim is right to say United played with four at the back under his immediate predecessors and the players still struggled, so a change of system can hardly be solely responsible for their current woes and last season's 15th-placed finish, their lowest for 51 years.",
      "But while his other rival managers have shown a willingness and ability to adapt their approach and formation when things are not going well and when the opposition demands it, Amorim has chosen to dig his heels in and double down on the way he sets up United.",
      "Amorim has said on several occasions recently that if he were to change to playing four at the back, he would lose credibility and respect among his players, only to then muddy the waters by saying that he will, at some stage, change his formation, but not now.",
      "Certainly, changing to a 4-2-3-1 system would solve the problem of Kobbie Mainoo's ongoing exile, enabling him to play in a midfield two with Casemiro and liberating skipper Bruno Fernandes from the current deeper-lying role that simply does not play to his attacking strengths.",
      "But with Amorim seemingly unwilling to entertain the prospect of changing his system, he must find a way of getting the best out of the personnel within, in particular improving the delivery and threat from his wing-backs.",
      "Amad has had a slow start to the season and missed the Brentford defeat following a family bereavement, but looked better in the 2-0 win over Sunderland, while Patrick Dorgu needs to improve his final ball if he is to start regularly ahead of Diogo Dalot.",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all made encouraging starts, while fellow new arrival, goalkeeper Senne Lammens, made an assured debut against Sunderland and has the No.1 position for now.",
      "The task facing Amorim in the next few weeks is to put together a sustained winning run. He has yet to win back-to-back league games after nearly a year in charge, and while achieving that feat at arch rivals Liverpool next Sunday – even accounting for their current wobble – is unlikely, Amorim needs a statement win and performance.",
      "Anfield would be the perfect place to do just that.",

Sitting tenth in the Premier League, things no longer look quite as bleak as they did a few weeks ago as the side now prepares for a trip to Liverpool.",

      "Amorim was then backed by United minority co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who said he would judge the Portuguese over three years. Amorim has yet to reach 12 months in charge at Old Trafford, and Ratcliffe used Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has a yardstick for patience.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" Ratcliffe told The Times' The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "While Arteta certainly struggled to elevate Arsenal into challengers for the Premier League early on, he did win the FA Cup in 2020, just months after his arrival. The Gunners were eighth in Arteta's first full season, having also finished in that position the year before when the Spaniard arrived mid-campaign.",
      "They improved to fifth in 2022 and have since finished second three times in a row, while they top the table ahead of the Premier League returning this week.",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, oversaw a disastrous domestic campaign last term having arrived in November with United ending 15th. The Reds did reach the Europa League final but the Portuguese head coach missed the chance to claim silverware, and potentially bank some credit, as United were beaten by Tottenham.",
      "After seven games this term, Amorim's side are 10th with 10 points ahead of a trip to Liverpool on Sunday, October 19.",
      "Ratcliffe's seeming show of faith in the manager will be tested over the coming weeks with four of United's next six games coming against sides currently in the top eight.",
      "If results continue to disappoint, the pressure on Amorim will only ramp up. The 40-year-old oversaw his 50th United game in charge before the October international break and, amid the Arteta comparisons, Amorim could do worse than digest what the Arsenal boss had to say when he brought up his half century at the Emirates with a dismal 3-0 home reverse to Liverpool which left the Gunners 10th in the table with eight games to play.",
      "\"I have to set the team up to perform in a different way and that is it,\" Arteta said at the time. \"Congratulations to Liverpool because they were exceptional today. That showed the difference between the two teams - that when they play at that level, the margin is incredibly high.",
      "\"I don't have to use any excuses - that we don't have five or six players - the standards are much higher at this football club and I have to get them to perform at that level. It was technical as well.",

      "Harry Maguire is ready to snub huge contract offers from Saudi Arabia if Manchester United offer him a new deal.",
      "England international Maguire is out of contract in June at Old Trafford and has become a target of Saudi outfits Al-Nassr and Al-Ettifaq. A move to the former would see him link up with ex-United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Maguire, 33 in March, is free to open talks with potential new clubs in January. And a move to Saudi could see him land a deal worth around £500k-a-week. Given it is likely to be the final lucrative move of his career, such an offer isn't without its temptations.",
      "But United are considering handing the defender a contract extension. Talks will take place in the coming weeks.",
      "However, Maguire - who was ruthlessly dumped and stripped of the United captaincy by former boss Erik ten Hag - will want assurances the deal is right for him.",
      "Maguire has 68 England caps to his name and is hoping to be part of Thomas Tuchel's squad for the next World Cup - although he is facing an uphill battle after being left out of the current squad.",
      "He knows that joining the Saudi Pro-League would damage his chances of extending his England career, whether Tuchel is in charge or not.",
      "But if he pledges his future to United, he wants to know he will remain an integral part of the club's plans, whoever is the manager.",
      "In an ideal world, Maguire would be willing to see out the rest of his career at Old Trafford. But with it being the last major decision of his career, the terms must be right.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Manchester United spent £236million on new signings in the first summer transfer window of Ruben Amorim's reign.",
      "Big-money signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko were joined by less high-profile arrivals in left-back Diego Leon and goalkeeper Senme Lammens.",
      "Now the new arrivals have had time to settle in, how have they fared since joining United? Here, we grade Amorim's summer recruits.",
      "Matheus Cunha: There was huge expectation after United agreed a £65m deal with Wolves for the mercurial and tempestuous Brazil forward, but Cunha has made a slower than expected start to his United career.",
      "Injured in the last-gasp 3-2 win over Burnley, when he was forced off in the first-half, he missed the 3-0 Manchester derby defeat, but returned at Brentford, with his cross to Mbeumo winning a penalty which was ultimately missed by skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Mason Mount's goalscoring return in the 2-0 win over Sunderland and relentless industry has probably nudged him ahead of Cunha in terms of selection. It will be interesting to see how Cunha responds to that. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: The former Brentford forward, signed for £71m, has unquestionably been United's stand-out summer signing. Mbeumo has hit the ground running following his summer switch, which is all the more remarkable given he was behind his new team-mates in terms of pre-season fitness and only featured in the final game on United's US summer tour.",
      "Two goals and an assist do not do justice to his overall contribution, his pace, physicality and diagonal runs in behind opposition defences giving United's attack a new dimension. He has started every Premier League game his season, underlining his importance. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Sesko has undeniably taken time to settle, but two goals in his last two games shows he is getting there and he has looked more comfortable with every game.",
      "After admitting Sesko looked “on his own” in United's 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, Amorim has sought to tweak his approach by playing to the 6ft 4in striker's strengths, with long balls for him to flick-on for his fellow attackers to win the second balls and force opponents onto the back foot.",
      "Sesko's poacher's instincts from close-range have yielded his goals and his physical strength, allied to his aerial threat, makes him a handful for defenders. 7",
      "Senne Lammens: An £18.2million deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp, he was a relative unknown before arriving at United, who also looked at moving for Aston Villa's experienced World Cup-wining keeper Emi Martinez, but that deal broke down.",
      "That saw United move for Lammens, who had to bide his time before making an assured debut in the 2-0 win over Sunderland, which had the Old Trafford crowd chanting “Are you Schmeichel in disguise?”.",
      "Such was the assurance Lammens transmitted to his defence, unlike Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana before him, it is hard to see him being dislodged. He commanded his box, used both feet, showcased decent distribution and already looks a major upgrade between the posts. 7",
      "Diego Leon: Defender Leon became United's second signing of the summer, after Cunha, when the 18-year-old joined from Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno for an initial fee of £3.3m, rising to £7m with add-ons.",
      "Given Leon has yet to make his United debut, it is hard to grade him. He was named on the bench for the games against Grimsby, Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland, but remained there.",
      "Worryingly, he was subbed at half-time after failing to impress for United's Under-21s in a 2-1 win at Liverpool last month, suggesting he has a way to go before he can be considered for a first-team debut.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "On the face of it, Bruno Fernandes could hardly have been more positive when asked about playing in midfield for Manchester United.",
      "\"I love playing football, whatever the position,” said Fernandes, ahead of Portugal's 1-0 World Cup qualifier win over Republic of Ireland. “They can put me at full-back, winger, goalkeeper. I’ll always give my best.”",
      "But it was the follow-up remark from Fernandes that was most telling, suggesting the 31-year-old playmaker was far from happy at playing in a deeper-lying role on the insistence of boss Ruben Amorim.“Everyone has their preferences,” said United captain Fernandes. “But we have to adapt to the coach’s ideas.”",
      "The clear inference from that comment is that Fernandes would rather play in a more advanced role, where he has been most effective for United and can provide a greater attacking threat and influence.",
      "Fernandes and his camp are known to have taken umbrage at recent reports stating he is not happy with the role in which Amorim continues to deploy him and is desperate to play further up the pitch, with more freedom.",
      "What is undeniable is that being selected in midfield does not play to the attacking strengths of Fernandes. He is arguably United's most creative player and the one with the biggest goal threat, but those weapons are being nullified by where he is currently being played.",
      "In midfield, Fernandes is forced to think defensively as well as offensively, something that does not come naturally to him. It is a different mindset, focusing on thwarting opponents when you don't have the ball, rather than what you can do with it at your feet, which is where Fernandes excels.",
      "In his new role, Fernandes' objective is frequently not to unlock the opposition but to keep them under lock and key. That is likely to be the case when United return to Premier League action at arch rivals Liverpool on Sunday, where Fernandes will be tasked with being more of a spoiler than a match-winner, given how the game is likely to unfold, with the hosts enjoying greater possession, forcing Amorim's side into a policy of containment.",
      "That is not to say Fernandes is completely ill-suited to playing more centrally. His intrinsic work ethic and willingness to cover so much ground, as evidenced by some key challenges in the dying embers of United's hard-fought 2-1 win over Chelsea, is a key skill set for a midfielder.",
      "But Amorim's insistence on sticking with his contentious 3-4-2-1 system, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Amad or Mason Mount playing as the two behind Benjamin Sesko, means Fernandes has had to accept he is now a midfielder and will play there as long as his compatriot remains in charge.",
      "Publicly, players will rarely complain about the position they are asked to occupy and the role they are required to fulfil. Privately, though, Fernandes surely yearns for the days under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag, when he was able to maraud around the pitch, showcasing his prodigious attacking talent, without having to do any of the dirty work.",

Heaven went down and required lengthy treatment before returning to action, but he was substituted at half-time, prompting concerns that he could face another spell on the sidelines.",

      "And while the shift across St George's Park is billed as fleshing out the squad for the session, it is far from merely making up the numbers.",
      "Tuchel and his staff will undoubtedly have had a say in who was promoted from the Under-20 squad and the England staff as a whole will no doubt have been involved in the discussion.",
      "Lacey will have taken plenty from the experience and impressed for the Under-20s in their 1-0 friendly defeat to Switzerland on Friday afternoon, twice coming close to scoring the the Young Lions.",
      "The international impression is the latest staging post in the United prospect's career and comes after a fine showing at club level this term which has seen him score twice in three Premier League 2 contests.",
      "He has long been talked about as a bright prospect at United - and this season might prove a pivotal period in the 18-year-old's development.",
      "Lacey was one of a clutch of youngsters who were alongside the senior group when United returned to pre-season training in the summer.",
      "The playmaker had an injury-hit campaign last term and was carefully managed as a result. His minutes at academy level were therefore limited, but he did travel on the post-season tour to Asia and was handed a senior appearance off the bench in the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "That offered a glimpse of what he can offer with his ability on the ball evident. Lacey signed a professional deal at the first opportunity last year and Old Trafford insiders believe he has the potential to break into the first team.",
      "He featured for United's Under-18s aged just 14 and is capable of playing in a variety of positions while the Reds academy coaches like to challenge youngsters in different roles.",
      "His long-term future could be as an attacking midfielder, while comparisons have been made with Manchester City and England star Phil Foden, ironically not called up by England this month as Lacey joined in training.",
      "The United prospect has a long way to go before being mentioned in similar dispatches to the Etihad ace but Lacey has evidently impressed for club and country.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were enough to earn United three points that move them up six places to eighth in the Premier League going into the international break.",
      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",
      "Subs:",
      "Dorgu (Dalot, 64)",
      "Solid at left wing-back. 6",
      "Cunha (Mount, 64)",

      "Mainoo (Mbeumo, 76)",
      "Not enough time to impact the game. 6",
      "Ugarte (Casemiro, 85)",
      "A late arrival. N/A",

    "body": [
      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "If you are asking in recent times, too often to count. Each new addition has been brought in with the promise of being able to change United's fortunes around.",
      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps the Manchester United manager in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham – even that they managed to make a pig’s ear of – and replaced by sack-race winner Nuno Espirito Santo, who will duly return somewhere in the middle of the pack here in due course.",
      "We can only assume that Potter will therefore replace Postecoglou, Nuno’s replacement at Nottingham Forest, at the City Ground as the Aussie is the favourite to be binned next, replacing Amorim, who is probably only still in a job so United can save a few quid on his pay-off.",
      "The managerial merry-go-round has never felt more real.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "Although what does need saying here is that there is a wild divergence in opinion on Slot’s job security. He is – entirely absurdly – joint third-favourite in some places. But we’re interested in the best available prices, and on that basis he’s as safe as Mikel Arteta.",
      "But however ridiculous it may sound, there are bookmakers out there who consider Slot’s position to be less secure than anyone in the league who isn’t Ange Postecoglou or Ruben Amorim.",
      "Life comes at you fast when a mini-crisis takes hold.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford plus another win at Nottingham Forest have everything looking peachy. And most sides are going to be pretty happy any time they take a point from Palace this season, we reckon.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is quite embarrassing, though.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "Victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Currently benefiting twice from the Ruben Amorim situation, gleefully helping himself to a much-needed win over a man also helping to keep him and others away from the head of this market.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season.",
      "What makes this particularly impressive, in a way, is that Nuno hasn’t really done that much wrong when you think about it. Not at the sort of catastrophic level that would normally be required for such an ‘achievement’",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward but the increasing body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "He is currently trying – and failing – to deploy it with a Forest squad far less suited than Tottenham, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability. Throw in the fact that when it did work at Spurs, it worked early on due to its shock-and-awe newness before everyone figured it all out. There has been no early benefit reaped at Forest. Actually the opposite is true.",
      "Postecoglou is the first Forest manager in a hundred years – an actual century – to go winless in his first six matches in charge. And it’s now seven after defeat at Newcastle.",
      "It helps not that he replaced a popular figure but the shadow of Nuno would be no inconvenience if Forest weren’t shipping goals for fun while showcasing all the flaws associated with Angeball. Fifteen goals conceded, seven from set-pieces, is it? Stunning.",
      "What Postecoglou needs is a patient owner willing to wait for an undefinable period in the forlorn hope the new manager’s messages might eventually land. He’s got Evangelos Marinakis. Mate.",
      "And now, in clear evidence that Forest no longer know what on earth they’re playing at, they’re being linked with Sean Dyche. Going from Nuno to Ange to Dyche in the space of two months is quite simply unhinged.",

      "A Serie A giant chief has reportedly drawn up an ‘intriguing idea’ to land a Manchester United attacker who is said to be ‘deeply frustrated’ at the moment.",
      "United’s attack left a lot to be desired last season. In the Premier League, none of their players surpassed 10 goals, and central strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee scored four and three goals respectively, though both played north of 30 games.",
      "Over the summer, it was reported that United were looking to ship out Hojlund, though Zirkzee would be safe. That was despite the former wanting to stay at United.",
      "He was indeed shipped out, to Napoli, but while Zirkzee survived, things have not panned out how they might have.",
      "The Dutchman has played just 82 minutes in all competitions this term, with new signing Benjamin Sesko preferred up top of late, while Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount have also been given minutes there.",
      "Amid his struggles for playing time, Gazzetta dello Sport reports Dan Friedkin and Gian Piero Gasperini at Roma have come up with the ‘intriguing idea’ of loaning Zirkzee in.",
      "The report states that the Dutchman ‘wants to leave’ in order to avoid the risk of missing out on the World Cup, having been left out of the Netherlands side of late.",
      "The report suggests that within the Premier League, West Ham and Everton also have Zirkzee in their sights.",
      "A recent report stated that Serie A clubs Inter Milan, Juventus and Como are looking at the United man, with the Hammers also mentioned.",
      "That, too, suggested that Zirkzee is not happy with his role at United. Indeed, it was said that he is ‘deeply frustrated’ by his current role, and a January move will be crucial if he’s to play in the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Ronald Koeman’s recent comments are a stark reminder of that.",
      "The Netherlands boss said: “He wasn’t in the preliminary selection because I don’t think he’s good enough at the moment.",
      "“Especially scanning when turning or passing often goes wrong. Yes, in principle form and fitness are always leading, but that is not always possible.",
      "“We have a lot of central defenders and midfielders, but we are somewhat limited up front.",
      "“But even then, I still think that you have to earn your selection, and I think he doesn’t deserve that now, but that could be the case again in another period.”",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee could be set for a move away from Old Trafford in January as he looks to make the World Cup, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly made a ‘shock U-turn’ on captain Bruno Fernandes after he was linked with a summer move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "According to reports, one ‘unhappy’ Manchester United star could ‘push to leave’ the Premier League giants in January amid one key ‘issue’.",
      "Former Man Utd winger Antony claims he suffered from “rudeness” from people at Old Trafford during his final days at the club.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is one of the players on Juventus’ list to replace Dusan Vlahovic in Turin, according to reports.",

      "",
      "Thanks George for asking in the last mailbox. It’s been stressing me out a lot hearing how 3-5-2 doesn’t work for various reasons and Amorim and the players have no chance.",
      "I remember in the 90s when Roy Evans took over the Liverpool side and adopted a 3-5-2. Liverpool bought Mark Wright for £2.2m who was England’s centre back (Harry Maguire with pace and class). John Scales (De Ligt with fewer mistakes) and Phil Babb (Lenny Yoro) were the other centre backs.",
      "Left back was Stig Inge Bjornabye and Steve Harkness. Nothing world class but could tirelessly get up and down the whole game. Right back was Rob Jones who was superb and again could run and run. Dorgu seems like he knows what he is doing but neither Dalot or Amad are a good fit for that position which messes up the formation and attacking lines.",
      "Midfield we had John Barnes (Bruno Fernandes) but he was fat and old so he just sat at the back reading the game, intercepting, spraying lovely passes and getting a few goals. He was definitely not all over the pitch trying to do everything but falling on all counts and ruining the formation. Barnes also took a decent penalty without getting into a strop. His partner was a young Jamie Redknapp whose best achievement was marrying Louise (If you know you know). He was a decent player and put a shift in. The 2 of them screened the back 3 so we were pretty solid.",
      "Biggest difference in Utd and Liverpool was the front 3. Liverpool had Steve McManaman who was all over the pitch (where Bruno should play) and had the license to roam and create. Up front was Stanley Victor Collymore and Robbie Fowler. They got 55 goals between them one season and played as orthodox strikers. The team was built to get chances to the front 2.",
      "In my opinion (Geoff) with Cunha roaming and Mbeumo wide it only leaves Sesko in there who can be easily marshalled by the opposition defence. So the answer is simple. Bruno needs to be further forward with Cunha and Mbeumo as 2 orthodox strikers. Put De Ligt as defensive midfield with Mason Mount sitting in front of the back 3. Buy a right wing back. It’s not hard, we can all see it, which is why it’s strange that Amorim cannot.\nHong Kong Ian (#Amorimin) LFC",

      "Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes feels a meeting with Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher is a good opportunity to “settle scores” after he missed a penalty against him earlier this season.",
      "Fernandes has been one of United‘s very best players since he joined them in 2020. The attacking midfielder has been directly involved in 186 goals in 298 games for the Red Devils.",
      "He has been their designated penalty taker for most of his time there, and in the Premier League, he’s scored 23 of those spot kicks, and missed six.",
      "But this season, Fernandes’ record from the spot is pretty woeful, as he’s scored just one of three efforts.",
      "He scored against Burnley, skied one against Fulham and saw Brentford goalkeeper Kelleher save his attempt in a 3-1 loss.",
      "Fernandes will come up against Kelleher for Portugal against Ireland on Saturday, and thus his penalty record has been brought up.",
      "Fernandes said: “This season, out of three, I ended up missing two. I don’t want to miss any of them. It’s something I need to study better. I’ll always do it with full conviction because there’s a coach who trusts me.",
      "“Every day is a good day to settle scores.",
      "“He was stronger. He did very well, and I didn’t. But it’s not something that affects my head. In a football team, there’s something bigger than individuality. Winning is much more important than settling scores with the Irish goalkeeper.”",
      "Portugal have full points from their two World Cup qualification games so far, but Fernandes is yet to have a direct hand in a goal.",
      "He played 90 minutes in the 5-0 victory over Armenia and neither scored nor assisted, before he again blanked in a 66-minute outing against Hungary.",
      "In three games against Ireland in his career, he’s assisted once and not scored.",
      "But the midfielder’s assist came in his last outing against Ireland, so he’ll be hoping not only that he can put his woes against Kelleher behind him, but that he can carry the form from his last match against them with him.",

Does Mr Bowler believe that every flag, once erected, must stay up forever? Would they not get fairly tatty?",

      "‘Peter Bowler’ – a flag isn’t representative of this nation at all. It’s just a bit of fabric with some colours on; it is a symbol, and as with every symbol its meaning comes from how it’s used and who by. What it represents can change at the drop of a (Bowler) hat. 30 years ago, if I’d started tying flags to lampposts showing the colours of the rainbow, most people would have assumed I was in favour of leprechauns, or Teletubbies, or Zippy and Bungle, etc. What’s that idiot doing up a ladder with that flag? He must really like Dark Side of the Moon to go to all that effort.",

Nobody saw Noel Gallagher playing a UJ guitar at the height of Britpop and thought, this is bad, it’s obviously jackboots next. Were we all watching Mo Farah, Jess E-H, Greg Rutherford wearing flags round their shoulders during their 2012 victory laps and screeching, will no-one rid me of these turbulent racists? I tell you what, that Roger Moore skiing off a cliff and opening a Union Jack parachute? Disgusting.",

Yes, most people realised something was very amiss at that point. Obviously, a lot of us – myself included – didn’t want to see it in his case, and quite merrily ignored the Asian Ruts and the Pregnant for the Last Times; but eventually you have to see what’s in front of your face. If Reform councillors get elected and immediately take down Pride flags – symbols of, more than anything else, a plea for tolerance and acceptance – whatever goes up in their place can only represent intolerance and exclusion. And what did they put up? The Gammon Bat Signal itself.",
      "There isn’t a symbolism committee that meets to decide these things; meaning is not handed down by Ed Miliband on giant stone tablets, we all just make it up as we go. Look up the word ‘literally’ in the dictionary to see that these things can get complicated. So, you can pretend the meaning of the flag isn’t changing, and you’re not changing it. Life may be easier psychologically if you tell yourself that the flag doesn’t mean anything deep; there’s no subtext to anything; flying the UJ is just a plain statement of fact – it’s just reminding people what country they’re in. On a par with tying a flag to a lamppost that says, this is a lamppost. What are people annoyed about? Nobody gets ‘triggered’ when they see place names on a road sign do they? What’s all the fuss about?",
      "But whether you know it or not, it’s reflecting you and your personality. It’s reflecting your actions in public and how you speak about the world. And if that flag is a big piece of cloth with your face on it, then fine – you get to own that, nobody else is involved. But if you’re telling everyone that this is their flag too, their country, and their values, the answer is No. Nobody asked us to sign up to how this is being used; nobody tying flags to railings and then pissing in the street straight afterwards asked for my opinion beforehand; nobody setting hotels on fire stopped to enquire if the people – be they white, middle-aged, angry or whatever else – are alright with this.",

      "United have produced some fantastic talents in recent years. Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho have both become quality attackers following their time at Carrington.",
      "More recently, Chido Obi seems to be turning himself into a threat up top, though he was poached from the Arsenal academy.",

      "So far this season, the 15-year-old forward has seven goals and one assist to his name in six under-18 Premier League games.",
      "There have been rumours that he could make the switch to Arsenal amid his top form, and Isaan Khan has written for the Daily Mail that suggestions of ‘revenge’ from the Gunners are ‘inevitable.’",
      "That’s given United signed both Obi and Ayden Heaven from the Emirates, prising away two talented youngsters in the process.",
      "Arsenal are certainly reported to be ‘aware of’ Gabriel, but reports of concrete interest are ‘premature’.",
      "Gabriel’s short-term future is committed to United until at least his 16th birthday, and the earliest he could sign his first professional contract is in the summer of 2027, before it would come into effect when he turns 17.",
      "United are said to be ‘desperate’ to keep Gabriel on their books, as they see him as a ‘future superstar’ and have reportedly offered him a box at the new Old Trafford – set to open in 2030.",
      "This right here is an elite talent, JJ Gabriel 🔥. Hopefully we’ll have a competent manager by the term he’s ready for the first team transition pic.twitter.com/QJX3EXhU20",
      "— Ryan (@Utd_BarryRyan) October 11, 2025",
      "Gabriel has displayed his exceptional talent online of late. A video has gone viral on social media of him passing a tennis ball back to himself off a wall, one touch at a time, using his left and right feet equally, before simply keeping it up by doing kick-ups.",
      "He then walked to a wall behind him, keeping the ball up still, knocked the ball against it a couple of times, before walking back to the first wall, ball still in the air, and started kicking it harder back to himself from about six feet away.",
      "Many social media accounts were in awe of the video, with football content creator Tom Garratt labelling it ‘silly talent’ as a mark of respect for the tough feat."

      "Michael Owen says it’s “embarrassing” to blame all of Manchester United’s struggles on Ruben Amorim’s three-at-the-back system.",
      "Man Utd have only accumulated 37 points from Amorim’s 34 Premier League matches in charge.",
      "There was speculation that a bad result against Sunderland in the Red Devils’ last match would get Amorim sacked, but the head coach led his side to a 2-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "A crucial home victory and a first clean sheet of the season are enough to relieve some pressure on the Portuguese during the international break, but Man Utd’s performances this season have been extremely disappointing.",
      "They are currently tenth in the Premier League with three wins, one draw, and three defeats from their opening seven games, with the club’s stuttering start to 2025/26 being attributed to Amorim’s tactical stubbornness.",
      "Amorim has stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-2-1 formation, and club legends Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney are among those to criticise the Red Devils boss for showing a lack of adaptability, or a lack of desire to adapt.",
      "Former Man Utd striker Owen thinks blaming the club’s poor form isn’t solely down to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 philosophy, and has actually defended the 40-year-old head coach.",
      "“They have changed the manager numerous times since Fergie left,” Owen said.",
      "“Then they blamed the players; spent billions on players and got some of the best players in the world, only for the club to be seen as a bit of a graveyard for players in the last decade.",
      "“Next it was the people buying the players, so everyone wanted rid of them. Then it was the board, so the board was shuffled around when Sir Jim Ratcliffe got involved.",
      "“Then it’s the fault of the facilities so they wanted to revamp the training ground and put plans in for a new stadium.",
      "“Then it’s the staff, so half the backroom staff, physios, doctors, canteen lady, the whole thing, wiped clean and a new start there.",
      "“The latest one is it’s because they’re playing a back-three. If I’m not wrong, I watched Erik Ten Hag about a year ago playing a back-four, and it was some of the most awful football I’ve ever seen from a Manchester United team.",
      "“Some great teams over the years have played with a back-three. I’m not saying that’s my favourite formation at all, and I’m not saying that Amorim is right to be steadfast in his beliefs in that formation. But I certainly don’t think all of United’s problems now are because they play with the back-three.",
      "“It’s embarrassing if you’re going to say the main reason for the downturn is because they play a back-three. I mean, it really isn’t. They could go back to a back-four and play as bad as they did under Ten Hag, then the screams would be equally as loud.”",
      "Amorim has voiced his concerns that negative comments from pundits about his system might be influencing his players, and Owen thinks that is possible.",
      "“I could totally buy that,” he said. “Players aren’t sheltered away from everything.",
      "“They’re driving cars to training, putting the radio on. They sit at home in the lounge with the TV on. They read social media. They can do all these things. If you’re interested in football, you can’t get away from what people are thinking and saying about it.",
      "“Whether footballers should be swayed by those comments or impacted by them, that’s a different argument. But I’ve got no doubt that people will watch and will listen to people they probably respected and thought were great players growing up. They’ll listen to those opinions.",
      "“If they’re saying certain things, then it might enter their head, and they could perhaps wonder if the manager is doing the right thing. They might have their own ideas, but that’s not a new phenomenon.",
      "“That will never change. It never has changed, but I do think it is a relevant point to make by Amorim.”",

      "It comes after Ruben Amorim could only guide Man Utd to a 15th-placed Premier League finish last term with the Red Devils failing to qualify for any European competitions.",

      "“But Ruben Amorim has got his preferred centre-midfield choice of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and probably even Manuel Ugarte is ahead of Mainoo as well, which does leave a lot of Manchester United fans perplexed that Mainoo can’t find a role in that side.",

      "The report adds: ‘Mainoo is unhappy with this start to the season and is pushing for a January transfer, even on loan. The Englishman’s short-term goal, in fact, is to show off his skills and secure a place in Tuchel’s squad for the next World Cup. Manchester isn’t the right platform, but Napoli could be.’",
      "Earlier this season, former Man Utd team-mate Phil Jones insists that if his lack of game time continues then Mainoo will look to force a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Jones said on Stadium Astro: “Kobbie is a player that I really admire. I loved watching him come into the team, and I remember his performance at Everton away, his first start.",
      "“He absolutely bossed the game. He was terrific that night. It was a mature performance, and he carried on that season.",
      "“It just looks like at the minute he’s out of favour. The manager’s already come out and stated that he’s not going to be playing with Bruno. You’re not going to dislodge Bruno in the form that he’s in.",

      "But Silva also warrants his next job being at a club at least in contention for Europe, even if his chances of joining a Big Six club in the near future are slim to none.",

Last season’s eighth-place finish in the Premier League was a solid return, and it says a lot about how far Brighton have come that a top-half finish feels the norm and that they perhaps should have finished one or two places higher.",

      "Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Ruben Amorim",
      "Wednesday 8 October 2025 20:34, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the minority owner at United, has said he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "Ultimately, this is a United side that is suffering from scars from a mentally tough previous season - finishing 15th as well as losing a European final. They have lost a lot of games as well, 21 of Ruben Amorim's 50 in charge.",
      "But despite disappointing losses and performances to the likes of Grimsby and Brentford, there is still a feeling of optimism inside the walls of Carrington.",
      "United feel, despite some of the poor results, that their data and metrics show that this side are improving. The eye test suggests that they are as well, looking at the performance against Arsenal, and first halves against Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "The Sunderland performance demonstrated flexibility from Amorim, something he has been accused of lacking. The team defended in a 4-4-2 and attacked in a 3-4-3.",
      "They look like they have a potential emerging No 1 in Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko had by far his best game for United so far, his pressing and ability to bring others into play were particularly impressive.",
      "United's ultimate aim for this season is a return to European football. Whether that is the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League - we will have to wait and see where this team can end up, but the reality is this team is still being rebuilt.",
      "The next run of fixtures will give all watching a better indication of what will be possible this season - with away trips to Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham and just the one home fixture to Brighton before the next break - no matter how the results go, we will learn a lot.",
      "The £200m new look front line of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha all look back to match fitness, as well as Mount, who scored a lovely goal against Sunderland before the break.",
      "If United can rescue a positive season from a rollercoaster start, there is room for optimism next summer in what could be an intriguing transfer window for United.",
      "With big contracts set to expire, there will have to be decisions made on the likes of Harry Maguire and Casemiro.",
      "There is a realistic prospect that the Brazilian's contract won't be renewed next summer and his three-year stay at United could come to an end.",
      "If that does happen, the freed-up space on the wage bill would represent an opportunity for United to strengthen in that area of the pitch.",
      "A midfielder remains a key area for United to strengthen next summer and although they have been long-term admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba, he is just one of a number of players they have looked at in the position.",
      "After a £50m redevelopment of the men's first-team training facility completed in the summer, United's next aim at Carrington is to upgrade their academy facilities.",
      "United have gone through change at their academy leadership level - with new academy director Stephen Torpey succeeding Nick Cox, who has joined Everton as technical director.",
      "With Torpey's recent arrival, United, led by director of football Wilcox, are keen to accelerate plans to rebuild the academy in the hope the facilities will match some of the best in the world.",
      "United decided not to develop the academy facilities at the same time as the men's first team as it would have been too disruptive on site, but having invested in both the men's and women's facilities in recent years, their next focus is the academy.",
      "United have some exciting emerging talents such as 15-year-old JJ Gabriel, who has been starring for Darren Fletcher's U18 side.",
      "Closer to the first team, U21 attacking midfielder Shea Lacey was seen training with the England first team during this international break.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe mentioned Arsenal's faith in Mikel Arteta when saying he would like to give Ruben Amorim three years at Man Utd, but how does his record in his first 50 games in charge compare? Have your say in our poll",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",

      "Thursday 9 October 2025 07:24, UK",
      "Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to give under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim three years in the job to prove himself.",
      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "\"We all know how football works. Before the next international break, Man Utd have got four games, Liverpool, Brighton, Forest and Spurs.",
      "\"What happens if they lose all those games? There will be another international break. Everybody will be talking about Ruben Amorim's future again.",
      "\"This is a very significant intervention by Jim Ratcliffe to come out and back Ruben Amorim. I personally think the backing is not 100 per cent. If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",
      "\"He's just saying 'Ruben needs to demonstrate he's a great coach over three years'. 'We have to be patient'. 'We have a long-term plan'. 'It isn't a light switch'.",
      "\"It's not a light switch, but Manchester United are one of the biggest clubs in the world. I would say the only clubs that really compare to them on a worldwide basis are Real Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "\"What would journalists in Spain who cover Real Madrid or Barcelona be saying if Real Madrid finished 15th in the table? What would they be saying if their new manager was bottom of the table when it came to results since he'd taken over?\"",

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Ruben Amorim said he has no plans to walk away from the Manchester United job and insisted his system is not to blame for their struggles in an impassioned press conference.",
      "HIs side face Sunderland on Saturday having suffered a third Premier League loss of the season against Brentford which left them 14th in the table and increased the pressure on the head coach.",
      "Ahead of Saturday's game at Old Trafford, read the full transcript as Amorim outlines his determination to turn Manchester United's form around, denies reports he is unhappy in Manchester, and argues that he used 4-4-2, rather than a back three, against Brentford.",
      "AMORIM: \"Because the worst thing in this job is to not win games. That is the same feeling I had in Casa Pia when I lost in the third division.",
      "\"And then it's a job. Of course, it's a dream to be here. And I want to continue here. And I want to fight for this. But the problem is now, what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job.",
      "\"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.",

      "\"That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here.",
      "\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's really important because there is no one in the world that can read everything and listen to everything about people that understand football and not be influenced by that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to listen and to see all the games because I know that I see the game more times than all those guys together because they have to see all the games in the Premier League and give an opinion.",
      "\"My opinion is completely different because I see the games, I see the training, I understand my players, I understand what I'm doing and I follow my job this way because it's impossible to survive in this club, listening to all the things.",

      "\"Nobody in my family talks about that. We love living in England. You have no idea what is abuse here because you are so polite compared to my country where we are losing. So you have no idea. My family is really happy.",
      "\"It's just me and my family that is struggling because I hate losing and I hate failing.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"I'm not concerned about that and nobody here is naive. We understand that we need results to continue the project.",
      "\"We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it's hard. That balance is really hard. So I'm not concerned about that.",
      "\"What I want is to see my team winning or losing playing the same way and we are not doing that, in the simple things of playing football that anyone can do.",

      "AMORIM: \"It doesn't matter. I just need one more game because football is like that. We need one more game, we win, we get some hope and then in the next game we'll see.",
      "\"That is always the same thing, so I don't need a lot of time. It doesn't matter for me, it's just the next game that matters and the next game is [Saturday]. We just have to perform and we need to win.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's the results. Imagine that we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don't miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine that this happened.",
      "\"The trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different.",
      "\"So, if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you are doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach, everything. And that is normal.",
      "\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.",
      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.",
      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",
      "\"And they have to believe in me because I watch more [Man Utd] games than you guys combined.\"",

      "Saturday 4 October 2025 15:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."
