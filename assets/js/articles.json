      "Ruben Neves has been linked with a shock move to Real Madrid(Image: 2025 Getty Images)",
      "Ruben Neves has recently set his sights set on a dream move to Real Madrid this month despite continued links to Manchester United and a possible return to the Premier League.",
      "The former Wolves playmaker, 28, currently plies his trade in Saudi Arabia after joining Al-Hilal back in the summer of 2023. But with Neves' contract up in the summer, he is understood to have suitors who are ready to bring him back to Europe before the end of the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "Manchester United are among those who have been linked and the Red Devils are looking for midfield reinforcements. It has now emerged, though, that Neves has eyes for another club amid interest from Old Trafford.",
      "According to Carrusel Deportivo, via AS, Neves has been identified as a target by staff at Real, who feel they need to sign a creative midfielder. Neves, despite having a lucrative contract offer on the table from Al-Hilal, is keen on the move - but not everybody is.",
      "The report adds that the Real Madrid board 'have doubts' over Neves and that the fact they would be able to land him on a free transfer in the summer means they would be unwilling to pay a substantial fee to sign him, making a deal unlikely.",
      "Neves boasts Premier League experience from his time with Wolves(Image: Getty Images)",
      "With Real not planning to do any significant deal during the current transfer window, Neves could decide to see out the remainder of his deal and assess all options in the summer.",
      "Manchester United could also be quiet in January after parting company with Ruben Amorim. They have since replaced him with Michael Carrick but the former United midfielder is only on a contract until the end of the season, at which point they are expected to recruit Amorim's permanent successor.",
      "With Carrick effectively in interim charge as things stand, the club could choose to refrain from doing any significant business before the February 2 deadline, although it has also been claimed the hierarchy are open to making a midfield addition in the window.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jadon Sancho briefly experienced life under Michael Carrick in 2021(Image: Soccrates Images, Getty Images)",
      "Jadon Sancho has already privately expressed his views on Manchester United's interim manager Michael Carrick. The 44-year-old was named as United's temporary boss last week until the end of the season, stepping into the shoes of the recently dismissed Ruben Amorim.",
      "Last weekend's 2-0 victory over Manchester City was his first game of this spell but not his first in charge of United. In 2021, he took over after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked before the halfway point in the season.",
      "Former England international Carrick took the reins for three matches before Ralf Rangnick's appointment, securing two wins and a draw. One of his players was Sancho, at the time a relatively new face at Old Trafford having joined for £73million just months earlier.",
      "While Sancho's time at Old Trafford has proved challenging on the whole, Carrick made a lasting positive impact on the winger. This was despite the pair only working together for a short period of time.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "This impact became evident when Carrick took over as Middlesbrough boss in October 2022. One of his players that season, Chuba Akpom, revealed what his friend Sancho told him about the manager.",
      "Akpom, whose 28 goals that season made him the top scorer in the second tier, told club media: \"No [I wasn't concerned about Carrick's arrival], I was actually really excited because a good friend of mine is Jadon Sancho at Manchester United and he had nothing but good things to say about the manager, so I kind of knew already what to expect from the gaffer. But I didn't know it'd go this well.\"",
      "Following his impressive performances, Akpom earned a major transfer to Ajax that summer. Carrick stayed on Teesside until 2025, though, when he was sacked after a 10th-place finish in the Championship.",
      "Chuba Akpom celebrating with Michael Carrick at Middlesbrough(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Sancho, meanwhile, has endured difficulties in Manchester under various managers before a falling out with Erik ten Hag resulted in him being loaned back to former club Borussia Dortmund during the second half of the 2023/24 campaign. He briefly returned for the 2024 Community Shield but was soon on the way out again.",
      "Sancho, now 25 years of age, spent last term on loan at Chelsea but saw the Blues pay United £5m to get out of making his switch permanent. The winger has been on loan at Aston Villa since the beginning of this campaign and is anticipated to depart United in the summer when his existing contract runs out.",
      "Whether Carrick will contemplate offering the England international another opportunity remains uncertain, despite previously praising him. \"He's a terrific player, Jadon,\" the manager said in 2021.",
      "Sancho scored for United in Carrick's caretaker spell in 2021(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"He's never happier than when the ball's at his feet, he's trying to create things, going at defenders, linking inside with forwards, creating chances and scoring goals.",
      "\"Who's to say how far he can go? Hopefully he fulfils every little bit of potential that he has. The potential he's got is massive, if he keeps doing the right things and keeps on the right track, then he's got a great chance.\"",

      "Referee Anthony Taylor had issued Dalot a booking for the tackle on Doku in the 11th minute, where the score was goalless at the time, but told to wait to restart the game while Craig Pawson on VAR checked the decision.",
      "The check concluded that a yellow card for Dalot would remain unchanged, with the United defender allowed to continue the game. United won the game 2-0 in the Manchester derby thanks to second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu.",

      "\"It's a subjective judgment…but I'm absolutely aligned that once that decision is taken on the field, we leave it as referee's call and we don't intervene with the VAR.\"",

      "Kleberson has explained that Manchester United would be wise to build their team around Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha, while also urging his former club not to spend big in the January transfer window. It looks to be a busy month for Michael Carrick at Old Trafford, who has stepped into an interim head coaching role until season's end.",
      "While his first game in charge saw the Red Devils run out 2-0 winners over Manchester City at the weekend, fans worldwide will be waiting patiently to see whether Carrick will be as active off the pitch. While a number of Premier League clubs have been linked with various arrivals and exits as of recent, the pace at United has been far slower.",
      "While there has been speculation on loan moves for Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo, it seems as though both men are set to stay put for the rest of the season. Elsewhere, there has been very little talk of new arrivals, with Carrick looking increasingly likely to stick with his current crop of talent.",
      "\"If you try to bring someone now, probably those guys are going to be waiting for some coach leaving, so they can think, ‘Okay, now's the time to get it back.’ And then some guys get it and say, ‘Oh no, my gosh, that's my time, there’s someone coming now.’ I think they need to keep those guys, just put like a juice on those guys now.",
      "\"And then say, ‘Guys, it's with us, man. With us. Let's put everything we have, let's play for Reds, and then try to bring everything you can to win those games and finish the season in a good position for the club.'\"",
      "When asked if United should hold off on transfers until the summer, Kleberson called on Carrick to do just that and leave it to the club to sort at the end of the season when his contract ends.",
      "Kleberson responded: \"Exactly, because the mistakes are already made, you know what I mean? It's tough to fix now.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Elsewhere, Kleberson explained that the club should be looking to build around Fernandes and Cunha going forward, explaining how the two could be the key to turning the tide in the Premier League and Europe. When asked about how his compatriot is fairing since his summer transfer from Wolves, he said: \"I believe he's doing well, you know?",
      "\"The problem is when the team and club doesn't move well - it affects, unfortunately, the field. Even the players say, no, it doesn't affect the field, but it's unfortunately affecting. And then when he moved to United, he went with a lot of confidence.",
      "Kleberson has spoken about Manchester United(Image: Getty Images Sport)",
      "\"He played well in the beginning, he got back in the Brazilian national team. He played also so well in the Brazilian national team. He's a classic player. I think the combination he and Bruno is really good.",
      "\"I think United has to think, 'Who's the next player going to be around those two guys?'... The puzzle [of the team], they can get it closer together? And [when they do] then the seasons go really, really consistently because those two are really, really good players.\"",
      "At the time of writing, United sit fifth in the Premier League standings with nine wins, eight draws and five losses to show for their efforts this season. Up next is a trip to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, January 25, to face Mikel Arteta's leading Arsenal.",

      "Man United are set to miss out on one transfer target(Image: (Photo by Darren Staples / AFP via Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United's search for midfield reinforcements this summer could hit a snag regarding one potential target.",
      "According to The Sun, Premier League rivals Sunderland have no plans to sell United transfer target Noah Sadiki during the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old joined the 'Black Cats' last summer from Belgian outfit Union Saint-Gilloise for approximately £15m, and has impressed since making the move.",
      "This has apparently caught the eye of Man United and their recruitment department, who have been scouting potential long-term successors for Casemiro as he enters the twilight of his Old Trafford career. Sadiki features on a shortlist of possible targets that includes Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton, and Elliot Anderson, all of whom have made strong starts to their Premier League careers in central midfield. Barcelona's Marc Casado has also been reported as a potential option in the past 24 hours.",
      "However, the Sunderland midfielder is apparently considered \"untouchable\", with no sum of money likely to persuade the Black Cats to sell the player, who is contracted until 2030. Earlier reports suggested that United were considering a swap arrangement that could have involved Manuel Ugarte departing the club, with the Uruguayan midfielder potentially leaving alongside a cash offer.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "However, with that avenue now apparently closed off, the club's bosses will need to find alternative approaches to their transfer dealings. It also brings into question the future of Ugarte for United, just three transfer windows on from his sensational switch from PSG.",
      "Roughly £42m was paid in 2024 to land the Uruguayan international, who was viewed as an upgrade in the central ranks. He is yet to prove that in his time at Old Trafford, however, having become a squad player who has failed to stamp his mark on a starting place in the first-team.",
      "Former manager Ruben Amorim addressed the struggles that Ugarte faced back in November, when he said: \"No, I understand [Ugarte's performances]. You can sense that a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle, and they are struggling, he is struggling in the moment.",
      "\"But it is our job to try to help our players, and again, everything can change, and you saw it five weeks ago, the environment (at the club) was completely different. So I know that Ugarte is struggling in the moment, and my job is trying to help him to feel as a player, like I felt when he was a Sporting player, for example, but it is a different world, and he needs to adapt, and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - JANUARY 11: Manuel Ugarte of Manchester United during the Emirates FA Cup Third Round match between Manchester United and Brighton & Hove Albion on January 11, 2026 in Manchester, England. (Photo by Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)(Image: (Photo by Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images))",
      "Those struggles continued through the last two months of the manager's reign, up until his dismissal. It remains to be seen whether he can be given a new lease of life under a different set of management staff, or whether Ugarte now faces the real possibility of another transfer switch.",
      "Despite questions over the midfield, there is some optimism that, for now at least, Kobbie Mainoo can become pivotal to the team following his recent recall under caretaker manager Michael Carrick, before focus shifts to other midfield targets in the summer window. The academy product wasn't a regular in the starting XI under Amorim, which sparked discussions about a potential January departure to secure more playing time.",
      "Following the manager's eventual dismissal and the appointment of an interim boss, Mainoo has been given an instant second chance with a superb 90-minute display in the Manchester derby against Manchester City. \"I thought Kobbie [Mainoo] was great in there alongside Case [Casemiro],\" Carrick said in a glowing review of the youngster after the game.",
      "\"I thought between the two of them. I thought it gave us a strong foundation really with Licha [Lisandro Martinez] and Harry [Maguire]. I felt it was a game for experience and knowing what it feels like.\"",
      "Currently, it appears the preferred midfield setup could feature Mainoo and Casemiro in the holding roles, whilst club skipper Bruno Fernandes is deployed in the attacking midfielder position. That could well see Man United through to the end of the season in excellent form, but the broader view is of a team prepared to make a marquee signing in midfield going forward.",
      "Whether they settle on Wharton, Anderson, Baleba, or another player for the position remains to be seen, but it's obvious where the priority lies.",

      "Football legend David Beckham received a flood of congratulations last year when it was revealed he would be knighted. But his eldest son, Brooklyn, was notably silent.",
      "This action, or lack thereof, takes on new significance in light of Brooklyn's recent statement confirming his estrangement from the rest of the family. The 26-year-old shared a lengthy post on Monday saying he \"doesn't want to reconcile with his parents,\" accusing them of controlling him for most of his life and \"trying endlessly\" to separate him from his wife, Nicola.",
      "Speculation about a rift between the Beckhams and their eldest son has been rife over the past year. This latest development sheds more light on why Brooklyn didn't publicly acknowledge what his father described in two words as his \"proudest moment.\"",
      "Instead of commenting on his father's knighthood, the former Arsenal academy player posted an Instagram story promoting pretzel pita chips shortly after the announcement. Many online observers found it disrespectful that he remained silent on his father's significant achievement.",
      "It's understood Brooklyn and David did not discuss his inclusion in the Honours list. Moreover, it's believed Brooklyn found out about the award through the media, just like everyone else.",
      "Manchester United and England icon Beckham is said to have chased a knighthood for years before finally achieving his ambition. Leaked emails from 2017 appeared to reveal his blunt reaction after discovering he'd been snubbed yet again.",
      "Following his exclusion, Beckham reportedly let rip at the committee in a message to a colleague. His feelings were allegedly captured in two particularly harsh words as he's said to have branded the committee \"unappreciative c***s.\"",
      "If true, it offers a glimpse into a different facet of Beckham's character rarely displayed publicly. The former footballer turned model and Inter Miami co-owner is typically seen sporting his trademark smile and maintaining the heartthrob image he's cultivated over the years.",
      "Beckham finally got his wish after receiving his knighthood from King Charles last year(Image: PA)",
      "Yet Brooklyn's claims hint at other layers to both the 50-year-old and his wife, Victoria. In his public remarks, Brooklyn described multiple fraught episodes that prompted him to distance himself from his family.",
      "Beyond the purported controlling conduct and apparent grudge against his wife, Brooklyn recalled the turmoil surrounding their 2022 nuptials. It's claimed fashion entrepreneur Victoria had agreed to design Nicola's wedding gown, only to withdraw at the last minute, forcing her to scramble for a replacement.",
      "Brooklyn also slammed his mother for hijacking what should have been a romantic first dance with his wife. Instead, Victoria allegedly arranged it so she was positioned on the dance floor and \"danced very inappropriately\" with her eldest son.",
      "Brooklyn and David were believed to be close before the drama that's unfolded in recent years(Image: Getty)",
      "He continued by saying the episode left its mark and that he had \"never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in his entire life.\" The Daily Mail obtained a statement from wedding guest Stavros Agapiou, who backed up the account and confirmed Brooklyn is \"telling the truth.\"",
      "By opting not to publicly congratulate his dad on his knighthood, Brooklyn appeared to maintain his position in separating himself from the family \"brand.\" And it demonstrates just how furious he is with his father and mother during what was meant to be one of the happiest moments in their lives.",

      "Roy Keane's comments about Michael Carrick's wife Lisa raised eyebrows(Image: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/WireImage)",
      "Former Manchester United star Roy Keane has faced fresh criticism for his remarks about Michael Carrick's wife Lisa. Keane made the comments as Carrick, who joined United as a long-term successor to the Irish midfielder in the 2000s, began his role as United's interim manager for the second half of the season.",
      "\"Well his wife can always come in because she has got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She is probably doing the team talk,\" Keane said on Stick to Football.",
      "Keane has been a vocal critic of United's decision to appoint Carrick as Ruben Amorim's successor for the rest of the campaign. His comment about the Englishman's other half struck a chord in particular with former Ireland international Eamon Dunphy.",
      "\"Roy Keane greeted Michael Carrick's moment by having a go at Carrick's wife, Lisa,\" Dunphy wrote for the Irish Mirror. \"Keane is becoming an embarrassment - to football, to himself, and perhaps to Ireland.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Dunphy continued: \"This stems from a row between Carrick's wife and Keane back in 2014. But it is not right - ever - to attack a woman in a high-profile situation like this. It is cheap. It is lazy. And it is wrong.",
      "\"I feel ashamed for football, and for Ireland, because of Keane's antics. I feel for Carrick. He has taken on a big job at Old Trafford. He is trying to rebuild something meaningful. Keane, meanwhile, is doing adverts where he insults people for money, becoming a parody of the figure he once was.",
      "\"But to have your wife publicly attacked by Roy Keane crosses a line. It is too much. And it says far more about Roy Keane than it ever will about Michael Carrick.\"",
      "Roy Keane has been vocal in his discussions about former club Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "On the pitch, Carrick kicked off his tenure with a dominant victory over Manchester City in the Premier League. The ex-England midfielder had previously held the interim position in 2021, bridging the gap between Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal and Ralf Rangnick's temporary appointment, though his latest result has already had some calling for him to take over permanently in the summer.",
      "United delivered one of their stand-out performances of late against City, putting a dent in their rivals' title aspirations in the process. Second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu sealed victory, but the home side also had further goals ruled out, while City's goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma helped keep the score down.",
      "\"Obviously, we had things we wanted to achieve in the game and the boys took it on but tactics are one thing and words another,\" Carrick said when asked about the win. \"You've got to put it on and make it happen, bring it live and everything today was spot on.",
      "\"Listen, I'm not going to say too much out of respect for [City manager] Pep Guardiola, he's such an unbelievable, incredible coach and they're such a good team. So it's not for me to pick them apart publicly. I think I wanted us to play to our strengths. We needed to be compact and needed the distances as short as possible between the units and between the positions.",
      "\"We needed to move as a team and, a few times, it got a little bit opened up but we still looked dangerous and I thought the front line were fantastic. It was everything what we would hope for, hence getting the good result.\"",

      "Rumours have resurfaced about Manchester United seeking new investment(Image: PA)",
      "Any prospective owners or investors in Manchester United would have to grapple with the club's staggering valuation if they wish to seal a deal. The Glazer family, who are the majority owners of United, have been on the receiving end of intense backlash from fans for their stewardship of the club since the Reds' leveraged buyout in 2005 saddled it with significant debt - currently estimated at around £1.29 billion.",
      "British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a 27.7 per cent stake in United in a £1.25 billion deal at the start of 2024, following an agreement with the Glazers. The Ineos founder was granted control over footballing and strategic matters at the club; however, there is still chatter about potential investment at Old Trafford as future plans are being formulated.",
      "But former Premier League club chief executive Keith Wyness has recently expressed scepticism about new investment and believes the Glazers will have had talks. The ex-Everton and Aston Villa CEO suggests that Ratcliffe may have little influence in any potential takeover discussions at United and believes further investment will aid them in financing their new stadium project.",
      "Any potential interest would have to take into account the club's jaw-dropping value - currently estimated by Forbes at $6.6bn (£4.9bn) in May last year. This valuation places United second on the global list of clubs, trailing only Real Madrid at $6.7bn.",
      "In 2023, the Glazers were in discussions with Qatari billionaire Sheikh Jassim about a potential takeover, with the Nine Two Foundation established to facilitate the deal.",
      "A statement at the time declared: \"Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani today [Friday February 17] confirmed his submission of a bid for 100 per cent of Manchester United Football Club.",
      "\"The bid plans to return the club to its former glories both on and off the pitch, and - above all - will seek to place the fans at the heart of Manchester United Football Club once more.",
      "\"The bid will be completely debt free via Sheikh Jassim's Nine Two Foundation, which will look to invest in the football teams, the training centre, the stadium and wider infrastructure, the fan experience and the communities the club supports.",
      "\"The vision of the bid is for Manchester United Football Club to be renowned for footballing excellence, and regarded as the greatest football club in the world. More details of the bid will be released, when appropriate, if and when the bid process develops.\"",
      "However, the bid never materialised, with the Glazers choosing instead to sell a minority stake to Ratcliffe. It appears that Jassim has now abandoned any plans for a takeover through the company.",
      "Companies House records reveal that the Nine Two Foundation was voluntarily dissolved in September 2024, following notice given three months prior.",
      "Ratcliffe has embarked on a cost-cutting mission since investing in the club(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "There is currently nothing concrete to suggest that United are considering a takeover or exploring fresh investment, but the fact that Ratcliffe's tenure has been dominated by cost-cutting amid huge plans to splash out on a new 100,000-seater stadium is something worth noting.",
      "Updates on United's stadium plans, which were confirmed in March last year, have been few and far between since the turn of the year, with the club still considering designs, funding and working on an agreement to buy the land around their current ground.",
      "The club's chief operating officer, Collette Roche, did, however, reveal some news last month, saying: “Constructive discussions are continuing with landowners around Old Trafford as we seek to assemble the land required to build a new stadium.",
      "“Design and planning will follow once we have clarity on the size and location of land available to build on.”",

      "Sources close to the teenager believe he is widely regarded as among the best 2009-born talents in all of world football.",
      "The reason Belinho has just signed with NK Kustosija is that he was not prepared to pen a long-term professional contract with Dinamo which would have kept him at the club for at least three years with the option of a further two.",
      "The idea is that at NK Kustosija, whose U19 side also play in the top tier of Croatian football, he'll be able to develop freely and then move onto one of Europe's elite clubs once he's turned 18.",

      "Neville was granted a number of new signings in the close season, including former MLS top scorer Josef Martinez. Results didn't improve, though, leaving Beckham with a tough decision to make.",
      "\"Football management is temporary, we know at some point you're going to be moved on. That was my reason for being nervous when you took that job,\" Neville's older brother Gary told his sibling on It's Called Soccer! in 2024. \"Did you think about that at the beginning or did you just see it as an unbelievable opportunity?\"",
      "Phil replied: \"[It was] both, really. The big thing is that you're not just losing a football game but you feel like you're letting a friend down as well. Becks is really strong, he doesn't buckle and he's really loyal to the people he's close to.\"",
      "When reflecting on his sacking specifically, he said: \"The day I actually got fired was probably actually harder for David than it was for me. He really didn't want to do it, he was really emotional. I was emotional too but I knew it was coming so it was probably easier for me.\"",
      "Beckham's Inter Miami franchise would go on to win MLS Cup without Neville in 2025(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Inter Miami had won just five of their first 15 league games when Beckham approved a change of manager. Tata Martino took over midway through the 2023 season, when even the summer additions of Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets weren't enough to drag them back into the play-offs.",
      "It was a different story in 2024, though, with Martino leading the team to the Supporters' Shield - awarded to the team that finishes top in the regular season - but falling short in the play-offs. His successor, Javier Mascherano, finally delivered the club a first MLS Cup triumph in 2025.",
      "Phil Neville wasn't deterred from pursuing his managerial dream by the way things ended in Miami. He took over at Portland Timbers just months later and has led the club to the play-offs in each of his first two seasons.",

      "In the context of the achievements of many big clubs, United’s performances have not been great over the past decade or so, but they have not been disastrous. Their average finishing position in the Premier League since Sir Alex Ferguson left has been between fifth and sixth and they have won a couple of FA Cups, the EFL Cup twice and a Europa League.",

      "If it is a shift in attitude, it has probably been hastened by Keane’s comments about the Michael Carrick appointment and by the Scholes and Butt digs at Lisandro Martinez, to which the defender duly responded after his fine contribution to United’s derby win. The Scholes and Butt comments were a bit immature - and subsequently proven to be ill-advised - but they were hardly vicious.",
      "Martinez was entitled to respond and did so in a nicely pointed manner. It was good knockabout stuff.",

      "The Beckhams are back in the news this week after eldest son Brooklyn issued a bombshell statement severing ties with his parents. Murmurs of a family feud have rumbled on for months, and Brooklyn has now confirmed the divide after suggesting his mother and father have controlled him for much of his life, alleging they've also \"tried endlessly to ruin his relationship\" with his wife, Nicola.",
      "However, Rooney has a far different perception of the Beckhams after being invited around for dinner not long after joining Manchester United. David left for Real Madrid in 2003, one year before Rooney signed for United, but the former Everton striker nonetheless got to grips with how one of the biggest power couples on the planet behaved away from the spotlight.",
      "Speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show, he told Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd he even had an impromptu first meeting with Brooklyn himself as he recalled: \"I remember years ago we got invited to Becks' for dinner. It was me, Lamps (Frank Lampard) and a couple more players.",

      "Not stopping there with the behind-the-scenes reveals, he also shed light on Victoria's personality that may surprise some: \"He’s obviously a great lad, and Victoria’s such a lovely woman and funny. A lot funnier than people would think.\"",
      "Wayne Rooney joined United 12 months after David Beckham left for Real Madrid, but the pair were England team-mates for years(Image: PAUL BARKER/AFP/Getty Images)",

      "Another memorable segment saw Posh telling the camera she and her family grew up \"very working class\" before David poked his head around the door and told her to \"be honest.\" He then reminded his wife how she used to be dropped to school in a Rolls Royce, and her reaction made for one of the best moments in the series.",
      "There's little to laugh about regarding the Beckhams' current private dealings following Brooklyn's claims, however. And after failing to feature in the family's own Netflix series, there's speculation the oldest member of their brood may now get a series of his own to share his side of the story.",

      "Manchester United have been urged not to make Oliver Glasner their next manager following claims the job would be \"too big\" for him. United are currently on the hunt for a new permanent boss after sacking Ruben Amorim earlier this month.",
      "While Michael Carrick enjoyed an ideal start to life as the club's interim manager, Crystal Palace coach Glasner is among the names tipped to be Amorim's long-term replacement. The Austrian announced last week that he would be leaving the Eagles at the end of the season when his current contract expires.",
      "Glasner's position was placed under the spotlight further following Palace's 2-1 defeat to Sunderland in the Premier League as he slammed the club's decision to sell Marc Guehi to Manchester City. However, former United goalkeeper Ben Foster has questioned whether Glasner's success at Palace could realistically translate to Old Trafford.",
      "The ex-West Brom and Wrexham stopper also voiced concerns over tactical fit, warning Glasner could face the same issues Amorim encountered by sticking to his preferred system.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, Foster said: \"He's the favourite to go and get the Man United job, but I just don’t think it would work out for him. I think it's too big a job. He would try and play the same formation that he's trying to play at Crystal Palace with Man United and he hasn't got the players.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"If you see the way that Man United played at the weekend, it was 4-4-2 basically and Palace do not play that way. In fairness, the players that Palace have got are actually really good in those positions. They have got wing backs, but it won't work at Man United.\"",
      "Glasner fired shots at Palace bosses on Saturday, just days after announcing his intention to step down at the end of the season.",
      "He said: \"We feel like we're being abandoned completely. Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this. We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week?",
      "Oliver Glasner was left angry over Marc Guehi's departure from Crystal Palace(Image: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty Images)",
      "\"At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset. If your heart gets ripped out twice a year, with [Eberechi] Eze one day before a game in the summer and your captain one day before a game - I've just got no understanding.\"",
      "Quizzed over whether he might leave before the end of the campaign, he said: \"I don't know. I always have a huge appreciation for this group of players. I completely trust them. Their character is exceptional and we will stick together and turn around.",
      "\"I will never step back because these players deserve Oliver Glasner as their manager and leader and this is what I will do. Sometimes it would help if we had a little bit of support.\"",
      "Glasner's provocative remarks at the weekend are understood to have led Palace chiefs to consider dismissing the manager. However, it was ultimately decided not to remove him from his post after talks were held on Sunday.",

Their attendance or lack thereof at Victoria's 50th birthday and then David's caused quite the stir.",

      "Brooklyn included in his statement that he does not wish to reconcile with his family, including father David, but the former England star posted his own statement with a vastly different tone just last year.",
      "In June 2025, Beckham took to Instagram with a picture of his four children on Father's Day and accompanied it with a heartfelt caption, which acted as a message to his kids.",

      "\"My parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn't stopped,\" wrote Brooklyn. \"Weeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife, and our future children.",

      "Lisandro Martinez has ended up in a war of words with two former Manchester United greats(Image: )",
      "The Gary Nevilles are at it again. Okay, this time it wasn't actually Neville who incurred the wrath of people at Manchester United, but the podcast personality and once-upon-a-time right-back was used as shorthand in Ruben Amorim's final press conference, and we all know who and what he means.",
      "Podcast culture is the latest battleground between the modern-day United and its greats of the past and no club seems to have it quite as bad. When the Class of '92 came towards the end of their playing days, there was always going to be intrigue at what comes next, but nobody had annoying podcasters on their bingo card.",
      "That is how they are often viewed at United, and the style of a podcast - lighthearted, engaging, different - is causing another pinchpoint. Just witness the war of words between Lisandro Martinez and Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes over the past few days as an example.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "If Martinez thought his forthright response after Saturday's derby day victory would be the end of it, he was mistaken. Butt and Scholes escalated the drama on Monday in the latest edition of The Good, The Bad & The Football.",
      "The former United midfielders tore into Martinez for having the temerity to hit back at what he clearly felt were disrespectful comments about how Erling Haaland would bully him at Old Trafford on Sunday. Part of the issue here is the format. Podcasts are different to TV analysis, and the market is so saturated that you have to stand out.",
      "As Butt said, the comments about Haaland picking Martinez up and running with him clearly weren't serious. It's the kind of thing you can't say on TV or radio, but can on a podcast. It's supposed to be funny. If anything, the biggest problem with those comments was their inaccuracy. Martinez has had several excellent games against Haaland in the past.",
      "Now that the Argentine has responded, Butt is telling him to \"f***ing grow up\". Scholes, it should be said, was much more measured, but there is no doubt the fanbase is firmly in the corner of Martinez here.",
      "Discontent at former players throwing out digs in the media has been rising recently. Podcast sofas, radio booths and pundit chairs are stacked with Old Trafford title-winners and all of them are competing to get that viral clip on social media.",
      "But here's the thing. Supporters would have a great deal more respect for the likes of Butt and Scholes if they turned their attention to the real problem at Old Trafford: an ownership regime that continues to hold the club back. The shoddy mistakes under Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the years of waste under the Glazers are a far bigger problem than whether Martinez is tall enough to mark Haaland.",
      "On this subject, they are often quiet. There was a period around the European Super League when criticism grew, and Neville has raised it occasionally since, but for others, it seems to be a topic they are desperate to avoid. Far easier to take shots at the current players.",
      "Scholes said in 2023 that the Glazers had backed every manager they had hired at Old Trafford, which is a very basic view of a club that has been less than the sum of its parts and rarely invested at the right times. Butt spent nine years of his post-playing career at United before leaving, and three years ago, he said he was \"sick of people upstairs telling me about football.\"",
      "There is still an opportunity to go further, however. The ownership structure at Old Trafford remains a mess and further protests are planned at the next home game. The idea of Ratcliffe and the Glazers working together to deliver success feels unlikely.",
      "Ahead of that Fulham fixture, it will be interesting to see whether the club's former players confront the elephant in the room. Martinez vs Butt and Scholes has been great drama and I'm sure their numbers will have gone up this week. But many United fans would like to hear their views on the owners as well as the players.",

      "Dorgu scored another important goal in the Manchester derby.(Image: 2026 Visionhaus)",
      "In November, Patrick Dorgu milled about Carrington's second floor to fulfil a sponsorship duty. He was yards away from the press conference room, blissfully unaware that his manager had just knifed him.",
      "\"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety,\" said Amorim. The bruising quote was splashed on back pages and spread like wildfire on social media.",
      "Amorim had explained Manchester United were conceding too many goals because his players were \"really soft.\" That was the standout line of the press conference until an innocuous last question about Dorgu.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "When Amorim was sacked at the beginning of the month, his ruthless comment about Dorgu was cited by United sources, who admitted that senior club figures had been unhappy with it.",
      "Amorim's forthright nature was brilliant for journalists, who were guaranteed a headline when he spoke, but less so for the people who mattered. The 40-year-old had a sharp tongue and was not afraid to speak his mind, which eventually led to talking himself out of a job after a final bombshell at Elland Road.",
      "Dorgu was still among the players who wished Amorim well after his sacking was confirmed. \"Thank you for everything, Mister. All the best in the future,\" he posted in an Instagram story.",
      "The message spoke volumes about Dorgu's maturity - and there are further examples. Last season, United were awarded a penalty against Real Sociedad in the Europa League, but Dorgu tried to overturn the decision himself with the referee while it was checked by VAR because he hadn't been fouled.",
      "During the recent 2-2 draw against Burnley at Turf Moor, Dorgu just got on with it after being stamped on by Kyle Walker, when performing theatrics would have seen Walker sent off.",
      "Dorgu has character and demonstrated steeliness to shake off Amorim's criticism in November, which might have caused greater harm to a 21-year-old without the same mental fortitude.",
      "Dorgu has responded to Amorim's criticism.(Image: 2026 Simon Stacpoole/Offside)",
      "Instead of sulking, Dorgu has trained to prove Amorim wrong. A source said the Dane \"does loads of extras\" and credited him for working \"really hard\". It's understood there has been a focus on improving Dorgu's crosses, with an emphasis on him perfecting his technique during training at Carrington.",
      "United believe Dorgu's hard work is paying off. The Denmark international knew an opportunity to regain his starting role would emerge during the Africa Cup of Nations, and he's contributed two goals and two assists in six games, representing his hottest run of form yet since his transfer from Lecce.",
      "Dorgu provided a brilliant assist for Matheus Cunha at Villa Park, and he built on that performance by scoring a superb volley in a gritty 1-0 victory against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Following the Newcastle victory, he spoke to reporters and was asked how he dealt with Amorim's criticism, saying: \"Of course, it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player. And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Dorgu added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence, so I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up. My teammates help me as well.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes, along with other members of United's senior leadership group, spoke to Dorgu after Amorim's press conference comment and he received support from the players he is closest to in the United dressing room - Ayden Heaven, Leny Yoro and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Dorgu and Hojlund pictured at Carrington in July.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "Dorgu should feel more secure at Old Trafford after an encouraging month. There were growing doubts about whether he was cut out for United, but he has shown his mettle by delivering improved performances.",
      "He has looked at home playing on the wing, which started against Newcastle when Amorim played him on the flank. Newcastle's analysts in the press box were audibly confused at the start of the game, trying to work out where Dorgu was playing, and he popped up with the matchwinner.",
      "But Dorgu's recent performances on the wing may even surprise the data boffins who recommended his transfer from Lecce, as he has taken to the role like a duck to water.",
      "(Image: 2026 Copa)",
      "It helps that Dorgu briefly played on the wing for Lecce, but performing in the Premier League is a different kettle of fish. He is learning on the job at one of the most scrutinised institutions in the world, and it shouldn't be forgotten that he's only just turned 21.",
      "Dorgu's goal against Manchester City was further evidence of his progress. He was picked to start in a striker-less front free by Michael Carrick, who preferred him to Cunha, and he vindicated that selection.",
      "\"I think Cunha did the hard work,\" Dorgu modestly told MUTV about his goal. “I just believed in my teammate that he would put a good ball in there, and I just closed my eyes and hoped to win.”",
      "Dorgu has gradually found his feet in Manchester, settling in the city without family joining him. Throughout the summer, staff noticed a difference in him, noting his confidence had grown after a challenging first few months at the club, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "\"I think I learned a lot,\" said Dorgu of last season. \"It was difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season.\"",
      "Dorgu's confidence should receive another boost after his Manchester derby goal. He does not look very anxious any more.",

      "United are in the market for a midfielder, so it comes as no surprise to see a connection to the England youth international.",
      "Speaking to Teesside Live, Boro boss Kim Hellberg said: \"I like him very much and if I could decide I would say ‘not for sale!’ But that will not come down to me. But I think he wants to stay here, you can see him being very, very happy and how he works. So hopefully he’s with us this year and further on.",
      "“He is very important, of course. He’s a top player and a top person. He is top in every aspect of the game. I think he’s defending good, he’s good offensively, he’s helping his team-mates and I’ve said that before.",
      "“I think his most impressive thing is how he is as a person because he could be easily, like you start thinking about other things when you get those big clubs that are after you.",
      "“They should be after him, because he’s a top player and I think he would be able to play in a lot of Premier League teams and do well, because that’s how good he is. That’s how good he is as a person and how good he is as a player.",
      "“But he’s been just staying so focused on everything, just helping everyone. It doesn’t matter, he helps absolutely everyone. Even if some of the players haven’t played, he helps them, he tries to coach them, he’s actually unbelievable.",
      "“It’s that I’m most impressed with because you can see him on the pitch and you just look at him and say, ‘Wow, that’s an absolutely top player.’ But to combine that by being that type of team person, team player, and human being, I think that is unbelievable.”",
      "Manchester United are reportedly considering two cut-price options as they look to strengthen their midfield. According to talkSPORT, AC Milan's Ruben Loftus-Cheek is on the Red Devils' radar.",

      "\"Some of the younger players in the squad like Ayden Heaven and Leny Yoro can learn from him, and that’s just as important as his role on the pitch.

      "Diogo Dalot avoided a red card during Manchester United's win over Manchester City(Image: )",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb remains unsure if Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku had enough force to warrant a red card in the Manchester derby, but believes VAR applied the correct process to reach the decision not to send the defender off.",
      "It came just 10 minutes into the clash between Manchester United and Manchester City, when the Portuguese international's tackle saw his boot land high on the leg of his counterpart.",
      "The on-pitch decision by referee Anthony Taylor was that of a foul, but with the belief that it only warranted a yellow card, rather than a straight red for serious foul play.",
      "VAR checked the challenge and came to the conclusion that the tackle wasn't worthy of a red card, with the audio confirming the thought process behind that call.",

      "Discussions followed between Pawson and his assistant, Adrian Holmes, about the speed of the contact, but they ultimately decided to stick with the on-field decision.",
      "Pawson confirmed: \"Yeah. Tayls [Anthony Taylor] confirming the yellow card for Manchester United 2 [Diogo Dalot]. He tries to play the ball, he misses it, and then he makes glancing contact onto the knee. There's no force or intensity, but he does catch him with a follow-through.\"",
      "It was a process that Webb believes is the right one, as he said on Match Officials Mic'd Up: \"Is there excessive force? Some will say, yes. I'm not quite there, but I can see that there could be.",
      "\"It's a subjective judgment…but I'm absolutely aligned that once that decision is taken on the field, we leave it as referee's call and we don't intervene with the VAR.\"",

      "While Guardiola was dismissive of the challenge, many of the pundits believed that it was the wrong decision not to brandish a red card to Dalot on the day.",
      "The likes of Alan Shearer and Roy Keane claimed that the tackle warranted a sending off, but Webb has made it clear that it was a subjective decision that followed the right process, regardless of the outcome.",

      "Middlesbrough midfielder Hayden Hackney has been linked with a surprise reunion with Michael Carrick at Man United.(Image: )",
      "Kim Hellberg is confident that Hayden Hackney will remain at Middlesbrough during this month's transfer window, despite inevitable speculation linking him with Manchester United. Hackney has continued to shine for Boro in their promotion campaign this season.",
      "His performances have naturally attracted Premier League interest this month, although no firm bids are understood to have materialised thus far.",
      "Recent reports have suggested Manchester United are monitoring the situation, with a potential £30 million move being discussed. The speculation intensified following Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach at Old Trafford last week.",
      "Carrick, of course, was the manager under whom Hackney truly established himself in Boro's first team, with the player frequently acknowledging how much he developed under the former England international.",
      "Nevertheless, the authenticity of Manchester United's pursuit remains unclear. The connection appears somewhat predictable, whilst Carrick's initial deal at Old Trafford only runs until the season's conclusion, reports Teesside Live.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "As for Hackney, he has shown no indication of being unsettled by the transfer talk, with Hellberg making it abundantly clear that the 23-year-old is content to remain at his boyhood club, leaving the Boro manager optimistic about retaining him this transfer window.",
      "Hellberg said: \"I like him very much and if I could decide I would say 'not for sale!' But that will not come down to me. But I think he wants to stay here, you can see him being very, very happy and how he works. So hopefully he's with us this year and further on.",
      "\"He is very important, of course. He's a top player and a top person. He is top in every aspect of the game. I think he's defending good, he's good offensively, he's helping his team-mates and I've said that before.",
      "Michael Carrick and Hayden Hackney(Image: Craig Thomas/News Images)",
      "\"I think his most impressive thing is how he is as a person because he could be easily, like you start thinking about other things when you get those big clubs that are after you.",
      "\"They should be after him, because he's a top player and I think he would be able to play in a lot of Premier League teams and do well, because that's how good he is. That's how good he is as a person and how good he is as a player.",
      "\"But he's been just staying so focused on everything, just helping everyone. It doesn't matter, he helps absolutely everyone. Even if some of the players haven't played, he helps them, he tries to coach them, he's actually unbelievable.",
      "\"It's that I'm most impressed with because you can see him on the pitch and you just look at him and say, 'Wow, that's an absolutely top player.' But to combine that by being that type of team person, team player, and human being, I think that is unbelievable.\"",
      "When asked about potentially losing Hackney during the current transfer window, Hellberg brushed aside the speculation as something he wasn't entertaining at this point.",
      "He added: \"I'm working with him while he is here. I don't think he's going anywhere. He's here, he's working hard, he's training hard, so that's the only thing I think about. I cannot go and think, 'Oh what will happen if he goes?'. It's too many thoughts.",
      "\"I need to focus on every day here, and he's here and he's doing it great. Then, of course, that's up to everyone around to see what will happen. But again, he's important for us and he's a top player.\"",

      "Manchester United's interim manager Michael Carrick has implemented a new rule already(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has already introduced a one change at Manchester United after his predecessor Ruben Amorim 'banned' three things before his sacking.",
      "Old Trafford legend Carrick took over from caretaker manager Darren Fletcher last week, stepping in as United’s interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "It came after Amorim was dismissed from his position as head coach 14 months into his tenure, having struggled to effectively implement his tactical philosophy and reportedly clashed with United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, over transfers.",
      "In his first match at the helm, Carrick guided the Red Devils to an impressive 2-0 victory over Manchester City, with the team's performance echoing the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson. After just three days of training under their new manager, United seemed transformed, defending valiantly and using wing-play to devastating effect.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "This marked shift could be down to a new rule Carrick quickly implemented upon taking charge. As reported by the Daily Mail, the 44-year-old has made training sessions at Carrington shorter but more intense in an effort to improve results this season.",
      "The players' reaction is understood to have been positive and it was 'immediately clear' from the first session that there was a different atmosphere on the training ground. The squad were also introduced to the new coaching team, made up of Steve Holland - who arrived as Carrick's No.2 - along with Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans as first‑team coaches.",
      "There is believed to be an effective combination of expertise and characters among the backroom team and a 'positive dynamic' seems to be developing already. Training sessions have also featured increased focus on one-to-one work with players and the squad are understood to be impressed by the attention to detail being shown.",
      "It remains unclear whether Carrick has scrapped the three bans previously put in place by Amorim during the Portuguese manager's reign or whether he has kept them. One of Amorim's core principles at United involved banning players from treating international breaks as holiday opportunities, with Marcus Rashford and Casemiro notably facing scrutiny for flying across the Atlantic when they had only been granted a few days away from training to rest.",
      "Ruben Amorim's non-negotiables didn't bring success(Image: Nick Potts/PA Wire)",
      "Discussing the situation, Amorim said: \"Would I set a different structure? Yes, for sure. But we cannot put this on the players. They told them they have five days off so they can fly anywhere. Because nobody in the club says you cannot fly. So we cannot, this time, put that on Rash or Case.",
      "\"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It’s my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Amorim also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays, highlighting his determination to improve his squad's physical conditioning. The Portuguese manager acknowledged early in his tenure that it was \"impossible\" to win the Premier League without a team that works hard.",
      "\"You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won’t win,\" he said. \"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won’t win.\"",
      "Manchester United looked rejuvenated in Carrick's first game in charge(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "His third rule targeted his coaching staff, forbidding them from delivering overly complex instructions to players. The former Sporting CP manager insisted that if he couldn't convey a tactical concept in one sentence, it shouldn't be communicated until simplified.",
      "Reports suggested the approach was initially well-received by the players, given the 'clarity' of his instructions. However, this didn't translate into success on the pitch, as his players found it difficult to adjust to his 3-4-3 system even after a year in charge.",
      "It seems the players have had no such trouble adapting to Carrick's instructions, as shown by their impressive performance in the Manchester derby. They will face an even tougher test with a trip to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, where they will take on league leaders Arsenal.",

      "Manchester United beat Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford to thrust themselves firmly back into the top four race in Michael Carrick's first game of his second spell in charge.",
      "Carrick's side produced a dominant performance against City and second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu sealed a deserved victory.",
      "United had created better chances in the first half and were on top throughout. Gianluigi Donnarumma produced a string of fine saves to keep City in the game.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "This is how the United players rated:",
      "Senne Lammens: Lost his bearings to needlessly concede a first-half corner but made amends with a save from Max Alleyne. Good hands in the second half. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Booked for a reckless early challenge on Jeremy Doku and then a poor pass straight out of play, but did well to recover his poise after that. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Should probably have scored early in the game but excellent defensively against Erling Haaland. A real front-foot performance. 8",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Superb sliding block on Haaland early in the second half. Read the game well and was good on the ball. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Booked in the early stages as well but coped well with Antoine Semenyo, who had Phil Foden in support in the first half. Intelligent performance. 7",
      "Casemiro: Should have scored, but excellent recovery tackle on Haaland after Kobbie Mainoo gave the ball away. A magnificent holding midfield performance. 9",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Lovely shimmy past Semenyo a reminder of his talents. A bit careless with a loose pass to Haaland in the second half but deserves a run in the team. 7",
      "Amad: A real livewire. Tormented Nathan Ake and then got Nico O'Reilly booked inside three minutes. Could have easily had a goal and was a threat throughout. Hit the post late on. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Unlucky with the narrowest of offside calls. A sublime pass to create a chance for Dorgu and perfect pass for the goal. Bruno at his best. 8",
      "Patrick Dorgu: A surprise selection but what an impact. Sharp on the ball, good first-half volley and really alert to get the second goal. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Exceptional work rate and clever movement to try and pull City's defenders out of position. Good volley to test Donnarumma and clinical with his next chance. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Made an impact at both ends of the pitch. Big tackle on the edge of his own area and assist for Dorgu's goal. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Little time to make an impact after coming on for the shattered Casemiro. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Thought he had scored late on but ruled out for offside. 7",
      "Ayden Heaven: A late introduction. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Malacia, J. Fletcher, Sesko",

      "Lisandro Martinez has admitted to being completely awed by Michael Carrick’s immediate impact at Manchester United and the way he set up his coaching team. The Reds claimed a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday in the Premier League in Carrick’s first match in charge.",
      "United appointed Carrick as the club’s interim head coach until the end of the season, following Ruben Amorim’s exit earlier this month and Darren Fletcher’s brief spell in the dugout.",
      "Goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu secured the three points for United as Carrick's men played their rivals off the pitch at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby.",
      "The game was Mbeumo’s first match for United on his return to club duty after starring for his country at the Africa Cup of Nations, with Amad Diallo also making his return to the squad.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Martinez played the full 90 minutes for United and helped the Reds keep a clean sheet against City, who had Erling Haaland and January signing Antoine Semenyo in their starting line-up.",
      "After the victory over City, Martinez praised the impact that Carrick has made despite only being appointed on Wednesday, three days before United’s clash in the Manchester derby.",
      "“Three days, unbelievable,” Martinez told Stadium Astro.",
      "“First of all, play with the ball, don’t be scared of the ball, having composure with the ball, play with confidence.",
      "“We had to defend with our lives and when we play we had to play with confidence and I think we did it.",
      "“Three goals, with a minimal offside, I think we deserved this win. But what [Michael] Carrick did with his staff was unbelievable, especially in a short time, that’s why I’m impressed about that.”",
      "United’s next match will now see them take on Premier League leaders Arsenal next weekend, with the Gunners being forced to settle for a point in the goalless draw with Nottingham Forest on Saturday.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Lisandro Martinez revealed that Michael Carrick told the squad to use the support of Old Trafford to inspire them to a win over Manchester City in the Premier League. The Reds came into the derby with the pressure on after Ruben Amorim's departure and recent disappointing results.",
      "However, they looked like the team with more confidence and could have been 2-0 up at the break had it not been for tight offside calls against Amad and Bruno Fernandes. United kept up the pressure in the second half and it finally told in the 65th minute.",
      "Following a City free kick, United hit the visitors on the counter with Fernandes laying it off for Bryan Mbeumo to slot home. The result was put beyond doubt 11 minutes later when Matheus Cunha's cross was tapped in by Patrick Dorgu. Mason Mount thought he had made it three but Cunha was offside in the build-up.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "City found it difficult to break down the United defence and Martinez explained how they managed to keep their forwards quiet. \"When you play against this kind of players, the team defends,\" he said. \"Not just one or two players. Today we defended so well. We were so compact all the time and then you have the confidence to go into the duels.",
      "\"You feel today a different energy in the eyes of the players. Today the team won, that's the most important thing for me.\"",
      "On the result, he added: \"Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Being here with the fans, with the team, we really know how we suffer during the season.",
      "\"But the only way is putting the face here and showing here who we are. Today is the best moment to do it. Not just the players on the pitch, the staff, everyone was part of that.\"",

It is great for him, but I look at the staff he has brought in and we sit here every week and talk about Man United being the best of the best and at this moment in time I don’t see that, even with the appointment and the staff, but that doesn't mean to say they can’t get results.",

      "\"But when you see the replays, the replays aren't good; for me, that's a red card. I know they said don't go looking for things, but it's high, it's across the kneecap, it's a red card all day.\"",

      "Keane then shared his own opinion, insisted: \"Well maybe, but obviously they've had a look at it, do you know what I mean? We always argue about 'does it matter what minute it is? Is it too early? Too early to score a goal?",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different.

      "As part of the revamped formats for their three main competitions, UEFA have announced a revenue distribution system for how the total prize money of around £2.88billion would be allocated each season up to 2026/27.",
      "Just over £2.1bn (74.38%) will be distributed to clubs competing in the Champions League and Super Cup, £490.7m (17.02%) to teams participating in the Europa League, and £247.5m (8.6%) split between those in the Europa Conference League.",

Butt, with a season’s worth of Premier League appearances under his belt when Hansen made his quip in the summer of 1995, put on his big boy pants and eventually won six titles and the Champions League with United. Which makes him well placed to know what it takes and how hard the job is, even as part of a functional football club.",

Not that players of that era ever did because then they would have missed their rating out of 10 and that wasn’t the done thing, no matter how hard many might insist they didn’t read them.",
      "The internet was barely A Thing in 1995 when Hansen sent Butt spiralling. And he left Old Trafford in 2004 long before social media became the wall-to-wall, 24-hour scourge it now is for modern players.",
      "Of course, United are all too willing to capitalise on the exposure offered by the intensified spotlight. They sell themselves to players by offering a level of profile impossible to achieve anywhere but a handful of other clubs.",

      "The players often don’t help themselves and, sure, some have been given such a platform only because of the falling standards at Old Trafford. It is understandable why that so irks the likes of Butt and Scholes. But these lads were fortunate in the extreme to play for the greatest manager ever to do it.",

      "On Saturday evening I posted on BlueSky that I didn’t think Oliver Glasner would still be Crystal Palace manager at the end of the season.",
      "However, I am not particularly surprised that the club’s response to his outbursts has been to keep him in post. This is, after all, a club that values its principles enough to stick to them even when straying from them would have brought more success, at least in the short term, according to an article I wrote for this site back in 2016. Jesus of Montreal I didn’t realise it was that long ago.",
      "I have some sympathy for Glasner, because the timing of the decision to sell Marc Guehi (and therefore withdraw him from selection for the Sunderland game) was about as bad as it could get. At the same time, it seems hugely unlikely that he would not have been aware of the negotiations taking place, and must have expected this would happen eventually, so there’s no real excuse for being caught out by it.",
      "Glasner’s main mistake, however, is not spinning the story his way. His previous comments have suggested he wants about 20 first team-calibre players but wants to pick the same starting XI when everyone is fit. The first of those is the preserve of the biggest clubs, and while it’s a nice ambition to have, there’s a reason clubs the size of Palace tend to fall into the second group.",
      "While his squad on Saturday was, as Harry Redknapp might say, down to the bare bones, it was almost the perfect opportunity to make his case to the board: “I used the players I had available but they’re not ready for the Premier League yet, we need reserves who are”. Instead, he made no substitutions, even with his team 2-1 down with 20 minutes to play, a move that came across as petulance bordering on unprofessionalism.",
      "This is where I have sympathy for the board: by their standards they did spend significant money (approximately £50m) in the summer on fleshing out the squad, something they likely did knowing they’d receive a big fee for Eberechi Eze. For Glasner’s talk of having his heart broken, Palace did make a good start to the season, even without Eze. If the timeline we’ve been told about is correct, then Glasner informed the board he was going to leave at the end of his contract. Despite knowing this, they still broke their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson, a player described as a perfect fit for Glasner’s system, in January. It’s not reasonable to expect a club to spend a fortune every time their manager has a fit of pique, even if there will always be the lingering suspicion that a couple of judicious signings in the summer might have avoided all of this.",
      "Where the board deserve some credit is in (at least as of 3pm on Monday) not being so fragile of ego as to sack Glasner for his insolence. I don’t expect they’re happy about what their manager has said, but it’s definitely the reaction of a grown-up to treat it for what it is, an outburst rooted in frustration and a situation that can be mediated, if not fully repaired. It’s fair to say that plenty of club directors would not have given Glasner this much leeway and you have to wonder if potential employers are having second thoughts about appointing him.",

To be in the top 6 every year? Champions League every year? Title race? Ok, but ahead of who? There are 7 other teams who want all that and can realistically achieve it – which of those should Spurs be displacing? Which of the midtable sides – Everton, Sunderland, Brentford, Brighton, Palace, etc – are Spurs entitled to be ahead of?",
      "The fact bears repeating: Spurs finished *17th* last year. Obviously their fans immediately spring into action when this is pointed out: ‘oh, we won a European trophy!’ Brilliant, let me know how following in West Ham’s footsteps is working out for you. ‘Oh we were concentrating on Europe, we could have finished higher in the league, we just didn’t want to.’ Yeah ok. Maybe you shouldn’t have sacked the manager who masterminded this false rubbishness in that case? And just told him, g’day, we want to finish higher in the league this year mate. Yeah, 1st would be lovely actually mate. Have a VB.",
      "Some of this year’s games have been awful and hard to watch; some of the results have been terrible. Yes. And? Welcome to being a football fan. Everyone has to deal with this. Superclubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG, etc feel they’re entitled to skip this part of the experience. Spurs are not these clubs. Their fans think they are long-suffering. They are not.",
      "Look at the defensive players Frank has got to work with: Paulinha has the brain of a dog; Udogie and Porro are complete disgracia; Spence acts like a child on Supernanny. Spurs fans won’t hear anything said against their centre backs, but they are objectively average: Van der Ven can run fast and Romero kicks people and complains a lot, wow. Maybe stop people from scoring occasionally? And Vicario.",
      "But Frank is getting a better tune out of his back 6/7 than anyone since the last time Spurs finished above Arsenal. They’ve conceded over 60 goals for the last 3 seasons in a row; this year they’re on course to concede 50. And aside from Arsenal, they have the best away record in the league – a sign that when they can keep games tight and put the onus on the opposition, they can be successful. It’s not hard to find signs that Frank is actually improving this team, if anyone has the patience to look. Granted, not relative to the imaginary version of Tottenham that their mad fans have in their heads; but relative to the one in the real world that, apart from the worst set of promoted sides since the competition started, was the *worst team* in the premier league last season. Pretend this wasn’t true if it makes you feel better, knock yourself out.",
      "Obviously, Spurs’ problem in translating this quiet improvement into more points and better home form is, constructing coherent attacks and scoring a lot more goals. But how does a new manager fix this? Richarlison is their best attacking player. *Richarlison*. Unless Ryan Mason CDXXVII can give Maddison new legs and find a 20 goal a year striker down the back of the sofa, where do the goals come from? Tel? Simons? I mean, we’re immediately talking the transfer market aren’t we?",
      "Unless the plan is to hire a new manager and tell them, you can’t sign any new players because actually we already have one of the best 4 squads in the country. If so, I have some bad news. But if it is time to sound the warchest klaxon, then it’s implicit that the current squad is not good enough for what is apparently desired.

      "Having last season watched Rasmus Hojlund do a similarly ineffective job up top, I do get the instinct to defend Gyokeres. Having an inept striker can be an especially grating experience – even if the rest of your team is humming and producing cohesive build-up play, you’re never far from a move breaking down via the link in the team that should add that crucial iota of potency.",
      "It’s made all the worse when they show occasional flashes of quality or produce a smart finish. “See? The ability is there, consistency is what’s missing”, we tell ourselves. But when the required quality is lacking, you can’t expect a sub-standard striker to produce those flashes more regularly. Sometimes, your expensive frontman is only able to impact games sporadically because that’s his ceiling.",
      "Rob’s argument for Gyokeres doing fine doesn’t really touch on his ability though – it seems entirely based around Arsenal sitting pretty in mid-January with him in the team. Arteta picks him for the team top of the league, and he’s an actual football manager, so if you think he’s crap, you are clearly wrong sir. But it doesn’t work that way does it? Anyone who’s watched a middling amount of Arsenal this season will tell you that he’s struggled badly.",
      "Isn’t it possible, or even probable, that Arsenal would be in an even stronger position if they’d invested in a striker who was at a level consistent with the rest of their team? 10-15 points clear with no lingering doubts over their goal threat maybe? Gyokeres really doesn’t pass the eye test – poor goal return, minimal contribution, looks laboured and out of sync when he does get involved. The frequent rush to highlight his effort and attitude has been a giveaway to be honest – it’s a classic case of damning with faint praise. Hojlund often got the same sympathetic treatment when charging after a pass down a channel only for it to bounce off his knee out of play.",
      "You can be top of the league, top of the Champions League etc., but still have some weak links Rob. And it’s hard to term Gyokeres as anything other than that up to this point. You’re rightly happy with a season that’s well on track in spite of his struggles.

I’d honestly relinquish a few places in the table in exchange for some excitement. The infinite horseshoe tactic is the worst thing I’ve seen in all the years I’ve watched them play (mid 80s – god I’m old).

      "Man Utd have made Niko Kovac one of their top targets to succeed Ruben Amorim and Borussia Dortmund fans ‘would welcome’ his exit, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils sacked Amorim, who only won three of his final 11 matches, over a fortnight ago after a miserable 14 months under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Darren Fletcher was made caretaker manager for two matches against Burnley and Brighton, before former Man Utd midfielder Michael Carrick was appointed interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick could not have wished for a better start with a comprehensive 2-0 win over arch-rivals Man City on Saturday, thanks to goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu.",
      "However, the plan is still to appoint a permanent successor to Amorim in the summer with a number of managers linked to the position.",
      "With a number of top managers set to leave their positions in the summer and a World Cup around the corner, Man Utd thought it would be prudent to wait until the the summer to make a decision on a permanent appointment.",
      "READ: Lisandro Martinez given eight-word advice by old man shouting at clouds",
      "Our friends at TEAMtalk broke the news that Dortmund boss Kovac is ‘one of the names’ on the Man Utd shortlist to succeed Amorim in the summer.",
      "And now Spanish publication Fichajes insists that Man Utd ‘want’ Kovac with the story reiterating that the Bundesliga manager is on their shortlist, which has ‘generated surprise’ in Germany.",
      "Fichajes adds: ‘One of the names that has emerged in recent hours is that of Niko Kovac , the current Borussia Dortmund manager. The Croatian has been in charge of the German club for nearly a year, but his time at Signal Iduna Park hasn’t left a particularly positive impression on the fans.",
      "‘That’s precisely why his potential candidacy for Manchester United has surprised even in Germany. Kovac hasn’t managed to get the best out of a squad with talent, depth, and high aspirations. The team has shown inconsistency, a lack of decisiveness in key matches, and a style of play that hasn’t quite convinced. In fact, a significant portion of Dortmund’s fanbase would welcome his move to England.’",
      "It is understood that at Old Trafford ‘there’s a feeling that the problem can’t be solved solely with a heavy hand or a defensive structure, two of the traits associated with the Croatian manager.’",
      "And Man Utd are ‘keeping several options open’ as the Red Devils face a crucial summer decision as Jason Wilcox ‘continues to evaluate candidates for both an immediate solution and a strategic replacement in the summer’.",
      "Jadon Sancho is out of contract at the end of next season with former club Borussia Dortmund said to be keen…but only on one condition",
      "An insider has revealed the thoughts of Manchester United on Jadon Sancho, who is on loan with Aston Villa, with the final opportunity for his sale approaching.",
      "Man Utd are one of two clubs hoping to do a deal for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jobe Bellingham in the winter transfer market, according to reports.",
      "England legend Sir Geoff Hurst has slammed the behaviour of Mark Bellingham after he complained about his son, Jobe, being substituted for Dortmund."

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘ready to use’ £42m flop Manuel Ugarte as ‘bait’ in a swap deal involving a Sunderland star.",
      "It is common knowledge that the Red Devils‘ top transfer priority this year is to overhaul their midfield.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd focused on revamping their attack and signing a new No.1 goalkeeper, having invested around £230m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "Each of these signings, especially Mbeumo, Cunha and Lammens, have made a positive impact this season, but Michael Carrick‘s side are still sorely lacking in other departments and this is particularly the case in midfield.",
      "The Red Devils made an audacious attempt to land Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in the summer, but a deal was deemed impossible as they had limited funds after making those aforementioned signings.",
      "This means United are still crying out for a No.6 and Baleba remains an option, but they are also linked with other potential targets.",
      "READ: Martinez has made Butt look a right mug; Man Utd pundit the one who needs to ‘f***ing grow up’",
      "This includes Sunderland star Noah Sadiki, who has been a revelation since joining Regis Le Bris’ side in the summer for around £15m.",
      "Sunderland fended off competition from Leeds United to sign Sadiki, who is unlucky not to feature on our list of the best 2025/26 Premier League signings.",
      "Unfortunately for Sunderland, Sadiki’s form leaves them at risk of losing the centre-midfielder in the coming months, with it reported last month that Man Utd are prepared to ‘go all in’ for him if they decide to move away from Baleba.",
      "Sadiki is surely valued at much more than £15m currently, but a report from GiveMeSport claims Man Utd are ‘ready to use’ Ugarte as ‘bait’ in a ‘swap deal’ in an attempt to drive his price down.",
      "The report claims: ‘Ruben Amorim was willing to sanction the £42 million Uruguayan’s departure, but the Portuguese would have preferred it to be a permanent move.",
      "‘And talk inside Old Trafford is that if United do follow Amorim’s thought process and look to offload Ugarte, he could be used as swop-bait to land Sunderland’s ‘incredible’ 20-year-old midfield talent Noah Sadiki.’",
      "However, ex-Man Utd defender Mikael Silvestre has explained why he thinks his former club needs to prioritise Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton for their midfield rebuild.",
      "“Man United should sign a centre midfielder in January,” Silvestre told Esports Insider.",
      "“Casemiro isn’t getting any younger, and if the club are playing in Europe next season, they’ll need more depth in the middle of the park.",
      "“There are plenty of options available on the market too and I believe Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace and Carlos Baleba at Brighton would both be great additions to the squad. Former youth player James Garner is also a possibility – he’s at Everton now, but he might be tempted to return to Old Trafford if he was guaranteed minutes under Michael Carrick.",
      "“United are too light in that position at the moment. Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are good options to occupy a place in the centre midfield, but if one gets injured, you’ve got no backup options. They need a strong forth man to cover that position, especially if they’re playing in multiple competitions next year.”",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has admitted that he has been “disappointed” by one Red Devils player who has not been good enough.",
      "Nicky Butt and Rio Ferdinand have both hit out at the Red Devils midfielder, who’s reportedly ‘agreed’ to leave in January.",
      "Man Utd are not planning on making any new signings in January as Michael Carrick will have to work with the current squad, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have turned to Atletico Madrid for a potential signing, while Manuel Ugarte “will leave” the Premier League giants.",
      "According to reports, a Manchester United star has reached an ‘agreement’ to leave the club this month, though this deal hinges on one condition.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could still offload Manuel Ugarte this month, while they have been ‘set a price’ for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba."

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "Unai Emery has foolishly been named Premier League Manager of the Month and then conducted a weird interview hinting at issues behind the Aston Villa scenes.",
      "That might not sound like a potent combination for a prompt sacking but in this particular season it is at least an inadvisable path to go down.",
      "Emery has followed an entirely doomed succession line of Premier League Manager of the Month award winners in 2025/26: Enzo Maresca, Ruben Amorim, Oliver Glasner and Arne Slot. And the two winners at the end of 2024/25 were Vitor Pereira and Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "In the cases of Maresca, Amorim and the entirely miserable Glasner especially they were crowned against a backdrop of hierarchical and boardroom issues which ultimately helped trigger their departures.",
      "So Emery saying Villa “are not contenders to be in the top five” and venting about “other teams with more potential than us” in a nod to Spurs hijacking their move for Conor Gallagher and Donyell Malen being sold before a replacement was secured, did not sit right with many.",
      "Jamie Redknapp called it “one of the oddest interviews I have ever seen”. Ashley Young thought it was “weird”. Stuart Pearce wondered “whether the frustration going forward will be too much for him that he can’t take this team any further”. Brooklyn Beckham was asked for comment but he’s got a lot going on.",
      "The likelihood of Emery actually leaving this season is infinitesimal; the bloke just wears his heart on his sleeve and was understandably slightly rattled by having to play David Moyes’ Everton.",
      "But in the unlikely event he does leave a post in which he holds an unimaginable amount of power and leeway, Emery would not be the first Premier League Manager of the Month to resign or be sacked in the same season.",
      "He wouldn’t even be the first at Villa Park to be hit by the curse…",
      "",
      "Club: Tottenham\nNamed Manager of the Month: November 2020\nPosition when MOTM: 1st\nSacked: April 2021\nPosition when sacked: 7th",
      "The Mourinho boom and bust cycle was in full flow by November 2020 when Spurs beat Brighton, West Brom and Manchester City, rounding the month off with a draw at Chelsea to consolidate their place atop the Premier League a year after his appointment.",
      "That form soon turned and by the time Mourinho was sacked in April, Spurs were barely clinging to a qualification spot for the same Europa League that Dinamo Zagreb dumped them out of despite their coach being in prison at the time.",
      "Spurs tried to hit Mourinho where it hurts, cutting ties six days before the Carabao Cup final and preferring Ryan Mason to lead them out against Manchester City. But they underestimated the Portuguese, who just counts the trophy among his collection anyway.",
      "",
      "Club: West Brom\nNamed Manager of the Month: September 2010\nPosition when MOTM: 6th\nSacked: February 2011\nPosition when sacked: 17th",
      "“Our poor sequence of results stretches back more than three months,” explained West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace, mindful of what came shortly before that.",
      "The newly promoted Baggies felt compelled to act after winning three of 16 Premier League games and slipping into a relegation battle that seemed to be comfortably in the rear-view mirror by September. A home draw with Tottenham, derby spoils in a 3-1 win over Birmingham and a dramatic 3-2 victory at Arsenal, combined with beating Manchester City in the League Cup, had helped dampen the disappointment of a six-goal opening-day thrashing at the hands of Chelsea.",
      "As high as sixth at one stage, West Brom subsequently crashed towards the trap door and only the safety net of Roy Hodgson could rescue them and indeed any of us. But especially and always Crystal Palace.",
      "",
      "Club: Hull City\nNamed Manager of the Month: August 2016\nPosition when MOTM: 5th\nSacked: January 2017\nPosition when sacked: 20th",
      "Few neutral, critics and even fans gave Hull City a tiger’s chance in the ocean of surviving as a Premier League team in their most recent top-flight season. Promotion had been secured through the play-offs but Steve Bruce left less than a month before the campaign began, the first team contained 13 senior players at one point and a protracted takeover looked no closer to being completed.",
      "There seemed to be no hope, although the gallows humour among those who remained was strong.",
      "Against all odds, reigning Premier League champions Leicester were vanquished on the opening day and Swansea fell to Hull too. Manchester United only escaped from the KC Stadium with a win at the end of the month through Marcus Rashford’s stoppage-time strike as Phelan orchestrated an excellent start in his unfamiliar role of being anything other than Manchester United assistant.",
      "But one league win in 18 finally forced Hull into action, perhaps a little too late for Marco Silva to get to know the Premier League. By the time they had lost 6-1 to Bournemouth in October the good Phelan had already long worn off.",
      "",
      "Club: Aston Villa\nNamed Manager of the Month: September 2001\nPosition when MOTM: 4th\nResigned: January 2002\nPosition when resigned: 7th",
      "An unbeaten start to the 2001/02 campaign had the minds of Aston Villa supporters wandering once more. Title challenges had come and swiftly gone under John Gregory, while Ron Atkinson could not quite keep Manchester United’s pace in the inaugural Premier League season.",
      "September 2001 was particularly flattering as Liverpool, Southampton and Blackburn were swept aside, sandwiching a goalless draw with Sunderland. A Champions League tilt at least looked possible. But from November 3 to New Year’s Day they beat only Ipswich in 11 games and the damage was done when they surrendered a two-goal FA Cup third-round lead over United.",
      "Three days after beating Derby and Charlton in consecutive fixtures, Gregory resigned in quite hilarious circumstances due to fan disgruntlement and issues behind the scenes with chairman Doug Ellis.",
      "",
      "Club: Manchester United\nNamed Manager of the Month: October 2025\nPosition when MOTM: 8th\nSacked: January 2026\nPosition when sacked: 6th",
      "In only four of his months as Manchester United manager did Amorim win more than a single Premier League game. And to be fair, the effort it took to muster two victories in December of 2024 and 2025, as well as January 2025, made his only October in charge look generational.",
      "It all seemed to click when Sunderland and Brighton were both sent packing from Old Trafford, sandwiching a ransacking of Anfield in a month which mercifully included no participation in the cups and thus no opportunity for Manchester United to embarrass themselves.",
      "That was probably the peak of the entire experiment. Amorim won just three of his next 11 games, but most pertinently challenged the authority of the great Jason Wilcox, to fall on his sword within a couple of months.",
      "",
      "Club: Tottenham\nNamed Manager of the Month: August 2021\nPosition when MOTM: 1st\nSacked: November 2021\nPosition when sacked: 9th",
      "Only seven coaches in Premier League history have been named Manager of the Month more often than Nuno, who has more such awards than Sir Bobby Robson, Carlo Ancelotti, Claudio Ranieri, Unai Emery, Mauricio Pochettino and Mourinho.",
      "How so very Spurs, by the way, to deliver consecutive Manager of the Month sackings.",
      "Never a particularly natural fit in north London as a mid-table manager promoted beyond his station, Nuno started with three straight 1-0 wins over Manchester City, Wolves and Watford while navigating a Harry Kane transfer saga to send Spurs top.",
      "But it was all a facade: Spurs lost five of their next seven and Nuno’s fate was sealed by defeat in El Sackico.",
      "",
      "Club: Sheffield Wednesday\nNamed Manager of the Month: January 2000\nPosition when MOTM: 19th\nSacked: March 2000\nPosition when sacked: 19th",
      "Sheffield Wednesday resisted the temptation to simply cite the greatest lyricist of our times when parting ways with Wilson in March 2000.",
      "“We’ve got stars directing our fate, and we’re praying it’s not too late, ’cause we know we’re falling from grace” would have been a fitting way to say goodbye to the millennium’s first Premier League Manager of the Month.",
      "A draw with Arsenal and victories over Bradford and Tottenham offered a glimmer of survival hope at Hillsborough in January. What a month, huh? But of course, captain, it’s Wednesday – they won one of their next seven before Wilson was sacked and Peter Shreeves came in to steer the ship into the First Division.",
      "Wilson never managed in the Premier League again. It didn’t look particularly promising when David Blunkett led four Sheffield MPs in demanding Wednesday take action in mid-January as “this sort of situation would probably have been addressed back in November at most other Premiership clubs”.",
      "",
      "Club: Reading\nNamed Manager of the Month: January 2013\nPosition when MOTM: 17th\nSacked: March 2013\nPosition when sacked: 19th",
      "What was the quickest case of the curse striking came in 2013, when McDermott started February as Premier League Manager of the Month and barely made it to mid-March before being rendered unemployed.",
      "Reading went on two separate runs of seven consecutive league defeats that season but January brought brief and beautiful respite with wins over West Brom and Newcastle, as well as a comeback draw with European champions Chelsea. Three more points against Sunderland on February 2 were the last McDermott would collect in his first stint as manager at the Madejski, with defeats to Stoke, Wigan, Everton and Aston Villa plunging them back into the sort of danger even the Nigel Adkins diet could not salvage.",
      "A similar fate befell Adam Le Fondre. The striker was named Player of the Month for January in a Royal double after scoring five times in four games, yet he had to wait until May for his next goal. Le Fondre still set the benchmark that season.",
      "",
      "Club: Chelsea\nNamed Manager of the Month: November 2025\nPosition when MOTM: 5th\nSacked: January 2026\nPosition when sacked: 5th",
      "Maresca wasted almost precisely no time in starting the ball rolling towards his Chelsea demise after winning the Manager of the Month award.",
      "It was one day after being crowned for a month in which the Blues beat Spurs, Wolves and Burnley without conceding before underlining their title credentials with an impressive draw against Arsenal, that Maresca cryptically lamented his “worst 48 hours” in charge.",
      "He probably experienced even tougher times in the intervening period, winning only two of his final nine matches and having to deal with more medical professionals telling him Reece James and Cole Palmer will spontaneously combust if he keeps picking them.",
      "What Maresca clearly didn’t understand is that in English, “manage”, if you split the two words, it’s “man”, “age” – you’re ageing men. Or teenaged South American forwards.",
      "Man Utd were once successful because of the likes of Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. If they are to be again, it will be in spite of them…",
      "Every single Manchester United in the Mailbox has picked Lisandro Martinez in his spat with the Class of 92.",
      "We begin with Eberechi Eze’s rarely-seen wife but move on to Lisandro Martinez being given some advice by an old man.",
      "Spurs are in a terrible mess. So what should they do next? Blackmail, gaslighting and liquidation all feature in our fun-filled rundown of 10 possible options.",
      "One of Arne Slot’s problems in keeping Liverpool fans onside is his personality, which is amplified because of Jurgen Klopp.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And neither Man City nor Liverpool are in top five."

      "Diogo Dalot drew headlines on Saturday after avoiding a red card for a studs-up challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby. It was more attention than he’s received for anything he’s done at Manchester United for a long time. That’s meant more as a compliment than an insult.",
      "He’s rarely bad enough to draw criticism. He’s normally fine and being fine for Manchester United has been no mean feat in what has incredibly been his seven-and-a-half years at the football club. Only Luke Shaw (11-and-a-half years) has been at Old Trafford longer; Dalot is the 23rd longest-serving Premier League player.",
      "Signed under Jose Mourinho in 2018, he’s seen Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ruben Amorim come and go; he’s currently enjoying his second helping of Michael Carrick, who – like his predecessors – will presumably find Dalot to be a consummate professional and a safe pair of boots.",
      "There’s a lot to be said for those consistent 6/10 players, particularly when the performances of the long, long list of Dalot’s United teammates past and present have been so variable. But there is also always the possibility that the grass may be greener, quite a lot greener as an alternative view is that his 232 appearances for the club symbolises the Red Devils’ post-Sir Alex Ferguson inadequacy.",
      "His apologists will claim he doesn’t get the credit he deserves, and that may be fair, but we’re also struggling to imagine too many Premier League managers chasing Dalot over the full-backs they currently have available to them. We doubt, for example, that Andoni Iraola would trade Dalot for Alex Jimenez.",
      "The 20-year-old joined Bournemouth from AC Milan on loan in the summer, but is now just four starts from meeting the 18-game requirement for that loan to be turned into a permanent £16m transfer at the end of the season.",
      "In 52 senior games for Milan and Bournemouth he’s yet to score a goal and has just three assists to his name, but as shown frequently in this clash with Brighton, he’s very adept at getting his team up the pitch with what is his outstanding speed and jinking acceleration with the ball at his feet. And while that final bit – the cross or shot – is currently lacking, his technical quality suggests those goal contributions will come in time.",
      "It was his bursting midfield run and crucial pass which set up Eli Junior Kroupi’s equaliser to make it 4-4 against Manchester United in December, and him playing on the right wing as he did on that day at Old Trafford, suggests Iraola – who it’s fair to say knows his onions – has no doubts over the right-back’s creativity.",
      "Nor will there be concern over his defensive faculties. Kauro Mitoma barely had sniff on the left for Brighton, though was forced to enjoy Jimenez screaming in his face after one instance of many in which the Bournemouth man got the better of him.",
      "Anyone watching him of late will be of a view that Jimenez is a star that’s yet to make the headlines that Dalot has avoided through his mediocrity.",
      "United managed to persuade both Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to join them over rivals in the summer, but in this saga of Red Devils transition, for every Champions League-ready star they are able to sign there will be another – like Antoine Semenyo – who opts to move to a better, more stable football club.",
      "As Ruben Amorim found out when he was denied the Semenyo money to spend on an alternative, United aren’t about to throw cash around willy-nilly as they once did, particularly when – as is the case with Dalot – the need for improvement isn’t all that conspicuous.",
      "But there is room for improvement and the best means for United to make gains would be for them to target unheralded players with high ceilings who may only marginally improve the first team when they arrive, but have the potential to make a huge difference in the not-too-distant future. Alex Jimenez is one of those players."

      "Nicky Butt has told Lisandro Martinez to “f***ing grow up” after the Manchester United defender gave a measured response – which he was asked for – to the pundit’s baseless criticism ahead of the Manchester derby. Excuse us for getting into a playground back and forth dear readers, but how about you f***ing grow up, mate.",
      "Rather than being “picked up and run with like a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler” by Erling Haaland, as Butt suggested would be the case, Martinez was the teacher waiting at the school gates to reprimand the father for his tardiness.",
      "It was a magnificent display from the Red Devils centre-back against the Premier League’s most dangerous striker; one Butt and fellow bullsh*t purveyor Paul Scholes might have predicted had their analysis of the battle involved more than a quick glance at their relative physiques.",
      "Saturday was Martinez’s fourth win in five meetings against Haaland and his second clean sheet. If there’s a criticism that can be aimed at the Argentinian it’s that there’s a rick in him. No-one is saying he’s a perfect centre-back; he makes mistakes too frequently to be hailed as a world class defender.",
      "But it’s very difficult to watch Martinez play a game of football and question his aggression, pace or physicality. Scholes’ suggestion that Haaland would “score, then throw him in the net” was also apropos of nothing. It was nonsense. Fiction for clicks.",
      "“He can say whatever he wants,” Martinez said. “I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don’t care.”",
      "Scholes accepted that invitation but, perhaps frustrated or embarrassed at being The Other Guy On The Podcast not even worthy of reference by the United star, Butt issued a nuclear and unbefitting response.",
      "“We are a podcast, we are three lads in a pub, we are not on Sky doing commentary. It’s quite obvious that Haaland is not going to pick him up and run with him. It’s f***ing obvious that.",
      "“When someone gets so upset about someone in the media or a podcast to start saying they can do what they want and come to my house and all that, f***ing grow up.",
      "“If you are going to get so emotional about someone saying that about you, you shouldn’t be at a big club. He will get that at the rest of his career at United, there will be ups and downs.",
      "“There is no personal issue with us and Martinez. I think it’s really sad that someone gets so upset.”",
      "We’re reticent to draw attention to it as there’s evidently nothing that Butt – at the start of his punditry career – wants more than for this to be dubbed a ‘war of words’. Martinez “doesn’t care” what Scholes thinks; he’s not about to give a sh*t about the thoughts of the guy alongside him. What is he? The podcast producer?",
      "But we were triggered by the obvious need for the man telling another man to grow up to grow up himself. There isn’t a person on earth who took Butt’s claim that Haaland would pick Martinez and run with him literally. It is indeed “f***ing obvious” and definitely not the reason Martinez was irritated, Nicky.",
      "Martinez, like every human being over the age of six knows how metaphors work. He’s annoyed by a) what the metaphor suggests and b) that suggestion being without foundation.",
      "And what’s this rubbish about “emotional” footballers not being suited to “big clubs”. Wasn’t Roy Keane your captain? Didn’t you watch Eric Cantona kung-fu kick a fan? You can’t just tell someone to grow up and expect to win the argument. He’ll be telling him to stop showing off in front of his friends in a minute.",
      "Butt and Scholes also can’t just brush off whatever they say on the basis of this being a podcast akin to “three lads (we would actively avoid) in a pub”. Well actually, they can, but a licence to say anything at all with no regard to facts, stats or simply what people see with their eyes makes it an entirely meaningless pursuit and one we can only hope that Martinez and the rest of the Manchester United players continue to treat with the disdain it deserves.",
      "Self-proclaimed “above average” Premier League footballer Jamie O’Hara would be a shoo-in for Prick of the Week if we still gave out that award…",
      "Man Utd were once successful because of the likes of Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. If they are to be again, it will be in spite of them…",

      "Nicky Butt has told Lisandro Martinez to “f***ing grow up” after the Manchester United defender hit back at the pundit for mocking him on his podcast.",
      "On The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of United’s 2-0 win over Manchester City, Butt claimed that Haaland would “pick Martinez up and run with him” like “a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler”.",
      "Scholes added that the Norwegian striker would “score, then throw him in the net”, fearing the prospect of “Martinez against Haaland”.",
      "In response, Martinez claimed former players are quick to criticise on podcasts and television but would never say the same things to players’ faces.",
      "“No, honestly, he can say whatever he wants,” the United centre-back said. “I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don’t care.”",
      "Scholes accepted Martinez’s invitation on Instagram, saying: “Someone’s had a good game. Was really happy for you… Tea, no sugar pls.”",
      "Butt couldn’t leave it though, hailing his performance but then insisting he should “f***ing grow up”.",
      "He told The Good, The Bad & The Football: “He was brilliant on the day, fair play to him. He’s gone out and he’s gone man to man against the best centre-forward in Europe and the world possibly, him and Harry [Kane] to be fair, and he was brilliant.",
      "“We come on here and say well done, everyone’s done well, that’s what’s to be expected from a Man Utd player on a derby day.",
      "“We are a podcast, we are three lads in a pub, we are not on Sky doing commentary. It’s quite obvious that Haaland is not going to pick him up and run with him. It’s f***ing obvious that.",
      "“When someone gets so upset about someone in the media or a podcast to start saying they can do what they want and come to my house and all that, f***ing grow up.",
      "“If you are going to get so emotional about someone saying that about you, you shouldn’t be at a big club. He will get that at the rest of his career at United, there will be ups and downs.",
      "“There is no personal issue with us and Martinez. I think it’s really sad that someone gets so upset.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand believes his former teammates were too “personal” in their criticism of Martinez.",
      "Ferdinand, speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, has now given his verdict on the situation involving two of his former team-mates.",
      "“It’s not beef, I think it’s being made out to be beef,” Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents. “This week I think there has been some stuff that has probably been just over borderline, personal. I have spoken to Martinez a few times, online and in person, and he is someone who just wants to do well, win, get back to the standards Man United were at. He is eager to see that that looks like.",
      "“He has even invited me to go to the training ground, go and get a coffee – he is a sponge. The way he plays is the way I feel he is – he is an honest character and a good sort to have in the changing room.",
      "“He is within his rights, if something gets on his nerves… he has come out and said it. The way it has been taken I think needs some context. He is not saying, “Come and meet me anywhere and we will have a tear up” – he is saying, “Let’s have a conversation face to face is you have an issue”.",
      "“We are talking about a World Cup winner here, he knows how to win. I had a conversation with him after the game and he was quick and clear – we have a standard now and need momentum. What I would say is, when you are talking about people, if you feel you can say the same thing in front of them, then it is fair game.”",
      "Self-proclaimed “above average” Premier League footballer Jamie O’Hara would be a shoo-in for Prick of the Week if we still gave out that award…",
      "Man Utd were once successful because of the likes of Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. If they are to be again, it will be in spite of them…",
      "Every single Manchester United in the Mailbox has picked Lisandro Martinez in his spat with the Class of 92.",
      "We begin with Eberechi Eze’s rarely-seen wife but move on to Lisandro Martinez being given some advice by an old man.",
      "Paul Scholes has revealed that Lisandro Martinez messaged him on Instragram recently claiming that he’d “lost all respect” for the Man Utd legend.",
      "Lisandro Martinez responded to Butt and Scholes’ entirely baseless criticism and *he’s* the one who needs to “f***ing grow up”? Lads, he’s made you look like a couple of…"

      "",
      "Apprehensively waiting for the game to start on Saturday morning the last thing I expected to see just a few hours later was the Old Trafford faithful waving Haaland off the pitch as he was hooked after doing f*** all in derby. It was a brilliant day.",
      "If you look back on Manchester derby games since Fergie left United have done pretty well when considering the gulf between the two over that time. United have 12 wins to City’s 14 with 5 draws. So beating City isn’t unusual. You would also recognise some of the tactics employed by Carrick in previous wins against City. Low block, low possession, and a counter attacking threat were all on display.",
      "However, many of those previous United wins were either on a knife edge or involved healthy doses of fortune. Not since well before Fergie left have a United side so utterly dominated a derby game. Both in and out of possession United dictated the pace and overwhelmed City with a relentless energy.",
      "Carrick was smart, which is a good sign, because he addressed the obvious thing first. United’s main defensive issue under Amorim was too much space in the midfield. So he made the team narrow, closed the space in between the lines, and put more men in the middle. Simple right.",
      "In particular playing Dorgu as a defensive winger who tucked into midfield really helped. It gave Mainoo the cover he needed to follow Foden/Cherki as they roamed and meant Amad and Bruno could jump out to press with Mbeumo when the opportunity arose.",
      "Going forward it wasn’t a case of playing it long and chasing through balls. United played out from the back and held possession in their own third with relative ease, then a straight pass through the middle, usually by Martinez or a very good Casemiro, triggered quick and aggressive attacks.",
      "There was a moment too when Mainoo received the ball then quickly turned the pressing Semenyo and passed out wide to start an attack. It was lovely and exactly the type of thing he needs to more of. He played well and looks so much more comfortable with midfield support though was outshone by many other excellent performances on the day. If he can do that press beating turn 3-4 times a game then he’ll quickly become the pivotal cog in our midfield.",
      "City though were just bad. The derby probably came at a good time for United given the current form of Pep’s team and apparent defensive line issues. There was period toward the end of the first half where Pep altered the positions slightly and City had us pinned to our box, they were knocking it around it that familiar way when they unpick a low block but the threat never came. They just didn’t shoot. Feels a bit like that period last season when they looked lost, almost like Pep trying to make them more direct has neglected the identity that made them so dominant.",
      "Looking forward on Carrick’s United it would be silly to take too much from this performance. Getting up for big games against rivals hasn’t been United’s problem. The comments from Shearer of ‘this performance level has to be the standard now’ just isn’t realistic and exactly what he said after the Liverpool win earlier this season. Derby games are unique because teams often find a higher than normal level. United do need more energy and urgency in general but expecting that performance every week is foolish.",
      "Tactically too Carrick can’t really do that to other teams. They will have to win whilst dominating possession and by unlocking the kind of low block he deployed on Saturday. United have been fairly proficient in attack this season, Carrick needs to find a way to maintain that threat whilst keeping control and remaining resolute in defence. That isn’t simple.\nDave, Manchester",
      "",
      "…What a performance in the derby, probably our best in years, and I was delighted enough to watch the match back in full and highlights on MoTD. The team looked well organised, dangerous in attack, and the energy and desire to press, defend and close down space was tremendous.",
      "Nobody can question that we have the makings of a good squad and, therefore, there is some talent there; although here comes the b-bomb. But, these players have shown before that they can raise their game in the bigger matches, reflected in our healthy number of points gained against the top half of the table this season. Our issue has been the low-block teams when we have more of the ball – can we break those teams down and, more importantly, show the same hunger and desire to work hard off the ball to defend well as a team? Time will tell, so let’s keep our powder dry for now. (Making up 15 points at this stage is doable, yeah? Beat Arsenal and it’s only 12! Shh, they’ll say you’re crazy).",
      "In other news, I do hope those Liverpool fans calling for Slot’s head (did he not win the league last season or was that actually a bad dream) and hoping Alonso will come in know what they are letting themselves in for. They need to appreciate that his most successful system thus far has been using 3 at the back at Leverkusen, and arguably it was a shift from this system and style to placate the Madridistas that led to his demise there.",
      "Assuming that’s acceptable then brace yourselves, as you’re in for a treat. As soon as results start going south, which they will if even temporarily to restructure the squad, it is all you will hear about from the media, ex-players and impatient fellow fans. Until he is eventually hounded out with his 3-4-3 tail between his legs back to the Basque region and you bring in Stevie G or Ian Rush to save the day.",

After another week where the main rivals failed to make up ground, we’re now 58% of the way through the season and Arsenal still retain the upper hand, somehow sitting seven points clear. That gap can disappear quickly, it only takes a couple of slip-ups.",
      "We’ve got them on the ropes but haven’t capitalised. It applies at a macro level; as mentioned the other protagonists are drawing or losing regularly and we should be extending the gap, and at the micro level; every game we have so much possession whilst giving away little but are unwilling to swing killer punches to see the opponents off.",
      "I’m sure Mikel Arteta doesn’t think they are holding back but that’s how it appears from the outside. Now we have the capability – improved squad ability and size – to kill off a game, for goodness sake let’s utilise it, don’t let rivals out of the corner they’re pinned in (excuse the set piece pun) to let them recover.",

And without checking the record books, I feel many of the matches were won by greater scores than so far this season.",
      "Come on Arsenal. In the words of an Arsenal legend, let’s play ‘with the handbrake off’ and get this done. Release me from these nail biting over tight games and let City, Villa, and a few Champions League teams ahead taste the canvas. ‘Seconds out’, as they say…..\nTyA, Essex (sorry, but I’ve now lost patience with Viktor)",

      "I’ve been watching this whole Arsenal season, and keep saying to myself – ‘it’s OK, the defense will carry us’. But now I’m not sure anymore – after another missed opportunity for 3 points this weekend, are we just not good at putting the ball in the net? We’ve scored goals from open play, but I’ve never felt like they can be relied on.",

Maybe one of the current best managers in Europe knows something. Or maybe Stewie or Will Ford etc. know more about football? Somehow I doubt it. Only 2 strikers have more than 10 goals in the league this season, and nobody was clamouring for Thiago. I would have liked Ekitike though…",

      "Social media outlets and brainwashed followers of such sites can’t speak or see for themselves about which teams are wobbling all over the shop. It ain’t Arsenal because they drop points on a busy schedule of four away games (two won and one drawn so far) but, as stated Villa and City dropped points.

We just lost to a team who we typically bank on a win, who were depleted with injuries, who came to Villa Park where we had won 11 in a row and where victory would have seen us 4 points off the top. And lost. And then to make matters worse another good player sold who we really could have done with last night goes and scores on his debut for Roma.",

I’ve no doubt he is lined up with a more high-profile role elsewhere. However, his actions this season have been incredibly selfish. I think much of it stems from the shambles Palace got themselves into over Europe – if I was Glasner I’d be furious with the club.",

      "According to reports, Manchester City face the prospect of losing summer signing Gianluigi Donnarumma in the near future on one condition.",
      "The Italy international joined Man City in one of the bargain deals of last summer’s transfer window, having moved to the Etihad from Paris Saint-Germain for around £26m.",
      "For years, Donnarumma has been considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world and he helped PSG win the Champions League last season.",
      "Despite this, the Ligue Un giants decided to move away from Donnarumma in the summer. This is because he entered the final year of his contract at the end of last season and PSG were unwilling to match his demands for an extension, while they brought in Lucas Chevalier as his replacement.",
      "PSG’s loss has been Man City’s gain as the 26-year-old has been superb for Pep Guardiola’s side this season, but his agent, Enzo Raiola, has admitted that he “will” leave if he is offered the opportunity to return to Serie A after he previously had a spell at AC Milan.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Manchester United, cursed Emery, Wilson, Arsenal and more…",
      "Raiola said: “Today at Manchester City he is finding serenity with the team and the environment, and he likes the project very much. He is also starting to understand the English championship.",
      "“The other day he told me jokingly that playing five or six years there is an adventure, but it was a joke… However, if there is the opportunity to return to Italy, we will take it.”",
      "Despite the arrival of Donnarumma, Man City are not the team they once were and they certainly need to strengthen in the next couple of transfer windows.",
      "And a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims they have their eye on AFC Bournemouth standout Alex Scott, who has also been heavily linked with a potential move to Man Utd.",
      "READ: Slot, Carrick, Guardiola among 10 PL managers likely to leave their clubs before next season",
      "The report claims Man City have ‘offered’ 60 million euros (£52m) for Scott and they ‘want to complete the signing this summer’.",
      "The report explains: [60 million euros is] a significant sum, but one that reflects the player’s current value and future potential. Within AFC Bournemouth, that figure is considered fair and commensurate with his performance. If a formal offer arrives on those terms, the club would be open to negotiations.",
      "‘For Manchester City, the outlay is seen as a medium and long-term investment, not as an immediate risk bet. Pep Guardiola isn’t looking for an undisputed starter from day one. The idea is for Alex Scott to come to Manchester City to grow, learn, and compete in a highly demanding environment.’",
      "The BBC is now a ‘man-free zone’ apparently, apart from all the programmes presented by men, that is.",
      "A transfer insider has told fans to “keep an eye on” the newest England star, as he is a “possibility” for a number of clubs, including Manchester United.",

      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 15:48, UK",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb is unconvinced that Diogo Dalot’s challenge on Jeremy Doku in Man Utd’s 2-0 win over Man City was worthy of a red card - but is convinced that VAR was right not to intervene.",
      "Dalot escaped a red card for a 10th-minute tackle on Doku, which ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean believed was \"100 per cent\" a sending off.",
      "The Man Utd defender was only shown a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor, with VAR Craig Pawson backing the on-field decision.",
      "Analysing the decision on Mic'd Up, Webb said: \"Is there excessive force? Some will say, yes. I'm not quite there, but I can see that there could be.",
      "\"It's a subjective judgment…but I'm absolutely aligned that once that decision is taken on the field, we leave it as referee's call and we don't intervene with the VAR.\"",
      "He added: \"I think it's one where the referee's call should stand on the field. That's what we've said we'll do where there's a mix of considerations.",
      "\"I think there is a mix, and therefore in this situation, it was right to leave it as the referee's call.",
      "\"If a red had been given, I would have expected the red card to stand as well, in the same way.\"",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola felt Dalot should have been sent off after an early foul on Jeremy Doku.",
      "But VAR Pawson stood by Taylor's on-field decision, believing the contact was \"glancing and not with force\".",
      "Webb said: \"At full speed, when you play it in real time, you can see there's not a great deal of speed in the action, not a lot of intensity.",
      "\"We were heavily criticised a few years ago for using slow motion and freeze frames because people said, this is not reality. It's not how the game is played. When you slow it down, it can look a lot worse - and it does. When you freeze frame it, you can make a lot of situations look like red card offences.",
      "\"So it's difficult for me to hear people make a judgment on this just by analysing freeze frame and slow motion, coming to the consideration that it's red on that basis.",
      "\"Yes, it could be red, but you have to think about the need to look at it at full speed. We've done that for some time now. We thought it was a fair criticism some time ago when people said, 'Stop using slow-mos as the main way of analysing these situations'. And we've listened, and we agree. And we play it at full speed. Then we slow it down a little bit to see the exact point of contact to factor that in as well.",
      "\"But without speed and force and intensity, it's unlikely to be a red card.\"",
      "Speaking at half-time at Old Trafford, Keane said: \"Doku definitely helps him [by not staying down]. I'm no expert on red cards, but I think it's a red.\"",
      "Richards said: \"He [Dalot] is on top of his knee. That is as clear a red card as you are going to see. What more do you want?!\"",
      "Ex-Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher speaking on Ref Watch:",
      "\"I thought it was a red card.",
      "\"He's gone in high and with a straight leg. He's hit him with his studs on the knee. The ball is not there, it's gone, so for me, it's a red card but for others, it is not.\"",
      "Former Cardiff and England striker Jay Bothroyd agreed with Gallafger on Ref Watch:",
      "\"I can't believe Dalot has tried to appeal the yellow card. It's a terrible challenge.",
      "\"The priority for the referees is player safety. When you see challenges like that, Doku could have ended up really hurt.",
      "\"To me, it wasn't a glancing blow. His studs are up and it is above the ankle. I don't understand how it is not a red card.",
      "\"It's a terrible decision. That's going to be one of the worst decisions of the season.\"",

      "Ref: \"I'm going yellow card, it's a glance.\"",
      "VAR: \"Yeah, he does, he's glancing contact on the knee. There's no force, but there is glancing contact. He's tried to play the ball, and he catches it with glancing contact. Glancing contact, there's no force. He's tried to play the ball, he flicks, he misses the ball, he catches him with a follow-through. I'm happy to confirm the on-field decision.\"",

      "Jamie Carragher has outlined his four-man shortlist to be the next Manchester United head coach, suggesting that their next permanent boss must be a candidate with the right \"energy\" and \"drive\" to lead the club forward.",
      "United parted ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this month after a disastrous 14-month reign at the club and have since appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick secured an impressive 2-0 win against rivals Manchester City in his first game at the helm, but Carragher has insisted Old Trafford needs a \"special\" leader.",
      "Here are the options and what Carragher had to say...",
      "Current role: England manager",
      "What Carragher said: \"He's been in the Premier League before. He's obviously a top manager. The thing I like about him is I still think he's got that energy and drive and spikiness about him.",
      "\"He's gone into the England squad, and he's ruffled feathers with some of the biggest players there. Now I'm not saying that has to happen in every job he's in, but there's something about him.",
      "\"He just feels like he would go to war for your club, and he'd be fighting against the other clubs, and he'd have something about him.\"",
      "Current role: Paris Saint-Germain",
      "What Carragher said: \"You would absolutely have him all day. Now we see him as the best manager in Europe. He didn't have a good time at Celta Vigo, he didn't have a good time at Roma, but Barcelona still appointed him.\"",
      "Current role: Newcastle United",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm a huge fan of Eddie Howe. The type of football when Newcastle are at their best is high energy going forward, but the real thing I like is that you have to be able to handle the pressures of Manchester United.",
      "\"When you're in Newcastle and you live in that city, it's constant and he handles it brilliantly. Where I think he could also help is that Manchester United have a problem with young players - a lot of them don't go on to fulfil their potential - but I think Eddie Howe is a great coach.\"",
      "Current role: Germany",
      "What Carragher said: \"I don't know everything about him but I do look at a coach with a big reputation, with a lot to prove in some ways.\"",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm crossing out Michael Carrick. I go back to this question - do I believe this guy can win the league? I have to believe he can. I don't believe Man Utd will win the league with Carrick, or Chelsea will with Liam Rosenior. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you have to be special. I might be proven wrong.\"",
      "Carragher also highlighted why other candidates, such as Xabi Alonso, Diego Simeone and Oliver Glasner, aren't suitable for the role.",
      "\"Jurgen Klopp will not be managing Manchester United. That is out. Xabi Alonso - he cannot do that. He can't, his affiliation with Liverpool. That can't happen.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti, for me, wouldn't have the energy or drive to get Man Utd back. Zinedine Zidane is a younger version of [Carlo] Ancelotti, but maybe I am wrong. Enzo Maresca is a no, but he is a really good coach.",
      "\"Xavi is one, at Barcelona, he won the league but enough experience for Manchester United? He only has a couple of years of experience as a manager.",
      "\"Roberto Martinez, if he does a brilliant job at Portugal, there is no doubt that Roberto is ready. The one thing he has not done in his career is manage an elite football club.",
      "\"He'd have to do something really special. Mauricio Pochettino is the same as Ancelotti. Chelsea went with Enzo Maresca as they wanted a young and energetic coach.",
      "Oliver Glasner, straight away, I'd say no because of the system. Andoni Iraola has done a brilliant job and is linked with top jobs but Bournemouth to Man Utd is a big jump.",
      "\"This is the same for Marco Silva. I think the next step for them would be Tottenham. It feels more Tottenham-like for them. Roberto De Zerbi is a brilliant coach but he is liable to go to war with the owners within six weeks.",
      "\"Diego Simeone is an interesting one. I was speaking to Gary Neville about United's DNA. It is interesting that Roy [Keane] and Gary have both mentioned Simeone at different points.",
      "\"That goes away from what a club's DNA is because he is a defensive coach. You can't ask a manager to change.\"",

      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of Saturday's game, which United went on to win 2-0, Scholes and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt made fun of Martinez's 5ft 7in size.",
      "Butt joked Man City striker Erling Haaland, who stands at 6ft 4in, \"would pick Martinez up and run with him\" like a \"dad after school running down the road with a little toddler\" before Scholes laughed and said that \"he'd score then throw him in the net\".",
      "After shutting out Haaland as United kept a clean sheet against their rivals, Martinez was asked about Scholes' comments and said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",

      "Butt pointed to the experience that he and the rest of United's 'Class of 92' had when Alan Hansen famously said on Match of the Day \"you can't win anything with kids\". A teenager at the time, Butt said that taught him to deal with criticism.",

      "With Bruno Fernandes the first man to create so many big chances against Pep Guardiola's Man City, Adam Bate looks at why Man Utd's playmaker needs to be in his best position. Also in The Debrief: Florentino's tackling and Newcastle's predictability",
      "Monday 19 January 2026 09:25, UK",
      "",
      "Manchester United's thrilling performance in their derby win over Manchester City on Saturday has naturally sparked talk of them being back, a restoration of sorts after Ruben Amorim's exit. That remains to be seen but for Bruno Fernandes it seems clearer.",
      "Back in his best position, restored to that No 10 role, he produced some performance at Old Trafford. Having been denied a goal and an assist by the offside flag in the first half, he eventually set up the opener - and made history against Pep Guardiola's City.",
      "In his decade in charge, no player had ever created four big chances in a Premier League game against them. In fact, Fernandes is the only player to do it against any team this season. And he has done it twice, having also achieved it in beating Wolves last month.",
      "Fernandes is responsible for three of the four occasions that a player has created four big chances in a Premier League game in the past three seasons, a reminder that while sometimes cast as part of the problem, he is surely among the victims of United's malaise.",
      "His efforts against City saw him bring up 600 chances created in his Premier League career, which is 168 more than Kevin De Bruyne, who is the next person on the list, since Fernandes' debut in the competition. Astonishing in what has often been an underwhelming side.",
      "Those numbers also indicate that he has not exactly been stifled under Amorim. In fact, he tops the charts for chances created this season too. Even so, it must make sense to get Fernandes closer to the opposition goal where he can do more damage from open play.",
      "The heatmaps from his Premier League career at United show that he was doing more of his work in his own half under Amorim, whose preferred formation does not have a natural role for a true No 10. Michael Carrick must be tempted to unleash him from there now.",
      "Because he can still make the difference. United's owners will look to Fernandes' age and the potential money that is on offer from Saudi Arabia and make their calculations. But there is also Champions League money to consider. And this Fernandes can deliver that.",
      "Florentino's performance in Burnley's surprise 1-1 draw at Liverpool did not showcase the same levels of creativity but he deserves huge credit for his attempts to shut down the reigning Premier League champions at Anfield. The midfielder made nine tackles.",
      "It is only the fifth time that a player has made nine tackles in a Premier League game this season - and Florentino has been responsible for two of them, having also done so against West Ham in November. This was perhaps his best game in a Burnley shirt.",
      "It was not perfect. He gave away a penalty that Dominik Szoboszlai missed. And some fans have been a little frustrated by his lack of care in possession. But his combative qualities were ideally suited to this particular challenge against Arne Slot's side.",
      "Perhaps Newcastle's goalless draw at Wolves should not have come as a surprise given that they started the season with three stalemates in their first three Premier League matches on the road. But it is just another example of their lack of cutting edge.",
      "Eddie Howe's side have now failed to score in three of their last four away from home. In fact, their only two Premier League victories on their travels have come after taking the lead inside two minutes. When charged with breaking teams down, they often struggle.",
      "Nick Woltemade has become something of a scapegoat for that, having not scored in his last seven appearances. But Newcastle's creativity problems run deeper. They are too passive in attack for a team that is at his best when showing real intensity in their play.",
      "Indeed, at Molineux they became the team to have registered the highest passing accuracy without a shot on target in the first half of a Premier League game since Opta began collecting such records. Wolves dropped deep. All Newcastle could do was cross the ball.",
      "Where was the movement inside, the movement around Woltemade? Wolves were happy to let Newcastle have the ball wide. Better chances might have come with some cute play in the half spaces. Without it, Howe's team can look a little one-dimensional.",

      "\"It has always been about the same thing, the love of it, just that feeling of being a football player, on the pitch, running after a ball. Obviously, you want to win and play in the best possible teams you can. But I think that love of football never leaves you.\"",
      "His new team Wolfsburg are not exactly flying in the Bundesliga. Earlier this month, they lost 8-1 to Bayern Munich. \"Not nice at all.\" But Eriksen scored as they bounced back with a win over St Pauli. \"We had a lot of stuff we had to prove to ourselves,\" he says.",
      "He also provided the cross for the late equaliser against Heidenheim at the weekend. Watching him up close on a bitterly cold day at the Volkswagen Arena, fans of the midfield maestro can rest assured that, even at the age of 33, the old Eriksen magic remains.",
      "His five chances created in the game were as many as his team-mates managed between them and included one lovely ball over the top that should have brought the opening goal. Playing off the right, he drops deep, floats around, has freedom to roam.",
      "In his pomp at Tottenham, Eriksen did all that and more and was arguably the Premier League's outstanding creative force. A big claim but the numbers support that. During his Spurs career nobody provided more assists or created more chances than the Dane.",
      "He also scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League player in that time. Wolfsburg fans have not seen one yet but this Rolls-Royce of a player feels at home in Volkswagen country. \"I just had a gut feeling it would suit me,\" he explains.",
      "\"I could see myself playing for Wolfsburg, trying the Bundesliga. It is a very open league. One team can be 3-0 up in the last 10 minutes and it can still end up 3-3. There is a lot going on and every team wants to play a little bit. It is an exciting league to watch and to play in.\"",
      "Remarkably, the Heidenheim game came 16 years to the day since Eriksen made his professional debut for Ajax. \"Has it been 16 years since my debut? I have had a fun 16 years,\" he says. \"It is still fun.\" But the hair is thinning and those team-mates are getting younger.",
      "\"All the new players coming up, they are born in the 2000s, even the late 2000s. That is weird,\" he says, smiling a little, amusing himself at the thought. \"I am around such young kids. At the same time, although in football terms I am obviously very old, I do not feel old.\"",
      "So, how exactly has football changed over these past 16 years, then? Where to begin. \"It has gone through different stages in terms of possession, then a bit of tactical work, then about possession again, then a lot of pressing, then a lot of athleticism,\" he explains.",
      "\"Now, there are a lot of stats going around, a lot of numbers you have got to hit, so there is a lot more time spent looking at the computer. You have to hit a certain amount of kilometres in training just to make sure you are in the right place for the next game.",
      "\"Years ago, that was not there. It was just on a hunch. Do you feel good? Okay, you are ready to go. Now, everything else is taken into consideration. What is your load? How many high-speed runs do you need to do? How many extra sprints do you need to do?\"",
      "He sounds a little bemused. \"Even strikers now are the first guys to press. Double runs, triple runs.\" But he has been able to adapt. And he has done so having come through that moment nobody will ever be able to forget at the European Championship in 2021.",
      "He almost lost more than his career that day in Copenhagen but recovered to add more chapters to his football story. Brentford offered a route back before he spent three seasons at Manchester United. But there was no role for him under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"As a player, I did not feel he was going to look my way, in every sense. Of course, then you struggle a bit football-wise. But person-wise, we had a decent relationship, nothing wrong there. He has one idea. Maybe I was a style of player not really suited for him.\"",
      "He insists that he wants the best for the club and believes \"a new manager brings new ideas\" and sees it as a \"chance for everyone\" again. Kobbie Mainoo, especially? \"I hope for anyone, it does not matter if it is Kobbie or someone else. I hope the club has success.\"",
      "Eriksen is well placed to assess the issues at Spurs too, having played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Is he surprised to see Frank's struggles? \"Yes and no,\" he says. \"I mean, the pressure is bigger. Of course, Brentford for a long time was a safe place.\"",
      "He adds: \"Now, he is in a new place with new eyes and people want something else. I hope he gets the time to change it and see what he can do. But I know football moves quickly and there are a lot of new ideas this week and then next week it will be another idea.\"",
      "If Eriksen sounds like he has seen it all in football, one wonders what is left for him. The World Cup playoffs in March are on his mind. \"The chance to play at the World Cup would be special. That is the first aim and to hopefully have a big tournament after,\" he says.",
      "His contract at Wolfsburg has another season to run after this and he is determined to see an improvement. \"We have lost way too many games this season. But we are on a better run now than we were before.\" As for the personal goals, well, they never change.",
      "\"Just to keep improving and just to have fun on a football pitch. I mean, that is what I have been doing for so many years,\" But does he cherish all this a bit more after what he has been through? \"I think I am just enjoying the moment, as I was before,\" he adds.",
      "\"But at the same time, I know what you can lose. So, I am happy with what I have. Maybe I am not cherishing it more but I am just enjoying what is ahead.\" What is certain is that we should cherish every opportunity we get to see Christian Eriksen playing football.",

      "Michael Carrick marked his Manchester United homecoming by restoring a familiar feeling as an attacking display secured his side derby day spoils with a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Having only been installed as head coach until the end of the season this week to replace the departed Ruben Amorim, United looked different and Old Trafford felt different.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opening goal, a fully deserved one, was one taken in vintage Man Utd fashion. Rayan Cherki's ball into the box, turned into a speedy three-pronged counterattack for United and Bruno Fernandes slipped in the goalscorer to net his seventh of the league season.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (6), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (7), Bruno Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7), Mbeumo (8), Amad (7)\n\n\nSubs: Cunha (7), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a) Mount (7)\n\n\nMan City:  Donnarumma (7), Lewis (5), Khusanov (6), Alleyne (5), Ake (4), Rodri (6), Semenyo, (6), Foden (4), Bernado Siva (6), Doku (5), Haaland (3)\n\n\nSubs: O’Reilly (6), Cherki (5), Mukasa (n/a), Ait-Nouri (n/a), Reijnders (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mbeumo",
      "There were more shades of the past as Matheus Cunha, a second-half substitute, crossed into the area for Patrick Dorgu to finish.",
      "At that point, United had already had the ball in the back of the net twice with both finishes ruled out for offside. Both Amad Diallo and Fernandes thought they had given United the lead in the first half only to see the assistant referee's flag raised.",
      "It wasn't the last occasion, though, as Mason Mount came close to making it a derby day demolition when he thought he had added a third off the bench only for that to be struck off too.",
      "United's record number of offsides this season summed up a front-foot display that began when Harry Maguire's third-minute header crashed off the bar. Amad also saw a chance hit the goal frame late on with no side hitting the woodwork more than United in the Premier League this season.",
      "While United impressed, they were fortunate to have ended the game with 11 men after Diogo Dalot escaped what Mike Dean called \"100 per cent\" a sending off after a challenge on Jeremy Doku.",
      "Pep Guardiola, though, could only watch on as his side were played off the park as title-chasing Man City could only muster one shot on target, relying on five crucial Gianluigi Donnarumma saves to also avoid humiliation.",
      "City are now at risk of falling nine points behind league leaders Arsenal, who play Nottingham Forest later on Saturday. Man Utd, meanwhile, move up to fourth.",
      "\"Today was special. Putting things together quickly and trying to put an imprint on the team. Gathering together and emotionally getting attached to what we want to do. I felt that was unbelievable from the staff and the players.",
      "\"I am not getting carried away. It is one result, but it needs to be a regular feeling with that level of performance.\"",
      "\"The better team won. They had energy we didn't have. Congratulations to them.",
      "\"They had the chances at the end with crosses. We know they are a transitional team, but in general they were better.",
      "\"They start really strong, that's normal.",
      "\"We never made a threat, crosses or movement, but that's part of the energy.\"",

      "Something about Manchester United's derby day was different, but it felt right.",
      "When Bryan Mbeumo scored his goal, the Stretford end roared. Not just because he had scored a timely goal in a dominant United display but because it represented what the Old Trafford faithful had explicitly or implicitly been crying out for.",
      "United galloped forward, led by Bruno Fernandes, flanked by Patrick Dorgu and Amad. Fearless, front foot and familiar. It was an attacking custom United have been used to.",
      "Though the 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the story of United's control of the game, their season high of offsides that resulted in three disallowed goals reflect a tweaked style that got the best out of United's attacking array.",
      "Mbeumo down the middle, the player with the most runs in behind this season in the league per 90 down the middle proved a masterstroke. Fernandes, the league's chief creator, back in an advanced No 10 role was equally fitting as he made his ninth goal of the season.",
      "\"United's DNA\" has been questioned this week. Is it real? Should United underpin their whole plan on what feels like folklore? Should United move away from Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? Sir Alex was in the director's box smiling all afternoon long - why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.William Bitibiri",
      "Tottenham are drifting towards a conversation they should never be part of.",
      "The 2-1 defeat to West Ham wasn't just another London derby loss to shrug off. It was a warning flare. Spurs are now priced at 50/1 for relegation, odds that still scream long shot, but it still tells an uncomfortable story. They are now just 10 points above the Hammers in the drop zone.",
      "And that, in itself, is the most damning indictment of all for Thomas Frank.",
      "Tottenham, a club in the Champions League and a holder of a European trophy, are better than this.",
      "Form is the driver of this narrative and it is ugly. Just four wins from the last 18 matches gives Frank a win percentage of 22 per cent. That is relegation-form. Spurs are leaking goals, losing control of games they should dominate and looking short on belief when momentum turns against them.",
      "There was a time when Tottenham pulled the trigger quickly in moments like this. Nuno Espirito Santo found that out the hard way. The irony will not be lost on Spurs supporters that the man now sitting in the West Ham dugout - having just beaten them - was dismissed with a 53 per cent win rate, more than double what Frank has delivered across the last 18 games.",
      "Frank was appointed to stabilise and progress the club. The opposite is happening.Lewis Jones",
      "Erling Haaland is Manchester City's greatest derby goalscorer of the Premier League era, but you would not have known it watching the 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. This was a pale imitation of the machine-like striker that has devastated United on so many occasions.",
      "Pep Guardiola pulled him off once it was clear the game was over, soon after Patrick Dorgu crashed in United's second. The striker finished with 14 touches, three successful passes and not a single shot on target. City were lost without his goal threat.",
      "The fact Haaland was brought off for an 18-year-old midfielder, Divine Mukasa, with 15 minutes of prior Premier League experience shows how sparse the current attacking options are for Guardiola. Omar Marmoush's return from AFCON can't come soon enough.",
      "The City manager warned of Haaland being exhausted before the derby and his deteriorating output highlights the problem. The striker has not scored a non-penalty goal for seven games, his longest run without one since he signed for Borussia Dortmund in 2020.",
      "City have already signed winger Antoine Semenyo and are set to bring in centre-back Marc Guehi, but they could do with a striker to ease the burden on Haaland. Strength in depth has been a crucial factor behind Arsenal pulling away in the title race.",
      "There is still time to catch the Premier League leaders, although City's run of four games without a win does not instil confidence. No surprise that has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal.",
      "The only world in which a title twist is imaginable is one in which Haaland is fit and firing on all cylinders. He looks in dire need of a rest. Until Haaland rediscovers some form, City have a big problem.Zinny Boswell",
      "Mikel Arteta has talked up the importance of rotation as Arsenal compete in four different competitions. They are on a gruelling run of four consecutive away games. But it still seemed strange that his most influential attacker was named on the bench against Nottingham Forest.",
      "There seemed no obvious need for it given Bukayo Saka had started only two of Arsenal's last four fixtures. Especially given the size of the opportunity presented by Manchester City's slip-up. What followed at the City Ground put the decision under even greater scrutiny.",
      "Arsenal laboured until Arteta's triple change early in the second half, after which Saka, on for Noni Madueke, looked by far the most likely player to make the breakthrough. He very nearly did, denied by Matz Sels at full-stretch when his header was bound for the corner.",
      "The draw is far from disastrous. Arsenal have added to their lead at the top of the table. But Arsenal supporters are entitled to wonder whether the outcome would have been different had Saka started the game rather than come into it late.Nick Wright",
      "Full-backs at Liverpool are going to be judged harshly. The shadow of those before you is long. But Milos Kerkez has stopped looking like a player learning his surroundings and started performing like one shaping them. Liverpool didn't get the result they wanted against Burnley but there were more positive signs that Kerkez is starting to look like the player they signed from Bournemouth.",
      "His game is built on intensity, but what has impressed most over recent weeks is control.",
      "After being likened to a youth player earlier this season by Gary Neville, there is a calmness to his positioning now, a better understanding of when to go and when to stay. Early-season exuberance has been refined into efficiency. He provided a real thrust down the left against Burnley and more assurance in his decision-making. No player created more chances (6) than him as he continually penetrated with conviction down the left flank.",
      "He looks stronger, sharper, and more attuned to the demands Slot wants. It bodes well for the future.Lewis Jones",
      "Chelsea won a game in which the spotlight once again shone firmly on Robert Sanchez - but this time, he stood up to it.",
      "The Chelsea goalkeeper has spent much of the last few seasons under constant scrutiny, with questions raised about his decision-making and reliability. On another afternoon, that pressure could easily have told. Brentford created enough chances to punish Chelsea, particularly in transition, and Sanchez was tested early and often.",
      "This was not a flawless Chelsea performance, but two things stood out.",
      "First, Sanchez’s response to pressure. The Spaniard produced several crucial saves, most notably racing off his line to deny Kevin Schade when the Brentford forward was clean through, moments that could easily have shifted the momentum of the game. For a player whose confidence has been questioned, those interventions mattered.",
      "Secondly, Chelsea’s growing ability to manage moments of danger. Even when Brentford threatened to force their way back into the contest, Chelsea remained composed enough to see the game out, with Sanchez providing a calm presence behind a defence that has not always looked settled.",
      "There will still be debate around Chelsea’s long-term solution in goal, but on this occasion, Robert Sanchez delivered when it mattered, and Chelsea took full advantage at the other end.",
      "Sometimes survival is just as important as style.Sam Cohen",
      "All is not well at Crystal Palace. The signs have perhaps been there for some times, certainly in terms of performances and results, but the last 36 hours have blown the roof off.",
      "First, there were the revelations that both Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi were heading for the exit. Rumours had circulated for some time on both and were perhaps not a surprise, but the manner in which the Austrian manager delivered them was.",
      "Usually a calm character, Friday's news conference and Glasner's bombshells pointed towards a shift at the club - one that just nine months ago, were basking in FA Cup glory.",
      "And after a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, in which Glasner says he was unable to bring on any substitutes to help the team, the manager took aim at the club's hierarchy over the timing of Guehi's departure.",
      "It's a direct challenge to the chairman - back me or sack me. So far, by Glasner's calculations, Parish hasn't done the former and managers who have challenged the club this season have often found themselves ousted not long after.",
      "On the pitch, it's now ten games and over a month without a win for Crystal Palace in all competitions. They are missing the likes of Ismaila Sarr and Daniel Munoz, although they should return soon.",
      "That will give the Eagles a much needed boost, but will likely do little to repair the relationship between manager and chairman. How that plays out for the remainder of the season will be an intriguing prospect.Charlotte Marsh",
      "The Stadium of Light has always been one of football's great grounds, and this season, Sunderland have made it their fortress.",
      "The Black Cats remain unbeaten there in the Premier League this season, which might come as somewhat of a surprise considering they lost their last three regular season games at the ground last term.",
      "Perhaps what is most impressive is the ability to come from behind to take points. They did so again against Crystal Palace on Saturday, and never looked harangued when going behind.",
      "Rege Le Bris praised the maturity and confidence of his team, and they certainly showed it. Especially in the second half, they remained patient before finally getting their deserved winner.",
      "Along with Leeds, the two promoted sides are harnessing the magic of their home support to help keep them in the league. In fact, Sunderland are just three points from the top four - a European push is more likely to happen than a relegation battle.",

      "It was one of those points that felt like considerably more than a point.",
      "Scott Parker's masterplan to take something from Anfield didn't involve conceding 32 shots, or Dominic Szoboszlai crashing a penalty off the bar, but it did without doubt revolve around the notion of staying in the fight.",
      "Burnley didn't flinch when Liverpool knocked on the door in the opening half hour. They didn't flinch when Florian Wirtz forced it open, either.",
      "Despite their lead it was Liverpool playing with urgency after the break. Without a second it was inevitable that Burnley would break out of their low block, if momentarily, and push for an equaliser.",
      "That part of the plan was executed to perfection. Ibrahima Konate nearly turned his ball into his own net moments before Marcus Edwards brought Burnley level.",
      "\"You never say die\" said Kyle Walker of his side's showing on Saturday. On a day when Leeds and West Ham won, Burnley's rope-a-dope point at Anfield could yet be pivotal in the battle to stay alive in the Premier League.Michael Morrow",
      "The screams of delight from Elland Road after Lukas Nmecha's last-gasp winner were so loud that you probably could have heard them from Barnsley.",
      "That's been the story at home for Leeds recently. They're now unbeaten across their last five Premier League home matches - gaining points from Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, and now an in-form Fulham side - and that run doesn't look like ending any time soon.",
      "Farke's revamped side have embodied a powerful, gritty style of play that the home fans are finding it easy to get behind.",
      "Their win today was earmarked by two 10-minute periods in which the powerful Leeds attack terrorised the frail Fulham defence. Leeds' two best chances - Calvert-Lewin's inexplicable miss from six yards out, and Brendan Aaronson's scuffed half-volley one-on-one with Bernd Leno - came when the home crowd was spurring them on the most, and should've resulted in goals.",
      "Just when the game looked gone, and Fulham's defence grew in confidence, the Elland Road roar got Leeds back in the game, just in time to rattle Fulham into three mistimed tackles, in turn creating the winning opportunity.",
      "\"To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means. The home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition,\" said opposition manager Marco Silva before the game. \"It is never easy to play there.\"",
      "And so it proved, as it has for almost every opposition side of late.",
      "With Farke's side continuing to grind out results with the help of their home crowd, it's hard to see any team remaining unfazed with a trip to Elland Road on the calendar.Noah Langford",
      "Fulham's recent unbeaten run has been so impressive that recent clamour for reinforcements seemed to have taken a back seat.",
      "Today's loss at Leeds is a harsh reality check for Marco Silva and his men, and demonstrates what Fulham fans know all too well - that the club will stagnate without new signings imminently.",
      "New injuries to Sasa Lukic and Emile Smith Rowe may take the headlines, but they are the least of Fulham's problems. The whites had just seven touches in the Leeds United box, their fewest in a Premier League game since December 2024.",
      "With Rodrigo Muniz out until February and Raul Jimenez having a poor game, Silva's only option up top from the bench was Jonah Kusi-Asare, the 18-year old Bayern loanee who is yet to score a professional goal outside the German fourth division.",
      "There are two weeks left in the January window - despite being heavily linked with attacking reinforcements, Fulham are yet to make a signing.",
      "\"Everything we try and do this January, we are relying on it. We are completely aligned,\" Silva said at a recent press conference.",
      "\"For me, it's tougher than the summer. If you sign players, they have to make an impact. Not just short term, for the long term.\"",
      "Should they fail to bring new faces, Fulham will be left not just short of players to make a push for Europe, but also possibly short of a manager to match their ambition come the end of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Nottingham Forest had one of the best defences in the Premier League last season but clean sheets have been hard to come by this term. Saturday's stalemate with Arsenal was just their fifth of the campaign - all of them have come under Sean Dyche.",
      "Holding the Premier League leaders felt very much like a Nuno Espirito Santo display from last season and there was a reason for it.",
      "This was the first game since August when Forest could start Matz Sels, Ola Aina, Murillo, Nikola Milenkovic and Neco Williams in a match. That was the back five that gave opposition attacks so little joy last term and it was the same for Arsenal on Saturday.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo made 15 clearances between them. Williams won seven duels when he was up against Noni Madueke and Bukayo Saka. Out of the back four, Aina won most possessions in the defensive and middle thirds.",
      "But in front of them was the star of the show in Elliot Anderson, winning 12 out of his 15 duels. Only William Saliba made more ball recoveries than the England international, who won the battle with Declan Rice in midfield.",
      "Forest may have been dragged closer to the drop zone by West Ham winning but if they keep defending like this, they will be fine in terms of survival.Sam Blitz",

      "Saturday 17 January 2026 18:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",
      "With only three days of preparation, United's new head coach successfully brought back 4-4-2 and delivered a statement performance that reminded Neville of the club he used to play for.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville added.",
      "\"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"I'm sorry, you can play that way in modern football, you've just watched 90 minutes of it, 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "Neville added: \"It's not a time to say that Manchester United will sustain this and carry up the league, this has got to be a bridge towards potentially getting a European place, top five would be amazing.",
      "\"But this is not the return of Manchester United, it's the return of at least something that looks like the club. It's been a pale imitation this last many years really. It's been awful. Some of the performances here, you have to see a good one to remind you about how bad it has been.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener came from a devastating counter-attack and wonderful combination play with captain Bruno Fernandes, no longer restricted to playing as a holding midfielder.",
      "\"I got quite emotional when that goal went in, because I thought, 'that's what I have been asking for, it's what everyone in this ground's been asking for'.",
      "\"Those players have set themselves a standard today, I have to say, they've set themselves a standard in attitude, in aggression, in positivity when they're playing with intent and playing through the lines, everything. You cannot drop below that.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes was Eric \"Cantona-esque\" back playing in the No 10 role after Ruben Amorim had so stubbornly stuck with him as a deep midfielder.",
      "\"That's where he's got to play, be near to goal, be where you can hurt them, because he's a great player. We don't want to see him back in a midfield two in front of a back three.",
      "\"Is that where we want to see him? No, it's definitely not right. I just saw so many things that reminded me of what this club plays like, what their DNA is, what they should be.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always said Manchester United's system is such, you have a forward and then you have a No 10, it can be [Dwight] Yorke, it can be Cantona, it can be [Wayne] Rooney, it can be [Carlos] Tevez, it can be [Dimitar] Berbatov. Those players that just drop in off a striker, Scholes did it for a number of years.",
      "\"We've always had that most talented player close to our striker and feeding them, and that's what made me a little bit emotional on that goal.\"",
      "Before the game, Neville said Carrick's spell in charge should be limited to the rest of the season as he called on INEOS to bring in an experienced head coach.",
      "Despite his delight over the manner of the win, Neville said Carrick's aim should be handing over the team in the best shape possible for the next coach.",
      "\"It is not a time to get giddy or carried away,\" said Neville.",

      "\"Ralf Rangnick came, it didn't quite happen in terms of that handover. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer came in and then got given the job. Michael Carrick's got to hand that baton over in good shape, and that is an unbelievable start for him.\"",
