      "Manchester United boss Michael Carrick has reportedly made a decision on Marcus Rashford(Image: Getty)",
      "Michael Carrick is eyeing up a third win in as many games during his second spell as Manchester United interim manager. His side are preparing to face Fulham at Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim's exit after 14 months at the helm at United was announced in January. On the back of Darren Fletcher's temporary spell, Carrick was brought in once again to man the ship, this time until the season's end.",
      "But with wins against Manchester City and Arsenal already under his belt, Carrick is bolstering his chances of becoming Amorim's permanent successor by the match. His squad host Fulham in the Premier League next and Marco Silva's side will be no pushovers.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Despite looking like he would excel under Amorim, boyhood United star Rashford quickly fell out of favour under the Portuguese manager. He joined Aston Villa on loan last year before a summer loan move to Barcelona.",
      "There, he has enjoyed his football, playing often as a valuable squad player and bagging a handful of goals under Hansi Flick. Rumours inevitably began to emerge regarding a permanent transfer.",
      "The Catalan giants hold a non-mandatory purchase option to buy Rashford for £26million when the season ends, but a new report from The Telegraph claims that Carrick wishes to bring him back to Manchester.",
      "Rashford has enjoyed his time at Barcelona(Image: Getty)",
      "The report states that if Carrick is named permanent boss, he would attempt to welcome Rashford back into the United fold, where the striker played alongside him during the twilight of his career.",
      "However, the same report suggests that Rashford would prefer to stay in Spain, where he is playing a critical role in the club's La Liga and Champions League tilts.",
      "On the topic of permanent transfers, a United academy youngster has departed. Joe Hugill has left the club for Scottish outfit Kilmarnock on a permanent deal.",
      "The former Newcastle and Sunderland youth striker joined United in 2020 and immediately impressed for the academy. In 2023, he joined Altrincham on loan. Hugill's first temporary move was followed by four more, as he played for Burton Albion, Wigan, Carlisle United and Barnet in the years to follow before signing for Kilmarnock this week on an 18-month contract.",
      "Hugill has joined Kilmarnock(Image: Getty)",
      "The 22-year-old took to social media platform Instagram with a heartfelt goodbye. He wrote: \"Thank you to everyone at Manchester United for the past 6 years.",
      "\"The players, the staff, the fans and everyone connected to the club who have made me love every minute along the way. I will always be beyond grateful for my time here and the memories will live with me forever.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford scored his ninth goal of the season against FC Copenhagen(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick wants to bring Marcus Rashford back to Manchester United - if he is named the club’s next permanent manager.",
      "Carrick has enjoyed a dream start to his time as interim boss, after replacing Ruben Amorim following his sacking. The former midfielder has only been in charge for two games, but has earned a pair of standout victories over Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "That has already led to speculation that Carrick could be handed the position on a permanent basis at the end of the season. And if that is the case, the Telegraph report that he would like to bring Rashford back into the fold at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford was ostracised by Amorim, who said he would rather play the 63-year-old goalkeeping coach, than the England international. He joined Aston Villa on loan at the end of the 2024/25 season, before making the move to Barcelona for the current campaign.",
      "The La Liga giants have an option to make that deal permanent, with all signs suggesting that they will execute that £26million clause. However, Carrick, who played with Rashford during the final years of his playing career, still sees a place for him at his boyhood club.",
      "The same report does state that the player himself would rather stay with Barcelona though, where he has scored nine goals and registered 12 assists so far.",
      "Speaking after his midweek goal in the Champions League, Rashford admitted that the style of play under manager Hansi Flick has taken him some time to adapt to.",
      "“I think for the front guys we have to put as much pressure on the ball as possible because the problem is when players have time on the ball to pick the passes and to see what our backline is doing,” he said.",
      "“If they do have time then the backline have to adjust. But it’s our way of playing, it brings an intensity to the game. I think when we play at this intensity it’s difficult for teams to match us.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“For me it takes a little bit of learning to get used to because you can’t let them rest on the ball. Whoever is closest to the ball always has to put pressure. So it’s a little bit different to what I’d done before. But this is the style of defence we play and when it works it’s really good.”",
      "Flick has regularly heaped praise on Rashford and hinted that the final decision over his future will lie with Sporting Director Deco.",
      "He said: \"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's Deco's job to do things for next season.",
      "\"We have to wait. We have months to go. For me, of course with Marcus we have a player on the top level, but also with our situation, and what I appreciate a lot from him [is his desire to be here].\"",
      "Rashford played with Michael Carrick during the latter stages of his playing career",
      "As for the January window, United look set to stand pat, not making any major moves with key departures also unlikely. Joshua Zirkzee had been linked with a potential return to Italy, but Carrick has said he wants him to remain at the club.",
      "\"Josh is just trying to work to get fit and get around the group,” he explained on Friday. “It has been great to have him back training with the group for the first time.",
      "“That is as far as it goes, for me and for Josh. I am looking forward to working with him. That's it, nothing else has been needed to be said.\"",

      "The defender had spent last season with the League Two outfit on loan and has now joined them permanently after making 35 appearances last term. Bennett had enjoyed a loan spell at Stockport prior to his loan move to Highbury Stadium.",
      "Bennett had been with the Premier League giants since he was 10 and has risen through the ranks, captaining the youth side that claimed the FA Cup in 2022, scoring against Nottingham Forest in the final.",
      "The 22-year-old never made an appearance for the Red Devils senior side and was unlikely to force his way into the first-team picture given the quality that already exists in their ranks.",
      "Bennett said upon completing his move to Fleetwood: “I’ve just turned 22 and I think now is the time to kick on and play as many games as I can. I’ve been out on loan, I’ve played a lot of football, and it’s about getting more experience and growing as a player and as a person.”",
      "Last term Fleetwood, who were initially managed by Charlie Adam, finished 14th in the fourth tier but their style of football was a big draw for Bennett. He said: “The style of football really worked for me. We wanted to play, be comfortable on the ball, and the back five suited me. There are a lot of good players here and that helped me kick on.",
      "“I’m absolutely buzzing to be back here. From the moment I came in last time it just felt like a family. I’m really excited to pick up where I left off and get back playing football.”",

But they have been willing to green light departures with Joe Hugill, another player in his early 20s, allowed to leave for Scottish side Kilmarnock.",
      "One player who won't be on the move is Joshua Zirkzee with Michael Carrick strongly hinting that the Dutchman will be staying put despite him falling down the pecking order and there being interest from Italy.",

      "Man United's global reach revealed(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United’s reach as a global football club has been revealed - with season ticket holders in 42 different countries.",
      "In total 7% of United’s 46,800 season ticket holders live outside the UK - from as far afield as Bahrain and Bermuda, New Delhi and New York Outside of the UK the largest number of season ticket holders headng to Old Trafford are in the Republic of Ireland, with 1,616, or 3.5% of the total. Next on the list is Norway, with 837 fans holding tickets.",
      "Third on the list is the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta - which has a population of just 570,000, around 60,000 fewer than the area covered by Manchester council - with 185 season ticket holders.",
      "Patrick Dorgu celebrates scoring at Old Trafford(Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "The figures, uncovered by Mancunian Matters, also show Denmark has 95, Switzerland 73, Sweden 62, Iceland, 23, the Netherlands 22, Belgium 20 and Poland (eight).",
      "There are seven season ticket holders living on the other side of the world in Australia while there are 13 in Thailand. Across the Atlantic there are 66 in the USA and 10 in Canada. Countries with a single season ticket holder include Italy, Croatia, India and even Russia.",
      "Joe Tedesco, President of Manchester United Supporters’ Club Malta, the world’s oldest official United supporters’ club, said: “I actually thought Malta would have more than 185 season ticket holders, we used to have around 500. Covid had a big impact; a lot of people gave up their tickets because they couldn’t travel, and afterwards, the prices of the flights to the UK rocketed.”",
      "He told Mancunian Matters: “Now it’s not unusual to have to pay €600 for a return flight. We are also affected a lot by the kick-off time and date changes for TV. This season in particular, we have had a lot of Monday night games. There have been a lot of instances where people have booked flights for the weekend, returning on Monday morning, only to see the game moved to the Monday night.”",
      "There are 209 season tickets, or 0.4%, registered to addresses outside Europe. In the USA the largest number of fans are in New York (12), followed by Illinois (nine), California (seven), Texas (six) and Virginia (six).",
      "It is unlikely that fans from far afield travel to Manchester 19 times each season. All season tickets are digital, and accessed through a phone app. Through this season ticket holders can create “relationships” with official members and forward their ticket on on a game-by-game basis",
      "The club states that all season tickets must be used for 16 out of 19 league games per season.",
      "United has over 330 supporters’ clubs globally, many of which share season tickets between their members depending on who is available to travel.",
      "Thai MUSC is one of the largest Manchester United supporters’ clubs in Asia. Their club chair said: ““Season tickets offer a great seat location and we can easily forward them to whichever of our members can attend the game.",
      "“Myself and our secretary travel to Manchester once or twice a season. Over the past few years it has been harder for our members to travel – each trip costs around £2,000 – and so we have donated the tickets to the Manchester United Foundation when no-one from the club can make the game.”",

      "Harry Maguire is facing a crossroads at Manchester United this summer(Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United's Harry Maguire faces a pivotal moment this summer as his contract nears its end. But the situation poses a dilemma for the club where he has been a defensive mainstay for seven years.",
      "Despite experiencing ups and downs in form, Maguire has managed to maintain his reputation in Manchester. Some might argue that despite the scrutiny he has faced since his move from Leicester City in 2019, he has justified his £80million price tag over time.",
      "However, the reality is the player will turn 33 in March and offers little in terms of resale value. The world's most expensive defender extended his contract with United for one year last summer but could now potentially leave on a free transfer.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Currently one of United's top earners with a weekly wage of £200,000, Maguire will need to agree to a pay cut if he decides to renew his contract at Old Trafford. His next contract could be the final significant deal of his career, but United currently hold a strong negotiating position.",
      "Currently, only three other United players are understood to earn more than Maguire: captain Bruno Fernandes, the outgoing Casemiro and fellow centre-back Matthijs de Ligt. However, it's undeniable there are significantly more than three players at Old Trafford who hold greater value than the England defender today.",
      "Should Maguire agree to these terms, it's conceivable he could sign a new, shorter-term contract. Much of this will hinge on the player himself and his desire to remain part of the United squad.",
      "In a similar vein to the two-year deal Virgil van Dijk agreed to stay at Liverpool last summer, Maguire could potentially continue further into his mid-thirties as one of the longest-serving United stars among the current group. While he may not have had the same impact as his Anfield counterpart, United at least know what they're getting with Maguire.",
      "Scott McTominay and Maguire could feasibly reunite in Naples(Image: Visionhaus via Getty Images)",
      "One potential move being mooted for Maguire is a summer transfer to Serie A. After all, the Italian adventure has proved highly successful for former team-mate Scott McTominay, who has been outstanding at Napoli since his move in the summer of 2024.",
      "The Athletic has reported representatives in Italy have reached out to Maguire's agent, keeping an eye on the player's situation. The appeal is clear, as it would keep Maguire in one of Europe's top leagues, which is arguably better suited to his style of play.",
      "The Yorkshire-born player has developed a reputation for his composure on the ball, despite occasional dips in confidence over the years. The current Maguire exudes a more capable aura when in possession, a trait crucial for a defender's success in today's Serie A.",
      "His prowess in aerial duels would also be an asset in a league that has shaped the careers of many defenders. Antonio Conte's Napoli have been linked with the player since McTominay's arrival, hinting at a possible reunion in Naples.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "In recent weeks, there have also been strong reports about a potential move to Turkey. It is understood Super Lig clubs have reached out to Maguire's agent, hoping to pique his interest.",
      "Several high-profile English players have joined the Super Lig in recent years, with varying levels of success. Tammy Abraham, Daniel Sturridge, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Dele Alli have all made the journey across the Mediterranean, often landing in Istanbul.",
      "Signing with one of Turkey's top clubs usually offers the added advantage of a clearer path to Champions League football. Clubs like Galatasaray or Fenerbahce regularly participate in Europe's premier competition, providing an extra incentive for a move to the Super Lig.",
      "Maguire could extend his Premier League career beyond Old Trafford(Image: Getty)",
      "While some players may be drawn to experience football abroad towards the end of their careers, this might not be the case for Maguire. Should he wish to remain in England, there will undoubtedly be a number of interested Premier League clubs.",
      "West Ham have been linked with the player on several occasions over the years. It's even believed the Hammers had all but signed a £30m agreement for the player in 2023, only for the deal to fall through.",
      "At the time, it was speculated Maguire would agree to reduce his wages to around £120,000 a week to join West Ham. This gives an indication of how much United could potentially cut the player's salary if he signs an extension, as well as providing a benchmark for what rival clubs might expect to pay should they sign him.",
      "Everton were also linked with the player during the summer of 2023, and the Toffees have a history of signing former United players. Maguire would fit David Moyes' preference for tall, robust centre-backs, and one could envision him fitting into a rotation alongside the likes of Michael Keane and James Tarkowski.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Upon finalising his move to Old Trafford, Fernandes shared the pivotal role Ronaldo played in sealing the deal. Not only did the seasoned striker speak to Fernandes but he also gave positive feedback about the midfielder to his former teammate and then-United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "\"Yes, I talked about Manchester United with Cristiano,\" Fernandes told United's official website. \"He just said good things about United. He said he started living his dream here and he started being a really good player here. I think he is happy with my transfer.\"",
      "The Portuguese midfielder continued: \"I also talked with Ole and he said he asked Cristiano about me,\" Fernandes explained. \"And he said good things about me, which is good! Cristiano plays with me in the national team and he knows me and for me he's a good person. I want to follow his steps.\"",

      "Joshua Zirkzee has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have sold forward Joe Hugill but Michael Carrick has no plans to continue a frontline exodus by sanctioning the exit of Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Hugill, now 22, has been at the club since signing as a teenager from Sunderland but has been unable to break into the first-team picture. He's had spell away from Old Trafford with the likes of Altrincham, Burton Albion, Wigan and Carlisle, but will now complete a permanent move to Kilmarnock.",
      "United don't intend to let Zirkzee follow him out of the exit door despite there being talk of the Dutchman heading back to Italy, where he initially made his name before joining the Premier League giants in 2024.",
      "He has struggled for goals in that time, which led the club to invest heavily in their frontline, pushing him down the pecking order, and the likes of Juventus have been linked with a move.",
      "Carrick though insists he's ready to have Zirkzee be part of his squad. He said: \"Josh is just trying to work to get fit and get around the group. It has been great to have him back training with the group for the first time. That is as far as it goes, for me and for Josh. I am looking forward to working with him. That's it, nothing else has been needed to be said.\"",
      "Zirkzee has been limited to just four Premier League starts and has only scored twice this term with minutes hard to come by. He saw Rasmus Hojlund leave in the summer and the Dane has since impressed back in Italy with Napoli, but it doesn't look as if Zirkzee will be joining him.",
      "Carrick had been told that, despite being named head coach until the end of the season, he would have to work with the squad he inherited. United's recruitment plans are on hold until the summer but the man in the dugout is not ruling out any just yet with the window closing on Monday night.",
      "Joe Hugill has left Manchester on a permanent basis(Image: PA)",
      "He said: \"I think we are just working through it, never say never. A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up. Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes it is out of our control that we have got to deal with. We are calm, I am pretty calm. We have got and we have shown what we are capable of doing as a team. We will have to see what the next few days bring. But we are calm about it.\"",
      "United's major target is a midfielder, but their targets will not be available until the summer and won't come cheap. They're eyeing the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba.",

      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed a successful first two games in charge of Manchester United. (Image: Justin Setterfield, Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has suggested that United might consider appointing Michael Carrick permanently if his initial success with the club continues. In his opening two matches since taking temporary charge until the end of the season, Carrick has guided the team to victories against both Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "These results have propelled them to fourth position in the Premier League standings and sparked discussion about a possible permanent role. However, United legend Gary Neville has cast doubt on whether the former midfielder possesses the qualities needed to manage the side on a long-term basis.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football Podcast, he said: \"Michael's not got the job because of his managerial record at Middlesbrough, he's got the job because of his knowledge of United and that Ruud (Van Nistelrooy) and Ole (Gunnar Solskjaer) had already been in before a little bit more than him maybe, and there was a feeling of 'let's have something fresh'.",
      "\"So Michael's got the job because basically of being in the right place at the right time, that is not the criteria of being a Manchester United manager.\"",
      "Keane then alluded to what he believes could unfold based on previous occurrences. \"How many times have we seen managers going in, and doing a job for a good month or two, then they get the job and they're gone a few months later?\" He asked.",

      "In a playful tone, Neville then turned to fellow pundit and Arsenal legend Ian Wright and quipped: \"The right path for Michael, might just be at the end of the season when Arsenal don't win the league and he goes there.\"",
      "As the discussion about Carrick carried on, former Lioness Jill Scott encouraged United fans to savour the current form and not get ahead of themselves. \"Now, if you're a United fan, just enjoy one game a week and you're winning,\" she said.",

      "Michael Carrick, interim head coach of Manchester United(Image: Nigel French/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are just one victory away from equaling Ruben Amorim’s longest Premier League winning streak as they prepare to host Fulham at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. Michael Carrick’s rejuvenated side come into this fixture on a high, having edged out league leaders Arsenal 3-2 in a thrilling encounter last weekend, while Fulham strengthened their European credentials with a 2-1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "Since taking over from Amorim, Carrick has made an immediate impact—whether as a temporary or permanent appointment—guiding United to consecutive statement wins over Manchester City and Arsenal. After a 2-0 derby triumph, United followed up with a dramatic five-goal contest at the Emirates, where Bryan Mbeumo, Patrick Dorgu, and a spectacular effort from Matheus Cunha handed Arsenal their first home defeat of the season in any competition.",
      "Carrick’s impressive start has only enhanced his prospects for a long-term role, as he becomes the first manager since February 2010 to claim back-to-back victories over the Premier League’s top two teams. United now sit in pole position in the race for fourth, holding a one-point advantage over Chelsea and a two-point cushion over Liverpool ahead of gameweek 24. Their current six-match unbeaten run is the longest in the top flight.",
      "United’s attacking reinforcements from the summer are proving their worth, with the team scoring in each of their last 11 league games and conceding just once in their last three matches at Old Trafford. Carrick has already overcome two of his toughest challenges since returning to the helm, but another test awaits as Marco Silva’s Fulham arrive with their own European ambitions.",
      "Fulham’s season started inconsistently, with nine wins and nine losses between late August and mid-December, but they have since lost just once in their last eight matches across all competitions, winning five. Harry Wilson was the hero in their latest outing, netting a stoppage-time free kick to complete a dramatic 2-1 comeback against Brighton at Craven Cottage.",
      "Sitting seventh in the table and only four points off the top four, Fulham’s improved away form has been crucial, earning 10 points from their last five Premier League away games after managing just one from their first six on the road this season. Silva’s men also held United to a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage earlier this campaign and can take confidence from their last league win at Old Trafford in February 2024—though that remains their only top-flight victory at the Theatre of Dreams in their past 20 visits.",
      "Manchester United’s versatile defender-turned-attacker Patrick Dorgu experienced both elation and disappointment against Arsenal—after netting a stunning goal-of-the-season contender, the Dane was forced off with a serious hamstring injury that is expected to sideline him for around 10 weeks. Dorgu’s absence opens the door for either Matheus Cunha or Benjamin Sesko to step into the lineup, but Cunha is likely to get the nod—either operating out wide or partnering Bryan Mbeumo, who should feature on the left—following his dramatic match-winner in North London.",
      "Aside from Dorgu, United have just two other fitness concerns: Matthijs de Ligt (back) and Joshua Zirkzee (unspecified), though neither is expected to break into the starting XI at this stage.",
      "For Fulham, manager Marco Silva could have right-back Kenny Tete available again after a thigh injury, but Rodrigo Muniz and Sasa Lukic are set to remain sidelined with similar issues. The Nigerian trio of Calvin Bassey, Alex Iwobi, and Samuel Chukwueze have all returned to the squad following their Africa Cup of Nations duties, and Chukwueze will be pushing for a starting spot after coming off the bench to score Fulham’s equaliser against Brighton.",
      "Chukwueze replacing Kevin could be one of two changes on Fulham’s left flank, as Antonee Robinson was substituted after just 59 minutes last weekend and may be replaced by Ryan Sessegnon in the starting lineup.",

      "Sekou Kone is reportedly poised to join Lausanne on loan for the remainder of the season, marking a rare exception to an otherwise quiet January transfer window for Manchester United. Business has been subdued at Old Trafford this month, as Michael Carrick focuses on achieving success in the Premier League with his existing squad.",
      "United are yet to confirm any incomings or outgoings in January, but that could change if recent reports surrounding Kone prove accurate. The 19-year-old is believed to be close to securing a loan switch to Lausanne for the rest of the campaign.",
      "Meanwhile, the defensive midfielder has been working with the Swiss Super League side for several days whilst awaiting the final details of the transfer to be completed.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS purchased the Swiss club in November 2017 and have subsequently incorporated it into a wider portfolio of European clubs, including OGC Nice and a stake in United.",
      "Given United place considerable trust in their academy starlets, it is believed that Kone will head to Lausanne for the next phase of his development. It is anticipated that the Mali youth international should receive substantial playing time with Lausanne, particularly as one of their regular midfielders, Souleymane Ndiaye, has been sidelined for up to three months.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The club announced on their official website: \"Souleymane Ndiaye had a very encouraging start to the season, enjoying the confidence of the coaching staff and notably making his first start in Skopje against Vardar during the UEFA Conference League qualifiers.",
      "\"After being sidelined by several injuries for several weeks, he made his return to competition at the beginning of 2026. He came on as a substitute against Servette FC, then against BSC Young Boys, a match in which he provided an assist, contributing to Lausanne's first victory at the Wankdorf Stadium in over 13 years.",
      "\"Having suffered from pain in both shoulders for several months, the player and the club have mutually agreed to opt for surgery in order to resolve these problems in the long term. FC Lausanne-Sport wishes Souleymane Ndiaye a speedy and full recovery.\"",
      "United may be wise to be monitoring Kone's progress carefully, given they may look for a new addition in midfield this summer. Casemiro confirmed earlier this month that he'll depart the club when his contract runs out at the end of the campaign, bringing to a close an impressive four-year spell with the Reds.",
      "Announcing his departure on Instagram, the Brazilian wrote: \"Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever.",
      "\"Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal. Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",
      "Sekou Kone is set to leave Manchester United on loan",
      "Despite being linked with a host of midfielders in recent times, including Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson among others, it seems that United will bide their time and make their move in the summer transfer window rather than rushing into any hasty deals.",
      "However, with a wealth of talent emerging from the youth ranks - including Kone, Kobbie Mainoo and Toby Collyer - it may not be long before these academy stars get their chance to shine on the big stage.",

      "The 31-year-old knows his next deal will be the last major one of his career, and that he needs to cash in. United would have to offer Fernandes a new and improved deal of around £400,000-a-week, to stand a chance of keeping him. His current deal runs until 2027, but has a buy-out clause of £60m.",
      "Carrick insists Fernandes is still happy and committed to United at the moment - but discussion over what comes next will take place closer to the end of the campaign. He said: \"We all want to win things. We all want to get better. We want to we want to improve as a team.",

      "Dorgu has been in fine form for the Red Devils in recent weeks but injured his hamstring in the 3-2 win over Arsenal last weekend. It has since been claimed the Denmark international, 21, could be absent for as long as 10 weeks, sparking fears Carrick will be deprived of a key player for a significant period.",

      "Michael Carrick can plan for the final months of the season without the worry of fixture overload(Image: (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images))",
      "According to the bookmakers, Claudio Ranieri’s side were still not favourites to win the title. To a large extent, that was understandable. After all, two powerful, deep squads were breathing down their necks and Mauricio Pochettino’s Spurs were playing some very decent stuff.",
      "And Leicester had finished 14th the season before. But what the bookmakers and a lot of fans and pundits did not factor in was the respective workloads.",
      "Leicester only had their remaining 15 Premier League games to deal with. Fifteen matches in 15 weeks. It turned out that, during that time, Arsenal and Spurs would play 21 times while Manchester City would play 25 times.",
      "Arsenal finished second, ten points behind Leicester. Spurs were a point further away in third, with City 15 points behind the remarkable champions. Of those last 15 matches, Ranieri’s men won ten, drew four and lost only one - a slightly controversial narrow defeat at the Emirates that saw Leicester reduced to ten men after taking the lead.",
      "In those last 15 matches, they scored 26 goals and conceded only eight. For those who put great importance on the relative workloads in the second half of the season, this was considerable weight to their argument that fixture demands can play a pivotal part in the final standings.",
      "Matheus Cunha's strike at the Emirates gave Michael Carrick his second win in two matches as Manchester United boss(Image: Getty)",
      "And a decade on, Manchester United will add a bit more weight. A decade ago, the bookmakers got it wrong when Leicester City - when leading after 23 games - were still not favourites to win the title and they have got it wrong now by having United at odds against finishing in the top four (albeit narrowly at 5/4). They should be way shorter than that.",
      "Naturally, commentators and a lot of supporters are calling for calm after the dramatic and successful start to Michael Carrick’s tenure. But a dispassionate look, not only at the fantastic victories over Manchester City at Old Trafford and Arsenal at the Emirates but at the physical demands of the remainder of the season, tells you why Carrick and United fans should be bullish.",
      "Harry Maguire has got a World Cup incentive to perform well in the final 15 games of the Premier League season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Around the training complexes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and others, the phrase you will probably hear most is ‘red zone’. Players in the red zone. Players having to have minutes managed. Presumably, we are not going to hear that from Carrick.",
      "This season, United have played 25 games across all competitions. That compares to 36 for Chelsea and Manchester City (who both played in the Club World Cup in the summer), 35 for Liverpool (if you include the Community Shield) and 33 for Aston Villa.",
      "United now have 15 games left in 15 weeks. Liverpool and Aston Villa have a minimum of 18 games left, while City and Chelsea have a minimum of 19 games. And most, if not all, those teams will face more.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong is the latest casualty at Liverpool as injuries pile up for Manchester United's top-four rivals(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Considering his recent form, the injury to Patrick Dorgu is bad news for United and for Carrick, but the manager has a largely fit squad with plenty of options. It was one heck of a bench Carrick named at the Emirates. Eight of United’s remaining fixtures are at home and Carrick has a core of English players - Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and possibly even Mason Mount - who know they have 15 club games to prove they are worthy of a place in Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup squad.",
      "Carrick is a very impressive character, a very likeable individual, a very well-respected figure in the game, with a very good reputation at the club. The party line would probably be that it is way too early to judge, that there should be no knee-jerk reaction to two stellar results.",
      "But everything is set up for Carrick to take United to fourth place or even higher. The job is surely his to lose.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already revealed his dream midfield maestro for Manchester United. After confirmation that Casemiro is set to leave Old Trafford when the season ends, focus has naturally shifted to who could step into the Brazilian's shoes.",
      "United have been linked with a host of prominent targets, such as Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba. The expectation is that the club will invest heavily during the summer window to strengthen the middle of the park, especially with Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future also uncertain.",
      "However, Ratcliffe cannot land his 'dream' acquisition, as that particular star has been retired for more than a decade. In 2024, the INEOS chairman was asked which former United icon he would revive at their peak to feature under then-head coach Erik ten Hag - and he barely hesitated.",
      "\"I think I'd bring Paul Scholes,\" he said on The Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast. \"That's the player that they are sort of most missing.",

      "\"They've got a couple of players who are not Roy Keane but - Casemiro and [Kobbie] Mainoo - they're sort of quite defensive midfielders, you know? But they don't have a Paul Scholes or an [Andreas] Iniesta.\"",
      "Since Ratcliffe took charge of football operations in February 2024, the Red Devils have spent in excess of £400million on new arrivals. During the 2024/25 season, recruitment efforts were clearly focused on shoring up the defence, with Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu all signed to reinforce the back line.",
      "In 2025/26, attention shifted sharply to attacking reinforcements, as United reshaped their frontline by bringing in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With those positions now strengthened, the spotlight is firmly expected to fall on midfield recruitment in the upcoming summer window.",
      "Paul Scholes is Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 'dream' midfielder(Image: Daily Mirror)",
      "Very few available players can mirror Scholes' combination of technical excellence, creativity and precise distribution. Even so, reports indicate that United are ready to pursue one or two top-tier additions in order to complete their squad overhaul.",
      "Casemiro has been a pivotal presence in the middle of the park, registering 150 appearances over three-and-a-half seasons following his move from Real Madrid. Although his form has fluctuated, his experience and influence will be difficult to replace, particularly given Manuel Ugarte's struggles.",
      "The Uruguayan has featured from the start in only seven league games this season and speculation suggests he could be sold in the summer unless his situation improves under interim boss Michael Carrick.",
      "Casemiro will leave United at the end of the season(Image: Gareth Copley, Getty Images)",
      "Mainoo has also faced uncertainty, having fallen out of favour during Ruben Amorim's tenure. Carrick, however, quickly reinstated the England international, awarding him starts in back-to-back wins over Manchester City and Arsenal - marking his first league appearances of the season.",
      "With doubts surrounding United's midfield options and Ratcliffe's long-standing admiration for Scholes well known, the club's next transfer decision could shape the next chapter of their rebuild.",
      "With uncertainty swirling around United's midfield and Ratcliffe's admiration for Scholes well-documented, the club's next move in the market could define the next phase of their rebuild. And if they can find even a fraction of the control, creativity and authority Scholes once provided, it may finally give Old Trafford the heartbeat it has long been craving.",

It is worth noting that none of the four joined from one of United's historic rivals, Manchester City or Liverpool - indeed, no player has joined United from either of those clubs in the Premier League era and on a couple of occasions, they even had later moves blocked.",
      "Brahim Diaz was in the headlines early this month for his penalty miss in the Africa Cup of Nations final. Back in 2019, though, his name was associated with a unique clause inserted when he left City for Real Madrid.",
      "According to reports at the time from ESPN, Madrid's swoop, which would cost them up to £22m including add-ons, also carried a 15 per cent sell-on clause. If Los Blancos ended up selling Brahim to United, though, the amount would reportedly rise to 40 per cent.",

      "The 31-year-old has 103 goals and 97 assists in 312 games for United, but he came close to leaving last summer when there was interest from the Saudi Pro League. His future is again uncertain heading into this summer.",

      "But Carrick has no doubt how important Fernandes is at Old Trafford, having seen the immediacy of his impact in January 2020 and the quality he still has now that the 44-year-old has returned as the club's sixth head coach since Fernandes joined.",
      "\"I've seen the impact he had as soon as he got here. I was obviously here, so I've seen it at close quarters,\" said Carrick. \"He had a huge impact straight away in so many ways. You could see the passion and how much he wanted to do well straight away.",
      "\"You've seen the quality and that's carried on all the way through and his consistency really of performances, his level of performances, his willingness to always put himself out there and physically be able to do it. So credit him for it in that respect.\"",

      "He reopened the debate over his future recently, suggesting that United wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the courage to tell him, and that he has a clause in his contract that could see him leave again this year.",
      "Carrick insists the club captain is happy and committed to United at the moment and said any discussion over what comes next will wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"We all want to win things. We all want to get better. We want to we want to improve as a team,\" said Carrick. \"We want to be successful and that's something we've got to work towards together, but Bruno's been fantastic since I've been here.

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick has spoken to the media this afternoon ahead of Sunday's visit from Fulham in the Premier League.",
      "Carrick confirmed Joshua Zirkzee has returned to training at Carrington this week following his short time out with injury. He also refused the notion that Zirkzee was looking to leave Old Trafford before the January transfer window shuts.",
      "However, there was bad news for Patrick Dorgu. Carrick said the injury is more on the serious side than they first thought and that he will be out for a period of time, albeit a timescale has not been set.",
      "When asked about any late January transfer window moves, Carrick refused to rule out but he was calm about the situation and working with the squad he has at his disposal. The interim head coach reiterated the importance of Bruno Fernandes and insisted Mason Mount remains an important member of the team despite his chances being limited since Ruben Amorim left.",
      "Take a look back at everything Carrick said below...",
      "That is the end of our coverage on the MEN blog. Make sure to stay tuned to our website for more build-up to this weekend's game.",
      "Carrick has told Manchester United it would be \"bang out of order\" to show any complacency against Fulham on the back of two stunning wins in his first games in charge. Carrick has guided United to victories against Manchester City and Arsenal, beating the Premier League's top two in successive games to move up to fourth in the table, but the challenge this weekend will be very different.",
      "United have produced perfect game plans to take on City and Arsenal but they will be expected to dominate against the Cottagers at Old Trafford and beating sides below them in the league at home has been a challenge at times this season.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Carrick has refused to rule out the possibility of Manchester United signing somebody before the transfer window closes on Monday, after being dealt with a blow with the news that Patrick Dorgu has picked up a hamstring injury. Dorgu had been in fine form for United and started the past two games on the left wing, scoring against Manchester City and Arsenal, but he is now out for a couple of months after picking up the injury at the Emirates.",
      "United have insisted all January that they would only make a move for a player who was a long-term target this month and the chances of that happening were receeding, but Carrick suggested conversations around recruitment were still going on.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That is everything from the first part of Carrick's press conference. Those quotes have been tidied up and we shall hear more from Carrick in the second part of his press conference later.",
      "Big fan of Mason, there is so many good things to like about him. His quality to start with, his attitude, personality. That's why we have a squad, certain times, certain games, certain players will play. As we work through the season, that will come to fruition. I like Mason a lot and he is an important player for this team and this club.",
      "I don't think we need to make too much of it, we are where we are. The feeling in the group, around the squad, the results we have had and going into the next game, I don't think the past is too relevant in that respect in terms of what has worked before. I think the boys are in a good place going into the game. It is a tough game, a really tough challenge. Marco has got them into a really good team. All of a sudden Fulham is a different game because we are at home. Taking anything for granted is bang out of order really and it might be the case the flow of the game is the same as the last two. There is no shame in that. We will deal with game in front of us and we will do whatever it takes to come out on top.",
      "I have seen the impact as soon as I got here. I was obviously here so I saw him in close quarters. He had a huge impact straightaway and in so many ways. You could see the passion, you could see how much he wanted to do well. Straightaway you could see the quality and that has carried on all the way through. His consistency of performances and level of performances, his willingness to always put himself out there and being physically capable to do it. There is a lot to credit him for, in that respect. Of course, we all want to win things, we all want to get better and to improve as a team, we want to be successful and that is something we want to work towards together but Bruno has been fantastic since I have been here, he was fantastic when I was here before. Nothing but good things to say about him.",
      "Let's not get too far ahead. We are working towards this game and we are talking about the window now and it is closing in a few days. That is on the agenda a little bit but my main agenda is getting through the game with Fulham on Sunday and Bruno is fully committed. No issues at all with that. Things further down the line will be addressed towards the end of the season. Everything is positive at the moment and there is no reason to be anything otherwise.",
      "Josh is just trying to work to get fit and get around the group. It has been great to have him back training with the group for the first time. That is as far as it goes, for me and for Josh. I am looking forward to working with him. That's it, nothing else has been needed to be said.",
      "I think we are just working through it, never say never. A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up. Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes it is out of our control that we have got to deal with. We are calm, I am pretty calm. We have got and we have shown what we are capable of doing as a team. We will have to see what the next few days bring. But we are calm about it.",
      "It is not ideal, of course it is not, we don't want to lose good players from the group. That is part of having a squad and assembling a squad to be able to cover certain things. We have got players who can do that. It is the nature of the beast, unfortunately.",
      "You have got to play with feeling, emotion, excitement. It is something we speak about. The tactical and technical side is one thing but what we have just touched on is totally something else. The boys have been there in training and in games, meetings and everything around the place they have been there in everything we have asked of them, with everything we have asked. Licha has epitomised that with how he has gone about every day and certainly in the games. We are aware about what it has taken to have the couple of weeks we have had. A couple of weeks is a couple of weeks, it is good but it is two weeks. We are definitely aware it is something we need to extend for longer. We need to respect the game, what it takes to win games, how hard it is and how good a team Fulham are. That is definitely at the forefront of our minds.",
      "Consistency is the key to success it is one of the most difficult things to achieve. It takes so much, it takes a level of performance, a level of mentality, intensity and concentration and actually being able to cope emotionally with the ups and downs of what this game brings and moving onto the next. There is so many things that kind of go into it. That is what we are working towards it, we have had a great couple of weeks - two big results. There is big games coming up. It is about keeping the mind in the right place as much as the emotions to go onto the next game just as we have done the previous two.",
      "Josh is back training this week, which is good news. He has been out for a short amount of time, first training with us since we have been here so that is great to have Josh back. Pat unfortunately is going to be out for a period of time. Still working through how long that is going to be. Disappointing because he has had such a big couple of weeks, we weren't sure if it was a little bit of cramp or if it was something more serious, at the moment it is looking a little bit more of a serious note. A few weeks out, how many weeks? We will have to wait and see. It is disappointing for all of us and Pat, he is in such a good place but unfortunately it is part of football and something you have got to work through and get him back as soon as we can.",
      "De Ligt is not training with us yet. Just working through the process of getting him back as soon as we can.",
      "Carrick is here and the press conference is about to begin. Stay tuned for updates...",
      "We are just 15 minutes away from hearing what Carrick has to say ahead of United's clash with Fulham at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United will not move for Cole Palmer, the Chelsea and England star, this summer for two key reasons. Firstly, and simply, United bosses know that Palmer, a boyhood supporter of the club, is out of the club's price range this summer. And secondly, an attacking midfielder is not on the club's list of priorities when it comes to strengthening the side.",
      "United invested almost £135million in the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer, while also spending big on a new No.9 in Benjamin Sesko. With Amad making rapid progress too, they aren't short of options in attacking positions, and believe other areas need greater attention this off-season.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "When Carrick sits down in front of the media this afternoon, there is a number of topics which could come up. Here's what we expect him to discuss in 45 minutes:",
      "We are just one hour away from the start of Carrick's press conference! Carrick will be sitting down at 1:15pm with his quotes embargoed until 1:30pm. Once the embargo lifts, we will have everything the interim boss has to say.",
      "If Michael Carrick wants to take the Manchester United job permanently, he has got off to the best possible start winning over the hearts and minds of everyone at Old Trafford. Thanks to his success as a player, the fans were already willing to give the former midfielder a fair go. The boardroom and the existing players were always going to be the ones he would find it more difficult to convince. While Ineos chose to put their faith in Carrick until the end of the season, there is a sense the appointment was made to give them more time to sort a long-term plan.",
      "Had Ruben Amorim left at the start of the summer, it would have been surprising if Carrick was anywhere near the conversation to replace him. Therefore, the 44-year-old needed to convince Ineos he is more than just a caretaker keeping things ticking over - should he want the job permanently.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Lammens has doubtless never experienced anything quite like what he did at the Emirates on Sunday. The viral picture that did the rounds earlier this week, showing him surrounded by players from both sides, does a good job of explaining the test for goalkeepers against Arsenal. It was clear the Gunners fancied their chances of getting at an inexperienced goalkeeper at this level. Time and again, they crowded him out, blocked his path to the ball and looked to stick deliveries right into his six-yard box. It was a tactic that had worked against the last two Manchester United goalkeepers they have faced.",
      "Andre Onana was unconvincing in a Premier League defeat at the Emirates last season, and Altay Bayindir was found flapping at Old Trafford on the opening day of this season.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "United bosses are yet to decide on what to do about Harry Maguire - with club chiefs understood to be split over the future of the veteran centre-back. Maguire, now 32, will become a free agent in June, and has not been offered a contract extension to remain at Old Trafford. He is allowed to open talks with other clubs - and his representatives from 'Triple S Management' have been in dialogue with some from across Europe..",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reluctant to hand Maguire a new deal. Instead, he believes young duo Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven can develop into a long-term partnership, while United also have Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt to lean on - a duo still in the mid 20s but whom boast a wealth of experience.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Good morning and welcome along to the United press conference blog! The Reds welcome Fulham to Old Trafford this weekend with spirits high after brilliant wins over City and Arsenal. Carrick is likely to be in a good mood but only if the news surrounding Dorgu's injury is good. The Dane limped off during the defeat to the Gunners and while Carrick suggested it was cramp, reports claim the winger could be out for ten weeks with a hamstring complaint. United fans are also set to protest against the ownership before the game and Carrick could well be asked about this in his press conference.",
      "Stay tuned for updates..."

      "The 22-year-old has also been linked to Atletico Madrid, Manchester City, Tottenham, Juventus and Strasbourg.",
      "Harry Maguire and Manchester United look to have very different stances on a new contract for the 23-year-old.",
      "That is according to Ben Jacobs, as per The United Stand, as he claims that Maguire is awaiting a formal contract offer following discussions in 2025, while United are still assessing their position having intentionally delayed the decision.",
      "He has just a few months remaining on his current deal but has been influential in United's change in fortunes under Michael Carrick.",
      "Some shock claims are being made out in Spain that Diogo Dalot has become an 'immediate priority' for Real Madrid.",
      "That is what Fichajes are reporting as injuries in defence continue to plague Real which has resulted in Federico Valverde filling in at right-back.",
      "Dalot is not quite untouchable and therefore a sizeable offer, while highly unlikely, could turn heads, but he is an important member of the United squad that Michael Carrick likely wants to keep.",
      "Alan Shearer has handed Manchester United a clear Adam Wharton transfer update, via Betfair.",
      "I think Adam Wharton is a brilliant talent. Crystal Palace got a great deal when signing him from Blackburn for around £20 million",
      "I don’t know what the cost would be to get him out there, it’s a very tough time for Palace. If Wharton was to leave Palace, he would have a lot of clubs after him. And I mean the big clubs as well who have got money to spend. He would also cost a few quid.",
      "Wherever he went, if he went to Man United, he would improve them. Same with Newcastle, same with Liverpool. The only thing that I guess is the one or two niggling injuries that he’s had. But he’s a really, really talented player who will improve any team.",
      "Marcus Rashford could be involved in a Barcelona swap deal which would see Manchester United sign a midfielder.",
      "According to The Touchline on X, the Spanish club have proposed including Marc Casado in a swap deal for Rashford.",
      "Barcelona look to be attempting to find alternative ways to sign the on-loan winger as signing him permanently using the buy-option appears difficult given their financial problems.",
      "Two Manchester United players have left the club in the last 12 hours with one of those heading out on loan and the other departing permanently.",
      "Toby Collyer spent the first half of the season at West Brom before being recalled and he has now been sent back out on loan with Hull City this time acquiring his services.",
      "Elsewhere, Joe Hugill has joined Scottish side Kilmarnock on a permanent deal after a challenging first half of the campaign out on loan at League Two Barnet.",
      "Hello and welcome back to MEN's Manchester United transfer live blog.",
      "For all the latest January transfer rumours from Old Trafford - which includes updates on Marcus Rashford and Adam Wharton - stay tuned to this page!",
      "Real Madrid are contemplating a move for Diogo Dalot, according to reports from Spain. The Manchester United defender often splits the fan-base, but Spanish outlet Fichajes understands Los Blancos are considering moving for him.",
      "While this rumour should be taken with a pinch of salt, Real have endured numerous injuries to captain Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Signing Dalot would mean they'd no longer have to deploy midfielder Fede Valverde at right back.",
      "Michael Carrick has not ruled out the prospect of late arrivals joining Manchester United this month. The interim United manager said:\"I think we are just working through it, never say never.",
      "\"A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up. Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes it is out of our control that we have got to deal with.",
      "\"We are calm, I am pretty calm. We have got and we have shown what we are capable of doing as a team. We will have to see what the next few days bring. But we are calm about it.”",
      "Manchester United academy graduate Toby Collyer has joined Hull City on loan. He will finish the campaign with the Tigers, who are looking to secure promotion to the Premier League.",
      "When asked about Collyer's arrival, Hull manager Sergej Jakirovic said: \"We spoke already this summer.",
      "\"It was a very nice conversation together with Jonny Evans at that time, who was the loan manager (at United), but at that time he chose West Brom, which is OK I respect that.",
      "\"Maybe he didn't believe that we would have a good season, and have a good team. It was tricky back then, when you have an embargo, you cannot bring the players.",
      "\"Also, you must look after yourself because you need the minutes, and maybe in our team it's easier to get the minutes.\"",
      "Barcelona midfielder Raphinha displayed his gratefulness for Marcus Rashford's contributions. The Manchester United striker scored in the Catalans' crucial 4-1 victory over Copenhagen.",
      "The La Liga heavyweights are yet to decide if they will sign the United academy graduate permanently, when his loan comes to an end. However, Raphinha appeared to suggest they'd want him to stay at the club with an Instagram post in tribute to the striker.",
      "The Brazilian uploaded a picture of himself celebrating with Rashford, with two rocket emojis and a fire one overlaying. It suggests the Barcelona player would relish playing with Rashford beyond his loan spell.",
      "Chelsea have put a €200million (£173m) price-tag on Cole Palmer to ward off interest from the likes of Manchester United. According to Fichajes, that's the price United will have to pay if they want to sway him to Old Trafford.",
      "However, even that may not be enough for the Blues, who have also said Palmer is \"untouchable\" and is expected to remain where he is. He also signed a deal keeping him at the club until 2023 when he arrived at the slub in the summer of 2023.",
      "Michael Carrick's sobering comments on Patrick Dorgu suggests Manchester United will be without him for a while. The interim boss said: \"Pat, unfortunately, he's going to be out for a period of time. We're still working through how long that's going to be,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"We'll have to see, it's disappointing, he's had such a big couple of weeks, Pat. We weren't sure whether it was a little bit of cramp or whether it was something a little bit more serious and at the moment it looks a little bit more on the serious note.",
      "\"So, it'll be a few weeks for that. How many weeks? We'll have to wait and see. So, that's disappointing for all of us really, and for Pat, he's in such a good place, but unfortunately it is part of football and it's something we've got to work through and get him back as soon as we can.\"",
      "If he is to be out for a pivotal few weeks, it beggars the question as to whether United should strengthen in the attacking areas he would have filled.",
      "Manchester United legend Jaap Stam has told his former club to sign Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba. He told TeamTALK: \"I really like Carlos Baleba at Brighton and think he could replace Casemiro at Manchester United.",
      "“I like Frenkie de Jong a lot too, but it looks as though he’ll be staying at Barcelona. Manchester United need to be looking for a replacement that has good legs and the engine to run up and down the field. They also need to be very good with the ball too. Baleba can do that.",
      "“Kobbie Mainoo looks to be stepping up his levels and has been performing very well. Alongside him, you need a player who has quality on the ball, who can defend well, and can at times also join in the attack, get into the box and maybe score or create goals for his teammates.”",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport have reported that Joshua Zirkzee could be allowed to leave Man United on loan, with 'negotiations underway' with Juventus.",
      "Zirkzee was linked with a move to Roma earlier in the window but he stayed."

Michael Carrick has been appointed interim manager for the remainder of the season before a new head coach is installed during what is expected to be a very busy few months before the 2026/27 season.",
      "Carrick could become the man in charge for the long-term with the former United midfielder winning his first two games at the helm against Manchester City and Arsenal. Kobbie Mainoo, who barely featured under Ruben Amorim, has been key in those victories and the departure of Amorim could open the door for Marcus Rashford to return.",
      "The 28-year-old is currently thriving on loan at Barcelona with a £30million buy-option included in his temporary switch. Financial problems could prevent the Spanish club from exercising that clause which could benefit United for two reasons.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE!** Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page**",
      "The first of those would be having the chance to bring him back into the fold with a new manager in charge. Alternatively, United could look to sell him permanently with his stock very high.",
      "According to CIES Football Observatories, his current value is €59m (£51m) but United could certainly get more given his experience and goal return. Even if that is the sum United receive for his potential departure, it will arrive as a sizeable financial boost with Rashford a product of their academy.",
      "Therefore, any funds acquired from a transfer for a homegrown player counts as pure profit on the club's financial books which helps greatly when complying with profit and sustainability rules.",
      "United saw this boost arrive last summer through the £40million sale of Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea with recent permanent departures for Scott McTominay and Mason Greenwood also helping.",

In terms of potential candidates, Unai Emery, Roberto De Zerbi and Oliver Glasner have all been concretely linked while there is a chance to appoint someone like Mauricio Pochettino or Carlo Ancelotti after the World Cup.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has just brought up six years at Manchester United",
      "When Manchester United were weighing up a move for Bruno Fernandes in 2019, they asked a former player for a reference. Cristiano Ronaldo was an international teammate of Fernandes at the time, and he vouched for the kind of player and character that United would be getting.",
      "The transfer that would see Fernandes follow the same path from Sporting to Manchester as Ronaldo would take another few months to come to fruition, United eventually making their move to sign him in January 2020. But boy, did it prove to be money well spent.",
      "The fee for Fernandes could reach £67million if all add-ons are met. In reality, he has been a £100million footballer for Manchester United since the moment he walked into the building six years ago yesterday. The club had done their due diligence on Fernandes and knew what they were getting. Not just an elite-level player, but somebody who was desperate to win and wouldn't think twice of calling out any slip in standards.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "It probably summed up his character that Fernandes played 90 minutes two days after signing for the club. That game against Wolves was six years ago tomorrow and a goalless draw was an inauspicious start. It didn't take long for his demonstrative side to appear. Now it is referees who tend to cop for it, but back then it was often his teammates, many of who just weren't on the same wavelength.",
      "The first time I remember being struck by Fernandes's force of personality was in his third appearance for the club. He started on the bench in a Europa League last-16 first-leg tie at Club Brugge, but was already showing that he was a leader. When he came on in the final nine minutes, United improved immediately, and on a couple of occasions, he scolded teammates for not getting the ball to him quickly enough.",
      "It was the kind of reaction that could cause concern in some dressing rooms, but speaking to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer afterwards, it was clear the United manager wanted more of it, rather than less.",
      "\"He’s another conductor and leader and winner,\" said Solskjaer. \"He wants to win, He doesn’t take 99 per cent as good enough and he’s impressed me. That’s something you see when you watch him but you don’t really know about until you have him in your group. He’s been absolutely top class.\"",
      "That is a description every United manager since would agree with. No matter how bad things got, there was always Fernandes to fall back on. He has rarely let his standards drop.",
      "His elevation to the captaincy in the summer of 2023 felt a long time coming. He had been the heartbeat of the team for a while and was already regularly wearing the armband, but now became the on-pitch leader. His ascension hasn't been without its faults and there has been discussion about his suitability for the role, never more so than after a stroppy second-half when losing 7-0 to Liverpool at Anfield in March 2023.",
      "The fact that came before he was confirmed as club captain showed that those inside Old Trafford never lost faith in Fernandes. That on-pitch demeanour might occasionally rile critics, but it comes from a position of being desperate to win. That hasn't happened often enough for Fernandes and United.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speak to anyone who works regularly at Carrington and Old Trafford, and they will highlight the human side of Fernandes' leadership. Forget what happens on the pitch; he is a unifying force off it. Humble enough to treat every member of staff the same way and make sure that they are all happy.",
      "He wasn't alone in being stung by the redundancies implemented since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival in February 2024, and he has always tried to help where he can. When staff perks were slashed ahead of the FA Cup final that May, he offered to pay for them out of his own pocket, a gesture that was rejected.",
      "That he has won just two trophies in his time at Old Trafford is a disappointing return. If anyone in the last six years deserves more, it is Fernandes. He is the only player in this period who would even be in a conversation about whether he would get in to the best and most successful United sides of the past.",
      "The Carabao Cup and FA Cup are a meagre return, and that won't change this season. Even if United get back into the Champions League, there will be no silverware at the end of this campaign. At that point, Fernandes will have a decision to make.",
      "He came close to leaving for Saudi Arabia in the summer and reopened old wounds recently by giving an interview in Portugal in which he said United wanted him to go but lacked the \"courage\" to tell him. He will again make a decision on his future this summer, probably after the World Cup, and an exit can't be ruled out.",
      "He has at least looked happier since Michael Carrick returned. Simplicity has been the hallmark of Carrick's first couple of weeks in charge and he has restored the Premier League's best No. 10 to a role playing as a No. 10. It has got the best out of Fernandes once more.",
      "He has been engaged by Carrick's decision to make training sessions shorter but more intense. He has a strong relationship with the 44-year-old, who was on Solskjaer's staff when he arrived at the club. Carrick believes Fernandes is in a good place at the moment.",
      "If United can secure a return to the Champions League, then perhaps Fernandes feels it is worth staying on. His time in Manchester deserves a fitting coda for what he has delivered. If he does wish to leave, it can't be held against him. Few players have given more for less in red in recent years.",
      "If he does stay, he will surpass Ronaldo as United's most-used player from Portugal. That is a record that would mean a lot for somebody whose affiliation with the club began when he used to watch Ronaldo playing here. His career in Manchester hasn't hit the heights of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, but there is little doubt that, in a difficult period, he has been just as important to Manchester United as his countryman.",

      "A report analysing stadium rights has calculated that Manchester United could bank around £150million with a 10-year agreement to sell the naming rights to a new Old Trafford.",
      "Last year, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London, and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said the project could be completed by 2030/2031.",
      "Estimated costs for a 100,000-seater designed by Foster + Partners have been put at £2billion. There is an acceptance that United would sell the naming rights to raise revenue, and a new report has calculated the club could bank around £150m with a lucrative 10-year agreement.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The Sponsor have compiled a European stadium naming fair market value report, which outlines United could bank around £15m per season, equating to £150m over 10 years.",
      "The report states if United maintain their current profile and increase their global exposure through regular Champions League qualification, the long-term value could exceed that figure.",
      "It's understood the lofty valuation reflects the scale of the Old Trafford redevelopment, projected capacity, modern infrastructure, United’s global fanbase, and the international reach of the Premier League.",
      "Omar Berrada, CEO, admitted that United could sell naming rights when he spoke at the unveiling of plans for a new stadium. \"At this stage, all the options are open,\" said Berrada. \"We're not closing any doors, so we obviously want the stadium to give us additional revenues for us to be able to invest into the team, and I think that's going to help.",
      "\"One of the biggest upsides is to give the best experience to our fans, to be able to accommodate more fans into the stadium. But it is true that the additional revenues will help finance the talent that the fans will see on the pitch.\"",

      "Manchester United's players soak up the applauds after victory over Arsenal(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "Sunday afternoon was always going to be a tough ask for Manchester United and Michael Carrick in particular. Expectations were through the roof after the manner in which the Reds beat Manchester City the weekend prior and there was now belief this United team could turn up to the Emirates Stadium and win.",
      "That was despite Arsenal's ground becoming a fortress this season and the Gunners having not tasted defeat since the beginning of December. So with expectations skyrocketing and an opponent seemingly running away with the Premier League title, what were the chances of Carrick being able to mastermind another sensational victory?",
      "It turned out, those expectations were not to be feared. United were sensational in north London and became only the second team to beat Mikel Arteta's side when they have scored two or more goals. The other team to do that? Well, that was also United led by Carrick in 2021.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "But it was more than just omens and good fortune which saw United defy the odds and beat the leaders on Sunday. MEN Sport has taken a look at seven things United did tactically which proved to be the undoing of Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "The connotations surrounding 'Park the Bus' are often negative due to some of the football we see from clubs who sit back. What we see from Carrick's system is how deep he likes his team to sit and invite pressure.",
      "On several occasions against the Gunners, you could see Amad and Patrick Dorgu drop into the defensive line, creating effectively a back six which Arsenal struggled to break down. United smothered the defence when the home side ventured into their half which made it impossible for the Gunners to play through the lines.",
      "Once United regained possession, Amad and Dorgu burst out of their holding roles to join the attack. Just as it was against City, the Reds were happy to not have the ball.",
      "Before the game, we all knew where United could be outdone - set pieces. The Reds are no strangers to scoring from corners and free kicks this season but it is Arsenal who have managed to perfect the craft.",
      "The Gunners tried a number of routines to unpick the Reds with only one working, (we will get onto that). But one tactical decision Carrick employed to counteract the Arsenal threat, was to give Harry Maguire a free role defensively.",
      "As Maguire is easily United's strongest header of the ball, it made sense to have him focused on watching its flight rather than being bogged down in a tussle with one of Arsenal's strapping centre halves. Speaking of which.",
      "United were caught out by one set piece in the game and were punished but, for the most part, they defended them well. Arsenal's tactic was to pile their aerial threats around Senne Lammens to cause chaos.",
      "When they attempted that, United's rebuttal was to try and do everything in their power to leave Lammens free so he could punch clear. The one time United were not able to stop the opposition, they conceded.",
      "Fortunately for the Reds, they were willing to embrace the battle and the scrappier side of the match. They played Arsenal at their own game and were victorious.",
      "Harry Maguire and Gabriel exchange a war of words during Manchester United's victory over Arsenal",
      "It was not that long ago Jamie Carragher was on Monday Night Football expressing how Casemiro's legs had gone and football had left him. Sunday was yet more proof this long goodbye could be a brilliant swansong for the Brazilian.",
      "On paper, you would think Kobbie Mainoo was most likely to be the box-to-box midfielder in the United system but in reality, it was Casemiro pushing up towards the No.10 position when pressing and then dropping deep when Arsenal were on the front foot.",
      "When United were in possession and on the attack, Casemiro did well to shuttle play out onto the flanks from an advanced role. The Brazilian's passing range is underrated but few would have predicted him being capable of playing such a physically demanding position so well - but he did.",
      "What we saw too often last season was United's centre-forward - usually Rasmus Hojlund - struggling at the top of the pitch trying to perform the pressing duty solo. There are few players in the modern game who can do that for the entirety of a match.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is much more mobile and willing to do the unseen work but even he cannot do it for a full 90 minutes. The Cameroonian shared this responsibility with Amad and this allowed the forward to recharge his batteries so that when the time came, he was ready.",
      "The first goal proved United were more than just a team willing to sit back. When Gabriel received the ball, he was met with a wall of players in front of him.",
      "United were helped by Martin Odegaard not dropping back to support the defender but the initiative of Casemiro and Mainoo to step up and ensure the attack and midfield pressed as one was impressive. By the time Martin Zubimendi played the loose ball straight into Mbeumo's path, there was little more he could have done to avoid that outcome. It was a masterclass in pressing from the Reds.",
      "In the first half, Lammens overshot a long ball upfield towards Mbeumo and the Arsenal defence easily mopped up possession. Instead of lambasting his goalkeeper, the Cameroonian could be seen showing appreciation for the idea and it became clear why.",
      "With the score locked at 2-2, Lammens went long again and this time reached his target of Benjamin Sesko. Other than Matheus Cunha, Sesko played the biggest role in the winner.",
      "His strength and ability to knock the ball down for Fernandes opened the Arsenal defence up. It still required a moment of genius from Cunha but without having the focal point at the top of the pitch, United would not have scored a third.",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates Matheus Cunha's goal with his coaching staff",
      "It was half an hour until midnight when the Manchester United coaches carrying players and staff arrived back at Carrington on Sunday. The ecstasy of their win at the Emirates was beginning to wear off, and another long week was stretching out in front of them.",
      "Michael Carrick and his staff had spent the journey home poring over footage from the game and preparing for the week ahead. Although the players have Monday off, the coaching staff were in, finalising session plans ahead of the weekend's game with Fulham. At 1pm, they strolled over to watch the Under-21s take on Brighton in the Premier League 2 at Carrington.",
      "That is the third academy game since Carrick took over and the third he has attended. The diligence of the 44-year-old and his staff has been noted around the building. Two weeks ago, the mood at Old Trafford was one of despondency. When United were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton, the picture had become clear. There were 17 Premier League games remaining, and that was it. Another season of drift looked set for a long, drawn-out conclusion.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "There was no anger towards Darren Fletcher after that FA Cup exit. The Scot had been a safe pair of hands for a week after the chaos of Ruben Amorim's exit, but it felt like nobody was enjoying themselves any more. Not the players, and definitely not the supporters.",
      "Contrast that with the scenes in the away end at the Emirates on Sunday. Fifteen minutes after the final whistle had blown, there were United fans still there, slowly drifting towards the exit and the North London night. \"It's Carrick, you know...\" could be heard echoing back up into the stands.",
      "Inside the bowels of the stadium, Carrick was just about to speak to Norwegian broadcaster Viaplay when he was pulled away for a meeting with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. It wasn't a job offer yet, but if this carries on, one might not be too far away.",
      "Although you could argue this is just a continuation of his three-game spell as caretaker in November 2021. To the wins against Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta and a draw against Thomas Tuchel, he has added a victory against Pep Guardiola and another success against Arteta. It is shaping up as a seriously impressive coaching CV at the highest level.",
      "United got the Carrick era off to a winning start against Manchester City",
      "Carrick has been unflappable since taking the reins from Fletcher. He is unobtrusive, low-key and has his feet planted so firmly on the floor that it's a surprise it isn't a challenge to lift them when he needs to move. He showed little emotion on the touchline on Sunday, only coming to life in front of the away end at full-time, with his two children among the 3,000 or so away supporters.",
      "It might have felt strange for them to be singing a song in their dad's honour, but then they might have been the only ones not doing so. Carrick has eschewed grand statements since his return. There has been no mention of chats with Sir Alex Ferguson, no real mention of his playing days or past glories. When it was put to him that United could do with a midfielder like Carrick now, he was self-effacing and made fun of himself.",
      "There has been no schmaltz or nostalgia since his return. This hasn't been a renaissance built on someone talking about the United DNA, but on someone delivering the United DNA. Two very different performances have produced the same result.",
      "This is a triumph of substance over style. It's been built on the training ground as much as Carrick is taking the plaudits now, he knows the work of Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion is essential to what they have delivered in the space of two weeks.",
      "For 14 months, Ruben Amorim wanted more time on the training pitches, but when he got what he wished for, he made little use of it. Whether the blame for that lies with Amorim or his experienced backroom team, it's clear that this thrown-together coaching set-up under Carrick is maximising the time they have.",
      "They had three sessions to prepare for Manchester City and delivered a game plan to dominate the derby and play front-foot, counter-attacking football. They then had a full week to come up with a strategy for the trip to Arsenal and delivered an approach that blocked space and offered the hosts nothing from open play.",
      "You can see the players have brought into it. Holland deserves plenty of plaudits as well. He is the most experienced member of the coaching staff and the Mancunian has quickly won the respect of the squad.",
      "The challenge for Carrick and co will change now. They have delivered tactical successes in games in which they were outsiders, but against Fulham on Sunday, United will have the ball and need to dictate the game. That will call for a change of focus this week.",
      "Cunha celebrates his dramatic late winner against Arsenal",
      "Carrick said after the win at the Emirates that there were \"layers\" still to add to the game plan and things to improve. Some of that will be related to breaking down a low block. United's kryptonite recently has been beating teams at home that they should be beating.",
      "If they do that and do it with style, then the clamour for Carrick will only grow. The man himself is refusing to say whether he even wants the job.",
      "\"I am here to do a job,\" he said on Sunday \"When I came here less than two weeks ago, I said we would make every decision for the bigger picture.",
      "\"We are not getting carried away. It is two huge results, but we will keep our feet on the ground. I am enjoying it and I will continue to do what I can.\"",
      "That has been more than good enough so far, but a different kind of test awaits this week.",

After full-time, the Ineos entourage was spotted making its way to the dressing room area within the Emirates. Lammens was asked whether Ratcliffe had popped into the dressing room to speak to the players, and he responded: \"No, I just saw him there when we came out of the dressing room.",

      "\"So today we did that, I think just hardworking, defending together, and then at the end, the subs like Cunha made a difference, and also, the people who come in give our team energy.\"",
      "Lammens claims the ball at the Emirates.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Michael Carrick has overseen wins over Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games since his appointment as head coach, and Lammens put the team's improvement down to going back to basics.",
      "\"To be honest, there's not many special things he did. It's just like sticking to the basics,\" said Lammens. \"Football is basics. If you do the basics well, then the quality of us comes out, and I think we have players with the quality that can make the difference.",
      "\"But if you just do the basics right technically, we're standing right, defending good together. And just [playing] as a team, to be honest, he made it really clear what he wants from us and what he expects from us.",
      "\"And I think today as well, on the pitch sometimes it [the plan] didn't really come out, but if you fight as a team and if you keep believing in it, then you can still get the win.\"",
      "When asked about Carrick's post-match message to the players, Lammens said: \"To be honest, the same things. It wasn't the prettiest game, but those were the most difficult ones. Last week was, I think, in every aspect, a good game. I think we play really well. Today was not always perfect.",
      "\"But like I said before, if you work hard as a team, you can always win. And now it's up to us. We're there, top four, to stay there and to even look above us. Those games against those top teams, you have to win.",
      "\"But now the coming weeks, when they expect more from us, when we are the favourite to win, then you also have to pull through and those are also really important games.\"",
      "United welcome Fulham to Old Trafford next weekend. \"They are sometimes the most difficult ones, the ones you have to win, so to speak,\" he said. \"It's still a long way from the end of the season, so we don't want to look at the end. Like at the table, but yeah, we know we're there [top four].",
      "\"We know we can play against those better teams, so now we have to win against those teams who are maybe a little bit more difficult to play against, playing against low blocks. If you want to be a great team, you have to win against those teams as well.\"",

      "Dorgu scored a screamer against Arsenal.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Manchester United secured a brilliant 3-2 win against Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. Arsenal took the lead in the first half, but Bryan Mbeumo produced a response just eight minutes later.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is enjoying a purple patch and scored an incredible goal to fire United into the lead in the second period. Arsenal equalised through Mikel Merino, but there was another twist in the tale when Matheus Cunha came off the bench to make it 3-2 with a superb shot from the edge of the box.",
      "Michael Carrick has started his interim gig with wins over Manchester City and Arsenal. United have moved to fourth in the table, which means they are now in a promising position to qualify for the Champions League. Here are the moments you might have missed...",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Dorgu shocked himself",
      "Dorgu scored one of the finest goals of the season and didn't know what to do with himself as he celebrated. The 21-year-old was just as stunned as everyone in the crowd at his strike.",
      "There were limbs in the away end as Dorgu made his way over to the corner. Once he'd been mobbed by his teammates, Dorgu shook his head at the TV camera, as if he was thinking, 'how did I do that?'",
      "The Dane has gone from strength to strength over the last few weeks and his confidence is flowing. He had the audacity to take a swing from the edge of the box, and the execution was perfect. Arsenal goalkeeper Raya had no chance as the ball kissed the crossbar on its way into the net.",
      "Carrick made a bold decision to start Dorgu in the Manchester derby and he vindicated that selection by scoring. Dorgu would have felt 10ft tall in training this week, and he probably wouldn't have attempted the shot without that belief.",
      "The importance of corners",
      "Before facing United, Arsenal had scored 24 goals from set pieces in all competitions this season - the most by any team in Europe's top five leagues. They have earned a reputation as being deadly from set-plays during Arteta's tenure, and it was clear that United had been prepared for that threat.",
      "Casemiro cleared the first Arsenal corner of the game, winning the header amongst a scrum of bodies, and Maguire reacted by enthusiastically applauding him as if he'd scored a goal.",
      "Every corner felt like an event, and there was a sense of anticaption around the ground when United conceded a set-play. The players fed off that energy, and Dalot whipped up his teammates as United prepared for Arsenal's second corner of the match, which was successfully cleared.",
      "Carrick prepared his side in training to deal with set-pieces. United conceded from two corners at the Emirates in December 2024, and work had been done to ensure they would not suffer the same fate.",
      "However, it's still difficult to stop Arsenal from corners, even when you prepare to face their threat. They piled bodies into the box, and Senne Lammens was crowded when Merino scored to make it 2-2.",
      "Casemiro appreciation",
      "Casemiro turned to the bench and first pumped when Mbeumo equalised in the 34th minute. United celebrated in the corner, and Casemiro briefly considered saving his legs before deciding to join in.",
      "It was announced earlier in the week that he will leave United upon the expiry of his contract. The Brazilian is hugely popular with matchgoers and was serenaded by the away section.",
      "United are set to sign a replacement for Casemiro in the summer transfer window, and it will be a good sign if his successor becomes half as popular with fans.",
      "Mbeumo's trademark",
      "Mbeumo scored his ninth goal of the season to fire United back into the game, and he used the same celebration as he did against Liverpool at Anfield, outstretching his arms.",
      "He used the same celebration when he scored against Tottenham in November, and it feels like it's becoming Mbeumo's trademark to wheel it out when he scores against 'big' clubs.",
      "It must be irritating for opposition fans to see Mbeumo celebrating in front of them like that. The 26-year-old has been a brilliant signing and possesses the kind of confidence that you need to represent United.",
      "Carrick was composed",
      "Luke Shaw received tactical instructions from Carrick while United celebrated their equaliser. Carrick moved his hands while he was locked in conversation, and he appeared to ask to move the ball quicker.",
      "Some managers may have got carried away in the euphoria of the goal on the touchline, but Carrick remained composed and used the time to pass on instructions after spotting something that could be improved.",
      "Remarkably, Carrick did not even show emotion when Cunha scored to make it 3-2. Instead, he began a dialogue with his backroom staff. There was finally a release of emotion from the 44-year-old at full-time.",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates United's win at the Emirates",
      "Michael Carrick told his Manchester United players to keep their feet on the ground and stay humble after they backed up a derby day win by beating Premier League leaders Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, with Matheus Cunha's late winner securing a stunning victory.",
      "United have beaten the Premier League's top two in Carrick's first two games in charge and now sit fourth with 15 games of the season to go. That puts Champions League qualification well within their grasp, but the 44-year-old is refusing to get carried away.",
      "Carrick has had an immediate impact since replacing Ruben Amorim, and these wins have sent out a statement about their intentions this season after a disappointing run of results in December, but one of the former United midfielder's strengths has been a calm demeanour, and he isn't about to misplace that now.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Although the away end revelled in a victory that hurt Arsenal's title chances, Carrick was focusing on the impact he could have within the club, rather than the statement it can send out to the rest of the league, and he is determined to make sure his players do not get carried away.",
      "\"I think it's more about the feeling that gives us as a group,\" he said. \"And the players and certainly the supporters, you know? That's my concern, how that can bring us together and lift us in a real positive manner.",
      "\"I'm not getting carried away. We've got some bigger games coming up, because every next game's the bigger game. So we're not getting carried away, we've got really important things coming up that we need to kind of keep improving with.",
      "\"Two massive games. There's a lot of emotion and a lot of energy and a lot of confidence that you can take from that, but be humble and understand how we've got these results, that's really important moving forward.\"",
      "United fans were chanting 'we're gonna win the league' as they left the Emirates but Carrick didn't flinch when told that in his post-match press conference, instead returning to a theme of focusing on Fulham next week rather than getting sucked into looking at the bigger picture.",
      "\"I know from our perspective it's just moving forward to the next game,\" he said. \"It's been less than two weeks that we've been together, so it's just keep getting good habits really, and good routines. The boys have been fantastic with that.",
      "\"I don't think we can look too far ahead. We certainly won't be anyway. We'll finish where we finish by the results we get. I know that's kind of obvious, but looking too far ahead can come back and bite you really so we've taken this week by week and game by game.",
      "\"We'll certainly continue to do that, but we've got to ride it. You've got to use the emotion, you've got to use the energy, you've got to use the confidence, but be humble enough to understand how we could just achieve these two big results and it doesn't just come easy. So we need to continue that and bottle it and use it again.\"",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "According to reports, Real Madrid ‘want’ Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and it’s claimed that he could replace Jude Bellingham.",
      "Fernandes has been heavily linked with a possible exit from Man Utd in recent months and it remains to be seen whether he will remain at Old Trafford beyond this season.",
      "United‘s captain has comfortably been their most consistent performer over the past few years and he is arguably their sole world-class player, but it seems that he is not sufficiently appreciated by INEOS.",
      "This is because the Red Devils hierarchy reportedly looked to offload Fernandes in the summer amid interest from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal to raise funds for their rebuild, though he eventually decided to remain at Old Trafford for at least one more year.",

      "He could still leave Man Utd as a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Real Madrid president Florentino Perez ‘wants’ him in the ‘coup of the summer’.",
      "It is noted that this deal ‘would facilitate’ an ‘exit’ for Bellingham, who has reportedly been put up for sale due to the England international’s alleged attitude issues.",

      "The report adds:",
      "‘At 31 years old, his transfer could be completed for a very competitive fee, ranging between 40 and 50 million euros. With his contract with Manchester United entering its final stages next summer, the price becomes extremely affordable for Real Madrid’s finances.",
      "‘The arrival of the Portuguese international would allow Florentino Pérez to execute a bold financial move that would drastically change the dressing room dynamic. It is speculated that his signing would facilitate a potential sale of Jude Bellingham, generating astronomical revenue for the club in the summer transfer window.’",

      "Here, thanks to football analysis experts Gradient Sports, we present the best shotstoppers in the Premier League.",
      "Across a vast range of metrics, Gradient grades every player out of 100, measuring execution and outcome to offer the most insightful and accurate view of individual performance.",
      "This is especially useful when it comes to judging keepers, rather than assessing them on clean sheets or simple shots-saved percentage.",
      "So, according to the grades, here are the Premier League stoppers (who have started a minimum of five matches) ranked for their shot-stopping prowess…",
      "The Argentina keeper has had a somewhat erratic season so far but Martinez has still saved 75% of the shots on target he has faced – better than any other Premier League regular.",
      "Dubravka was an inspired summer signing and without him, Burnley would be further adrift. The 37-year-old has been the busiest keeper, facing 32 shots on target more than anyone else.",
      "Much to the disgust of James Trafford, Pep Guardiola changed tack completely and brought in a big guy to guard his goal. Donnarumma has the lowest saveable goals conceded with 15.8%.",
      "The giant Georgian just scrapes in having played five games when Alisson was injured and Liverpool were caving in after a flying start. Apparently, half of the 10 goals Mamardashvili conceded were saveable, but he performed above expectation on a third of the shots he saved.",
      "Areola has come under criticism having initially been dropped to the bench at the start of the season but there are signs he is starting to recover some reliability during the Hammers’ recent upturn in form. Which won’t be a coincidence.",
      "Dispatched back to the bench recently, which seems harsh, according to the numbers. Maybe Spurs’ bench is comfier.",
      "Raya has faced 52 shots on target, at least a dozen fewer than any other regular No.1, considerably fewer than any other keeper, but the fact the Spaniard is fifth for shots saved above expectation indicates he has been a reliable presence when called upon.",
      "A very mixed season for Sels after sharing the Golden Glove last term. Sean Dyche toyed with replacing the Belgian but Big John blew it.",
      "You can’t blame Vicario for looking unsettled behind that Spurs side but he has been caught up in the chaos too often, even if the stats suggest he remains one the Premier League’s better shotstoppers.",
      "The numbers suggest Pickford has been something of a contradiction. He has made the third-highest number of big saves and is fifth for shots on target saved, but he has conceded the second-highest number of saveable goals (14). Still England’s No.1.",
      "The Netherlands No.1 continues to catch eyes, with Bayern Munich and Tottenham both credited with an interest in the Seagulls stopper. Scrapes into the Premier League power rankings top 30.",
      "A very middle-of-the-road season so far from Henderson, who needed his best yet if he hoped to dislodge Pickford in the England goal in time for the World Cup. May get plenty of opportunities to impress before then since Palace have sold their captain and best defender.",
      "MORE PREM RANKINGS: Best passers under pressure | Most tackle-proof players",
      "May have felt aggrieved to give up the gloves when Lucas Perri returned but Darlow is rightfully back in the Leeds goal. Not because he’s demonstrably better, rather he’s certainly no worse.",
      "There have been occasions this season when Leno was less than his usual reliable self, evidenced by the fact that no keeper has conceded more saveable goals (16).",
      "Anything less chaotic than Andre Onana was always going to make a huge difference to United and Lammens has been a calming, reliable presence. A top-class keeper? We’ll see…",
      "The Brentford stopper was conceding too many goals that perhaps he shouldn’t at the start of the season while settling into his first job as a No.1, but Kelleher looks more at ease in the role now.",
      "Petrovic, like Bournemouth collectively, began the season well but had a major wobble at the back end of the 2025.",
      "Performed slightly better than Pope but not enough to make Eddie Howe consider a permanent change.",
      "Hasn’t been consistent enough to silence the doubters, and the fact Liam Rosenior admits he is asking Sanchez to do things that may be unfamiliar with suggests Chelsea will be looking for a new keeper in the summer. There’s a good one going free in Italy.",
      "Below Ramsdale for shotstopping here, but many Newcastle fans were happy to see Pope return upon return from injury.",
      "Don’t shoot the messenger, Sunderland fans. We agree, Roefs has been superb.",
      "Alisson is usually a rock-solid presence for Liverpool but the Brazilian, not long ago viewed by many as the world’s best, has struggled to stop the Reds’ rot. Is it time to give Mamardashvili a longer run?",
      "Initially taken out of the firing line because of injury, then dropped after a series of soft goals culminating in the latest-ever Premier League winner.",
      "Dropped, then restored to the Wolves XI, though these numbers would query Rob Edwards’ logic."

      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has made a new ‘transfer decision’ amid interest from European and Saudi Pro League sides.",
      "Fernandes has consistently been Man Utd’s best performer in recent years as he is arguably their sole world-class player.",
      "United‘s captain has carried the broken club on his back during their recent dark times, but it has been widely reported that he could be on borrowed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Last summer, it was reported that Man Utd were looking to cash in on Fernandes to fund their rebuild, so a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal looked likely.",
      "Fernandes eventually decided to remain at Man Utd, but he hinted in a recent interview that he is not completely happy with the board’s treatment of him.",

      "READ: Ballard, Stach to Man Utd: Ten Premier League newbies poised for pillaging",
      "However, a new report from Football Insider journalist Pete O’Rourke claims Fernandes’ latest ‘transfer decision’ is that he has ‘no plans to move to the Saudi Pro League at this stage of his career as he aims to continue playing at the highest level possible’.",
      "“I think he can definitely stay beyond this summer. He’s under contract until 2027, and there’s an option in that deal, as well, to extend it,” O’Rourke told Football Insider.",
      "“If he was to become available, there’s no doubt that there would be clubs interested in him.",
      "“We know that obviously there has been interest from the Saudi Pro League before, but I’m not sure that Fernandes is ready to move there at this stage of his career. He still wants to play at the highest level.“",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham has admitted that he has concerns about Fernandes, even though it would be a “huge loss” if he moved elsewhere in the summer.",
      "“In terms of Bruno [Fernandes] you’re looking at two different things,” Sheringham told Bet MGM.",
      "“You’re looking at him as captain material and whether he’s an identity which is what the club stands for. I don’t think he’s that because he doesn’t lead by example in his manner on the pitch.",
      "“We’ve seen him throw his arms up in the air and all that which I don’t think is a good look and not something a captain should be doing.",
      "“Don’t get me wrong, the way he’s performed on the pitch over the last couple of years, he’s definitely a type of leader but I’m not sure he’s a captain.",
      "“There’s been a lot of speculation about his future. First of all, you don’t want to lose your top players and without a doubt, Bruno has been one of Manchester United’s top performers over the last two-and-a-half years in a team full of players who have been underperforming.",
      "“I don’t listen too much to speculation but, of course, he’d be a huge loss if he did move on at the end of the season.”",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid ‘want’ Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and it’s claimed that he could replace Jude Bellingham.",
      "If you stop Bruno Fernandes, you go a long way towards stopping Man Utd. But the stats prove how hard it is to subdue the Red Devils captain…",
      "Man Utd would need an “astronomical offer” to convince Chelsea to sell Cole Palmer with transfer rumblings “getting louder”, according to reports.",
      "New information has emerged on Bruno Fernandes’ future at Manchester United, including a no-brainer decision and a ‘significant’ demand for a new contract.",
      "Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Man Utd in August gave a false perception of where each club was headed, so I have revisited ten of our conclusions from that game…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes could join Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in the coming months via a ‘historic offer’."

Which is not unreasonable since his agent can point to Isak’s status as British football’s most-expensive player. Which he will have to justify when he’s back from injury.",
      "",
      "8) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City) – £295,000 a week\nThe first of four Manchester City entries in the top 10 and perhaps one of the more surprising names on the list. His agent played a blinder when he moved to City because the striker was only on just north of £33,000 a week at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish (Manchester City/Everton) – £300,000 a week\nIt is no surprise to see Grealish on such an extraordinary salary since it was negotiated when he became English football’s first £100million purchase, before Pep Guardiola had sussed that he didn’t fancy the star after all. Grealish joined Everton on loan, with the Toffees liable for £225,000 a week, making him their highest-paid player by a margin of £100,000 a week, while City top up the rest. So it’s especially sickening for the Merseysiders that he may miss the rest of the season.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – £300,000 a week\nUnited probably wept weekly when similar amounts left their coffers to be deposited into Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford’s accounts but Fernandes is more than worth it to the Red Devils. Without him, things would have been even bleaker.",
      "5) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – £300,000 a week\nSilva is in the final season of his £15.6million-a-year salary at City. The Portugal star reportedly doubled his money when he signed a new contract in 2023.",
      "",
      "4) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – £350,000 a week\nVan Dijk is on almost double the salary he signed for when joining Liverpool in 2018. Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money up to this season, but it is now a matter for debate.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. The Brazilian is earning his coin again but only until the summer when there will be no renewal.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. A £2.6million-a-year pay rise was viewed as more than worth it to keep the Egyptian around – and to spare the cost of replacing him – but half a season later, we’re considerably less sure.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City) – £525,000 a week\nWe’re told that there were months of negotiations before Haaland signed his deal for 10 (TEN) seasons which makes us wonder: where the hell was his agents’ starting point?! It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",

      "An excellent first campaign in charge saw them qualify for the Champions League, but inconsistency has cost them this season, with a 3-0 defeat to Club Brugge on Wednesday ensuring they finished 25th in the group phase of Europe’a elite competition, and will therefore play no further part.",

      "He said: “I hope that the players are aware that tonight is a professional foul. I’ve lost games in my career, I’ve rarely felt that sense of shame, being able to concede six goals in two games. I want it to have consequences on the rest of the season.”",

      "After a tremendously fun Big Midweek of UEFAball it’s back to the bread and butter of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "But don’t worry, it’s still big. Very big. And a lot of that’s down to the fact we’ve got Spurs v Man City to enjoy. There are few more reliable fixtures for some kind of nonsense or other, and Spurs – the 14th best team in England but the fourth best in all of Europe – are currently in the mood for delivering piping hot nonsense at frankly dangerous levels.",
      "Liverpool, too, would quite like to add some of their continental brio to their domestic offerings, while DNA-powered Man United reviver Michael Carrick must now prove he can do it in the non-blockbuster Sunday 2pm slot.",
      "",
      "You know what’s going to happen, don’t you? We know it, you know it, Pep Guardiola knows it. Thomas Frank probably doesn’t know it, but he doesn’t know much of anything these days.",
      "But yes, obviously, Spurs are obviously going to win this game. Rarely if ever has the fundamental paradox of Tottenham-City games applied more than it does here, to wit: the less likely a Tottenham win logically appears to be, the more likely it is to happen.",
      "And right now a Tottenham win in any game – obviously this only applies to any game of proper football in a difficult competition, not tish and fipsy like the Champions League – is a highly illogical outcome.",
      "Spurs have just come through the gentlest imaginable run of fixtures, a January of almost cartoonish ease with which to get themselves back into contention for the European spots, and somehow come out the other side of it in the heat of a proper relegation battle having won not a single one of their last five Premier League games. They’ve lost back-to-back against two teams whose winless Premier League runs extended to double figures before their appointment with the good doctor, and coming minutes away from making that three on the bounce at Burnley.",
      "Meanwhile they’ve been casually winning games in Europe like it’s nothing. In the last three months, Spurs have now won twice as many Champions League games (4) as they have Premier League ones (2).",
      "A team that now, as an apparent point of principle, insists upon conceding at least two stupid and easily preventable goals in every single Premier League match they play has kept more clean sheets in the Champions League than anyone else.",
      "This is Spurs heritage. This is what they do. Spursy has never been purely about the spectacular ability for the disastrous and humiliating; it has always required the ability to occasionally and often entirely inexplicably hit absurd heights to make the pratfalls so much bigger and funnier.",
      "And for many years now, Man City have been a key punching bag along the way in the set-up for whatever nonsense Spurs are building up to. While for the last couple of seasons Spurs have perfected this wonderful new bit of being a clinical force in Europe but worse than ever before domestically, they’ve quite rightly never abandoned the ever-bankable ‘improbable victory over Pep Guardiola’s Man City’ bit.",
      "They’ve won their last two trips to the Etihad 4-0 and 2-0, and also knocked City out of the Carabao last season.",
      "This latest instalment is unfortunately at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where Burnley and Brentford remain the only Premier League teams this season to leave empty-handed, but does come with added banter potential from not just Spurs’ own stupid form but the fact last weekend’s results have got City right back on Arsenal’s coat-tails in the title race.",
      "It’s still a bit early in the season for it to become a true repeat of the great 23/24 final-week showpiece, especially with Spurs so uncomfortably close to the bottom three. But it is nevertheless a game that has either a win-win or lose-lose element to it for Spurs, depending on your outlook.",
      "And it gives us the latest chance to wheel out one of our very favourite stats. Since Wolves returned to the top flight in 2018/19, Spurs have taken 18 points from their 15 Premier League games against them. Over that exact time period, Spurs have 23 points from 15 Premier League games against Man City.",
      "Now we know Wolves were quite good for some of that time, but for a lot of that time City were the most relentless collector of Premier League points Our League has ever known. Yet Spurs hold a 7-6 winning record against them over a time period that includes only the very last not-very-good-actually bits of the Pochettino era and all the awful crud that’s followed. And we’ve not even mentioned the infamous Champions League quarter-final.",
      "We have no idea why it keeps happening as often as it does, but we can only assume it will keep happening for as long as Spurs remain so resolutely, utterly and determinedly Spurs.",
      "",
      "Spurs aren’t the only team using the Champions League to mask their domestic failings, with Liverpool managing to even finish above the all-conquering European night Lilywhites after thrashing Qarabag to finish third in the standings and achieve some level of cathartic release after the loss of the most misleading unbeaten run on record with that late defeat at Bournemouth.",
      "And like Spurs, Liverpool now face a tricky game in which to try and port some of that European feel-good vibe to a misfiring Premier League campaign.",
      "They’re not exactly the same, sure. Liverpool are trying to win an undignified scrap for the Champions League placings and Spurs are trying not to get actually relegated, but the point stands.",
      "Newcastle are Saturday night’s opponents for Arne Slot. The lowliest of the English teams in the Champions League having finished all the way down in a perfectly decent 12th, and it’s fair to say that they used up a bit more gas in battling gamely if in the end not that meaningfully to a 1-1 draw against the holders PSG on Wednesday night.",
      "It was a result that left both of them outside the top eight, and burdens Newcastle with another couple of games in a crucial month as they now try to avoid finishing outside the top five in England.",
      "",
      "Unai Emery may be rueing his decision to start Ollie Watkins in a broadly meaningless final game of the Europa League league phase after Villa’s star striker limped off in the first half with what looked like a hamstring issue.",
      "But things would be a sight worse if they hadn’t managed to tie up a deal to bring Tammy Abraham back to Villa Park. It’s a rather neat marker of Villa’s rise that Abraham’s season at Villa Park in 2018/19 involved scoring 25 goals to get them out of the Championship, and he will have rather different targets for the remainder of this campaign.",
      "Watkins’ injury makes Abraham potentially an even more important signing even more quickly for a team whose sheer lack of alternatives goes some way to explaining why Watkins was being used in such a low-wattage game in the first place.",
      "Abraham will now, we assume, be thrust straight into the action and charged with the small matter of instantly providing the goals to keep Aston Villa’s title challenge going. Best of luck, Tammy.",
      "",
      "The wins over City and Arsenal were extraordinary and thrilling. But the reality is that even at their lowest ebbs United have, under all their various failures of post-Fergie managers, quite often managed to summon up sufficient muscle memory to give the teams that used to be their direct rivals a rare old game.",
      "Even under Amorim they would sometimes take points off your Citys or your Arsenals or the Liverpools of this world.",
      "What United have been less good at, particularly in the Ten Hag and Amorim eras, is reliably sorting out the vast glut of decent mid-table teams that you get in your modern Premier League now.",
      "As such, and as dreary yet contrarian as it feels to say it, what we see from Carrick and his side this weekend against Fulham may well tell us more about his and their long-term prospects than the magnificent and attention-grabbing nonsense we’ve had so far.",
      "",
      "Wrexham’s march through the divisions may not yet be done as they launch an improbable bid for the play-offs in the Championship, the division that was supposed to bring Hollywood FC back to reality.",
      "No escape from reality for Sheffield Wednesday, who remain seven points away even from being able to end the season where everyone else began it.",
      "",
      "The European champions are still operating some way short of their brilliant continent-conquering best this season. Having been forced by Newcastle into once again taking the scenic route to Champions League glory they must now protect their fragile advantage atop Ligue 1 on a trip to face Gary O’Neil’s Strasbourg.",
      "And they’ve been in the business of slapping sides silly since O’Neil PFMed his way onto the Ligue 1 scene. Not sides as good as PSG, admittedly, but this looks a slippery test indeed for a team that had to expend a lot of energy for not a lot of end result at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday night.",
      "",
      "Chelsea’s long reign as the dominant force in English women’s football appears to be over. Last week’s defeat to Arsenal has left them nine points off relentless pace being set at the summit by City.",

      "Juventus have not always been the arbiters of morality but their work in environmental sustainability puts their slow, unconvinced Serie A rivals to shame.",
      "How closely have you been paying attention to the January transfer window? We’ve got 20 players to suss, starting simple but it gets harder…",

      "With all six English teams in this season’s Champions League reaching the knockout stages – and five of the six finishing in the top eight to proceed directly to the last 16 – it now looks certain England will once again receive a bonus spot in next year’s competition.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season are all still involved as we head into the play-offs and last 16. Every other country has by now lost at least one of their teams.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay some price down the line when teams inevitably start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer over their major rivals, all of whom have now started losing teams from their own equations while England power on with a full quota.",
      "With English teams securing five of the eight automatic spots in the last 16 of the Champions League via first, third, fourth, sixth and eighth-place finishes, England have pocketed a huge haul of final-position bonus points to further extend their lead here. Even play-off-bound Newcastle have added plenty more points to the kitty for finishing 12th.",
      "Aston Villa finished second in the Europa League standings for another huge bonus-point boost, with Nottingham Forest safely into the play-offs from 13th. Crystal Palace are in the Conference League play-offs. With all nine teams still standing, England are going to be scooping up plenty more points for a good while yet. It would already be a huge shock if one of those extra Champions League places doesn’t once again come the Premier League’s way.",
      "We only have a year’s worth of data under the current format to go on, but worth noting that third-placed Italy finished with 21.875 last year, which means England are already only about a point away from a total that would have been enough for a top-two finish last time out.",
      "Total points: 188.625\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLast 16: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL)\nPlay-off round: Newcastle (UCL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",
      "",
      "Unlikely to hold off the big leagues currently behind them, but Porto and Braga both finishing in the top six of the Europa League standings with Sporting seventh in the Champions League has thrown a good chunk of bonus points into the pot – and any points Portuguese teams rack up only have to be divided by five.",

      "Chelsea have reportedly put a price tag on Cole Palmer amid speculation that he could move to Man Utd in the summer transfer window.",
      "Since joining Chelsea in a bargain £40m deal from Man City in 2023, Palmer has contributed 41 goals and 19 assists in 82 Premier League appearances.",
      "Those figures have attracted attention of the biggest clubs in world football but Palmer has had a quieter year, missing half their games through injury.",
      "Despite only playing 14 times this season, there are rumours that Man Utd are looking to make a move for the Chelsea superstar in the summer.",
      "There were rumours last week that he is ‘unsettled’ at Stamford Bridge and that Palmer would consider leaving Chelsea for Man City if Pep Guardiola leaves in the summer.",
      "However, a fresh report on Monday indicated that Palmer ‘would be open to a sensational transfer to Manchester United’ in the summer with the Chelsea attacker ‘missing his hometown of Wythenshawe’.",
      "READ: No Man Utd players but two transfer targets in top 10 for passing under pressure",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed on Thursday that Palmer is a ‘key part of the project’ at Stamford Bridge and that he has ‘got zero coming’ out of the Chelsea star’s camp about a potential move.",
      "There has already been talk of a potential offer worth as much as €120m (£104m) but Spanish website Fichajes insists that Chelsea have ‘set his release clause at €200m (£173m), a figure that clearly demonstrates their intention to secure their star player’.",
      "Chelsea ‘are not facing financial difficulties that would force them to sell’ and they believe the €120m mentioned elsewhere ‘falls far short of Palmer’s true value’.",
      "The report adds: ‘To even begin serious negotiations, United will need to offer at least the €200 million Chelsea has set.’",

      "Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman reckons the introduction of Palmer off the bench in Chelsea’s 3-2 win over Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday night “brought Joao Pedro to life” as the Brazilian scored a brace.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live Champions League Debrief podcast, Osman said: “I felt like Chelsea would go to Napoli and win and get that statement result. Napoli are struggling with numbers and injuries but you got the feeling that Chelsea weren’t just there to limp through.",
      "“Tactically they were a little bit poor in the first half but Liam Rosenior made a good change in the second half with Cole Palmer as he was then able to join up with Joao Pedro.",
      "“It brought Joao Pedro to life and allowed him to make runs so Chelsea grew in strength. The longer the game went on, the more you felt like Chelsea would end up winning it.",

      "It turns out Manchester United chiefs are actually pretty good at transfers, and a veto of a Michael Carrick request will be another win…",
      "It has long been the perception about Man Utd that they have been very poor at transfers since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, and this is true to a certain degree.",
      "Man Utd have got a lot wrong in the transfer market, but there has been a turning of the tide since Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his recruitment team took over.",
      "Ratcliffe and co. have been far from perfect regarding other matters (i.e., with his brutal cost-cutting programme), but they have been pretty on the money with transfers.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is their only potential blot on their summer recruitment, while the doubts about the January 2025 signing of Patrick Dorgu have started to evaporate as he has thrived in an advanced role.",
      "And even better work has been done on outgoings: In the summer, Tyrell Malacia was their only ‘bomb squad’ member to stick around, with Man Utd managing to offload Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund on their teams with significant fees secured in all but one of these deals (Sancho is out of contract in the summer and will inevitably leave on a free transfer).",
      "READ: Why big Champions League night containing zero Man United was actually all about Man United",
      "This business enabled Man Utd to invest £230m on signings last summer, and they are well-placed to be in a position to spend even more in this summer’s window as cash will come in via the sales of Rashford and Hojlund, while they could also benefit from Mason Greenwood’s sell-on clause and Champions League qualification.",
      "United’s wage bill will be further boosted by the exit of Casemiro, who is confirmed to be leaving upon the expiry of his contract instead of accepting a pay cut to remain at the club.",
      "And the Red Devils also look to be going this correct route with Harry Maguire, who finds himself in the same boat as Casemiro in terms of contract.",
      "Earlier this week, The Daily Mail reporter Nathan Salt explained why Maguire is ‘increasingly unlikely’ to remain at Man Utd despite Carrick’s admiration of the England international.",
      "“He’s played well in the past two games – winning the man-of-the-match award at Arsenal – but it feels increasingly unlikely,” Salt said.",
      "“United have had ample opportunity to get Maguire on to fresh terms but there appears to be limited willingness at this stage to do so with his contract now around five months from expiry.",
      "“Carrick is a fan of Maguire but senior United figures are keen to see next season’s minutes go to Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, two young players that United believe will be the bedrock of the backline for years to come.”",
      "The Athletic’s Andy Mitten has since added that ‘Maguire’s future will likely boil down to money and the length of the contract being offered’, while he ‘needs to be playing every week and United’s view is that if he’s doing that, the case for a new contract is a much stronger one’.",
      "But the reality is that Maguire is unlikely to retain his current importance for much longer.",
      "Like Carrick, Maguire has benefited from circumstance, returning to fitness and form at a time when Man Utd are on a rare upswing and while Matthijs de Ligt is unavailable.",
      "Maguire has been really good for Man Utd in their last two games, but he is still unlikely to be ahead of De Ligt in the pecking order once Carrick (or his successor) has a fully fit squad, while Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are also there to replace him.",
      "Had Casemiro signed a cut-price extension to remain at Man Utd, his wage would still have been among the highest in the squad and it would have been difficult to justify when he would have been a bit-part player behind Carlos Baleba and/or Elliot Anderson next season.",
      "And with INEOS setting a precedent regarding how they will handle ageing players and their expiring contracts, it should be expected that Maguire follows Casemiro out of the door for a new adventure with his head held high.",
      "This would be the right step for all parties and another move in the right direction for INEOS.",

      "Former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann has urged the Reds to consider a move for the Man Utd defender, with a Bundesliga star among two alternatives.",
      "Man Utd are set to reject any request from Michael Carrick to renew Harry Maguire’s contract as they look to the future, according to reports.",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes should know better than anyone that the idea Arsenal ‘could be the worst team to win the Premier League’ is nonsense.",
      "The dust having settled from his clash with Lisandro Martinez, Scholes has since decided to take on the entire Arsenal fanbase with a pop at the current league leaders and favourites.",
      "“If you’re thinking of picking a team of the season and picking the front four, nobody from the Arsenal team gets in that,” he said, echoing the sentiments of Jamie Carragher.",
      "“That is not normal, that would never happen. The best team in the league would always have at least one, maybe two players [forwards], in the team of the season,” he added.",
      "May we introduce both Scholes and Carragher to Manchester City in the two seasons prior to Erling Haaland’s arrival, when their top-scoring league forwards were a) Raheem Sterling with ten goals, b) Raheem Sterling with 13 goals, and c) not Harry Kane, Mo Salah, Sadio Mane, Heung-min Son or indeed any forward who would get into the team of the season.",
      "Scholes in particular ought to know that Arsenal, 25 points off the lowest Premier League-winning tally ever set by Manchester United in 1997, with 15 games remaining, would not “be the worst team to win the league” whatsoever. They have five PFA Player of the Year candidates; they’re quite good.",
      "These English top-flight champions who only had a single representative in that season’s PFA Team of the Year certainly contradict Scholes and his ilk.",
      "",
      "Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect that Scholes always keeps his 2002/03 PFA Team of the Year place at the forefront of his mind while engaging in that week’s thoughtful, considered punditry with Nicholas Butt and Patrick McGuiness, but it is also funny that he is so central to the most recent counter to his own argument.",
      "Manchester United won the title in 2002/03 but boasted neither the Player of the Year (Thierry Henry), nor Young Player of the Year (Jermaine Jenas), with Manager of the Year Sir Alex Ferguson and Golden Boot winner Ruud van Nistelrooy proving the difference.",
      "But it was Scholes who carried the Team of the Year flag for Manchester United alone as tap-in merchant Van Nistelrooy was overlooked. He will take solace from finally putting his Henry feud to one side.",
      "Runners-up Arsenal had five players – Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole, Robert Pires, Patrick Vieira and Henry – make the XI, while a couple of stars for third-placed Newcastle in Kieron Dyer and Alan Shearer were voted in.",
      "Manchester United had as many players in there as fourth-placed Chelsea (William Gallas), Blackburn (Brad Friedel) down in sixth and even bloody tenth-placed Spurs.",
      "How can Scholes sit there with a straight face and say Arsenal “could be the worst team to win the league” when champions Manchester United let Stephen Carr into a Team of the Year?!",
      "",
      "The roles had been reversed for Arsenal and Manchester United half a decade prior, when the runners-up claimed a 5-1 win over the title winners in the Team of the Year.",
      "Gary Neville, Gary Pallister, David Beckham, Butt and Ryan Giggs all sat alongside one player each from six different clubs, including Arsenal spokesperson Dennis Bergkamp.",
      "It was the iconic Dutchman‘s best individual season by far in terms of goal return, with 16 scored and 11 assisted in the Premier League alone for the Double winners.",
      "Also sneaking into the XI were Nigel Martyn (Leeds), Colin Hendry (Blackburn), Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea), David Batty (Newcastle) and Michael Owen (Liverpool), making Bergkamp the sole non-British inclusion.",
      "",
      "It is safe to assume that woke nonsense kept Eric Cantona out of the 1995/96 Team of the Year. Or perhaps a strikeforce of Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, whose respective 25 and 31-goal seasons almost demanded room be made for them.",
      "Beyond the Frenchman it is difficult to see who else might have made it in for the champions. No-one but Cantona scored more than 11 goals, while he also boasted the most assists with ten. Peter Schmeichel definitely had a shout but was pipped by two things: David James of Liverpool; and the normalisation of his own brilliance.",
      "In the end it was only Gary Neville who made the grade at the end of his first full Premier League season, no thanks to Marco Boogers.",
      "Newcastle had three complete bottlers in there (Rob Lee, David Ginola and Ferdinand). Aston Villa filled two spots with Ugo Ehiogu and Alan Wright despite finishing fourth and not having the best defensive record in the division.",
      "Tony Adams (Arsenal), Steve Stone (Nottingham Forest) and Ruud Gullit (Chelsea) rounded out the selection. That has the makings of quite the five-a-side team.",
      "",
      "In an era when one club dominating the Team of the Year was rare, it was commonplace for seven of eight to have representation in the final XI.",
      "Manchester United (Pallister and Mark Hughes) managed to sneak two players into the final First Division selection ever despite finishing as runners-up, with eighth-placed Forest (Des Walker and Stuart Pearce) matching them.",
      "But clubs finishing anywhere from fifth (Manchester City, Tony Coton) and sixth (Liverpool, Ray Houghton) to 14th, 15th and 16th found their way in back in 1992.",
      "Chelsea had Andy Townsend. Spurs had Gary Lineker. Southampton had Alan Shearer. We would all listen to that podcast. And of course Leeds had Gary McAllister, cited as the key inspiration behind their title win.",
      "",
      "It is likely that Liverpool suffered for the European exploits of Nottingham Forest, with Ray Clemence especially unfortunate to miss out to Peter Shilton in the 1978/79 PFA Team of the Year.",
      "Clemence kept 28 clean sheets and conceded an absurd 16 goals in 42 First Division games. Shilton lifted the literal European Cup. Clemence was never out-jumped by Diego Maradona. Swings and roundabouts.",
      "Phil Neal, Graeme Souness and Terry McDermott could make particularly strong cases against their omissions but in the end it was FWA Footballer of the Year Kenny Dalglish who flew the flag alone for Liverpool.",
      "West Brom matched their third-placed finish with three representatives, including two of the Three Degrees in Cyrille Regis and Laurie Cunningham.",
      "",
      "‘I was the manager, the man in charge, who would sink or swim on the success or failure of the players hired. The chairman wouldn’t pay with his job if I failed in mine and it wasn’t his personal money we were spending anyway.",
      "‘Sam Longson was on holiday when I did the deal for what was then regarded as a massive fee of £175,000. I told him nothing about it until I sent a telegram. I can’t recall the exact wording, but it went something like this: ‘Just bought you another great player, Colin Todd. We’re almost bankrupt. Love Brian.’",
      "The inimitable Clough knew he had ‘just signed the best young defender in England, who was about to turn Derby into the best team in the country’.",
      "Todd won the title together with Clough in 1972 before reigning again as Player of the Year – and Team of the Year member – under Dave Mackay three years later.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists it “would take a crazy amount of money” for Man Utd to buy Cole Palmer from Chelsea in the summer transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils have been linked with a move for the Chelsea attacker over the last week with reports claiming that he is ‘unsettled’ at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Palmer, who has been limited to 14 appearances in all competitions this season because of injury, ‘would be open to a sensational transfer’ to Man Utd in the summer, as he ‘misses his hometown of Wythenshawe’ and was a Red Devils fan as a boy.",
      "Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior described Palmer potentially moving to Man Utd as “unrealistic” and insisted that the England international is “very happy” in west London.",
      "And now Romano has admitted that “things can happen” but insisted that there is “zero coming” from Palmer’s camp over a move to Man Utd.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Chelsea did their job in the Champions League. And don’t forget the message coming from Liam Rosenior after the match. In England, in the last couple of weeks, we’ve had many rumours about Cole Palmer being unsettled or having problems at Chelsea, he wants to play for Manchester United.",
      "READ: Man Utd, Liverpool stars among five big names who need a move before the deadline",
      "“Before the game, Rosenior said Palmer is happy and untouchable but after the game he said, by himself, that Cole Palmer in the dressing room was looking like a very happy guy. The message coming from Chelsea is very clear: Cole Palmer is considered an absolutely key part of the project.",
      "“There’s absolutely nothing ongoing in terms of contracts and problems. But things can happen. As of today, they have got zero coming from Cole Palmer’s camp.",
      "“If someday they decided to part ways, it would take a crazy amount of money – but really crazy.”",
      "Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy could see Palmer moving to Man Utd as the Red Devils will probably need a successor to Bruno Fernandes in the near future.",
      "When asked if Chelsea need to qualify for the Champions League to keep Palmer, Murphy told BestBettingSites.co.uk: “No, because they’ve got him under a long-term contract, so they can keep him either way. But qualifying for the Champions League would make it much easier to quieten the noise around other clubs trying to get him.",
      "“It would definitely help. This season hasn’t been as fruitful as he’d like because of injuries and getting back to form. He’s had this nagging thigh or groin problem, whatever it is. But he’s a special player.",
      "READ: No Man Utd players but two transfer targets in top 10 for passing under pressure",
      "“The way football works, if you’re a player of that quality and you’ve always had a love for a particular club, it’s not a huge stretch to imagine things lining up.",
      "“Especially if United were to go on a run. A lot of Chelsea fans think the club is more of a business than a football project, so could I see Cole Palmer leaving for Manchester United? Yes, I could.",
      "“I wouldn’t want it to happen, but I could see it. Bruno Fernandes needs a successor. He’ll get through the groin problem. He’ll be fine.”",
      "However, former Man Utd midfielder Gordon Strachan insists that Palmer should stay tat Chelsea and attempt to win a major trophy there.",
      "Strachan told Poker Scout: “Cole Palmer could go to most clubs if he leaves Chelsea this summer. I’d personally like to see him stay at Stamford Bridge and win one of the big major trophies, but if he gets an offer from the likes of Bayern Munich and he wants to move, then Chelsea are just going to have to accept it.",
      "“Players like Palmer sometimes want to move on and experience something else. Maybe he’s bored or unhappy with the system at Chelsea – he hasn’t seemed himself this season.",
      "“I’d however like to see him stay there because they’ve put a lot of faith in him when other clubs didn’t. There comes a point where he should ask himself: ‘Chelsea have helped me a lot, can I help them before I potentially leave and go somewhere else?'”",
      "READ NEXT: Champions League prize money table calculated with four clubs cracking £80m after first phase",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have ‘made a huge offer’ as they have emerged as the ‘favourites’ to sign Real Madrid star Eduardo Camavinga.",
      "One of Cole Palmer’s teammates at Chelsea has reportedly made him feel “unsettled” and the Manchester United target has been “offered to everyone”.",
      "Aston Villa head coach Unai Emery has revealed an update on Liverpool loanee Harvey Elliott and has responded to reports linking him with Real Madrid.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United are set to miss out on ex-Wolves star Ruben Neves, who had been deemed a ‘priority’ target.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a ‘decision’ on whether to sign Chelsea star Cole Palmer, who has a ‘release clause’ in his contract.",
      "Chelsea have reportedly put a price tag on Cole Palmer amid speculation that he could move to Man Utd in the summer transfer window."

      "According to reports, the door has opened for Manchester United to sign talented winger Iliman Ndiaye from Everton in a potential ‘record’ transfer.",
      "Man Utd are yet to make a signing in this transfer window as it is likely the case that they are saving their money to invest heavily in the summer.",
      "Michael Carrick‘s side will focus on overhauling their midfield as Bruno Fernandes and/or Manuel Ugarte could follow Casemiro in leaving, but they could also look to strengthen in other positions.",
      "This includes forward areas, with a recent report claiming Man Utd are plotting a move for Everton standout Ndiaye.",
      "The 25-year-old has massively surpassed expectations at Everton over the past 18 months, grabbing 17 goal involvements in his 56 appearances in all competitions.",
      "READ: Man Utd, Liverpool stars among five big names who need a move before the deadline",
      "Now, according to a report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk, a deal for Ndiaye is ‘on’ as he has been deemed an ‘attainable’ target.",
      "Ndiaye is said to be preferred over AC Milan’s Rafael Leao, but Everton reportedly wants a potential ‘record’ sale worth around £75m.",
      "Jones explained: “Man United are being linked to Rafael Leao again, but I am told that is not one they really have on the radar at the moment.",
      "“His talent is undoubted but there is a risk factor attached, and from recent conversations I’ve had, I get the impression he is not really in that top list that they are starting to put together.",
      "“The left side of the team is definitely something they are looking at. They would like a left back and another attacker, as we have been reporting recently.",
      "“The reason Ndiaye is such a good target is that he is attainable and also has transferable traits from Everton that are already proven within the Premier League.",
      "“That domestic experience cannot be discounted when we look at how Man Utd build outwards from here. Leao is a sexy name and would make a good headline, but someone like Ndiaye is probably a better fit for the project.”",
      "Regarding their midfield, a report from Football Insider claims Man Utd are ‘to spend £100m’ on a replacement for Casemiro, with football finance expert Stefan Borson providing more information on the finances.",
      "“If you’re talking about signing a top midfield player to sit in Manchester United’s midfield, the range of cost is clearly £80-100m, which has with it £20m of amortisation cost per annum,” Borson told Football Insider.",
      "“It’s one step forward cutting yourself off from a very high cost of an older player, but Casemiro has to be replaced and there’s lots of risk with all of these acquisitions.",
      "“Manchester United in particular have recruited in midfield many players where it hasn’t worked, and then you’re stuck with a very high cost that’s very hard to move. I mean, Ugarte is a perfect example. Again, you just have to see how it pans out.”",
      "Manchester United are eyeing a summer left winger, with Rafael Leao, Tyrique George, and Iliman Ndiaye reportedly on their shortlist.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro has “almost certainly” decided where he will move when his contract expires this summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are ready to add Everton attacker Iliman Ndiaye to their list of transfer targets ahead of the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are expected to place Everton’s dazzling winger Iliman Ndiaye on their transfer shortlist for the summer.",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed when Casemiro’s exit from Manchester United was decided, while David Ornstein believes he has an advantage over other managers.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly drawn up a shorlist of four midfielders who could replace Casemiro in the summer after the Brazilian announced his imminent exit."

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."

      "Michael Carrick will go for a third consecutive win as Man Utd head coach against Fulham on Super Sunday and goalkeeper Senne Lammens has a big role to play; The Radar column also reveals the passing stats that set Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa apart",
      "Saturday 31 January 2026 21:43, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Lammens brings calm to Man Utd💪 Konsa's passing under pressure🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United beat Arsenal last Sunday with the help of two moments of brilliance from Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu. But their goalkeeper played his part too, albeit in typically understated style. Senne Lammens continues to impress.",
      "The 23-year-old, an £18m signing from Royal Antwerp, has looked good value ever since his debut in October, when he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford, instantly bringing a level of calm Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana lacked.",
      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",

      "Arne Slot has talked about Liverpool's issues against low blocks and they are not the only Premier League side struggling to break down deep-lying opponents; Between the Lines digs into the data to reveal the teams with the best and worst numbers",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Friday 30 January 2026 10:27, UK",
      "Low blocks are a hot topic in the Premier League.",
      "The term refers to a defending team sitting deep in a compact shape to protect their goal and restrict space in central areas, making it difficult for their opponent to create chances.",
      "Which teams come up against low blocks most frequently? And which teams are most and least effective when it comes to playing against them? Between the Lines digs into the numbers.",
      "Arne Slot was told to stop talking about low blocks by Steven Gerrard after Liverpool's Champions League win over Marseille.",
      "The data supports Slot's comments on low blocks.",
      "This season, Liverpool have a higher percentage of build-up phases of play against compact defences than any team in the Premier League, at 26 per cent.",
      "Arsenal are second, at 24 per cent, with Nottingham Forest and Newcastle third and fourth, on 23 and 22 per cent respectively.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Leeds have the lowest percentage of build-up phases against low blocks this season, at 14 per cent, just below Crystal Palace and Burnley at 15 per cent.",
      "Slot has bemoaned facing more low blocks than last season this term as Liverpool's opponents set up to frustrate them.",
      "Again, the data backs him up.",
      "Only Everton have experienced a bigger increase to the percentage of build-up phases against deep opposition this season.",
      "While Liverpool and Everton are facing low blocks more frequently, Manchester City are facing them less frequently.",
      "In fact, Pep Guardiola's side have the biggest negative differential among ever-present Premier League clubs this term, their percentage dropping from the highest in the Premier League last season at 27 per cent, to 21 per cent this term, putting them fifth.",
      "The dip reflects changes to the way they are attacking, as well as how teams are defending against them, with Guardiola having put more emphasis on directness this season.",
      "Aston Villa rank as by far the most effective team against low blocks.",
      "Helped by a succession of strikes from outside the box this season, Unai Emery's side have racked up 19 goals from phases of play against deep defences since the start of last term.",
      "It is three more than any other side has managed in the same timeframe, with Manchester City next on 16. Newcastle have also enjoyed some success, scoring 15 goals against low blocks.",
      "Excluding relegated and promoted sides, Brentford have scored the fewest goals against low blocks, with three.",
      "Aston Villa and Brentford also come out top and bottom respectively when factoring the number of times Premier League teams have come up against opponents in a low block.",
      "For context, Aston Villa's 19 goals since the start of last season have come from 1,717 build-up phases against compact defences, giving them an average considerably higher than any other Premier League side at 1.11 goals per 100 phases.",
      "Manchester City's 16 goals, meanwhile, have come from a far higher number of build-up phases against low blocks, at 2,676, giving them a much lower average of 0.60 per 100 phases.",
      "While Newcastle and Manchester United rank closest to Newcastle for goals per 100 build-up phases against deep defences, Liverpool and Arsenal sit closer to Brentford.",
      "Arsenal's issues become even clearer when looking at shot numbers.",
      "While Liverpool do at least get a decent amount of shots off against low blocks, their average of 9.9 per 100 phases of play putting them fourth among ever-present Premier League sides in the last two seasons, Mikel Arteta's side average the second-fewest, at just 7.8 shots per 100 phases of play.",
      "The data also suggests Chelsea struggle against low blocks, averaging only fractionally more shots than Arsenal at 8.1.",
      "Arsenal's lack of threat against low blocks was most recently apparent during Sunday's 3-2 loss to Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium, when the Gunners struggled to open up their opponent's defensive structure in open play.",
      "In contrast to Arsenal, Manchester United have averaged considerably more shots against low blocks than any other Premier League side since the start of last season, at 12.9 per 100 phases of play, showing they fare better at breaking them down.",
      "Why are so many Premier League strikers struggling this season? Last week's edition looked at the declining number of goals being scored by forwards and the reasons behind the trend.",

      "Cole Palmer is contracted at Chelsea until 2033; recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United; Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea",
      "Wednesday 28 January 2026 07:38, UK",
      "Chelsea consider Cole Palmer \"untouchable\" amid links with Manchester United.",
      "Palmer is contracted until 2033 and is seen as a key player in the club's future.",
      "Recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United in order to return to the north west, but Chelsea believe the player is happy at Stamford Bridge - as does head coach Liam Rosenior.",
      "Asked if Palmer is 'untouchable' and happy at the club, Rosenior replied: \"Yes and yes. It's simple.",
      "\"Cole's an incredible player like [Moises Caicedo] sitting next to me and many players in the group.",
      "\"I'm not surprised at the timing [of the rumours]. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there's people are [looking to] unsettle. It's not true. Cole's here, he's very happy and I can't wait to see him on the pitch.",
      "\"There's no reason for an assurance [from Chelsea's directors]. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere, there's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation, that's where I'm at.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. We've had numerous conversations with him on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him - because he loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player.",
      "\"You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth, there's not point having any discussion about it.\"",
      "Palmer's season has been hampered by injuries to his groin, toe and, most recently, thigh which caused him to miss Sunday's victory at Crystal Palace, but he returned to training on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League fixture at Napoli.",
      "The 23-year-old has not provided an assist in the Premier League this season, scoring four goals in 12 league appearances, having netted 15 in 46 last term and providing 11 assists.",
      "Palmer joined Chelsea from Manchester City in a £40m deal in 2023, and has scored 41 goals and made 20 assists across his 81 league appearances for the Blues.",
      "Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea despite interest from multiple teams.",
      "Talks are ongoing between Rennes and Chelsea about a deal for the 20-year-old French centre back.",
      "Ideally, Rennes want to keep him until the summer and it is proving to be a difficult deal to complete, especially in January.",
      "Clubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool are reported to be interested in buying the player in the summer.",
      "Rennes want €65m (£56m) but Chelsea have so far been reluctant to match the asking price.",
      "Chelsea have recalled centre back Aaron Anselmino from his loan at Borussia Dortrmund but it is not certain he will stay at Chelsea for the rest of the season.",
      "Chelsea had five centre backs in their squad for their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday and they have AFCON winner Mamadou Sarr on loan at sister club Strasbourg. Two other Chelsea centre backs are out injured at the moment - Levi Colwill and Tosin Adarabioyo.",
      "Other January centre back target options for Chelsea include Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi and Como's Jacobo Ramon.",
      "Senesi, 28, is out of contract this summer but Bournemouth would be extremely reluctant to let him leave this month. He is set to have the option of moving to some of the biggest clubs in Europe in the summer.",
      "Jacquet is highly rated by new Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior and played for Rennes when they beat Rosenior's Strasbourg side 4-1 in Ligue 1 in November.",
      "Axel Disasi is expected to leave Chelsea before the January transfer window closes.",
      "Multiple clubs are interested in England, Germany, France and Italy, with West Ham an option. Fiorentina are considering a move for Disasi, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Disasi had previously been surplus to requirements under Enzo Maresca, but has been training with the first team since the arrival of Liam Rosenior.",
      "Raheem Sterling and Chelsea are close to finding a solution in the next few days which will end the long-drawn-out stand-off between club and player.",
      "Sterling has not played for Chelsea since May 2024 even though he has remained one of the club's best-paid players, earning a reported £325,000 a week.",
      "He spent last season on loan at Arsenal but he has been training away from the first-team squad since last summer when a move away could not be agreed during the window.",
      "Chelsea are now in talks with Sterling and his representatives and a solution is expected to be found before the window closes on Monday evening.",
      "He has 18 months left on a contract which could cost Chelsea £25 million if he was to stay until it runs out in the summer of 2027.",
      "Sterling does not want another loan deal so either a permanent deal will have to be arranged in the next few days or a compromise agreement reached whereby he would become a free agent.",
      "Either way, it is expected he will no longer be a Chelsea player after Monday - although he would be well within his rights to stay until his contract runs out.",
      "Sterling signed a five-year deal when Chelsea signed him from Manchester City in a £50 million deal in the summer of 2022.",
      "The deal was done just two months after Chelsea had been bought by new American owners and during a window when co-owner Todd Boehly was acting as the club's interim sporting director.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is expected to remain at Chelsea in this window.",
      "Chelsea's second-choice goalkeeper has been the subject of interest this month from clubs in England, Germany and Turkey, who are keen to offer him more regular football, but Chelsea are reluctant to let the Dane leave before next Monday's deadline.",
      "Chelsea signed Jorgensen from Villarreal for £20.7m in July 2024.",
      "Jorgensen played 24 times for Chelsea last season, predominantly in cup competitions, and was key to their Conference League success, but has been limited to just eight appearances this season.",
      "Jorgensen suffered an injury against Pafos last week and was not pictured at Chelsea training on Tuesday morning.",

      "Gary Neville is \"blown away\" by Manchester United's transformation under the management of Michael Carrick.",
      "United backed up a derby win over Manchester City with a 3-2 success at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday in Carrick's second game in charge.",
      "Those results have transformed the mood following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Neville is confident United - who are up to fourth in the table - will finish in the Champions League qualifying spots.",
      "\"There are a number of things that have changed, the intensity, the compactness, the aggression of the defending, their willingness to get behind the ball together and be difficult to beat and dig in when you're in difficult moments of the game. And there was more of that [at Arsenal] than there was against City.",
      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",
      "\"The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attacking of speed, the counter-attack. It feels right.",
      "\"And I think one thing that this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that is the way Manchester United have to play, because it's just felt right watching them.",
      "\"Now that might not lead to Champions League football this season, it might be that they go and get beat by Fulham next week. Who knows what's going to happen? I don't think they will by the way, I think they'll finish in the Champions League [qualification places] now.",
      "\"But that's why a number of players that commentate on Manchester United have been so angry in this last five or six weeks, because of the likes of Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Bournemouth, Burnley and Leeds, six teams that have been really struggling apart from Leeds maybe, and only five points were picked up in those games again out of the 18.",
      "\"And in a lot of those games where Manchester United had opportunities to go into the top four. We're like, 'go on', and they didn't, and now they've done it because I genuinely believe there is a feeling that they are better than what they've shown.",
      "\"And they've proved it in these last two games, they have really proved that they can get compact, they can stay together, be aggressive in their shape, can spring out of that shape and play good football and counter-attack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "\"It's been thrilling to watch these last two matches, it really has, and it's a remarkable turnaround.\"",

      "Roy Keane says Man Utd have their \"swagger\" back following wins against Arsenal and Man City but does not believe Michael Carrick is the right man for the job; Keane says Old Trafford needs a head coach who is \"bigger and better\" than Carrick, despite his early success in the role",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 07:19, UK",
      "Roy Keane says Manchester United have their \"swagger\" back following a 3-2 win against Arsenal but does not agree that Michael Carrick is the right man for the job at Old Trafford.",
      "Matheus Cunha scored a dramatic winner at the Emirates Stadium for United against the Premier League leaders, making it two wins from two for Carrick to kickstart his reign.",
      "Carrick has now overseen victories against Manchester City and Arsenal since he was confirmed as the head coach until the end of the season, but Keane does not agree that he should be a candidate for the role in the long term.",
      "\"If United win every game until the end of the season, I still wouldn't be giving him the job. I still wouldn't be convinced he's the man for the job. Absolutely not.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager. The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.",
      "\"Are we going to sit here and believe Michael Carrick can get United winning league titles? It's not enough for me. I don't believe he is the man to get them winning league titles.\"",
      "On the performance against Arsenal, Keane added: \"Considering where they are and where they have been, they had a bit of swagger and calmness to their play.",
      "\"Two brilliant strikes and players off the bench had a big influence. You see the United fans in the corner, it's a bit like the old days.",
      "\"Carrick's done really well. Two brilliant performances. They showed real quality.\"",
      "Gary Neville also believes that Carrick is not the long-term solution for Man United and believes they should target more experienced managers like Thomas Tuchel or Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "\"They played properly, with intensity. I think it's right that Carrick keeps the job until the end of the season and then hands the baton over to a Tuchel or an Ancelotti, someone of that world-class ilk.\"",
      "Despite the strong form in the early days of his reign since being appointed as Ruben Amorim's successor, albeit only until the end of the season, Carrick is not getting carried away.",
      "\"We couldn't expect to come here and suddenly dominate the whole game and the ball. We're just starting off, really. It's a great starting point, but we need to put more layers on top, and we'll try to do that in the coming weeks.",
      "\"I give a lot of credit to the staff and the players for how much they've invested and how much they've bought into it.",
      "\"It's alright trying to help them and say certain things, but they've got to live it - and you've seen that with the boys coming off the bench and making a difference.",
      "\"It's a real collective feeling. It's great when it comes together and everyone's in it, and we can celebrate with the fans at the end. That's important and it's a big moment.\"",
