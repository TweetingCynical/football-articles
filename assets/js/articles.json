      "Manchester United would be willing to take a £20million hit on Andre Onana to facilitate a move away. The Cameroonian goalkeeper sees his future up in the air following a tricky few campaigns at Old Trafford.",
      "He has been blighted by inconsistency since his £50m move from Italian giants Inter Milan. And it appears that United won’t be able to fetch anywhere near that fee should they choose to move Onana on permanently.",
      "Red Devils chiefs would be willing to sell him for around £30m in an effort to get him off the wage bill. And while that represents a significant loss for the club, there remains a major issue.",
      "Monaco and Saudi clubs have shown tentative interest but neither would be able to match United’s demands. From Onana’s stance, he is in no rush to quit the club.",
      "He is determined to stay and fight for his place in the team, while proving he remains capable of being the club’s number one. That is despite hinting that he would be open to departing last month. He said: \"Will I leave? I don't know, we'll see!\"",
      "Should Onana stay, that could see their hopes of signing a new goalkeeper take a significant hit. They already identified potential options including Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez.",

      "Manchester United are once more linked with Valencia's Javi Guerra, despite being knocked back with a clear hands off warning from the La Liga club two years ago. Erik ten Hag was enjoying his second full summer transfer window at Old Trafford at the time, desperate to further improve the Red Devils side he inherited after the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when he showed an interest in Guerra.",
      "The 22-year-old midfielder's £87million release clause reportedly caught the attention of the United top brass, who were contemplating activating it to bring the Spaniard to Old Trafford. However, Valencia insisted that they held no intentions of cashing in on their wonderkid, who initially rose through the youth system of Villarreal before a 2019 move, signing his first professional contract two years later.",
      "Their sporting director Miguel Angel Corona told the Mail at the time: \"We are fully aware that we have a player with enormous potential for the future and the ability to perform at a good level now. That is why the club have decisively moved him up to the first team in recent months. It is not in our plans to sell him to any club.\"",
      "He added: \"For us, the emergence of Javi Guerra has not been a surprise. We have been aware of what he is capable of for a long time, we have been helping him and demanding more from him every step of the way, from youth level to the elite.",
      "\"He has to continue working in this way. We have to be cautious when making assessments about his level or how far he will be able to go, as he is a young player and has a long way ahead of him, but only he, with his day-to-day work, will determine where his limit is.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Guerra himself admitted in May 2023 that his family had urged him to remain at Valencia. He said: \"They advise me to stay the same, not to change because all this has cost a lot of work and we have to continue like this.\"",
      "The news came as a big blow to Ten Hag, as well as Newcastle United's Eddie Howe, who was also said to have been monitoring the youngster's situation closely. United instead secured Mason Mount from Chelsea in a £55m deal, as well as Sofyan Amrabat on loan from Fiorentina.",
      "However, it now appears as though the Red Devils are once again in the running to secure Guerra's services. While United have looked to bolster their frontline thus far, with the addition of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and a pursuit of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, Ruben Amorim is also looking at strengthening the centre of the park.",
      "And as per reports in Italy, Guerra looks increasingly close to finally leaving behind the Spanish sunshine in favour of north west England. While his hefty release clause is still in place, United may look to negotiate a cheaper deal for the talent, given that they have already spent big this summer and have a number of other targets in place across the pitch.",
      "With Christian Eriksen departing and Casemiro's playing time at the Theatre of Dreams uncertain, Amorim could be looking at a younger squad base to adapt to his patented 3-4-3 system. And Guerra could certainly fit the bill as an excelling partner to Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte, as Kobbie Mainoo's own place in the starting XI is in question given he has struggled to play to Amorim's style.",
      "He impressed in La Liga last season, scoring three goals and providing three assists in 36 appearances for Valencia, who finished a respectable 12th in the standings. And with a struggling United finishing a record-low 15th in the Premier League, Amorim will be eager to find more stability and composure in the heart of midfield ahead of next season.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Ex- Manchester United starlet Zidane Iqbal has opened up on feeling ‘disrespected’ by former boss Erik ten Hag - eventually leading to his exit from Old Trafford. Having joined the club as a nine-year-old, the midfielder worked his way up through the ranks with the Red Devils.",
      "He found himself on the edge of first-team football in 2021, eventually making his first-team debut against Young Boys in the Champions League. But that was as good as it got for Iqbal, who was eventually sold to Dutch side Utrecht in the summer of 2023.",
      "And he has now opened up on his decision to leave having been effectively cast aside by then boss Ten Hag. Speaking to The National, the 22-year-old said: “I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",
      "“I spoke to my dad and agent and said: ‘I can’t do this for another year’. From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team. For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the under-23s. I thought to myself, ‘I’m just like a number’.”",
      "Iqbal was hopeful that he would be afforded an opportunity to play against Charlton Athletic in the League Cup, only for Ten Hag to dismiss him once again - and that’s when he realised he needed to leave.",
      "He added: “Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn’t see my name. I was gutted. Then I thought I’d come off the bench. Nothing. That was the turning point for me. I didn’t feel the manager respected me enough to play me.”",
      "And having seen a number of promising youngsters look for opportunities abroad, Iqbal had no hesitation at leaving, especially after Ten Hag had asked him not to play at the under-19 World Cup.",
      "Iqbal said: “The manager [Ten Hag] listened and then told me he didn’t want me to go to the tournament. He said it was the end of the season; we had injuries and needed training numbers, too. He told me to stay patient. So I did. I was sure I’d play some minutes and become the first Iraqi player in the Premier League.",
      "“It didn’t happen, not even in the last games when there was little to play for. My best friend, Ali Al Hamadi of Ipswich, became the first Iraqi player, so I’m happy it’s him.",
      "“But I told my agent that I needed to move. I’d done everything that was asked and didn’t get a chance. I saw that Jadon Sancho had moved abroad from Man City, Paul Pogba from Man United. I was happy to try and take a similar route.”",
      "Iqbal’s talks with Ten Hag were not just limited to a transfer request. The Dutchman was also spotted letting his fury with the youngster be known as he slammed him as “f***ing rubbish” during a training session.",

      "Marcus Rashford's hopes of landing a dream switch to Barcelona have been aided after another of their targets had to be scratched off their list.",
      "Rafael Leao is the latest major name who won't be joining the Catalans, who have had little joy with their pursuit of more firepower this summer. The AC Milan star has excelled at the San Siro and new manager Max Allegri insists he is going nowhere.",
      "Barcelona, fresh off the back of securing a domestic double in Hansi Flick's first season, are looking to bolster a forward line that already includes Robert Lewandowski, Lamine Yamal and Raphinha. Leao had been identified as their latest target, but the Italians have no plans to sell.",
      "Allegri has said: “I’m sure I can bring out that extra something he’s been missing. I’m glad he’s stayed, he’s now more responsible, more mature, and has all the qualities to become one of the best.\"",
      "That comes after Barcelona also missed out on Nico Williams and Luis Diaz. The latter was thought to be their priority but Liverpool have made it clear, whilst his contract is winding down, that the Colombian will not be departing Anfield.",
      "As a result, Barcelona made a beeline for Williams, who put himself on the map with a stellar showing in last summer's Euros. He remains a leading light at Athletic Bilbao and, after being close to a move, has u-turned and chosen to sign a long-term deal at San Mames after Barcelona couldn't offer him certain guarantees.",
      "It means the Spanish giants are back to the drawing board and Rashford could be a name they now consider. The Manchester United forward doesn't appear to have any future under Ruben Amorim after being loaned out back at the start of the year.",
      "His move to Aston Villa was a success, but has not been made permanent and Rashford has been somewhat left in the lurch over his next move. It is understood that the England international sees Barcelona as his 'dream destination' and that move could now materialise if their persist with their plan to add another forward.",
      "Newcastle are also among those to express an interest in Rashford, but they want a loan move whilst those in Manchester want an end to the saga with a permanent exit on their radar. The 27-year-old has proven he can be prolific in the past, but he's been blighted by inconsistencies.",

      "Manchester United have backed out of having their own documentary filmed by Amazon as Ruben Amorim fears it could become a distraction. The Premier League giants had been in discussions for months about having their own “All or Nothing” series.",
      "Already Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham have had their own fly-on-the-wall documentaries filmed, but it requires the club opening up their doors, which their head coach wasn't willing to allow.",
      "It is understood Amazon were prepared to pay £10million to gain access but the man in the dugout hasn't pulled the plug on the deal, which had been in the pipeline. Amorim was the driving force behind saying no after the concept was put to him.",
      "It was discussed during a meeting of the club’s executive committee, who were all united in backing the manager's stance and no documentary will now take place, according to reports. Other factors like the nature of the commercial agreement were cited as factors, as reported by the Telegraph.",
      "Amorim knows he is under pressure to produce results and having the cameras up close and personal may not aid his cause. He has a shocking record since taking charge, which led United to post their worst ever Premier League season as they finished down in 15th.",
      "The Portuguese boss needs a big pre-season - on and off the pitch - if he is to turn things around. He knows that a slow start will only add pressure. Having cameras inside the dressing room for potentially defining moments is ideal for broadcast, but unlikely to be high on Amorim's wish list.",
      "There was a financial motive to having Amazon involved with the club making no secret of their need to consider the balance sheet. A post-season tour to Asia was almost solely financially driven and the extra cash could've eased any pressure, but they will now do without the streaming service's money.",
      "The previous docs that have been made it the past have had to cover the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham, which led to Jose Mourinho's return to management. The series on Arsenal began with them sitting bottom of the league as some fans turned on Arteta.",

      "United of course said no, elected to keep Garnacho despite issues with his attitude and social media posts. After being benched for the Manchester derby victory in December he looked on the way out.",
      "But Garnacho knuckled down, became an important part of Ruben Amorim's side and featured heavily in the second half of the season - until the final weeks.",
      "His Europa League final snub and subsequent reaction were the final straw for Amorim, who duly told Garnacho he had to leave this summer. Now he is one of five players whom the club have told not to return to pre-season training as they seek opportunities away from Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are the others.",
      "Of the quintet, Garnacho is the one for whom United can charge the most. He's youngest of the five, has shown he can cut it at United and doesn't command a £350k-a-week salary like Rashford.",
      "Indeed, his deal is increasingly key for the club's accounts, because his sale equates to pure profit. The current issue however is that while there's been plenty of speculation around potential suitors - Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Napoli and Juventus to name four - none have come forward with an offer.",
      "Indeed, they're looking elsewhere. Chelsea have turned to Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund as well as £60m Brighton striker Joao Pedro in recent days, Juventus like Jadon Sancho and have landed Jonathan David in forward positions and now Napoli have turned to £24million PSV Eindhoven star Noa Lang, with an agreement finally reached between the two clubs.",
      "As such, the door on a move to the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium for Garnacho appears to have been firmly closed.",
      "United must keep searching for a buyer to give them what they want. But selling Garnacho across Europe this summer is starting to look harder than it previously did.",

      "The Brazil forward, 26, was joined by fellow new boy Diego Leon, as well as United stars Amad, Mason Mount, Noussair Mazraoui, Ayden Heaven, Joshua Zirkzee, Toby Collyer, Matthijs De Ligt and Kobbie Mainoo. 15 players in total were present.",

      "Manchester United face a pivotal campaign this season - and planning is already well underway. A number of Red Devils return to Carrington on Monday for their first day of pre-season.",
      "And it’s probably fair to say that Ruben Amorim will have his stars hard at work as he attempts to recover from what was a woeful season last time out. Fortunately, work has already started on their summer business.",
      "A £62.5m deal for Matheus Cunha has already been rubber-stamped - with the Brazilian joining from Wolves - while Diego Leon became United’s second addition of the summer. But the work is not expected to end there.",
      "A new winger, as well as a striker, are also on the club’s shopping list. But will those deals get done in time?",
      "There’s less than two weeks before United’s first pre-season friendly of the summer against Leeds so Amorim will be keen to get moving. Take a look at the most pressing issues that the Portuguese coach needs to sort:",
      "The Brentford star has emerged as the Red Devils’ prime target of the summer - and all the signs point towards the deal being done. United have faced competition from Premier League rivals Tottenham but Mbeumo is currently prioritising a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "They have had two bids for Mbeumo rejected and are now contemplating a third which will be in the region of £65m. And should all go to plan, United will be optimistic of getting a deal done sooner rather than later.",
      "A deal for Mbeumo will take United’s spending this summer to around £130m, meaning they will likely need sales to offset that outlay. And there are already a number of candidates to leave.",
      "Last season’s loanees Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony are all high on the list of potential departures. So Amorim will be very hopeful of finding suitors for all of the three.",
      "The exits are unlikely to stop there though. Goalkeeper Andre Onana is a candidate to leave on loan, while left-back Tyrell Malacia is unlikely to have a future at the club following a season with PSV.",
      "Finally, Alejandro Garnacho could also be sold amid apparent interest from Chelsea and Napoli. Amorim will surely want the future of his misfits decided before they fly away for their pre-season tour, but that could well be a tough task.",
      "Speaking of departures, Onana is one of a host of players who could leave. The Cameroonian goalkeeper has endured a tricky few seasons since joining for big money from Inter Milan.",
      "Reports have suggested that United are open to letting him leave on loan amid apparent interest from Monaco. And that has seen the club linked with a host of goalkeepers including Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Botafogo star John Victor.",
      "Amorim must come to a decision over his number one sooner rather than later. If he decides to let Onana go, a replacement needs to be signed but if he stays, Amorim needs to make it clear that he is his man going forward.",
      "And while Amorim has a decision to make between the sticks, the same could be said of the centre of his attack. Cunha and Mbeumo represent excellent additions to United’s frontline but they are unlikely to be leading the line this coming season.",
      "A central striker has long been on the club’s shopping list. Viktor Gyokeres was a strong candidate for a move but he now appears likely to become an Arsenal player instead.",
      "It could potentially leave United in a tricky position where they don’t have enough funds for a new striker, which may have to see Amorim put his faith in Rasmus Hojlund. But that decision needs to be made first.",
      "The past few seasons have obviously been rotten for United but there is one place that they have excelled - giving academy stars an opportunity. Kobbie Mainoo and Toby Collyer are two of the standout success stories over recent seasons.",
      "But with a lack of European football next season, the best way for the club’s young stars to get experience might be loan spells away. Dan Gore, Harry Amass and Ethan Wheatley are candidates for temporary moves, while there are also plenty of promising stars in the club’s academy ranks who could benefit from moves.",
      "Amorim needs to work with newly-appointed head of loans Jonny Evans to decide who could potentially be sent out on loans over the coming weeks.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "The summer transfer window got off to a quick start with the arrival of Matheus Cunha, but the Red Devils have not been able to build on that momentum. Only the arrival of teenager star Diego Leon has been confirmed since with plenty of work to be done.",
      "United have failed to trim their squad thus far too. Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof departed at the end of their contracts, while Jonny Evans moved to a coaching role but Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho all remain at Old Trafford.",
      "But the club still hope to strengthen in their forward positions despite being unable to secure an agreement for Bryan Mbeumo thus far. An out-and-out striker may not go amiss for Amorim too.",
      "Manchester United are ready to sign free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin as a cost-effective solution for Ruben Amorim’s squad. United are in the process of rebuilding their squad the Portuguese coach is said to believe that Calvert-Lewin would be a useful addition alongside more expensive signings.",
      "Despite a poor injury record, reports claim that United believe the forward has the qualities required to bolster Amorim’s squad. United are ready to offer Calvert-Lewin a contract which would include bonuses tied into appearances as they eye a handy squad player.",
      "Calvert-Lewin left Everton after nine years at the end of June and is looking for a new club. The 28-year-old striker scored 71 goals in 273 appearances for the Toffees after joining them from Sheffield United in 2016.",

      "Dan Ashworth's tenure as Manchester United's sporting director was a short-lived one, ending in disaster within just a few months. Ashworth was a prime target for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who had to patiently wait over four months for him to officially commence his role due to being placed on gardening leave by his previous club, Newcastle United.",
      "It was on the 1st of July last year that Ashworth formally joined the Red Devils and immediately embarked on an ambitious recruitment campaign for then-manager Erik ten Hag, following United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.",
      "One of those other players was well-acquainted with Ten Hag, who was eager to reunite with. United shelled out £42m to bring former Ajax ace Matthijs De Ligt in from Bayern Munich.",
      "In a bid to provide Rasmus Hojlund with some assistance at the opposite end of the pitch, Ashworth activated Joshua Zirkzee's £34m buyout clause from Bologna after the Dutchman had aided the club in securing Champions League football for the first time in nearly six decades.",
      "Eager to bolster their defensive midfield – with Casemiro failing to replicate his Real Madrid form at the time – United sanctioned a move for Manuel Ugarte, who Paris Saint-Germain were willing to offload after just one season.",
      "A £40m offer was enough to secure the former Sporting CP star's services, eventually reuniting him with Ruben Amorim following the Portuguese boss' appointment as Ten Hag's successor last November.",
      "However, Ashworth departed United in December, before he could witness the outcome of his efforts. Over four months of the season had already elapsed upon Ashworth's exit and the performances of those three players left much to be desired.",
      "Despite De Ligt earning a formidable reputation in Europe since his teen years, he initially struggled to find his footing in Manchester's defence. While United endured a lacklustre season under Amorim, the Dutchman gradually found his rhythm in defence, sparking hopes among United fans that he will remain a key figure in their backline for years to come.",
      "The same optimism doesn't extend to Zirkzee, whose underwhelming presence has led United to continue their search for a striker to address their goalscoring issues – a role the former Bayern Munich forward was expected to fulfil.",
      "The 24-year-old has only managed to net seven goals in 49 matches across all competitions, with a mere three coming from Premier League games.",
      "His future at the club could be up in the air if Amorim succeeds in attracting ex-Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, despite Arsenal showing strong interest. Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins is also on United's current watchlist.",
      "As for Ugarte, the 24-year-old excels in tackling and regaining possession, typical traits of a defensive midfielder. However, he faced criticism last season due to his lack of forward play, with supporters arguing that his passing skills and athleticism are severely lacking.",
      "Amorim faces a colossal task ahead of the 2025/26 season, and it's yet to be seen what role these three players will have in United's future.",
      "And it seems unlikely that Ashworth's full quartet will be completed anytime soon. Branthwaite has recently signed a new contract with Everton under ex-United manager David Moyes.",
      "The England international, now reportedly valued at around £70m, inked a new five-year deal earlier this week.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "The team's talisman is a guaranteed starter and it would require Madueke to play from his less favoured left side if he were to join. Richards has backed the signing of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad but believes the focus now must be on landing a No 9.",
      "He said on The Rest is Football podcast: \"I like Zubimendi. We saw him in the Euros final, when Rodri came off. Very good player, tactically really good. He’s good on the ball, really good awareness in midfield. Gyokeres is a really good striker. I think a striker is more important than getting Madueke in first.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ready to sign free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin as a cost-effective addition to Ruben Amorim’s squad. United are rebuilding their squad in the summer transfer window and Amorim believes that Calvert-Lewin would be a good addition alongside more expensive signings.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived at United for £62.5million from Wolves and the club are still chasing Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, who will also cost north of £60m. But with the club conscious of profit and sustainability rules, they are also on the lookout for cheaper signings.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has left Everton after nine years and is looking for a new club. The 28-year-old striker scored 71 goals in 273 appearances for the Toffees after joining them from Sheffield United in 2016 and is seeking a fresh start.",
      "He has struggled with injuries in recent years, but The Sun reports that United believe he has the qualities required to bolster Amorim’s squad. They are ready to offer Calvert-Lewin a contract which would include bonuses for appearances so he could become a useful squad player in a role which could help avoid further injuries.",
      "United are still trying to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, who all spent last season away on loan, as well as Alejandro Garnacho and, potentially, Rasmus Hojlund. With Cunha a No.10 and Mbeumo best off the right wing, Calvert-Lewin could slot into the forward line as a No.9.",
      "He managed just three goals in 26 Premier League games last season with injury sidelining him between January and May. But he is hungry for a new challenge after posting an emotional farewell to Everton upon the expiry of his contract on June 30.",
      "He wrote: \"To Everton Football Club and the Evertonians. After nine remarkable years at this club, I've made the incredibly difficult decision, together with my family, to begin a new chapter in my career.",

This choice to move on was not simply about me, it was a decision my family and I spent a long time considering together.",
      "\"We believe it's the right moment to seek a new challenge and continue growing, but that doesn't lessen the bond I'll always have with Everton. I'm deeply proud of what we've shared, fighting for this club when it mattered most, scoring big goals in crucial moments, wearing the shirt with commitment and pride. My hope is that I leave with your respect, knowing I always sought to uphold the values of this great club.\"",

      "As a result of losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, United's transfer budget this summer is not as big as what it would have otherwise been, meaning they are having to box clever in this summer's window. Progress has been slow thus far, reflected in the Reds' tally of just two new arrivals, and player sales are key to funding new additions.",

The club's hierarchy knows Amorim has got to oversee a serious improvement next season and it is evident the Portuguese chief believes his players will have a better chance of helping the club climb the table without a TV crew following their every move.",

      "But just over a month since they lodged their opening bid for the Brentford attacker, United are yet to reach an agreement with the Londoners for the Cameroon international, who has made it clear that he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "After seeing an opening offer worth £55million turned down at the start of June, United lodged an improved offer in excess of £60m a few weeks later, and it was understood the deal was close to being finalised.",
      "However, almost a fortnight has passed since then and United are yet to reach a full agreement with Brentford, despite maintaining a degree of confidence that the deal will be done.",
      "United wanted to have Mbeumo signed and in position for the start of their pre-season training preparations. Instead, Diego Leon and Cunha were the only new arrivals present at Carrington on Monday.",
      "United will head to the US for their pre-season tour later this month and head coach Ruben Amorim will be hoping to have the bulk of his transfer business done by the time he and his players fly across the Atlantic. In reality that feels unlikely.",
      "United have prioritised strengthening their attack this summer and news of their interest in Mbeumo was almost immediately applauded. He scored 20 Premier League goals last season and would be an excellent addition.",
      "Mbeumo is expected to occupy the right-sided No.10 role in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system after making a habit of drifting inside off the right flank during his time at Brentford. It is believed Cunha has been drafted in to operate in the left-sided No.10 role.",
      "Although it is currently impossible to predict just how United might line up for their season opener against Arsenal next month, Amorim is not short on options in the No.10 positions. Cunha's arrival is expected to see Bruno Fernandes drop into the centre of midfield, leaving Mason Mount, Amad and potentially Mbeumo squabbling over the right-sided No.10 berth.",
      "Amad has proven he is equally effective as a right wing-back or a right-sided No.10 in Amorim's system, but Mount is restricted to one role in the head coach's preferred system. Fortunately for the former Chelsea man, he is held in very high regard by the Portuguese boss.",
      "Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount throughout his United tenure. He shared his admiration for him before even taking charge of United for the first time last November.",
      "If Mount can put his injury struggles behind him, Amorim will have plans to make full use of him this coming season. However, if Mbeumo eventually seals a move to Old Trafford, regular starts may become difficult for the England international to attain.",
      "But with the opening game of United's pre-season campaign now a little over a week away and the club's pursuit of Mbeumo lacking any sort of pace, Mount could find himself in pole position to start against Leeds United in Sweden and attempt to nail down a starting berth ahead of the US tour.",
      "After being consistently lauded by Amorim and bagging a start in the Europa League final in May, Mount will fancy his chances of becoming a key player in his third term at Old Trafford after his first two were ravaged by injuries.",
      "The longer United's pursuit of Mbeumo takes, the stronger Mount's chances of becoming a starter in Amorim's first-choice XI will become."

They were tasked with completing a set of pull-ups. Among those involved was Joshua Zirkzee, who experienced problems with a hamstring injury towards the end of last season.

      "Manchester United returned to pre-season training on Monday as the countdown to the new Premier League campaign begins in earnest.",
      "The Reds welcomed 15 players back into the fold ahead of their pre-season opener against Leeds United in Sweden a week on Saturday.",
      "New signings Mathues Cunha and Diego Leon were at Carrington as they met their new team-mates for the first time but several players will return later in the week after international commitments.",
      "The new Premier League season is now a little over a month away and Ruben Amorim and United have some key questions to answer between now and the big kick off. The MEN take a look at four of them.",
      "United want the player and the player wants United, so this is a deal that should get sorted.",
      "The Reds have had two offers for the Cameroon international knocked back so far this summer and talks are continuing as United seek to find a compromise with Brentford.",
      "The Bees are rightly sticking to their guns on one of their key players and have left the door open to the 25-year-old staying at the Gtech next season.",
      "United will want to conclude a deal swiftly, and would love to have Mbeumo in place for the pre-season tour of America in a couple of weeks.",
      "United have delayed the return to training of five wantaway stars.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have no future at the club under Amorim and all have been granted extra time away from Carrington to try and secure moves.",
      "United will hope to bank £120million + for the quintet with those sales potentially covering the cost of Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals.",
      "But the Reds are not in the strongest bargaining position given everyone knows the club want rid and it remains to be seen how much of a market materialises for the five at the prices United want.",
      "Shifting at least one or two on in the coming weeks would be most welcome.",
      "Amorim rotated, rotated and rotated some more last season as he battled a flurry of fixtures at home and abroad.",
      "The Old Trafford chief will hope that pre-season can offer him the chance to settle on a preferred XI with the lack of European football opening a door for United to thrive domestically with a limited schedule.",
      "But that will only work if the Reds can find their form. Amorim must decide whether the likes of Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund remain first XI options while providing clarity on the positional roles the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount will play next term."

      "Ruben Amorim faces an important pre-season as he looks to implement his philosophy on the squad after a difficult six months at the Theatre of Dreams. United face a difficult start to the season as they take on Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea before the beginning of October.",
      "Following the narrow defeat in the Europa League to Tottenham Hotspur and their low finish in the Premier League, United are under pressure to get off the mark early with a strong start to the campaign.",

      "And with a crop of players not expected back until later in the week, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot being granted an extended period of leave after Diogo Jota's tragic death last week and five wantaway stars having their return dates delayed until later this month, it has highlighted the need for United to inject some pace into their recruitment drive.",
      "No club should be pressured into getting deals done for the sake of it, especially United, who have been criticised in recent years for paying over the odds for countless players.",
      "However, when you analysed the list of 15 players that were present at Carrington on Monday, it did hammer home the need to get new signings through the door sooner rather than later.",
      "United have prioritised strengthening their attack this summer and getting Cunha nice and early last month marked an excellent start. However, the Mbeumo situation is beginning to drag on for too long.",
      "With the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City getting deals done at speed this summer, United are at risk of being left behind. Sales remain key to bringing new players in, but the sight of just two new signings being in position for the start of pre-season has hammered home the importance of United adding more blood to their ranks sooner rather than later.",
      "United have another fortnight until they jet off to the US for their pre-season tour, meaning the clock is ticking to get new signings in place in time."

      "Manchester United are once again showing interest in Valencia's Javi Guerra, despite receiving a firm hands off message from the La Liga outfit two years ago.",
      "Erik ten Hag, who was navigating his second full summer transfer window at Old Trafford, was keen to enhance the squad he took over following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's exit and Ralf Rangnick's interim reign when he first expressed interest in Guerra in 2023. The 22-year-old midfielder has an £87million buyout clause that intrigued the United hierarchy, who were considering triggering it to secure the Spaniard's services.",
      "Nonetheless, Valencia made it clear they had no plans to part with their prodigy, who progressed through Villarreal's youth ranks before transferring in 2019 and signing his first professional contract two years on. Valencia's sporting director Miguel Angel Corona told the Mail at the time: \"We are fully aware that we have a player with enormous potential for the future and the ability to perform at a good level now.",
      "\"That is why the club have decisively moved him up to the first team in recent months. It is not in our plans to sell him to any club.\"",
      "He added: \"For us, the emergence of Javi Guerra has not been a surprise. We have been aware of what he is capable of for a long time, we have been helping him and demanding more from him every step of the way, from youth level to the elite.",
      "\"He has to continue working in this way. We have to be cautious when making assessments about his level or how far he will be able to go, as he is a young player and has a long way ahead of him, but only he, with his day-to-day work, will determine where his limit is.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Guerra himself admitted in May 2023 that his family had urged him to remain at Valencia. He said: \"They advise me to stay the same, not to change because all this has cost a lot of work and we have to continue like this.\"",
      "The revelation came as a significant setback for Ten Hag, as well as Newcastle United's Eddie Howe, who were both reportedly keeping tabs on the promising youngster. Manchester United went on to sign Mason Mount from Chelsea for £55m and brought in Sofyan Amrabat on loan from Fiorentina.",
      "Yet, it now seems that the Red Devils are back in contention to secure Guerra's signature. While United have been focusing on enhancing their attack this season, with the acquisition of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and interest in Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, Ruben Amorim is also keen on reinforcing the midfield.",
      "According to Italian media reports, Guerra is edging closer to swapping the Spanish sun for the north west of England. Despite his substantial release clause, United might attempt to negotiate a more affordable deal for the talent, considering their potentially hefty spending this summer and the array of other targets they have across the pitch.",
      "With Christian Eriksen leaving and Casemiro's playing time at Old Trafford uncertain, Amorim might be considering a younger squad to fit his preferred 3-4-3 formation. Guerra could potentially be an excellent addition alongside Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte, especially as Kobbie Mainoo's position in the starting line-up is doubtful due to his struggles with Amorim's style.",
      "Last season, Guerra made a strong impression in La Liga, netting three goals and providing three assists in 36 appearances for Valencia, who finished a respectable 12th in the league. With United ending a record-low 15th in the Premier League, Amorim will undoubtedly be keen to bring more stability and control to the midfield ahead of the next season."

      "However, upon returning to Italy, via an initial loan to PSG and a second spell at Juventus, Kean has managed to rediscover the sort of form which made him such an exciting prospect. The 25-year-old scored 19 goals in Serie A last season - his best campaign in senior football.",
      "This has, unsurprisingly, caught the eye of United and, according to The Athletic, the Reds have been the Premier League club most interested in Kean. However, if United are to snap him up, they will need to work quickly.",
      "It is understood that Kean has a £44.8m release clause inserted into his Fiorentina contract. However, that clause expires on Tuesday, July 15 and if it is not triggered prior to then, the Italian club are under no obligation to accept a bid as low as that this summer.",
      "Should they complete a move for Mbeumo, like to cost more than £63m, United's hands could be tied until they sell players. Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have all informed the club that they wish to seek opportunities elsewhere.",
      "Now we have entered July, it is less of a necessity to sell before buying but Ineos will still need to bring in a good chunk of money before the window shuts to balance the books.",
      "They attempted to sign Liam Delap before his move to Chelsea. A striker is very much on their wish-list - to act as competition for Rasmus Hojlund."

      "Former manager Thomas Frank warned in May that Mbeumo's sale would need to be for a substantial fee.",
      "\"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,\" he said. \"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",
      "\"There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for.\""

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, and they are on course to do so…",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £61.7m\nThe Black Cats made Noah Sadiki their third summer signing and are far from finished following promotion to the Premier League.",
      "",
      "8) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "6) Atalanta – £68m\nIvan Juric has somehow landed the Atalanta job and has brought Kamaldeen Sulemana with him from Southampton.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper has propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Newcastle are set to spend around £85million in the next week, while mulling over an offer for a midfielder once rated at £50million…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",
      "",
      "19) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nBack in the power ranking after The Athletic reported that Madrid are ‘open to selling’ the Brazilian winger, who is apparently the Gunners’ ‘dream target’ this summer. David Ornstein says Arsenal is keen, but that a transfer is unlikely if Gabriel Martinelli isn’t sold. And Madueke will certainly be cheaper.",
      "",
      "18) Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nThe Spain Under-21 midfielder has a release clause worth £87million but United – and other clubs – reckon he’s attainable for a quarter of that sum. Apparently, Guerra is ‘close’ to joining United but we’re not buying it – yet.",

      "",
      "17) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "16) John McGinn – Aston Villa to Everton\nThe Toffees are keen in the Villa skipper but their interest it doesn’t seem to have gone beyond a look and and sniff. McGinn is under contract until 2027 but they might be interested in selling the 30-year-old if they really are intent on moving for Lazio’s Matteo Guendouzi.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nWe’re not sure how many offers West Ham have rejected, but the latest was reportedly worth £50million plus £12.5million in add-ons. West Ham need to sell but they also need to squeeze Spurs for as much as they can given what they make is what Graham Potter can spend.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nSancho is refusing to leave any of the final year of his United salary on the table, which is making things awkward for everyone. And now we learn that the ex-England winger is currently an alternative option for Juve while they prioritise Francisco Conceicao, who was on loan in Turin from Porto. The Old Lady has a week to snare Conceicao for a discounted fee of £25million, but even that amount requires some negotiation.",
      "",
      "13) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern were looking for a wide forward even before Jamal Musiala’s injury at the Club World Cup. Diaz’s willingness to move appears greater than Liverpool’s intent to sell, so the Colombian may have to force the issue if he’s really so keen to try something new.",
      "",
      "12) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca’s hopes of signing Luis Diaz appear dashed, which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "11) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £20million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year. This will go for as long as Valencia are stubborn.",
      "",
      "10) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "9) Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe noise around this one is increasing, with Madueke perhaps the most achievable left winger target, assuming Eberechi Eze is a separate pursuit. Chelsea need to sell, as they seemingly always do, to meet UEFA guidelines and they are expecting an offer from Arsenal. Given the Gunners’ lack of haste this summer, we suggest the Blues don’t hold their breath, but we would certainly keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now.",
      "",
      "7) Sean Longstaff – Newcastle to Leeds United\nThe Athletic reckons Leeds are close to maxing out with their latest bid, which is worth £10million and another £2million in add-ons. Remember when Mike Ashley was quoting £50million for the midfielder? Longstaff is a year from leaving for nothing, which is something the 27-year-old, apparently, wants to avoid for the sake of his hometown team making a few quid. Which is different…",
      "",
      "6) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before this week, with a chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. Having missed their own deadline, there is talk they could walk away, but even United wouldn’t come this far just to ditch it.",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nReports suggest that Arsenal have made progress but they are yet to reach an agreement with Sporting. There is, apparently, a desire for all parties to get a deal done but for everyone to be satisfied, Arsenal will have to get to £70million. This feels like a saga but, in fairness to the Gunners, what was the hurry before pre-season? That time is now upon us, though…",
      "",
      "3) Thierno Barry – Villarreal to Everton\nThe France Under-21 striker has a £34million release clause but the Guardian reckons Everton are close to securing a hefty discount to sign a replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin for £27million. Barry, who bagged 11 goals last season, was flying somewhere prior to the weekend, we assume into Merseyside.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle have finally reached an agreement with Forest worth £52million plus add-ons and Elanga will be heading to the North-East for a medical in the coming days.",
      "",
      "1) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nDone bar the confirmation.",

      "With Mbeumo’s former manager at Brentford, Thomas Frank, replacing Ange Postecoglou as Tottenham boss last month, there was an expectation that Spurs now had a chance of landing the Bees forward.",
      "It has been clear that Mbeumo’s first choice is Man Utd but Wenham is predicting that Brentford could force the Red Devils to move on to other targets if they don’t lower their price, giving Tottenham a chance later in the summer.",
      "Wenham told Tottenham News: “Manchester United are now looking at [Ollie] Watkins..",
      "“They’re unlikely to sign Watkins and Mbeumo, and there’s also an interesting subplot here. If you remember when Tottenham tried to sign David Raya, Brentford wanted £40million.",
      "“As the window went on, nobody was paying the £40m and they ended up loaning him to Arsenal and he then joined permanently for much less than £40m. I could see that happening with Mbeumo where he becomes available at the end of the window for less.",

      "As some players arrive for pre-season while others are still going in the 2024/2025 campaign thanks to the Club World Cup, we’re looking ahead to the World Cup Proper next summer and the transfers that we reckon need to happen in the remaining few weeks of the current window for England to win the big gong.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nDespite Rashford doing everything short of donating body parts in order to force through his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona, he was third choice until about a week ago. But the Nico Williams snub has now put him in pole position for the transfer, in quite the remarkable boon for his career and England’s chances of redressing the balance of their lopsided attack.",
      "Luis Diaz can ‘agree’ to as many transfers as he likes – Liverpool didn’t want to sell him before so surely won’t now, while top target Williams has signed a new deal with Athletic Club having quite reasonably been perturbed by Barcelona’s inability to assure him that he could actually be registered to play football.",
      "Rashford faces the same grim possibility, but these things tend to work out for mega-clubs like Barcelona, and the juice is undoubtedly worth the squeeze for the United academy graduate. Having seen what he did for Villa in six months, it’s hard to imagine Rashford not being brilliant under a manager with an excellent track record of getting the best out of attacking players in a team where it appears to be impossible not to get a shedload of goal contributions as a forward. Ferran Torres got 26 last season.",
      "And while Tuchel already knows that Harry Kane will play as his No.9 with Bukayo Saka on the right and one of the 427 wonderful No.10s as his No.10, there is currently no standout candidate for that left-wing spot. The thought of Anthony Gordon starting there is hardly encouraging as things stand and Tuchel can’t make the same Gareth Southgate mistake of crowbarring a Phil Foden or Cole Palmer into that role.",
      "An in-form Rashford would be ideal and we can’t imagine a better place for him to find and maintain that form than with Barcelona.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nLiverpool aren’t currently willing to pay the £50m up front that Crystal Palace want for Guehi, but an ‘agreement in principle’ between the player and buying club, along with him ‘pushing’ for the transfer suggests a compromise will be reached.",
      "Guehi has understandable concerns over his game time at Anfield as he looks ahead to the World Cup, but has presumably come to the obvious conclusion that he will go straight into the team alongside Virgil van Dijk because a) Ibrahima Konate has made a rod for his own back through his reported desire to be the next free transfer Judas, and b) we’re not convinced Konate is all that anyway as a free-kick mannequin could be made to look half-decent next to the greatest centre-back the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "Guehi looked a bit dodgy against Latvia in March but more than proved his big-tournament worth at the Euros, and a season of Champions League football next to Big Virg would make us feel rather more at ease over what’s currently a lick-your-finger-and-raise-it-to-the-sky position.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s to Crystal Palace’s great credit that they’ve nurtured so many footballers to the point where they should be playing Champions League football, but kudos and hat tips aren’t going to win you trophies… Oh, that’s right, they already bloody won one.",
      "Europa League football came with that wonderful FA Cup win, but whether because he feels like he’s achieved everything he can and more at Palace or he’s been looking wistfully at what best pal Michael Olise’s been doing at Bayern Munich for the last year, Eze is supposedly ‘desperate’ to return to the club that released him at the age of 13.",
      "Part of us thinks “no, f*** you Arsenal, you had your chance”, but we’ve got our England hats on and surely nothing but good can come from Eze and Declan Rice playing together week in, week out.",
      "",
      "Adam Wharton – Staying at Crystal Palace\nWe are in dangerous territory assuming that Eze and Rice will form a partnership at Arsenal that can drip through to England as that sounds suspiciously like Rice in a holding midfield role akin to a tiger walking around an enclosure.",
      "Tuchel doesn’t want a caged Rice but the one who ran all over Real Madrid and embarrassed Jude Bellingham across two legs in the Champions League, but that can only happen if a quality No.6 comes through this season to set him free. We believe that man is Wharton and that the best way for him to stake his claim is to remain at Palace, which is fortunate as we’re guessing Steve Parish would want a bazillion pounds for him if Guehi and Eze are on their way out.",
      "A non-transfer but one we felt worthy of mention as it’s the glaring issue facing Tuchel right now and to offset out guilt at giving the green light to arguably our favourite Premier League team being gutted this summer.",
      "",
      "John Stones – Manchester City to Everton\nStones will likely be looking at his competition for a starting spot at Manchester City and fancy his chances. Neither Abdukodir Khusanov nor Vitor Reis have arrived and demanded a place through their displays and a battle with Manuel Akanji or Nathan Ake to play alongside Ruben Dias is one he’s frequently won.",
      "When fit, of course, which has been so rare as to put Stones in a position that City players appear to often find themselves in under Pep Guardiola, where the manager’s desire to be cautious over the fitness of the perennially injured far outstrips the reality that most footballers need to play football to get fit.",
      "We’re hoping David Moyes has got enough of the Old School still in him not to concern himself with niggles, proximity to Red Zones or that other fancy-schmancy sports science guff and play Stones if he says he’s ready to play, which we assume he will be all of the time during a season before what could be his last big tournament hurrah.",
      "He ticks the Dick Hill marquee-signing box and offers the opportunity of an England partnership forming alongside Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nRasmus Hojlund reportedly wants to stay at Manchester United having spectacularly failed to read the room and Ruben Amorim faces the prospect of the Denmark international doing sod all again up top for United next season as predictably little progress has been made on finding buyers for their overpaid crop of outcasts.",
      "No interested club is daft enough to pay full price for your Alejandro Garnachos, Antonys or Jadon Sanchos in the knowledge that the Red Devils will say yes to any offer to get them out of the club on deadline day.",
      "A £60 move for Watkins is therefore very unlikely, but Villa have shown some interest in United’s pariahs, offering hope of a swap or a separate but very definitely linked PSR-swerving dodgy deal.",
      "While we would be surprised if Watkins joined and banged in goal after goal he would at least be guaranteed a spot in the team, which was far from the case under Unai Emery last season. We want the guy who’s going to play minimal football while watching Kane at the World Cup to have played plenty during the season, thank you very much.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nMadueke was arguably England’s most impressive player against Andorra in June and could absolutely be in the mix for a starting spot next summer if he moves to Arsenal or stays at Chelsea, but this is less about him and more about Starboy.",
      "The injury which kept Bukayo Saka out for a big chunk of last season may be entirely unrelated to him being flogged by Mikel Arteta at an average of 46 games in the previous three campaigns, but as overuse injuries go, a hamstring ping is a common one.",
      "Madueke could play on Arsenal’s left in the same team as Saka but, more importantly for England, in his place on the right on occasion, to save some of his energy and dynamism for the international left-backs who need to feel the Saka pain if the Three Lions are to have any hope.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nHe’s made just four starts at No.10 since his move to Manchester City four years ago and two of his 17 goals for the Citizens have come in those games. That provides fairly good evidence of his value in that role over his typical spot under Pep Guardiola on the left wing, as did his display for England in that role vs Ireland under Lee Carsley in September, when he scored and was seen doing Jack Grealish type things we’ve been denied the joy of watching for far too long.",
      "Guardiola’s negging has given Grealish little option but to leave Manchester City and Napoli are thought to be among those most interested. We’re not quite sure how Antonio Conte might fit Grealish into a line-up with Scott McTominay and Kevin De Bruyne but now we think about it we’re not sure there’s a midfield trio we would rather watch in action.",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Newcastle\nAfter his outstanding displays to drive the England U21s to Euros glory we really need to find out just how good Elliott is at football this season, and that’s only going to happen away from Liverpool.",
      "Fulham are interested but we’re guessing Elliott is setting his sights a little higher. Borussia Dortmund offers a sanctuary for lost English souls and will be an attractive option. But if Eddie Howe can – with all due respect – get nine goals and 14 assists out of Jacob Murphy in a season then Elliott must fancy his chances of staking his England claim at St James’ Park.",
      "",
      "Fabian Ruiz – PSG to Manchester United\nA strange one for those hoping for a revitalised Kobbie Mainoo this season and we count ourselves among those crossing our fingers that Ruben Amorim can find a suitable spot for him in his 3-4-3 to allow him to shine for the Red Devils as he did for England at Euro 2024.",
      "But Mainoo’s absence from the team thanks to Ruiz’s arrival would only be short-lived before he usurps a guy who was brilliant for England’s conquerors Spain at Euro 2024 but would arrive at the World Cup bereft of all confidence having had it sapped from him by a year at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly pull out of a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo in order to sign another Premier League star and pressure Brentford to lower their price.",
      "Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze continues to attract interest from Premier League sides Arsenal and Liverpool, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been given a double blow in their pursuit of a new striker this summer with Ollie Watkins looking difficult to land, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal have no chance of agreeing a cut-price deal for Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze as Gunners hold internal discussions, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal need a striker. Viktor Gyokeres is the standout, but who else is there? From fantasy picks like Isak to the realistic Watkins, we rank 10 options.",
      "Including Ollie Watkins to Manchester United and Eberechi Eze to Arsenal, we’ve reassigned the Premier League’s best of the rest to the big boys."

      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Some clubs go all Football Manager with transfer clauses. Spurs are trying to find West Ham’s sweet spot over Mohammed Kudus but an apparent add-on regarding Thomas Frank’s side winning the Premier League and Champions League, as reported by talkSPORT, is unlikely to move things along.",
      "That is not the first transfer clause that a prospective selling club has rejected out of hand. Spurs themselves have previous.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes – Sporting to Spurs\nWest Ham are said to want ‘a more realistic proposal’ for Kudus which guarantees them a greater pay-out up front.",
      "At least Spurs are not now in the midst of a famous trophy drought when pledging payments to clubs in the event they win the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "They had just lost the Champions League final when Bruno Fernandes agreed to make the move to north London – but in echoes of the Viktor Gyokeres carry-on, Sporting president Frederico Varandas stood in the way.",
      "“The only serious offer was from Tottenham and that was £40m plus another £18m in bonuses for winning the Premier League and the Champions League,” he said. “Those are difficult objectives, so we chose not to accept.”",
      "By January, Manchester United came around waving an initial £47m rising to £67.7m at the Portuguese club, who were more amenable to clauses such as Champions League qualification and making 25 starts.",
      "",
      "Declan Rice – West Ham to Arsenal\nWest Ham do not tend to mess around with the old Premier League and Champions League-winning clauses either.",
      "Their laborious staring contest with Arsenal over a move everyone knew would go through involved half-hearted Manchester City hijacks and incessant grumbling over payment structures.",
      "The Gunners had a couple of offers rejected, with one including add-ons for winning either of the two big ones and Rice playing a certain percentage of games.",
      "In the end the £5m add-ons attached to a £100m deal were for the Hammers to receive £1m each time Arsenal simply qualified for the Champions League with Rice starting 60% of games.",
      "Two payments down, three to go.",
      "",
      "Sadio Mane – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nWhile the perennial German champions did eventually get their man, it took a bit more finesse than one might expect.",
      "Mane wanted the move for a fresh challenge and Liverpool were happy to oblige in a continued restructuring of their attack, but Bayern had to get serious first.",
      "After an opening offer of £21m plus an extra £4m in add-ons was scoffed at by Liverpool, Bayern came back to the table with, as reported by the well-connected Paul Joyce of The Times, a bid which could theoretically reach £30m.",
      "Fair enough. That seems like a perfectly sensible progression in negotiations.",
      "Oh hold on. It would have only hit that top figure if Bayern won the Champions League and Mane the Ballon d’Or. Over each season of his three-year contract. So an extra £6.5m in return for Mane becoming the third player to win three consecutive Ballons d’Or simultaneously with Bayern completing only the second Champions League threepeat in history. Sounds about right.",
      "Mane only ended up staying in Bavaria for a single year, with Bayern eliminated in the Champions League quarter-finals as the Senegalese struggled. No wonder Liverpool mocked those ‘laughable’ bonuses.",
      "",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka – Crystal Palace to Man Utd\nThere were a couple of clauses contained within the final deal which saw Wan-Bissaka leave Crystal Palace for Man Utd.",
      "The former likely abandoned any hope of receiving 10% of any subsequent sale of the right-back for more than £50m long before he moved to West Ham for £15m.",
      "More plausible is that 190 appearances for Man Utd supplemented that initial £45m fee with £5m worth of add-ons.",
      "But Man Utd would have had other contingencies written into the transfer if things had gone their way. It was reported during protracted negotiations that Palace were ‘unimpressed’ by the nature of the performance-related clauses, one of which was known to be an additional payment if Wan-Bissaka made 25 Champions League appearances for a club which had just qualified for the Europa League; he has been stuck on 15 since December 2023.",
      "Some outlets went one further and suggested that Man Utd pledged more money if they won the Champions League, despite not advancing beyond the quarter-finals since 2011. In Palace’s eyes, that was fairly accurately deemed by The Guardian ‘to be wildly unrealistic’.",
      "",
      "Hugo Ekitike – Reims to Newcastle\n“Newcastle positioned themselves, we discussed it, they made us an offer that did not suit us,” said Reims president Jean-Pierre Caillot of Hugo Ekitike in January 2022.",
      "“As we do not really want him to leave, we have fixed the price quite high. They did offer us €35m all in, but with a number of bonuses, some of them quasi-impossible to reach. Like for example, winning the Champions League. We want €30m flat and €10m in achievable bonuses.”",
      "The Ligue Un club were far more receptive to a summer approach. Newcastle had expected to complete a deal for striker Ekitike worth €36m, plus €10m in what were described by French sources as far more ‘easily attainable’ bonuses. Perhaps they started with just qualifying for the Champions League first.",
      "But an injury put the move in doubt and the Magpies moved on to other targets long before Paris Saint-Germain swooped. Eddie Howe probably doesn’t regret waiting a little longer for Alexander Isak instead.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho – Borussia Dortmund to Man Utd\nAfter successfully reeling in Monaco with an add-on worth £7.6m if Anthony Martial finished on a Ballon d’Or podium, Man Utd repeated the trick with Bruno Fernandes four-and-a-half years later. They will owe Sporting Lisbon £4.2m for each of the first three times the Portuguese is named PFA Player of the Year or takes a spot in the Ballon d’Or top three. The current tally stands at zero in either case.",
      "United tried it again when it came to those complicated talks with Borussia Dortmund over Sancho. Despite having ‘forced the Germans’ into selling the winger in August 2020, Sancho inexplicably remained at the Westfalenstadion for almost 12 more months.",
      "Thirteen days after the delayed Euro 2020 final, in which the England international missed a shootout penalty, Man Utd finally had their man. But not before Dortmund shot down any idea of the overall fee being enhanced by that typical bonus due if Sancho finished high in the Ballon d’Or vote.",
      "As an aside, the last Man Utd player to take a podium place in Ballon d’Or voting was 2008 winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who also finished second in 2007. Before then, it was 1999 runner-up David Beckham, Eric Cantona’s third place in 1993 and then bronze for George Best in 1971. It’s hardly a regular occurrence.",
      "",
      "Kieran Tierney – Celtic to Arsenal\nAround the time Tierney was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a knee injury that required surgery in early April 2022, Arsenal might have felt they had already established a substantial enough lead in the pursuit of Champions League qualification.",
      "The Gunners were fourth, four and six points clear of Man Utd and West Ham respectively, with a game in hand on both. Tottenham were a place further back and six points behind, with the north London rivals having 10 games left each.",
      "It should have been sewn up but Arsenal’s form collapsed, in part because of the reshuffling which Tierney’s absence forced. Arsenal lost three consecutive games to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, then won four on the trot before imploding against Spurs and Newcastle to confirm their slip to fifth.",
      "Celtic never believed in them. It was during talks over Tierney when the Scottish giants, having already rejected a £15m bid for the left-back, scoffed at the structure of a further £25m offer. One of the clauses pertained to Arsenal, Europa League runners-up at the time, qualifying for the Champions League.",

      "Christian Benteke – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nAn absolutely glorious clause. So good it needs to be retained in its original form, as written by Chris Bascombe of the Daily Telegraph in August 2016:",

Those additional clauses included £2.5 million should Palace qualify for the Champions League with Benteke scoring 20 goals and playing in 70 per cent of the fixtures of such a top-four campaign. These three conditions formed part of the same clause.’",
      "It turns out ‘this was not considered realistic on Merseyside’. Idiots.",

And as a generally optimistic chap, this is the first time since INEOS took over that I’m nearing panic stations. And by that I mean dreading the drifting malaise and apathy that will come with following United for the foreseeable.",
      "If we take a brief stroll down memory lane, we had ETH who had a terrible season but had some leeway because the squad he was managing – largely due to a ridiculous injury list – couldn’t actually field XI decent players in the right positions for two weeks in a row. He was then given a couple months with some fit players and it went pear-shaped and instead we got a systems-coach in. Which made sense given INEOS’ clear indication that we’d be spending in our means and these big, manager-led signings were over.",
      "So Amorim arrives and is given leeway because his system very clearly needs excellent wing backs of which United have literally none. Fine INEOS, you wanted your man, this is longer-term thinking. More leeway from fans. A single signing in January alleviates a small piece of the problem, but United still start most weeks with a past-it central midfielder and no options up front. But more leeway is given because INEOS are going to sort the summer out, and United are finally going to start the second half of the open-heart surgery Ralf wanted.",
      "And here we are. Probably the most-challenging opening few months of any team in the league. A manager we’ve heard for almost a year needs a great pre-season with his players. A system that we’ve heard for multiple years needs new blood, more athleticism and just more numbers. A season that is absolutely crucial to the club’s future. And what have INEOS achieved?

      "Let me be clear, I believe the way the club behaved regarding Thomas Partey was reprehensible, and has tarnished the reputation of both the club and the fans too. Now, not everyone is terminally online, following this discourse, so it is quite possible that many Arsenal fans had no idea that the club was protecting a potential sex offender, however many hundreds of thousands did. We all saw the same social media posts by the victims, we all knew who the police were alluding to. For me, the most shameful part is that they tried to renew his contract, knowing all this. Why would you do this?",
      "I can’t believe I’m about to type this, but Stewie is right in this regard. How can the club talk about community when they circle the wagons for people accused of such crimes? How can we celebrate our amazing women’s team when this is how the club treats other women? How was this allowed to happen? Were they so scared about the value of an asset that they’d rather burn our reputation to protect someone else’s reputation. Someone who has cast a dark shadow over our club?",
      "I don’t know the complexities of employment law, contracts, etc, but the club should have dropped him the moment he was accused, but they didn’t. There needs to be a top down review about how these decisions were made, who made them, and they are held to account.",

      "The problem with Arsenal’s left-hand side has been their team setup and use of inverted LBs and a lack of a decent/fixed Left 8.

It’s just too heartbreaking, and feels too soon. As many have said, he only knew of me in the collective, as one of millions of LFC supporters, but nonetheless his death in many ways feels like the loss of a close friend. We invest so much in our clubs & these players so something like this is a shock and it hurts.",
      "Thanks to the intervention of autoplay, the recent episode of The Athletic’s LFC podcast came up and I ended up listening to them memorialize Jota. More than once they hit on the tragedy of Diogo being taken just as he hit the prime of his life – winning a league title with his club, winning a Nations League with his country, and most importantly marrying his childhood sweetheart. All of which are especially cruel.",
      "But listening to that episode, and reflecting on my own personal losses, I am going to (try to) see the positive in this. My mother passed away a little over a year ago, only about a week after I moved from NYC to London. She had been in cancer treatment for a couple years, and the last 6 months of her life were clinical trials and experimental treatments, none of which were able to help. One of the main things to give us comfort, which doesn’t apply at all here, is that we all knew the end was coming and she was fully at peace with it. She encouraged me to make the move, and as a result of some timing issues I ended up living with my parents in Upstate NY for a month and I absolutely wouldn’t trade that time for anything in the world.",
      "The other silver lining which gave us peace, is that she got to have all of the major experiences she wanted out of life. My parents were married for 43 years and got to do a bit of traveling in retirement before her life was dominated by appointments and treatments. My sister got married about 3 years ago, so she got to experience the joy of one of her children getting married.",
      "About a year after that, she was overjoyed at the news that my sister was pregnant. And while she was in the end stages of her own life when my niece arrived, my mom got to be a grandmother. I can only imagine the physical pain she was quietly going through but I have never seen my mom as happy as when she held her grandchild.",
      "There is such a sense of cruelty in Diogo passing away just as he was going through the prime of his professional life and hitting these personal milestones, which cuts deep for many but especially those closest to him. He had so much in life ahead of him, but I am going to try to take peace knowing that he and his family got to experience those recent highs while he was alive and hope that someday they are able to do the same.",
      "It took me a long time to get that perspective, in part because of the ability to mentally prepare and to say goodbye while Mom was still with us. I hope they reach a similar comfort in the future and that they always know the love that the LFC, Wolves, Portugal, Pacos de Ferreira communities (among others) hold for Diogo, Andre, and their entire family.\nDanny, LFC NY"

      "We’re still waiting on some stragglers and official releases, so do check back for further updates, but here are our objectively correct rankings of the Premier League’s 25/26 home kits for you to enjoy and not get unnecessarily cross about.",
      "Remember, these are the correct opinions.",
      "Big themes for this season include: round collars, local ‘inspiration’ and more immediately obvious divergence between ‘replica’ and ‘authentic’ versions of shirts. We’re not really happy about any of those themes, if we’re honest.",
      "Away and third kits to follow in due course but there are still just far too many unknowns and uncertainties there for any kind of solid ranking, and as you know we wouldn’t want to just put our name to any ranking that was half-baked. Ahem. On we go.",
      "",
      "TBC: Crystal Palace\nWe don’t even have a clear idea who’s making the as-yet-unreleased kit for the FA Cup winners. They’ve been with Macron in recent years, but we have been unable to track down details of the length of that contract. Another TBC in terms of both the kit itself and more importantly its ranking, then.",
      "",
      "TBC: Bournemouth\nCannot even be ranked in the absence of even vaguely reliable leaks. There appears to even be some doubt about the manufacturer, with some ferociously ugly mock-ups featuring supposed adidas efforts despite our understanding being that Bournemouth still have a year left on their deal with Umbro.",
      "",
      "TBC. Sunderland\nWe’ve seen a few leaks and they’re mainly terrible, but no confirmation yet for what is actually the kit. It’s hummel, so it should be good. Which is the main reason we’re remaining too sceptical to rank based on current leaks.",
      "",
      "17) Burnley\nUtter woke nonsense, we’re afraid to report. Burnley and Castore were so busy coming up with a shirt that meets the apparent current requirements to ‘taking inspiration from the local area’ that they completely forgot to take inspiration from an actual Burnley shirt.",
      "Update your phone wallpaper to celebrate our 2025/26 Home kit 🥳 pic.twitter.com/g6w7rcNGOE",
      "— Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) July 4, 2025",
      "The marketing bullsh*t manifests in a vaguely topographical pattern designed to represent the fact that East Lancashire, famously and uniquely, has some hills in it.",
      "But they’ve completely failed to put anywhere close to enough blue on here. Yes, Burnley have in the past dispensed with their traditional blue sleeves, but we don’t care for it and it will never look right.",
      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "16) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

      "And now we don’t know at all. We’re not saying this is bad, we’re saying we’re not sure whether it’s bad or brilliant, and it’s that total lack of conviction that has rattled us into the shadow realm. If we can no longer be sure about sashes on football kits, than what certainties do we have left to cling to?",
      "We don’t think we’re being dramatic when we say this feels like it might be a harbinger of absolute doom for all mankind. Especially in a year that has already featured Spurs winning a trophy and the MCC allowing members not to wear jackets in the Lord’s pavilion just because it was a bit warm.",
      "We expect confirmation that the ravens are leaving the Tower any moment.",
      "And it’s not even like City have plucked a sash from nowhere either. Sure, it’s never been on the home kit before, but they have a proud away-kit sash history that dates well back into the before times of the 1970s and whatnot.",

      "14) Brentford\nA new home shirt is an event in itself after they took the now wildly unusual step of keeping the old one for two years. It’s certainly an interesting one to mark the switch from Umbro to Joma, and while we really want to like it, it’s not quite right.",
      "Let’s start with the good. The red and white cuffs and collar are good, as are the pinstripes at the edge of the main stripes. Well done there.",

      "— Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC) July 4, 2025",
      "We’re not sold on the white sleeves, though. In our view it tilts the balance of red and white too far in favour of white, and not even the primarily red back for the name-sets can quite save that.",
      "Our big problem, though, is the ‘lace-up’ collar detail. Officially, it’s ‘inspired by our original 1925 kit lace design’ but… it’s a bit wanky isn’t it? There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",
      "Just sort of drawing a fake one on sadly reduces a shirt that could have been really good to something approaching a novelty. It’s just a little bit too close to ‘humorous T-shirt with a bow-tie drawn on it’ which is a shame.",
      "",
      "13) Tottenham\nA significant departure this for Tottenham with plenty of non-white areas here. That’s not unusual in itself; what’s unusual is that just as Spurs managers generally alternate in style and tone, so too their home kits operate on a rota switching between all-white (or nearly all-white) and more colourful.",

      "— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) June 18, 2025",
      "Yet after last year’s Kappa-coded full navy blue sleeves comes this effort. Now there’s less navy on this sleeve for sure, but it still constitutes a navy-heavy season, and with plenty of that silvery-blue-gray thrown in for good measure. That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",
      "What we can’t get away from – and no, we can’t fully explain this – is that the specific placement of the navy areas means this shirt is giving Bolton to a distracting degree.",
      "",
      "12) Liverpool\nA return to adidas for Liverpool after many years with Nike and based on the plentiful leaks out there it’s a safety-first start to the rekindled relationship, with a low-risk entirely inoffensive shirt that leans heavily on the 2006/07 classic minus the big ol’ flappy collar.",
      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards, something we expect the away and third kits to do rather more based on the leaked pics we’ve seen so far.",

      "",
      "11) Fulham\nUnofficial for now, but it follows last year’s lead on being a predominantly white effort with far less black than we’ve seen previously. Here it is once again reduced to the adidas stripes, the collar and a bit of piping.",
      "It’s absolutely adequate based on the leaks we’ve seen. While we’re always slightly reluctant to rank on leaks, we’re confident nothing new we could learn about this kit will propel it up or down this list in any significant way.",
      "",
      "10) Brighton\nNot too sure about the asymmetric collar – something Nike are keen on and seen last year on Spurs’ light blue away kit – but generally speaking it’s a bold and bright Brighton kit that we can all enjoy.",
      "One interesting quirk is that it’s almost entirely inverted from last year’s. That had white sleeves and blue cuffs, while this year it’s blue sleeves and white cuffs. Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",
      "The most exciting thing about Brighton’s kit, though, is that it takes the prestigious award for this season’s most overexcited and unnecessary made-up colour name. Football kit manufacturers rank second only to paint companies in this field, and we are beyond excited to tell you that the little turquoise flashes on the sides of this kit are not in fact just your common or garden turquoise but are in fact Hyper Turq.",

      "— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) July 1, 2025",
      "",
      "9) Everton\nVery hard to rank until we actually get to see it for real. Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",
      "pic.twitter.com/JbimZktGYA",
      "— Everton (@Everton) June 27, 2025",
      "",
      "8) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here if the widespread leaks are anything to go by, with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",
      "A source has leaked the 2025/26 Aston Villa Home Kit, It should officially release inside the next month if this is the actual design. pic.twitter.com/wtRVNHSwQe",
      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "6) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "5) Nottingham Forest\nWe’re still working from leaks here, so it’s a gamble putting this so high but the pinstripes as well as the shield surrounding the badge and the clear nods to the 92-94 kit mean this has all the hallmarks of an absolute banger.",
      "We reserve the right to alter this ranking if the actual shirt disappoints, but at this stage we’re very excited about this one.",
      "",
      "4) West Ham\nUmbro have done some fine retro work with West Ham in recent years, and it all comes together here in this shiny and powerfully early 80s effort. Even the BoyleSports logo looks like it’s from 1983.",
      "The new home kit – that’s shirt, shorts and socks – in one shot. pic.twitter.com/PdexDvPJo7",

      "The return of the full colour club crest is good after last year’s experiment with keeping it to the club’s primary colours, which we didn’t hate but have to now concede doesn’t look as good as this one does.",
      "The striped collars and cuffs are first-rate, and the flashes of blue under the arms are just enough to avoid this falling into the Burnley trap.",
      "Also, while we generally restrict our rankings here to the tops, given the amount of switching and alternate use that goes on with shorts and socks anyway, it is worth noting that West Ham have this year’s best socks, with the stripes of the collar and cuffs deployed simply but expertly.",
      "",
      "3) Wolves\nYes, we like this. That’s a pleasingly modern take on a proper old-fashioned collar, and the whole retro vibe is enhanced by a material that almost looks knitted.",
      "Again, we could be wrong because we’re only at this stage going off pictures rather than real-world information, but it does look like the lads at Sudu have got the colour right this time. Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",

      "This shirt certainly has that, and perhaps our favourite collar of the entire season’s efforts. In a world of plain round collars, United have a double-element v-neck that – and we have no idea whether this is intentional or not but to our mind it’s a bonus – brings to mind the devil’s trident from their badge.",
      "Having praised the black, though, we’re not quite sure at first glance about what seem some very shiny black adidas stripes on the shoulders and sleeves. They’re slightly off-putting – notably on the long-sleeve version.",
      "There’s also a print woven into the sleeves rather than body of the shirt, which is an unusual choice but one that works here. The last United home shirt we can recall with sleeves that differed from the main body of the shirt was 1998/99, and that seemed to work out well for everybody.",
      "The design on the sleeves is, of course, a nod to their stadium because that seems to be what everyone is doing this season. Presumably that means after one wash it will have all holes in it.",

      "Amorim is said to be the driving force behind ‘pulling the plug’ on the deal which would have seen United earn ‘significantly more than £10m’ as the platform’s largest ever payment for an ‘All or Nothing’ series after previous editions followed Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham.",
      "‘Ruben Amorim made clear he was not comfortable with the potential intrusion on the first team — while aspects of the commercial agreement and the time pressure of the upcoming season were factors, too’, the report states.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘United presented the proposal to Amorim after the end of the season and, having received his feedback, the board received a unified recommendation at its Executive Committee to drop the idea.",
      "‘The Amazon proposal would have lightened financial concerns and United’s business side, including INEOS and the club’s chief executive Omar Berrada, were supportive of it.",
      "‘Upon being informed of the potential arrangement, Amorim — who has experienced a difficult start to life at United — made clear he did not believe such a project to be appropriate or beneficial to the first team at present. He felt it would be an unwelcome distraction in an environment that has had many problems in recent years.’",
      "Amorim’s refusal comes as no surprise as he currently looks set for another hugely challenging season at the Old Trafford helm.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon remain their only additions so far this summer and having missed an ‘internal deadline’ to sign Bryen Mbeumo from Brentford, a report on Monday claims the Bees now want ‘significantly more’ than their latest £62.5m offer when it was previously thought £65m would be enough.",
      "Their struggles to sign players is only outstripped by their inability to sell them, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho all so obviously available that no club in their right mind would make an offer this early in the window in the knowledge that United will get desperate as the days tick by.",
      "The only reason to persist with Ruben Amorim after his first few months was to give him a proper pre-season. But Manchester United have failed to deliver.",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has had ‘no contact’ with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim since their falling out, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United transfer is off after Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho decided to pull the plug on the deal.",
      "Mainoo is so much more than ‘pure profit’ and the very idea of selling him is an indictment of Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "As wind-up tactics go, wearing the shirt of another club next to a yellow Ferrari is a guaranteed way to annoy fans and burn bridges with one’s employer."

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Manchester United flop Rasmus Hojlund ‘doesn’t want to leave’ the club amid interest from Inter Milan",
      "The Red Devils have so far only managed to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.5m from Cerro Porteno, and are said to currently be focused entirely on prising Bryan Mbeumo away from Brentford.",
      "They’ve seen two bids rejected for the 25-year-old, the latest of which is said to have matched the fee paid for Cunha, with the Bees holding out for £65m for the Cameroon international, who is keen on the move to Old Trafford but perhaps not as desperate as the United bosses would like.",
      "The United bosses missed their own ‘internal deadline’ to sign Bryan Mbeumo on Monday when the players returned to pre-season training, though transfer expert Fabrizio Romano claims the Brentford star is still ‘giving priority’ to the move to Old Trafford as ‘talks continue’.",
      "Romano tweeted: ‘Manchester United’s absolute focus remains on Bryan Mbeumo deal with talks set to continue this week.",
      "‘No agreement with Brentford last week but #MUFC keep working on it and Bryan also keeps giving priority to United move. Deal on.’",
      "But there have been rumours of United interest in other potential new players, with a striker thought to be high on Ruben Amorim’s wish list after Hojlund’s awful return in 2024/2025.",
      "The £64m man managed just ten goals and four assists in 54 appearances for the Red Devils, prompting the club to listen to offers for the striker this summer, with Inter Milan most interested in signing him.",
      "Romano hasn’t ruled out his transfer, but claims it would require United to push for his exit as Hojlund ‘doesn’t want to leave’.",
      "Romano tweeted: ‘Rasmus Højlund doesn’t want to leave Manchester United this summer, his desire is to stay. The only possibility for sale is in case United decide to advance in talks and proceed with his exit. Inter, keen for weeks but deal now in stand-by.’",
      "United have reportedly held talks with Aston Villa over a possible move for Ollie Watkins, though aren’t thought to be willing to pay their £60m asking price, while it was claimed over the weekend that the Red Devils were ‘making a shock move to sign free agent’ Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "The striker has left Goodison Park on a free transfer and the report claimed Amorim ‘wants to snap up Calvert-Lewin as Red Devils chiefs juggle their finances and try to build a new forward line’.",
      "But GIVEMESPORT claim that move is off before it ever really got going as ‘influential figures stopped short of engaging in prolonged discussions due to identifying his injury record as a major red flag when going in search of fresh firepower’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Manchester United have not held talks over the terms Calvert-Lewin is seeking despite being long-term admirers, GMS sources have learned, and they are unlikely to up the ante while there are other targets on the market even though Amorim has been open-minded about securing a goal-getter with a proven Premier League track record.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to ‘turn to’ a new striker target, but this potential deal hinges on one ‘pivotal’ factor.",
      "Man Utd will look to sell Joshua Zirkzee this summer if their attempts to offload Rasmus Hojlund continue to remain stale, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘politely declined’ the chance to sign a striker who scored just three goals last season, as his club attempted to secure a swap deal for Rasmus ...",
      "Ruben Amorim has chosen between Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee if Man Utd must sell one. He is also targeting a midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been informed that they can sign Liverpool and Chelsea target Hugo Ekitike in a ‘flexible deal’ as they look to reduce his fee.",
      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund could be on the move in the transfer window and another Serie A club has ’emerged’ as an potential destination, according to reports in Italy."

      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd with Amorim’s side bagging just 44 goals in 38 matches last term.",
      "That has left Man Utd looking to improve their attack in the opening couple of months of the transfer window with Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha signing from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "Bids have also been lodged for Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, although nothing has been agreed, while there is rumoured interest in former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin on a free transfer.",

      "Aghahowa told Africa Foot: “While Everton and Al-Ahli’s interest is obvious, Ndidi hopes to join Manchester United. He wants to take a step up by signing for a big club like Manchester United.",
      "“It would be an excellent move for someone I consider one of the best African central midfielders of recent years. He’s powerful, capable of pressing, winning back balls, and creating space with his long diagonal runs.”",
      "A report in the UK insisted that Ndidi wanted to leave Leicester this summer with Man Utd and Everton interested in the midfielder, who has a £9m release clause.",

      "Aghahowa added: “Wilfred is the player the Red Devils need in midfield. He’s surprisingly generous and capable of repeating efforts and covering a lot of space. He would be a considerable asset to the Manchester club if the transfer were to go through.”",
      "Former Man Utd chief scout Mick Brown recently insisted that there will be a lot of competition for Ndidi’s signature because of his low release clause.",

      "Arsenal are closing in on the signing of Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres. Will he be more Islam Slimani or Bruno Fernandes? We’ve ranked the biggest Premier League signings from the Portuguese top flight.",
      "To avoid a colossal list with every single Liga Portugal signing, we made the cut-off point 20million euros on Transfermarkt, and anyone who turned out to have cost less than £15million after a quick Google search was ditched. That conveniently left us with 30 names, which was pleasing…",
      "30) Fabio Silva (Porto to Wolves, £35.6m)\nWhat a very expensive mistake. Signing Football Manager wonderkids isn’t always a great idea. And yes, he’s still technically a Wolves player.",
      "",
      "29) Lazar Markovic (Benfica to Liverpool, £20m)\nLiverpool were supposed to be signing a wonderkid, but Markovic was anything but; he’s now 31 and without a club after leaving FC Baniyas in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "",
      "28) Adrien Silva (Sporting to Leicester, £22m)\nLeicester famously missed the deadline to sign Silva in the 2017 summer transfer window by 14 seconds.",
      "He never scored for the Foxes in 21 matches, left for AS Monaco after three years, and didn’t score in 40 matches for the French club. Leicester should have taken that 14-second failure as a sign.",
      "",
      "27) Giannelli Imbula (Porto to Stoke, £18.3m)\nImbula is best remembered for tweeting things like ‘New season how many goals for Imbula’ or simply posting photos of himself playing for Stoke with his name as the caption. He gave Victor Wanyama and Wayne Rooney a run for their money on Twitter.",
      "On the pitch, he couldn’t get anywhere near the dizzy heights of Wanyama. He’s been without a club since February 2024 and as far as we’re aware, Imbula hasn’t yet called time on his career. Despite joining the Potters as one of the most exciting midfielders in Europe, he only played 28 times, scoring twice.",
      "",
      "26) Islam Slimani (Sporting to Leicester, £29.7m)\nSlimani scored 61 goals in 123 games for Sporting – an impressive record but not so fantastic that Arsenal fans should fear Viktor Gyokeres will be just as poor in the Premier League.",
      "In my head, he was awful, but seven goals in 23 Premier League games in 2016/17 says otherwise. That’s hardly an outstanding return, but the fact he didn’t put up numbers to match Niclas Fullkrug in 2024/25 is surprising.",
      "",
      "25) Eliaquim Mangala (Porto to Manchester City, £32m at least)\nAnother iconic Twitter moment is when an Everton fan said this to Mangala during his time on loan: ‘seriously mate no joking please just don’t play again prem not suited to u pal your crap no hard feelings just not worked out @ Mangala’.",
      "Yeah…he wasn’t great. For City or Everton. He’s another one currently a free agent.",
      "",
      "24) Darwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64.2m plus £21.2m in add-ons)\nIt’s just not worked out for poor Darwin at Anfield. The word ‘raw’ has been associated with him since day one, and at 26 years of age, you don’t want to be tagged as ‘raw’. He will almost certainly leave Liverpool this summer after scoring seven goals in 47 matches last season.",
      "MORE: Benfica are the greatest salesmen in football; even Brighton cannot touch them",
      "",
      "23) Nico Gonzalez (Porto to Manchester City, £50m)\nThere’s talk of Nico leaving City already, having only joined for a huge fee in January. If that happens, his ranking will tank.",
      "",
      "22) Fabio Vieira (Porto to Arsenal, £34.2m)\nVieira’s poor physical attributes have caused him to struggle in England. He spent last season on loan back at Porto and it’s anyone’s guess what happens now. Eberechi Eze joining would surely mean the end for him at the Emirates.",
      "",
      "21) Marcos Rojo (Sporting to Manchester United, £16m)\nRojo was quite entertaining, but only because he was a classic, chaotic Argentine. Like a taller, more unhinged, less talented Lisandro Martinez.",
      "",
      "20) Javi Garcia (Benfica to Manchester City, £15.8m)\nTwo-cap Spanish midfielder Garcia joined from Benfica for a respectable fee as Roberto Mancini sought more physicality in his title-winning midfield. He played 76 times for the Cityzens and was a real ‘does a job’ player.",
      "",
      "19) Victor Lindelof (Benfica to Manchester United, £30.7m plus £8.8m in add-ons)\nThe Swedish centre-back was simply ‘meh’ for United, which is not exactly what you want for close to £40million.",
      "",
      "18) Jose Bosingwa (Porto to Chelsea, £16.2m)\nIt’s hard to see Bosingwa’s name without thinking of his studded assault on Yossi Benayoun that didn’t even result in a yellow card. That, and the fact he had a monobrow.",
      "",
      "17) Anderson (Porto to Manchester United, £20m)\nAfter his first season at Old Trafford, Anderson won the 2008 Golden Boy award. He’s a weird one, really. It’s obvious that he didn’t reach the heights expected, but he wasn’t a bad player. Sitting near the middle here feels right.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Nunes (Sporting to Wolves, £38m plus £4.2m in add-ons)\nWolves winning the race to sign highly-rated young midfielder Nunes wasn’t overly surprising given their Portuguese ties through Jorge Mendes, but it was still a coup.",
      "He wasn’t as good as expected but they still sold him for a profit to Man City.",
      "",
      "15) Diogo Dalot (Porto to Manchester United, £19m)\nOverall, this has been a pretty decent signing, and Dalot sitting middle of the road is a good indication that Liga Portugal signings have been pretty successful in Our League.",
      "",
      "14) Evanilson (Porto to Bournemouth, £31m plus £8.5m in add-ons)\nReplacing Dominic Solanke was always going to be tricky, but Bournemouth nailed it with Evanilson. He’s very different, but just as effective up front. The Cherries will hope to repeat the trick when replacing Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "",
      "13) Raul Jimenez (Benfica to Wolves, £30m)\nJimenez’s horrific skull fracture understandably hindered the second half of his Wolves career. His form was never the same, but overall, he was a very good signing.",
      "",
      "12) Ricardo Pereira (Porto to Leicester, £17.5m plus £4.3m in add-ons)\nPereira hasn’t been the same since suffering an ACL injury in March 2019. He’s become very injury-prone and his performances have understandably declined. Before that, though, he was one of the best right-backs in the Premier League. And he wasn’t too expensive.",
      "",
      "11) Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThe huge transfer fee for Fernandez makes him hard to rank, but there’s no doubt he has improved a lot under Enzo Maresca. In truth, he was never rubbish for Chelsea. He barely put a foot wrong, but just didn’t look like a £100m+ midfielder. He still doesn’t – but certainly looks a lot closer to one than before.",
      "MORE: Virgil van Dijk tops ranking of all 17 £70m-plus Premier League signings",
      "",
      "10) Pedro Porro (Sporting to Tottenham, £39.7m)\nSpurs nailed it with this one, even if the signing felt confusing for a while. It felt like Porro was signed as Antonio Conte’s perfect right-wing-back, yet everyone, Conte included, knew he was never going to last in north London.",
      "And then when Ange Postecoglou came in, Porro’s place in the team was uncertain. It quickly became clear that he’s an elite right-back and perfectly fine in a back four.",
      "",
      "9) Ramires (Benfica to Chelsea, £18.2m)\nBenfica must love it when they hear a knock at the door and it’s Chelsea stood there, putting their index fingers together and cutely saying, ‘It’s me again’.",
      "This was a low fee in comparison to Fernandez and friends, but still hugely successful. Best remembered for that chip against Barcelona, Ramires helped the Blues win the Champions League in 2012. He was a brilliantly consistent presence in the midfield with his ridiculous pace and engine.",
      "",
      "8) David Luiz (Benfica to Chelsea, £21.3m)\nChelsea have quite the history when it comes to signing talents from the Portuguese top flight. Luiz’s first spell at Stamford Bridge was between January 2011 and July 2014, when he joined Paris Saint-Germain for over £40m.",
      "Luiz was unpredictable, but that was kind of the charm with him. When PSG paid that huge fee, a lot of people were pretty surprised. Years later, I’m still not sure if he was brilliant or s**t.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Porto to Liverpool, £37m plus £12m in add-ons)\nCurrently wanted by Barcelona and Bayern Munich, the Reds are reluctant to sell Diaz, even if he is very purply patchy, 28 years old, out of contract in two years, and could fetch a significant transfer fee.",
      "While the Colombian has it in him to score once in 15 matches, he also has it in him to score 15 goals in as many games. Don’t turn your nose up at seven assists and 13 goals in a title-winning campaign.",
      "",
      "6) Joao Palhinha (Sporting to Fulham, £20m)\nThe price varies online, but what is for certain is that Palhinha was a huge success at Craven Cottage. And Fulham flipped him to Bayern Munich for a huge profit after two very productive years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson (Benfica to Manchester City, £34.7m)\nAfter sacking off Joe Hart, there were some major goalkeeper teething issues for Pep Guardiola, with Claudio Bravo coming in and performing very unconvincingly.",
      "Guardiola wanted a world-class ball-playing goalkeeper and he signed one in Ederson for a modest fee. He’s been well worth the money, even if errors have been creeping into his game more and more as the years pass by.",
      "",
      "4) Ricardo Carvalho (Porto to Chelsea, £19.85m)\nWhen Jose Mourinho joined Chelsea from Champions League winners Porto in 2004, a few players followed, including Paulo Ferreira and Carvalho.",
      "After playing every minute in the Portuguese club’s Champions League-winning campaign, Carvalho casually helped the Blues romp to a Premier League title after Arsenal went an entire campaign unbeaten, and helped them to a monstrous defensive record of only 15 goals conceded across the 38-game season. If a Premier League record is ageing like a fine wine, it’s that one.",
      "",
      "3) Nemanja Matic (Benfica to Chelsea, £21m)\nChelsea first signed Matic from Slovakian outfit MFK Kosice for pennies in 2009, selling him to Benfica for around £3m two years later. It took the Blues little time to realise they’d messed up and re-signed the Serbian midfielder for big money two-and-a-half years later.",
      "Matic was only 25 when he returned to Stamford Bridge and he quickly became an integral player in Jose Mourinho’s team, which convincingly won the Premier League title in 2014/15.",
      "He was a rock in midfield and scored the occasional banger as well, which is always a nice extra for your ball-winning midfielder to have.\nThere wasn’t much to separate Matic and Carvalho, so the fact the former was sold to Manchester United for around £40m, while the latter only left for around £7m, gives the midfielder the edge.",
      "",
      "2) Bruno Fernandes (Sporting to Manchester United, £47m plus £20.7m in add-ons)\nIt would take some doing to top Fernandes to United, but that’s exactly what’s happened.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker has been an incredible player for United and is comfortably their best signing since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "",
      "1) Ruben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £62m plus £3m in add-ons)\nDias quickly became a huge player in City’s defence when he arrived in 2020 and was instrumental in multiple title wins. He walked into the team and instantly became a leader, helping his new club reach the Champions League final and win the Premier League title by 12 points.",
      "He was named FWA Footballer of the Year, Manchester City Player of the Year, Premier League Player of the Season and the UEFA Champions League Defender of the Season in 2021 after an outstanding debut season. He remains a leading Premier League centre-back four years on.",

      "Beyond that, deadlines have been set and passed to sign Bryan Mbeumo, with either possible outcome making Manchester United look varying degrees of foolish: if they do not set an overdue precedent by walking away from a deal they feel has been inflated, they must instead meet demands which were never going to be lowered.",
      "Omar Berrada pledged last month to “do our best to do more signings quickly” but the immediate backtrack – “sometimes when you’re not quick it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money” – was revealing; Manchester United almost always find the unfathomable third option of taking too long to wrap up signings which become too expensive.",
      "The argument to remain patient with Amorim hinged on him needing a pre-season, and the Portuguese having time and space to work on integrating the players he wants into his fabled system. It was the only reason to persevere with an idea which turned out to be atrocious in practice last season.",
      "That argument collapses in on itself the longer he is given the same squad he has already failed spectacularly with, unless the belief is that Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof were the bad apples causing everything else to rot.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED TRANSFER COVERAGE\n👉 Man Utd set for £30m Greenwood windfall after £60m bid as second signing ‘could be finalised by Monday’\n👉 Man Utd ‘want’ Chelsea star with target to be ‘released’ on one condition; transfer to ‘move quickly’",
      "A few months of acclimatisation might do wonders for Patrick Dorgu’s confidence and capability levels. Diego Leon could hit the ground running as a teenager playing and living outside of Paraguay for the first time in his life. There may happen to be some ludicrously talented wing-backs, centre-forwards, goalkeepers and holding midfielders in the Academy waiting to emerge.",
      "But Manchester United cannot afford much in their current state, let alone relying on possibilities, suppositions and estimations.",
      "They need guarantees and certainties, absolutes and assurances. That is why the return of an old transfer policy made complete sense in early June but the longer the current situation drags into July, the more impeded Amorim’s start – already far further back than first anticipated – will be.",
      "Cunha alone cannot hope to galvanise and refresh this group with his mere presence. The spectres of Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony still linger. The sense that Manchester United are entirely incapable of negotiating more than one transfer at a time persists.",
      "Making Mbeumo a priority target is one thing but other opportunities are going unexplored. The instinct might be to raise an eyebrow at the reported pursuit of Dominic Calvert-Lewin but a free agent with substantial experience and no settling-in period in a position Manchester United must reinforce at least makes sense without being particularly inspiring.",
      "Yet not every signing needs to come with a statement, not every purchase must send a message. Sensible squad building requires far more cost-effective deals than it does extravagant ones, even if they cannot feed the ego quite as emphatically.",
      "And that ego will almost certainly need to take a hit over the valuation of the players they openly wish and need to sell before buying. As Berrada put it, there is a need to “balance the books”.",
      "But he also said “we’ve put ourselves in the best position possible by doing everything that we’ve had this year around cost-cutting,” and the only way to make such a risible defence of widespread redundancies and ludicrous cutbacks more shameful is to squander that apparent place of strength.",
      "“I’m confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we’ve gone into,” he added, and they might well do. But the point was only ever to give Amorim a stronger team to work with to maximise his “secret” weapon of pre-season.",
      "Manchester United have failed on that count already. Their first friendly is in 12 days before they fly out to the United States for a tournament which bleeds into August. Every minute ticking away with neither a signing nor a sale feels like part of the countdown to Amorim’s demise rather than the start of his great rebuild.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: ‘Bryan Mbeumo deal done’ as Ruben Amorim role misunderstood",

      "Casemiro was a dead-man walking for over a year at Old Trafford with United not just opening doors but baking pies to entice buyers for the Brazilian, but after an uptick in his displays at the end of the season led to an international recall he now wants to see out his contract in the hope of heading to the 2026 World Cup.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
