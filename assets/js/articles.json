      "The January transfer window is now under four weeks away with plenty of teams plotting their moves ahead of the New Year.",
      "Some teams are more settled, the likes of Arsenal, whilst others may look to inject some fresh energy mid-season. Liverpool are being tipped to consider reinforcements, especially in defence after missing out on Marc Guehi in the summer. Ibrahima Konate's future also remains unclear.",
      "Mohamed Salah's stock has also fallen - he was on the bench once again on Wednesday night - and there continues to be talk of him leaving Anfield.",
      "The Reds, Tottenham and Manchester City are among the clubs tracking Bournemouth ace Antoine Semenyo, who has a £65million release clause that comes live in 2026. He's been a huge success this term with the Cherries facing a fight to retain him.",
      "Manchester United want a new midfielder and some wing-backs, but would prefer to wait until the summer. Should players become available though they may well act.",
      "Conor Gallagher admits he wants more game time at Atletico Madrid, but isn't looking to leave the club.",
      "\"I'm happy, but obviously I want to play as much as possible,\" the England international said.",
      "\"Every footballer would like to be on the pitch for 90 minutes every single game. Obviously, I'm at a world-class club and there's a lot of amazing players. The most important thing is how the team plays and the results we get. At the moment, it's going really well for us.\"",
      "Darwin Nunez is already looking for a way out of Al Hilal - despite only arriving in Saudi Arabia six months ago. The former Liverpool striker is understood to be unsettled and wants to move on, reports Ole.",
      "His representatives have offered him to Argentine giants River Plate, which would grant the striker a route back to South America.",
      "Man United scouts were in Piraeus last week to watch Olympiacos midfielder Christos Mouzakitis against Real Madrid.",
      "The 18-year-old is an exciting talent and the Corfu-born player is already said to have left Los Blancos weighing up a £25m offer.",

      "Bahoya, a France Under-21 player, joined Frankfurt from Angers in 2024. The 20-year-old, who is under contract until 2029, has two Bundesliga goals so far this season.",
      "Saudi clubs could return for Mohamed Salah in 2026, according to talkSPORT.",
      "Al Hilal have reportedly been joined by Al Qadsiah in pursuit of the Liverpool and Egypt star, who is enduring a difficult time at Anfield.",

      "West Ham, on the other hand, are looking to bounce back from a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday. Prior to this, the Hammers had enjoyed a three-match unbeaten streak, winning against Newcastle United and Burnley before the international break and then drawing 2-2 with Bournemouth.",
      "Despite West Ham's recent uptick in form, United will be anticipating a win if they hope to secure a spot in the Champions League by season's end.",
      "However, United will have to face the Hammers without Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire, who have been ruled out by Amorim. Both Sesko and Maguire have missed the last two games due to injuries sustained in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham prior to the November international break.",
      "Amorim also hinted that there may be two additional unnamed players who are doubtful for the match against West Ham.",
      "The United head coach did, however, confirm that Matheus Cunha is available for selection after being sidelined for the previous two fixtures, alongside Sesko and Maguire.",
      "Speaking ahead of the West Ham clash, Amorim revealed: \"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we're going to approach it, let's see if they can play. The rest of the squad is good.",

And below is a look at Liverpool’s next five fixtures in the Premier League compared to their rivals as they look to move back into contention for the European places after a very challenging spell.",

      "Ruben Amorim’s side found themselves behind at the break in south London following Jean-Philippe Mateta’s penalty, but responded after the interval. Goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount ensured that United bounced back from last week’s home defeat by Everton.",
      "Manchester United are confident of keeping academy starlet JJ Gabriel following Barcelona’s interest in the teenager. The 15-year-old came to wider attention following a hat-trick for United’s U18 side at the weekend and has scored 10 in as many games so far this term.",
      "Barcelona have previously invited Gabriel and his family to the Camp Nou, with the United prospect also meeting first team players and touring the club’s facilities. However, United are determined to fend off Barcelona’s long-standing interest in the England U16 international.",
      "United boss Amorim, who has already involved Gabriel in training, has spoken about the youngster: “Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media. You could see the U21s had a game and we had less players and tried to pick players for training that have talent.",
      "“Not just for me to see for tomorrow but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace. If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Wes Brown has urged head coach Ruben Amorim to add a left wing-back to his squad in January. Patrick Dorgu joined the club in the last winter window as wing-back cover on both flanks, but Amorim appears less settled on the left than in some other positions.",
      "Dorgu, who joined from Lecce in Amorim's first window in charge, has struggled to replicate his international form at club level. United's boss has urged the Dane to play with less anxiety, and Brown thinks the answer for now could be to add a specialist in the position.",
      "\"I’m probably going to have to go with… and I’m not sure if Luke Shaw can do it… a left wing-back,\" Brown told the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast when asked about the transfer United need to prioritise. \"But I reckon we’ll see Luke Shaw there in the upcoming games.",
      "\"You want to have that [energy] at wing-back. Amad Diallo can do it. He’s going to lose a few at the back-post, I suppose, every now and again, but you can see the difference in age.",
      "\"I just feel with Manchester United at the moment, a lot of our good possession and where we’re strong is on the right-hand side. Our left probably isn’t as strong and it would be nice to see that so United can both ways. Everybody knows Bryan Mbeumo and Amad, when they get on the ball, it’s dangerous. It’s not exactly the same on that left-hand side.\"",
      "England international Shaw struggled with injuries last season but has put together a run of games under Amorim this term. Those outings have mostly come as one of three centre-backs, though, rather than in the physically demanding left-back role.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is also a left-sided specialist, but the Dutchman appears to have no Old Trafford future despite failing to seal a summer move away. The former Feyenoord star has been an unused sub three times this season without making it onto the pitch, and is out of contract in June.",
      "United take on West Ham on Thursday, and a win would further boost their hopes of European qualification. Amorim confirmed Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire will miss the game through injury, but Matheus Cunha is ready to return.",
      "\"We have two doubts for the game,\" Amorim added in his Wednesday press conference.. \"I will not tell you today because we will change the way we are going to approach [the game]. Let's see if they can play tomorrow.\"",

      "Manchester United are targeting a player who once left Joshua Kimmich wowed. United spent big in the summer on attacking reinforcements but are set to turn their attentions to defence and midfield in the next two windows.",
      "Ruben Amorim's project at United is still a work in progress, with the side hopeful of showing signs that they are moving in the right direction under the head coach. The 40-year-old has been in charge for just over one year now, taking over from Erik ten Hag.",
      "His arrival came with an understanding that it would take some time for his 3-4-3 system to work, but patience has worn thin among some of the fanbase at times. A Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and a lack of European football for this season has only ramped up the pressure on Amorim so far.",
      "With that in mind, and the focus on some improvements in the near future, United are looking towards the transfer market for the next possible signings who could help. There will be a keen sense of trying to find value, as well as those who can make something of an immediate impact.",
      "According to BILD, one of the players on the club's radar is Nathaniel Brown, a left-back from Eintracht Frankfurt. The 22-year-old could be viewed as a possible recruit for the left wing-back role that is in place in Amorim's system, which hasn't quite been nailed down by any player yet.",
      "Brown, 22, has been a regular for Frankfurt since he signed for the club last season, having had a knack for scoring and assisting a goal or two. There is an expectation that Brown will leave Eintracht Frankfurt in the near future, with the club said to be welcoming offers and ready to cash in.",
      "However, a fee in the region of £57m could be demanded, while a move in the summer seems more likely than the January transfer window, given the player's World Cup hopes.",
      "Arsenal and Real Madrid are also believed to be in the mix for the defender, who have all been monitoring him in recent months. The German international has received plenty of praise in recent weeks for his performances, including some kind words from Joshua Kimmich.",
      "Despite being on the end of a 3-0 defeat to Bayern Munich, Brown defended well when coming up against Michael Olise, which led to some praise. Kimmich said after the game: \"He did well, especially because he played against Michael [Olise].",
      "\"I know from my own experience how difficult that is, but I already had him [Brown] on my radar beforehand.\" Brown will now have one eye on making the Germany squad for the 2026 World Cup, with an opportunity up for grabs.",
      "It's a position for United that could do with some more consistency, with Amorim needing specific traits from his wing-backs in the system. The head coach has often switched between using Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot on the left, with some uncertainty over the position.",
      "Amorim was particularly frank about the struggles Dorgu has faced so far, as he recently said: \"When I see them training they are doing so much better than in games.",
      "\"Then Patrick, when I see him playing for the national team, he’s scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was completely different to the decision[s] he’s making in our team. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel it, the anxiety.”",
      "The potential interest in a player like Brown could indicate just how unsure Amorim is of his current wing-back options at his disposal, particularly on the left. It's unclear whether the defender would be open to such a move, but it indicates the type of market that United are operating in.",
      "The club are keen on finding value, adding in the young stars who can add quality with room to grow for the future and perform beyond their transfer fee.",

      "He was United's first-ever black goalscorer and was also included in Sir Alex Ferguson's first-ever team for the defeat at Oxford United in November 1986. However, it was claimed on Wednesday that he had passed away.",
      "Moses and his wife are claimed to be living in Zakynthos, a Greek island in the Ionian Sea. The 65-year-old former midfielder also coached at Doxa Pigadakion for a short spell a couple of years ago.",
      "And in a statement on Wednesday, the Greek outfit claimed it was his wife who informed them of Moses' death. But journalist Andy Mitten has revealed that Moses is alive and well.",
      "Taking to social media platform X, he wrote: \"Understand social media rumours of Remi Moses dying are not true. He's alive and well. But had he looked on social media, he'd have seen how many people absolutely loved him as a player.\"",
      "Replying to Mitten's post, Reece Blakeley, one of Moses' children, confirmed: \"I have just spoken with my brothers (his sons). Can confirm the legend is still alive and well.\" While a United spokesperson said: \"Remi's family have confirmed to us that the rumours of his passing are entirely false. They are baffled about their origins, and report him to be healthy and in good spirits.\"",
      "Moses made 199 appearances for United, and earlier today, a statement from Doxa Pigadakion even went as far as revealing when his funeral would take place. The statement read: \"Our club had the honour, for a short time, to collaborate in sports with Manchester United footballer, Remi Moses, when in the 2020/2021 season, he was the coach of our women's team.",

      "\"Remi, for several years now, has been a permanent resident of Zakynthos. With our club, and with its people, he has always had communication and a two-way sporting respect.",
      "\"These feelings led his wife to contact us immediately yesterday Tuesday morning, to inform us that Remi is no longer with us, and to ask for some small help.",

      "Another star who Amorim has a decision to make over is central defender Leny Yoro. The Frenchman has endured a difficult few weeks but Amorim has backed the defender to overcome his issues.",
      "He said: “It’s really important. I also spoke with him because he thinks too much, he makes a mistake and then he struggles. He wants to do everything so well. He’s growing, with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy.",
      "“He cannot show that to the people the way he came to the bench, he knows that. It shows he cares, he knows it wasn’t his best game.”",

      "Barcelona are stepping up efforts to sign Manchester United teenager JJ Gabriel. The 15-year-old sensation is among the most talked-about talent in the Red Devils' academy - having scored 10 goals in 10 matches for the Under-18s this term.",
      "However, according to The Sun, Barcelona are trying to prise Gabriel away from United and take him to their famous La Masia youth system. It's added that United director of football Jason Wilcox was key in convincing Gabriel to remain at he club this season and next campaign.",
      "Sources from the Red Devils feel the involvement of Wilcox showed Gabriel's family how much they value the attacking midfielder, and believe he could have a huge future at Old Trafford. There is confidence that the 2010-born starlet will stay at United for the long haul, rebuffing interest from Barcelona.",
      "Last week, United's head coach Ruben Amorim was said to have held a separate meeting with Gabriel and his camp. It came after the teenage sensation was pictured in first-team training with the rest of the United squad.",
      "Gabriel was promoted to train with the senior players last Thursday as the Under-21s had a behind-closed-doors game on Friday and went up against Anderlecht in the Premier League International Cup on Tuesday night.",
      "In an Instagram post back in October, Gabriel confirmed that he had trained with the first-team and Amorim was asked about his inclusion. \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy, and everyone paid attention on social media,\" the Portuguese said at the time.",
      "\"You could see the U21s had a game and we had less players and tried to pick players for training that have talent. Not just for me to see for tomorrow, but also for them to feel what it means to be in the first-team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it's important, not just for JJ, but for everyone.\"",
      "Gabriel is the latest United star Barcelona are trying to snap-up, with the Catalan giants hoping to bring Marcus Rashford back on a permanent deal next summer. The 28-year-old forward has enjoyed a stellar start to his loan spell at Barca, scoring six times and adding nine assists in 19 appearances.",
      "He was named on the subs bench for Tuesday's 3-1 win against Atletico Madrid but made a vital contribution as a second-half substitute to help his side to a crucial three points. Speaking post-match, Rashford sent a message to the Barca fans. \"Important win and great team performance,\" Rashford posted on Instagram.",
      "Barcelona have the option to make his transfer permanent at the end of the season for a fee of £26million. There was a chance for Rashford to join Aston Villa this summer - after an impressive loan stint in the second half of the 2024/25 season - but Villa chose not to exercise their £40m option.",
      "Rashford will have the chance to add to his goals and assist tally for Barcelona when they take on Real Betis in La Liga this weekend. It will be the first time Rashford goes up against his former United teammate Antony since both players opted to leave the Red Devils on loan in January.",

      "Rashford started the match on the sidelines due to the recent return of Raphinha on the left wing, but he was brought into the fray in the 67th minute with Barca leading 2-1 and Diego Simeone's side seeking an equaliser.",
      "His introduction, along with Ferran Torres, added some spark to Hansi Flick's attack, and it was the Spanish substitute who scored the third and final goal of the match in the 96th minute.",
      "Despite this being the fourth consecutive match in all competitions where the England star hasn't scored or assisted, his contribution on Tuesday was positively received, as noted by sections of the Spanish media.",
      "Sport lauded his immediate impact and the problems he posed for the Atletico defence during his 24-minute stint on the pitch. They described his performance as \"stinging\" and summarised: \"He came on and quickly began causing problems for Atlético from the left wing. He came close to scoring and provided a much-needed boost for Barca in the final minutes.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo echoed these sentiments, praising his counter-attacking abilities thanks to his impressive speed, which nearly saw him add to his tally of two league goals this season.",
      "The publication stated: \"He breaks free on the counter-attack after a pass from Casado and shoots after a cutback, but Oblak deflects it with his foot. Great play by the Englishman.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Despite Rashford's impressive showings for Barcelona, questions have arisen over whether his spell in Spain will extend beyond his season-long loan. When he joined Barca this past summer, the club secured an option to make the Englishman's move permanent for £26million.",
      "He's become a consistent performer with six goals and nine assists in his opening 19 appearances across all competitions. However, according to Spanish publication Sport, concerns persist within the club about the 28-year-old's substantial wages, despite his contributions.",
      "Rashford accepted a 25% wage reduction to join the Catalan giants, with his weekly earnings now standing at £240k, which Barca are paying in full. The England international's tactical adjustment is also reportedly causing unease, with Rashford said to be contributing little in terms of high pressing, a fundamental characteristic of any Hansi Flick side.",
      "The report further suggests that the club's future transfer strategy will focus on finding backup for Raphinha, with United hoping a verdict on Rashford's uncertain future arrives soon.",
      "If the Manchester-born winger returns to Old Trafford next summer, he may be loaned out for a third successive season or sold, as Ruben Amorim doesn't view him as part of his long-term vision for the club.",

      "Manchester United's 2025 Christmas party has reportedly been given the go-ahead after Sir Jim Ratcliffe cancelled last year's. The United hierarchy stopped any festive cheer 12 months ago following a round of cuts.",
      "Last year, the party was cancelled after it was deemed inappropriate to celebrate following a first round of redundancies that resulted in 250 jobs being axed. The scrapped celebration saved the club more than £100,000, with the annual staff bonus of £100 being replaced with a £40 voucher from M&S.",
      "Now, the Daily Mail have reported that staff members will get the opportunity to celebrate Christmas this year, with chief executive Omar Berrada deciding to invite all staff members to the event. It will be held in one of the larger suites at Old Trafford, with food and musical entertainment provided for employees.",
      "The decision comes after United's hierarchy ran the changes following Ineos' minority takeover. A further 200 redundancies, which reduced the workforce from 1,150 to 700, saved the club millions.",
      "\"If we hadn't have implemented the cost programmes and restructuring that we have done over the last 12 months. So we have to deal with all those things, and there's only so many things you can deal with at once.",
      "\"We have a new management team, we have to deal with the financial restructure, then we have to move on to the squad, data analysis, and moving forward.",
      "\"But we are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans. But I am not actually surprised where we are in the league because Ruben's only got a certain size of squad he can deal with, and quite a number of those players are injured or not available to him.\"",
      "He added: \"The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things [widespread cuts and restructuring].",
      "\"Ultimately, if you look at running the club the size of Manchester United with an income of about £650m you spend a part of that £650m on operating the club and part of it on the squad.",
      "\"Where do you want to spend the money? Do you want to spend it on operating the club, or do you want to spend it on the squad? Because if you spend it on the squad you get better results.",
      "\"And at the end of the day what's Manchester United here for if it's not to win trophies and silverware. What we want to do is invest in the best players in the world if we can, rather than spend it on, I'm afraid, free lunches.\"",

      "First, Obi hasn't played a single minute of senior action for United during the 2025/26 season after Amorim decided to leave him in the Under-21s for this campaign. He has since shone, netting five times in 13 matches.",
      "The 18-year-old, who made eight first-team appearances for the Red Devils last term, is continually improving and there are whispers the next step is to loan him out in the January transfer window.",
      "Indeed, The Sun reports that United are open to loaning Obi out next month to help further his development by gaining more first-team minutes in the EFL or National League.",
      "Heaven, 19, is another player United are aiming to loan out. The youngster made a name for himself when he was thrust into the limelight by Amorim last season, particularly impressing against his former club Arsenal.",
      "However, like Obi, Heaven has found regular first-team game-time hard to come by this term. He has clocked up just 28 minutes in the Premier League, coming on as a second-half substitute against Fulham and Brighton.",
      "And with Lisandro Martinez's return from injury, Heaven has been demoted to being third-choice left centre back, behind the Argentine World Cup winner and England international Luke Shaw.",
      "Heaven's spot on the bench could also be in jeopardy when Harry Maguire returns to fitness in the coming weeks. Heaven recently had a stint with the U21s against Solihull Moors in the National League Cup.",

      "Despite being included in their senior matchday squad four times, Leon's playing time has been with the U21s this season. He netted his first goal for Travis Binnion's side in a 4-1 victory over Tottenham in October.",
      "Goalkeeper Radek Vitek has thrived since his loan move to Championship team Bristol City in the summer, while full-back Harry Amass has impressed with Sheffield Wednesday. Both Vitek and Amass appear ready to step up to United's first-team squad next summer.",

      "Ethan Wheatley, a 19-year-old forward for England U20s, has scored three goals and provided two assists in 17 games for League One outfit Northampton Town. Meanwhile, midfielders Ethan Ennis and Dan Gore have seen plenty of action at Fleetwood Town and Rotherham United, respectively.",

      "In that time, he won the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup having played under legendary former boss Sir Alex Ferguson. But Parker has been willing to part with a number of items from across his playing career.",
      "As per The Sun, the former defender decided to auction off a miniature silver Premier League trophy which was given to winners during the 1992/93 season instead of medals. The trophy reportedly fetched £27,280 when up for auction.",
      "Other highlights included Parker’s medals from United’s 1993/94 Premier League triumph, as well as their FA Cup win vs Chelsea the same year. Each of the medals went for £16,120.",
      "Parker’s League Cup winners medal fetched £5,700, while a further Charity Shield plaque was sold for £1,736. Away from items from his club career, Parker also decided to bid farewell to a host of mementos from his international career.",
      "The former right-back sold off each of the 19 England caps that he had earned. Each of those fetched £3,720, except for the cap that Parker won when he played for the Three Lions’ in their defeat to West Germany in the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy - that cap instead earning £8,060.",
      "A spokesman for auctioneers Budds said: “The main reason for selling is that he is quite friendly with Viv Anderson and some of the other players who have sold their collections.",
      "“With the market so strong for Manchester United mementos at the moment he wants to maximise their value and give the proceeds to his family.”",
      "Speaking about his career with Man United earlier this year, Parker said: “Everything I wanted as a kid was to play for the biggest club I could. I always said, aim as high as you can. If you fail, you can always go down, but start at the top if you can.",

      "\"I was never aware of any interest from United and I'm happy with how things worked out. I'm enjoying my football and we're progressing well as a team. I never felt as if I had a point to prove really except maybe to myself and to Liverpool Football Club in terms of improving as a player.\"",
      "But Rodgers was left furious with the Scotsman's comments. He said: \"I think if Sir Alex ever bumps into Jordan he might want to apologise for that.",
      "\"The comment surprised me, I have to be honest, coming from someone with such status in the game. Maybe it was meant as flippant but to a young player making his way in the game it could be damaging.",
      "\"Every player is different, and every player at this club has had his strengths and weaknesses medically assessed. The statement in terms of Jordan was inappropriate.\"",
      "Henderson responded in the best possible way - with his performances on the pitch. He was named captain of Liverpool in the summer of 2015, ahead of Jurgen Klopp’s arrival a few months later.",
      "He became instrumental in Klopp's Merseyside revolution as the team grew increasingly competitive, reaching the Champions League final in 2017/18 and claiming the trophy twelve months later.",
      "Henderson also played 30 league matches during 2019/20 as Liverpool cruised to their first Premier League title, which they lifted when the season resumed during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "The England midfielder clocked up a total of 492 appearances for the Reds, scoring 33 goals and providing 58 assists, figures that barely scratch the surface of his monumental influence both on and off the pitch.",
      "In a shock move, he decided to leave Liverpool in 2023 for Steven Gerrard's Al-Ettifaq project in Saudi Arabia, believing his opportunities at Anfield under Klopp would be limited ahead of the new season.",
      "Henderson's two former clubs, Liverpool and Sunderland, are set to face off in the Premier League on Wednesday night at Anfield. His boyhood team Sunderland have kicked off the season exceptionally and currently sit sixth in the table in their first season back in the top flight.",
      "Meanwhile, reigning champions Liverpool are trailing by one point after a dismal run of form, which finally came to an end with a 2-0 victory over West Ham at the weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are preparing to face West Ham on Thursday as the Red Devils target another unbeaten run. Ruben Amorim’s side produced an impressive second-half display to earn a 2-1 away win over Crystal Palace at the weekend.",
      "It was the ideal response from United following their disappointing home defeat to 10-man Everton last week. That loss ended the team’s five-game unbeaten streak but Amorim’s side were able to swiftly return to winning ways at Selhurst Park on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly prepared to offload four members of Ruben Amorim’s squad during the January transfer window. ESPN has claimed that the Red Devils will listen to offers for Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, Manuel Ugarte and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "The report states that United will need to raise funds to pursue midfield targets in January. However, there is an added complication, as allowing players to leave early in the window could leave Amorim with a depleted squad while the Africa Cup of Nations is still ongoing.",
      "All of the aforementioned United players have struggled for game time so far this season. Zirkzee has returned to the starting XI due to injuries to other forwards, while Ugarte has started on just three occasions.",
      "England international Mainoo’s sole start came in the cup defeat to Grimsby and he has consistently been linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Meanwhile, Malacia is yet to feature this season.",
      "Manchester United will have Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui available for longer than expected ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations. The trio are set to represent their respective nations at the tournament, which begins on December 21, but a new FIFA ruling has allowed clubs to keep their players until December 15.",
      "The deadline had previously been thought to be a week earlier. The ruling means Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui will now be eligible to face Wolves away on Monday, December 8, a game they were previously scheduled to miss.",
      "However, it remains unclear whether the extension will apply to United’s home game against Bournemouth on December 15. Mbeumo will be at AFCON with Cameroon, while Amad will represent Ivory Coast. Mazraoui will also hope to guide Morocco to victory. The tournament is scheduled to run until January 18.",
      "Before the ruling, Amorim shared his thoughts on the situation: “We have the rules, when we have to release the players, so we will see. We are doing our job to try and maintain the players a little bit longer, but it is not just in our hands. We need to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and protect the national team.\"",

But while the Red Devils could be poised to lean on their academy in the wake of players heading off mid-season, the likes of Heaven, Leon and Obi could still head out.",
      "The young trio have struggled for opportunities under Ruben Amorim this term, and are now set to continue their development elsewhere for the short term, per reports.",
      "Leon, 18, arrived at the club in the summer but had big ambitions after leaving Cerro Porteno. The young full-back has not yet appeared in a competitive fixture for the first team and is being linked with a move to Nice, who would offer him the chance to gain valuable first-team experience for six months.",
      "\"I’m really happy, I think every player dreams of this,\" Leon told Versus before his move to Old Trafford. \"When you’re a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity.",
      "\"Everyone thinks I’ll go out on loan, but I don’t have that mindset. I’m going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I’ll already be playing with them.\"",
      "Heaven has enjoyed more first-team action since joining from Arsenal, but his situation is also likely to be assessed. The 19-year-old has shown promise but has only earned 158 minutes on the pitch this term. Forward Obi, who also joined from Arsenal, broke into United's first team plans last season after dominant displays in the youth ranks. Amorim has since admitted he introduced the striker at an inappropriate time.",
      "Obi has been required to settle with the club's under-21s this term, having made eight appearances under Amorim last season. The striker has not appeared since the final day game against Fulham Amorim believes he did not foster the correct environment for Obi to thrive last term. “He played last year, but I think it was too soon,\" he said.",
      "\"We didn’t have a team we could put a young kid of 16 into and him not struggle. He’s one of the guys but he started too soon. Sometimes it’s hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that ‘I’m already here’. We need to be careful with that.”",

      "Matheus Cunha is set to return to the Manchester United squad against West Ham on Thursday but Ruben Amorim has two fresh doubts that could force him to draw up a new game plan. Cunha is back in contention after missing the last two games following a training ground incident on the eve of United's game with Everton, but Amorim refused to confirm who the players at risk of missing the game were.",
      "\"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we’re going to approach it, let’s see if they can play,\" the United head coach said. The rest of the squad is good. Mathues is ack. Harry and Sesko are still out.\"",
      "Maguire has been out for three weeks with a thigh injury and Sesko hasn't played since the draw at Tottenham after picking up a knee injury not long after coming off the bench in North London. Cunha has just one goal in 11 games for United since his move from Wolves in the summer and Amorim believes the Brazilian has more room for improvement as he prepares to return to the team.",
      "\"I think he has more levels to go,\" he said. \"He is in a different club, different pressure but I think he copes with that really well.",
      "\"He was struggling because he was not scoring and he was thinking too much about the numbers. But the influence that he has in the team is so important for us but I think Cunha has so much to grow defensively and offensively.\"",
      "West Ham will be without Lucas Paqueta after his red card against Liverpool but Amorim is confident his countryman Nuno Espirito Santo will be successful after taking over at the London Stadium earlier this season.",
      "\"I had no doubts he will have success,\" he said. \"He’s really experienced, he knows how to work with different squads, understands really well the league. We know it’s going to be tough, he’s really smart preparing the games. The preparation is about the opponent but I’m focused on what we need to do and what we need to improve.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Leny Yoro to stop beating himself up over mistakes, and revealed he had pulled the young centre-back aside after he showed his frustration in Manchester United's win at Crystal Palace on Sunday. Yoro conceded the penalty which allowed Jean-Philippe Mateta to open the scoring at Selhurst Park, before goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount saw United side roar back in the second half.",
      "Amorim took Yoro off during the celebrations for the equaliser, with Noussair Mazraoui already stripped and ready to come on. The 20-year-old showed his frustration as he was withdrawn and needed an arm around the shoulder from Mason Mount at full-time. That gesture was praised by Amorim, who revealed he had spoken to Yoro about his reaction to mistakes and also used this week to show him clips of positive elements from his performance at Selhurst Park to try and rebuild his confidence.",
      "\"I also spoke with him because he thinks too much, he makes a mistake in the game and then he struggles because he’s too young and he wants to do everything so well,\" the United head coach said. \"He’s growing, with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy. He cannot give that to the people the way he came to the bench, he understands that but he was really frustrated.",
      "\"On the good side, it shows that he cares, he knows it wasn’t his best game but he did some things well and I showed him that also. He’s fit and ready for the next challenge.\"",
      "Amorim also insisted there was room for improvement in the performances of Diogo Dalot, while praising his ability to play as a wing-back on either flank. \"He can do a lot of things better, like other players,\" he said. \"When you see a very good game of Diogo he can show he has the quality, but sometimes he drops a little bit.",
      "\"He’s really powerful, he’s good on set-pieces, he can play both sides. To have that ability of playing both sides that can help you to think about the squad. He’s a very important player for us but he needs to improve like another player.\"",

The 18-year-old has had his first taste of being part of a matchday squad in recent weeks and the forward is highly-rated within the United academy.",
      "Although he didn't get on for his senior debut and could find his place in the 20-man squad taken with Matheus Cunha's return to action, Amorim insists Lacey is ready for a chance and will get one soon. United have no European games this season and are already out of the Carabao Cup, reducing the number of opportunities for young players to feature.",
      "Lacey has been training with the senior squad and Amorim has been focusing on the differences between playing for academy sides and the speed of first-team football. Even if he is out of the squad against West Ham on Thursday, Amorim insists it is a matter of time until he makes his debut.",
      "\"Try to explain every day how to play, because if you're comfortable and don’t have many doubts when you are playing that will help the kids to play,\" Amorim said of his approach to Lacey in recent weeks.",
      "\"Then to work the physicality, to understand when he’s training with us, understand the speed of the pressure, the moments to have the ball and pass the ball is completely different to Under-21s. That is the only way I know how to prepare a kid to play for the club, especially this club. He’ll have the chance, I don’t know when, but he’s ready to play.\"",

      "Manchester United are confident of keeping hold of JJ Gabriel despite Barcelona stepping up their efforts to sign the academy starlet. The 15-year-old and his family have been guests of Barcelona at the Nou Camp on at least one occasion recently and were given a tour of the facilities as the Catalan club try and woo the United teenager.",
      "Their interest in Gabriel is long-standing. Gabriel has met Barcelona players during his visits to the Spanish city and it has been made clear that the club would like to bring him to their iconic La Masia academy at some point in the future. The England Under-16 international has long been talked about as one of the best talents to emerge from the United academy in recent seasons, but his goalscoring exploits for the Under-18s have seen him enter the wider consciousness this season.",
      "He scored a hat-trick in a 7-0 win against Liverpool Under-18s at the weekend and has now scored 10 goals in as many games this season. Gabriel has already trained with the first-team and Ruben Amorim has been asked his involvement in senior training sessions.",
      "“Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" he said. “You could see the U21s had a game and we had less players and tried to pick players for training that have talent.",
      "“Not just for me to see for tomorrow but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace. If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",
      "Barcelona's interest dates back at least two years and they remain keen on signing Gabriel, who holds an EU passport through his father's Irish heritage. That will make a move to the continent easier.",
      "United are determined to keep hold of Gabriel, however. Director of football Jason Wilcox played a key role during the summer of 2025 to show the forward and his family a pathway at the club and Amorim has taken an interest in his development.",

Both incomings and outgoings have been brought up in the conversation for the Reds, who spent more than £200million in the summer but might decide to add to their ranks next month.",

      "According to LaRoma24, Roma's management has received approval for the needed budget to secure a high-level striker, and Joshua Zirkzee is mentioned as one the Italian club want.",
      "It's said that Roma's ownership will guarantee financial coverage for the deal, whether it is a loan or a permanent transfer. Zirkzee, however, could still stay at United in January.",

      "The heat was on Ruben Amorim's assistant Carlos Fernandes back then. United were a soft touch at set pieces and offered virtually no threat at the other end of the pitch, and that woeful combination led to calls for Fernandes to be stripped of set-piece planning responsibilities.",
      "Now, every time United get a corner or a free-kick, Fernandes still rises to his feet to oversee the plans, but gone are the jitters that come defensively and the expectation that nothing will come of it in the opposition's penalty area. United's comeback success at Selhurst Park last weekend was thanks to two set-piece goals and only Arsenal have scored more of them this season.",
      "But United are creating a higher xG from set-pieces and are scoring goals from them at a better rate than the Gunners, who only top the scoring charts because they have more attacking corners and free-kicks than Amorim's side. Amorim has admitted to stealing set-piece ideas from other clubs, but gave credit for the upturn in fortunes to the work Fernandes is doing on the training ground and the research he is putting in on the opposition.",
      "He is backed up by 27-year-old first-team analyst Kaita Hasegawa, who is devoted to set-pieces. Hasegawa has also recruited a team of data experts tasked with focusing on them. Once Hasegawa and his team have passed the information on to Fernandes, the 31-year-old devises routines and gets down to business at Carrington on running the players through them. The work is paying dividends.",
      "\"In this league, set pieces can win you games,\" said Amorim. \"Or you can lose if you don't pay attention to that. I'm really pleased with the job that they are doing.\"",
      "United's approach to set-pieces seemed shambolic when Amorim first arrived, but, as with so much of the Portuguese head coach's first year, a lack of time on the training ground played a part in that.",
      "Now, United have a week to prepare for most games, having failed to qualify for Europe and been dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August. That free time is helping to improve their sharpness at set-pieces.",
      "\"Last year we trained without the real movement we can put in the position,\" said Amorim. \"If you don't have space and you cannot put load because they are recovering, it's not the same thing.",
      "\"[Now] you have more time to kick corners and free-kicks and you can create real game situations this year. That helps. If you train more time you will improve. That is normal.\"",
      "Amorim believes United can still improve defensively when it comes to set-pieces and admitted that area of the game is now so crucial in the Premier League that it is impacting his team selection.",
      "\"You have to think about who you put in the squad, if you play with Amad, Bryan, Bruno, all these guys,\" he said. \"If you don't have Casemiro - and we suffer against Tottenham with that - not Sesko, not Harry.",
      "\"So you have to make a balance sometimes, thinking 'yes, the idea for the game is this one, but if you have set pieces against it cannot be this team'. Our league is like that at the moment.",
      "\"You need to think not just the way you are going to play but also in set pieces. If you look at it with a little bit of attention to the league you understand that set pieces are massive for the game. Sometimes, to open the game. If you score a goal you are in better conditions to win the game.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's side return to action looking to make it back-to-back wins following Sunday's comeback victory at Crystal Palace. The Reds came from behind to beat the Eagles at Selhurst Park, with goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount securing all three points after Jean-Philippe Mateta had given the home team the lead.",
      "As for West Ham, they are hoping to return to winning ways after losing 2-0 to Liverpool on Sunday. The Hammers had previously gone on a three-game unbeaten run, beating Newcastle United and Burnley before the international break before being held to a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth.",
      "Although West Ham have picked up a little bit of form recently, it's still a game United will be expecting to win if they want to break into the Champions League places come the end of the season.",
      "But the Reds will have to do it without Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire again, after Amorim ruled the duo out for the visit of the Hammers. Sesko and Maguire have missed the last two matches with both players suffering injuries in the 2-2 draw at Tottenham before the November international break.",
      "They might not be only United players unavailable, though, with Amorim admitting that there are two unnamed doubts for the game against West Ham.",
      "The United head coach, however, did confirm that Matheus Cunha is available after missing the last two matches alongside Sesko and Maguire.",
      "Speaking in his pre-West Ham press conference, Amorim said: \"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we're going to approach it, let's see if they can play. The rest of the squad is good.",
      "\"Matheus is back. Harry and Sesko are still out.\"",
      "Looking at West Ham, they are expected to be without four players for the trip to Old Trafford.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo confirmed on Tuesday that Crysencio Summerville won't make the squad, while Lucas Paqueta is suspended after he was given two yellow cards during the defeat against Liverpool.",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez that they must fight it out for the right to get in his team as the Argentine's return from injury sets up a fascinating duel between the pair. Shaw has started every Premier League game this season and made his 300th appearance for Manchester United in Sunday's win against Crystal Palace.",
      "But he was withdrawn towards the end at Selhurst Park and replaced by Martinez. The 27-year-old was making his first appearance in 10 months after recovering from a serious knee injury. Martinez has had misfortune with injuries in the last couple of years, but now that he is fit, he is desperate to make up for lost time and will be eyeing a challenge to Shaw to get in the team as Amorim's left-sided central defender.",
      "There is a chance Shaw could yet be used as a left wing-back, although he has barely played that position since Amorim's arrival and the demands would be a test of his newfound durability. For now, the 30-year-old is likely to keep his place against West Ham on Thursday, but Amorim has set up a battle between the two left-footers for a place in his team going forward.",
      "\"They have to fight,\" he said. \"We talked about that as a group last year. We needed to win the Europa League. You have 11 players because you have no idea what is playing one game per week. You are going to be upset because you are not going to play. It’s 11 players that can play and then the rest you have to fight. That is the situation. That is not a problem. That is a blessing. That is my job to choose.",
      "\"Licha is a guy who has a big character. I feel that he stops for a year and now he wants things really, really fast and you have to manage that to explain with that injury, we need to go step by step, but he's getting ready, he's feeling really strong. He's one more guy to help the team to play better, so I'm really happy with Licha at the moment.\"",
      "Shaw's renaissance has been remarkable after his own injury woes restricted him to just five starts last season. He had made only 27 appearances across the last two seasons before his run in the side this term.",
      "\"We took special consideration in the beginning,\" said Amorim. \"When we are building the player, we have to be careful. Trying to control the load, not putting so many minutes. Even the position is completely different.",
      "\"You know that the demands of that different position he is going to struggle. He adapts really well to that position because sometimes he's playing with the ball like a fullback. But he's defending more deeply. He's really smart.",
      "\"For me, I said already I think he's a world-class player. Of course, he needs more continuity. Like he's showing this season. We are playing just one game per week. That helps a lot. If he needs three days to recover, and he's not needing it now, but if he needs it we can give him.",
      "\"We are not taking special measures for him in this moment but we had to do it in the beginning when he was starting to have more minutes.\"",
      "Amorim left the door open to Shaw playing as a wing-back in his system, with the absence of Noussair Mazraoui and Amad during the Africa Cup of Nations set to lead to a shortage of options in that position from mid-December.",
      "\"It's different, you have to train there,\" said Amorim. \"Before you think to put a different player in that position, you need to train there. Or he needs to do some minutes and then he needs to come off. Or return to a different position.",
      "\"But he's ready to if we need him. Maybe we are going to need him and in this system he can play there.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim spoke to the media on Wednesday ahead of Manchester United's Premier League clash with West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim offered an update on the fitness of Matheus Cunha with the Brazilian back in training and available to face the Hammers.",
      "But United do have fresh injuries with two players doubts while Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire remain sidelined.",
      "Recap all the latest from Amorim's press conference below",
      "That's a wrap from Ruben. Here's the main headlines from what he had to say and from around United today.",
      "United have two fresh injury doubts for West Ham after cryptic Amorim answer",
      "What Amorim told Yoro after United reaction",
      "United stance on JJ Gabriel transfer as Barcelona step up interest",
      "It’s normal in any profession when you are exposed to it. I don’t read it, I protect myself.",
      "I don’t watch TV when they are talking about Manchester United. Not because I don’t agree, a lot of time I do, but it’s a way of me being healthy.",
      "My feeling as a coach is enough, I don’t need other feelings. The only way is protect myself. Of course I lose money from sponsors on Instagram, for my protection of my family and living a normal life is not worth some pounds.",
      "I protect myself and nobody can tough me more than me when we lose and when we don’t play well. Nowadays it’s really normal to have that abuse so it’s the only way to survive.",
      "Ruben Amorim has told Leny Yoro to stop beating himself up over mistakes, and revealed he had pulled the young centre-back aside after he showed his frustration in Manchester United's win at Crystal Palace on Sunday.",
      "Yoro conceded the penalty which allowed Jean-Philippe Mateta to open the scoring at Selhurst Park, before goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount saw United side roar back in the second half.",
      "Amorim took Yoro off during the celebrations for the equaliser, with Noussair Mazraoui already stripped and ready to come on. The 20-year-old showed his frustration as he was withdrawn and needed an arm around the shoulder from Mason Mount at full-time.",
      "That gesture was praised by Amorim, who revealed he had spoken to Yoro about his reaction to mistakes and also used this week to show him clips of positive elements from his performance at Selhurst Park to try and rebuild his confidence.",
      "Read more here",
      "I had no doubts he will have success. He’s really experienced, he knows how to work with different squads, understands really well the league.",
      "We know it’s going to be tough, he’s really smart preparing the games.",
      "The preparation is about the opponent but I’m focused on what we need to do and what we need to improve.",
      "He can do a lot of things better, like other players. When you see a very good game of Diogo he can show he has the quality, but sometimes he drops a little bit.",
      "He’s really powerful, he’s good on set-pieces, he can play both sides. To have that ability of playing both sides that can help you to think about the squad. He’s a very important player for us but he needs to improve like another player.",
      "Try to explain every day how to play, if you're comfortable and don’t have any doubts when you are playing that will help the kids.",
      "Then to work the physicality, the speed of the pressure, the moments to have the ball and pass the ball is completely different to U21s.",
      "He’ll have the chance, I don’t know, but he’s ready to play.",
      "It’s really important. I also spoke with him because he thinks too much, he makes a mistake and then he struggles.",
      "He wants to do everything so well. He’s growing, with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy.",
      "He cannot show that to the people the way he came to the bench, he knows that. It shows he cares, he knows it wasn’t his best game.",
      "He has more levels to go. He’s at a different club, different pressure, he was struggling because he was not scoring, he was thinking too much about the numbers but the influence he has in the team is important to us.",
      "Amorim confirms Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire remain out but Matheus Cunha is back.",
      "The United boss also says that two other members of his squad are doubts for the contest but didn't name them and will make a late call on their inclusion for the game against the Hammers.",
      "Read the full story here",
      "The Brazilian has been missing for the past few weeks with injury but has returned to training.",
      "That is a huge boost for United given striker Benjamin Sesko is also sidelined. Amorim will provide a more detailed update on the fitness of his squad shortly.",
      "Cunha hasn't featured since the draw with Spurs ahead of the international break.",
      "The United boss will be speaking just about now to the journalists in the room at Carrington.",
      "As ever, the press conference runs to a 15 minute embargo meaning we will be able to bring you the live quotes from 1.30pm.",
      "So stay tuned!",
      "There is a rare midweek Premier League outing for Manchester United this week as the busy Christmas period nears.",
      "United host West Ham United on Thursday night (8pm kick-off) and they go into the game in good spirits. Despite being 1-0 down at half-time, Ruben Amorim’s side came out as 2-1 winners against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The game against West Ham will now give the team chance to gain momentum and record back-to-back wins. United captain Bruno Fernandes had given United a slight injury scare in the closing stages of the game against Palace, but Amorim has confirmed that he had just been on the end of a kick and should be fine.",
      "The side have also been given another boost ahead of the clash against the Hammers with forward Matheus Cunha providing an update on his injury. Here’s a look at the latest from the treatment room at Carrington.",
      "This week presents a relatively unique experience for Manchester United, who for the first time since the end of August have a midweek game and a short turnaround between fixtures. The embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby further cleared an already quiet schedule for a team not in Europe this year, and United have benefited from the lack of midweek games to drill down into Ruben Amorim's plans on the training pitches at Carrington.",
      "They have played only 14 games this season, compared to the 20 contested by Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle. A gap of just four days between Sunday's win at Crystal Palace and Thursday's Old Trafford date with West Ham is unusual for a team that has become accustomed to the pattern of long lead-ins to games. They have had at least six days to prepare for every match since the start of September.",
      "However, the fixture list is arguably still kind to United, who will play six games in December.",
      "Read more here",
      "There was a nod to his teammates from Luke Shaw at Carrington on Tuesday as he was presented with a commemorative framed shirt to celebrate his 300th appearance for Manchester United, a milestone he might have never expected to reach during his lower moments at Old Trafford.",
      "Shaw's United career has often been one of survival. From spells where he has looked one of the best in the world in his position, to times when injuries have repeatedly struck him down and left him frustrated on the sidelines and a source of criticism from the stands.",
      "The 30-year-old has started every Premier League game this season and has developed into a senior statesman in this squad. He was presented with the shirt by director of football Jason Wilcox and head coach Ruben Amorim, before delivering a speech to the squad and first-team staff. That is something Amorim has introduced this season.",
      "Read more on the changing dressing room dynamic here",
      "Manchester United are confident of keeping hold of JJ Gabriel despite Barcelona stepping up their efforts to sign the academy starlet. The 15-year-old and his family have been guests of Barcelona at the Nou Camp on at least one occasion recently and were given a tour of the facilities as the Catalan club try and woo the United teenager.",
      "Their interest in Gabriel is long-standing. Gabriel has met Barcelona players during his visits to the Spanish city and it has been made clear that the club would like to bring him to their iconic La Masia academy at some point in the future. The England Under-16 international has long been talked about as one of the best talents to emerge from the United academy in recent seasons, but his goalscoring exploits for the Under-18s have seen him enter the wider consciousness this season.",
      "Read more here",
      "Hello and welcome to our live press conference blog. Amorim will speak to the media at 1.30pm today as he looks ahead of Thursday's Old Trafford clash with West Ham.",
      "We can expect an update on injuries with Matheus Cunha in contention to return to the squad against West Ham and there will also be an update on the availability of Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo around the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Keep across this blog throughout the day for updates from Carrington."

      "That is something Amorim has introduced this season, ensuring achievements are marked in the right manner, and it has become clear in recent weeks that the atmosphere in the dressing room is as strong as it has been for many years.",
      "Carrington insiders talk of how easy every player is to deal with and there has been a collective approach to things like media duties and community appearances this season. It may not be a coincidence that naturally quieter players, such as Shaw and Mason Mount, have found their voice. Shaw has helped Matheus Cunha settle in and has struck up a friendship with the Brazilian, while Mount is now bringing his experience to bear on the squad.",
      "It was noticeable that Sunday's matchwinner wrapped an arm around Leny Yoro at Selhurst Park on Sunday and Mount, having shunned media duties in his first couple of years at the club, has become an excellent talker off the pitch.",
      "The dressing room now feels a more level, meritocratic place. Some notable figures and personalities have left the club in recent years. Players such as Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho could bring the mood down and dominant personalities like Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo have gone.",
      "Despite the frequent turnover of managers in recent years at United, it is the players who have often faced scrutiny from supporters. That feels like it's changing this season and even if there are questions around the quality of some players, the idea that the dressing room is toxic or plotting behind the back of the manager has gone.",
      "That might be Amorim's biggest success so far. There are signs of progress on the pitch, but off it he has changed the culture and the environment at Carrington, which has been absolutely vital. He has been especially ruthless with players whom he considered to be a bad influence or who affected the mood of the dressing room, axing Rashford, Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho as a result.",
      "The benefits of that approach are now being seen. This feels like a squad on the same page and willing to stick together and that hasn't always been the case for Amorim's predecessors.",

      "Amorim had confirmed as such in a recent press conference when asked about a potential return date for Cunha. He said: \"I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham United], not this one [vs Crystal Palace].\"",
      "Without the summer signing, United suffered a very bad defeat to ten-man Everton but the response was emphatic this past weekend as they beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park. Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount were both on target which could see Cunha on the bench for his return match.",
      "Nonetheless, Amorim will almost certainly be pleased to have Cunha back in his squad and its fair to say the man himself is also very pleased. Via Instagram stories, with Cunha in full training gear at Carrington, he said: \"Back back back.\"",
      "That fitness boost looked set to arrive alongside a major blow as Bruno Fernandes was captured on camera limping in the latter stages of the win over Palace. However, Amorim seemingly confirmed he would be fine to feature going forward.",
      "“It was a kick, I was shouting at him because he needs to learn we make a substitution in the end, he needs to talk to the bench,\" he said. \"But he said it was just a kick, so everything is OK.”",
      "And Amorim will certainly need his captain over the coming weeks as United face a busier schedule than usual with their first midweek clash since the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Following the visit of West Ham, United travel to Wolves next Monday evening before hosting Bournemouth under the lights again seven days later. Their last clash before Christmas comes against Aston Villa with a Boxing Day clash at Newcastle United following that.",
      "A first start in over nine months for Lisandro Martinez will likely arrive during that period after his brief returning cameo against the Seagulls last Sunday.",
      "As for Benjamin Sesko, he is still missing because of a knee injury picked up against Tottenham Hotspur while Harry Maguire is yet to return from a muscular problem suffered in that same game.",
      "Amorim delivered updates on both in his press conference last week which suggested that returns are on the way, but neither are quite ready just yet.",
      "\"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time. It will take a little bit longer, and we are taking care of him,\" he said. \"Harry is the same [he will need more time].\"",
      "Despite the tone of his comments, the Slovenia international has not suffered a setback and is still expected to return for the clash against Wolves later this month.",

      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has \"so much more to accomplish\" in his career after making his 150th appearance in the Premier League against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ruben Amorim questioned his options at left wing-back ahead of the trip to Selhurst Park, admitting Dalot and Patrick Dorgu weren't performing on matchdays as well as they were during training.",
      "Dalot was recalled to the starting team to face Palace and delivered an improved performance. The Portugal international was the United player with the most duels won and was responsible for winning the foul that led to the second goal, a display which earned praise from Amorim.",
      "When asked whether Dalot's display was the benchmark for a player in that role, Amorim said: \"It's of course defending and attacking. If you have certain characteristics, the pace, you can go right or left because you also can play with your left.",
      "\"You need to use that in every single game in the Premier League and not just one game and then we drop a little bit the level. But it's the same thing that I said with Patrick. I know they have a lot of quality. They just need to be relaxed sometimes and show that and show the intensity and the pace that they have.\"",
      "The game saw Dalot make his 150th appearance in the Premier League, which he said is a source of \"pride for playing at the highest level for so many years”.",
      "Dalot added: “I’m very happy to reach this beautiful milestone in the biggest league in the world. My journey has been one of constant growth as both a man and a player, and I’m proud of what I’ve achieved knowing that I’m only 26 and still have so much more to accomplish in my career. I’m enjoying every moment.”",
      "Dalot started in wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, but he struggled against Nottingham Forest, and Dorgu was recalled to face Spurs before the international break.",
      "The 26-year-old is more comfortable on the right, but has played predominantly at left wing-back this season.",
      "When asked after Liverpool if the victory was one of the biggest wins of his time at the club, Dalot said: \"Probably, yeah, I could say so because of the moment, the pressure that everyone created on us to have back-to-back wins, coming here against a team that was going through a difficult phase.",
      "\"So a game like today can go both ways. The team that wins today will come on top, so very important for us, but again, I don't want to get too carried away because next week we have to keep going.",
      "\"At a club like this, you're always expecting two, three or four wins in a row. It was important for us to know we're capable of doing it. We know already, but we needed to prove it on the pitch and to do it against a team like Liverpool, there is no better way for a Man United fan, a Man United player, to do that.",
      "\"So really happy. Today is a very good day for the club. We've been through a lot, some difficulties, but today is to enjoy.\"",

      "The Argentina international has gradually been building up his fitness in recent weeks and was named on the bench for the Premier League defeat to Everton last week.",
      "On Sunday, Martinez was named on the bench once again by Ruben Amorim for the clash against Palace, and this time a cameo appearance in the closing minutes at Selhurst Park.",
      "More than 24 hours after the final whistle in south east London, Martinez has posted a message to his 6.8 million followers on Instagram to reflect on his return to action for United.",
      "\"Long time not being able to do what I love most and what better way to return to the court [pitch] with a very important win,\" wrote Martinez.",
      "\"They were months of suffering, uncertainty, anguish, imbalance... where the lack of energy was nothing to beat me, but I was lucky enough to count on my family, friends, teammates, fans, the club and the national team, to recharge the heart.",
      "\"Just thank you, everyone.\"",
      "Responses poured in with one of those coming from former United goalkeeper David de Gea. The stopper, now with Fiorentina, commented 'he's back' with a knife emoji referencing Martinez's butcher nickname.",
      "Martinez's United team-mate Joshua Zirkzee commented 'welcome back' with a red love heart while compatriot Rodrigo De Paul wrote 'we were waiting for you, beautiful butcher'.",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes explained after the win over Palace why he was delighted to have Martinez back in the matchday squad.",
      "“It’s very important to have him [Martinez] back, it’s such a long spell that he was out, even for himself, it’s great to be back with the team to have this feeling of playing games again,\" Fernandes told MUTV.",
      "“We know how much he struggled being out without being able to play for us. He’s back and one more option to have such big quality in the team, so we’re very happy with it.”",
      "United's next match will see them host West Ham in the Premier League on Thursday night at Old Trafford, where Martinez will be hopeful of getting more minutes under his belt as he continues to get up to speed after a lengthy spell on the sidelines.",

      "After VAR demanded a retake due to a double touch, the forward successfully converted the penalty.",
      "However, after half time, United capitalised on their fresher legs. They levelled the score unexpectedly when Bruno Fernandes' free kick found Joshua Zirkzee, who calmly slotted the ball into the net.",
      "The game took a dramatic turn moments later. Fernandes set up a free kick for Mason Mount to strike home through a sea of players, and the Reds managed to maintain their lead, securing a crucial three points away from home.",

One of centre-backs needs to cover, where middle can't cover. Wing-back forward so far up and can't come back in time. CP plays the same system and plays a lot better.",
      "\"Get rid of Zirkzee. I don't know what he is good at. With his height and weight, at least he can contain the ball, but he can't do it and easily loses the ball. Also, at least, we need to buy 2 middle players.\"",

      "After replays showed the ball had accidentally struck his left foot, Mateta was given the chance to retake the penalty and made no mistake with his second attempt. The rules changed following controversy in Atletico Madrid's Champions League last-16 second-leg tie against Real Madrid in March.",

      "Following the International Football Association Board's (IFAB) intervention, a 'double-touch penalty' must be retaken rather than disallowed, if the ball goes in from the original kick.",
      "As a result, Mateta put his team ahead in the 36th minute, before Ruben Amorim’s side responded with goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount. Yoro was taken off six minutes before the hour mark and was comforted at full-time by Mason Mount.",
      "Taking to Instagram after the game, Yoro reflected on the difficult game he had at Selhurst Park. \"Challenging days - Mindset locked in - Work on.\"",

      "\"I think it's not hard to understand what the fans want, first of all, but of course it was a surprise.

And as a result of finding his footing with the La Liga giants, Manchester United have recently been linked with making a move for the midfielder.",
      "The Reds have struggled in their engine room for a couple of seasons, with Casemiro's ageing legs leaving him unable to cover the ground he once did during his Real Madrid heyday - while Bruno Fernandes' suitability to a deeper role has been cast into speculation by pundits, evidently more compatible in the No.10.",
      "And with Manuel Ugarte failing to gel under Ruben Amorim, as well as Kobbie Mainoo seeing his future at Old Trafford cast into speculation, United have been linked with a wealth of talent in the January window, including Gallagher. Reports suggest that the Premier League titans are eyeing up a loan deal for the 25-year-old.",

      "\"Koke has been playing ahead of him. Koke has his attributes; he's played 700 games, at the weekend, for Atletico Madrid. And Simeone just can't let go of him. So it's a security blanket for Simeone.",
      "\"Koke has been a wonderful player, but Conor Gallagher does offer a little bit more, now. He gets around the pitch a lot quicker than Koke does and he has a goal-scoring threat. He's been happy to play in a wider midfield position.",
      "\"Would he play in this game? (vs Barcelona on Tuesday). He started in the game against Inter Milan. Probably not then. That means that there will be rotations and changes. But I think that he's really pushing hard for a place on a more regular basis.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "“You can leave them out of the side and the rest of the squad can cope. But when you have three or four players who are really talented, but just aren’t at the races, then it drags the team down a level.”",
      "“It’s really hard for the manager to turn that situation around, so I think it’s very important to act decisively in situations like that, so Amorim got rid of them (the disruptive players).",
      "“He replaced them with Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha, and now United are playing at a higher level than what we had before. These three work hard, they’re willing to defend, they don’t think they’re bigger than the team. With a negative attitude, a team is in big trouble.",
      "“I think that was the main goal for United in the transfer market. Players who thought about themselves above the team, they needed to go. The squad is more balanced now.",

You can afford a few flair players who might not always have that attitude, but it has to be a small minority. Back when I was there, we had Gary and Phil Neville, John O’Shea, Wes Brown. They made life easier for us.”"

      "The Red Devils pulled off a major coup to sign 20-year-old Yoro ahead of Real Madrid in 2024, and his overall form over the past 18 months as one of United’s stronger performers has proven that he was worth the hype.",

      "One midfielder they have been heavily linked to is Real Madrid’s Valverde with reports in Spain claiming that he is one of seven names wanting Alonso out at Real Madrid.",
      "The report claims: ‘The dressing room is divided into two factions. Two opposing views. The majority group is the most critical. The sector that no longer trusts Xabi. The one that feels his methods clash with the club’s identity. And here are the seven names leading this stance: Jude Bellingham, Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Valverde, Brahim Diaz, Ferland Mendy, and Eduardo Camavinga. Endrick joins them, also expressing his discomfort.’",
      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",
      "The same publication also claims that Valverde and England international Bellingham have both been the subject of ‘offers exceeding €100m (£88m)’.",
      "It is understood that Bellingham ‘can’t find the space or the freedom that made him shine in his first year, while the Uruguayan feels out of rhythm, disconnected, and lacking the physical presence that usually makes him a game-changer.’",

      "“If he wants to be at the World Cup he should take the chance. I think he’s plenty good enough. It must be so frustrating for him knowing his ability and how well he has done, even when he has only had a few minutes, that the endgame is still the same.",
      "“At that age, you just want to play football, you just want to express yourself. He burst onto the scene and for a while he was always the first name on the team sheet. Now all of a sudden no matter what he does, he’s not on the team sheet. So where do you go from there? For me, he has to look elsewhere. He needs to get football. He needs to get minutes.",
      "“As far as I can tell, he hasn’t done anything wrong. If you look at Man United over the last year, you could arguably say that when he has played, he’s been one of Man United’s best players. So the treatment that he’s getting, I honestly can’t understand it.",
      "“Hence the reason why I’m saying that no matter what he does, he’s not going to start unless something happens and unless Casemiro’s form drops again, or someone gets injured, I think he just will not get a start on merit. Which is the sad thing, because he would be in there otherwise.”",

      "Still, the shambolic mess of last season was never likely to be fixed in a single transfer window and positive steps have been taken to get the club back on an even keel.",
      "Firstly, most of their so-called ‘bomb squad’ were sent elsewhere in deals on United’s terms, with permanent deals or future fees secured for Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund, while Aston Villa loanee Jadon Sancho’s career at Man Utd is also all but over as his contract expires next summer.",
      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",

      "Champions League qualification would boost their coffers to execute this business, but Man Utd may also have to wheel and deal to raise funds as they did in the summer.",
      "One such way the Red Devils could free up cash is via adjusting player contracts, with Casemiro and Maguire among those facing uncertain futures at Old Trafford.",
      "Casemiro is one of six Premier League players enjoying an unexpected renaissance, as his great form has ensured that Kobbie Mainoo’s continued absence has become a lesser topic, while Maguire has remained an important squad player for Man Utd.",
      "With Casemiro, he currently earns around £375,000 a week, and this can be extended on the same terms until 2027. Maguire, meanwhile, earns roughly £180,000 a week, and a completely fresh deal is required if he’s to remain at the club beyond the summer.",
      "And The Daily Mail have shed light on the situation regarding these two players, claiming ‘neither player has a concrete offer on the table at the moment, although United still have time to stop them from leaving as free agents in the summer’.",
      "The report adds:",

      "This is the perfect approach from Man Utd’s hierarchy.",
      "It is easy to justify keeping Casemiro and Maguire beyond this season, given the roles they have played this season, but this comes with the caveat that each player must accept a pay cut to remain at Old Trafford.",

      "Man Utd are set to break their transfer record next summer on one of two players as they look to bring in a new midfielder, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on five new additions in the summer transfer window with Sir Jim Ratcliffe backing Ruben Amorim to get things right.",
      "Man Utd heavily invested in their forward line after only four Premier League clubs scored fewer goals than Amorim’s side last season.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all joined for big fees but many fans, former players and pundits thought their failure to sign a new midfielder was a huge oversight.",
      "Man Utd are still suffering from inconsistencies this season and there are rumours they will go for a budget option midfielder in the January transfer window, such as Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher or Wolves’ Joao Gomes.",
      "In the summer, they are expected to go big on other midfield options with Manchester World claiming that Man Utd ‘could break their club-record transfer fee to sign a top midfield target’.",
      "READ: Every Prem club’s player of the season so far includes four sold by Newcastle",
      "Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton have emerged as their two top targets with the £89m they spent on Paul Pogba from Juventus in 2016.",
      "The report added: ‘Anderson and Wharton are both expected to cost in excess of £100m, and their values could rise even higher if they star for England at the World Cup next summer.’",
      "Manchester World continued: ‘United only have four senior central midfielders on their books, and there are doubts over all of those already at the club. Casemiro could leave when his contract expires at the end of the season, and there is strong transfer interest in Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese playmaker will be allowed to leave if he wants to, though he has already indicated he will not decide on his future until after the World Cup.’",
      "Back in early November, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed what we can expect from Man Utd in the January transfer window.",
      "Romano told his YouTube channel: “Ruben Amorim sends clear indications in public and in private for Manchester United in the January transfer window. In private, the conversations have started between Amorim, the board, and the management of Man Utd ahead of the January window.",
      "“I told you about the midfielder. I told you that Man Utd are looking for that position. But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "Romano added: “But Amorim sends a clear message also in public talking about January. First of all, he says the window will be open and there is the possibility they will do something. So, not closing the doors to the opportunity to bring in new players, and it’s already an update for Man Utd. But he also says, ‘I don’t want players for the short-term.’",
      "“Amorim is not bringing in a player for just a few months. A player will join Man Utd only if they believe the player could be an option for the long-term. They don’t want to add a player just in terms of numbers, also because Man Utd have one competition this season plus the FA Cup incoming, and they want to focus on the Premier League.",
      "“They already have several players. So, if someone joins in January, it will be a player who Man Utd can trust for the present but also for the future.”",
      "Manchester United have reportedly decided to break the £100m barrier on their next addition, though four stars may need to leave first.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed why Manchester United feel that their first 2026 signing is a “hidden gem” and has been likened to a Chelsea star.",
      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100m for Elliot Anderson after Man City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will not be signing Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘confident’ that they can seal a cut-price deal for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, according to reports."

      "Former Manchester United defender Mikael Silvestre fears his former club face an uphill battle to make a Champions League return, as he painted a gloomy picture for Ruben Amorim’s team.",
      "Silvestre was a Champions League winner with United back in 2008 and also won four Premier League titles during Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign at Old Trafford, but he has warned the club’s supporters that they face a wait to see their team back in Europe’s elite competition.",
      "Speaking exclusively to Football365 with Poker Scout, the former France international defender has suggested United boss Ruben Amorim and his team cannot be expected to return to the Champions League next season after a lowly 15th place finish in the Premier League last season.",
      "“The top four for me is not realistic from where they were last season,” said Silvestre. “It’s just too difficult to picture how they will do that because of the lack of consistency.",
      "“We saw it against Everton when they lost 1-0 (at Old Trafford last week). You cannot have this kind of blip in the Premier League and expect to finish in the top four.",
      "“Of course, the other teams around you have to perform and we can see that Liverpool are not having a good time, but I feel the top four is too much for United this season.",
      "READ: Every Prem club’s player of the season so far includes four sold by Newcastle",
      "“For me, it would be a big surprise if United are in the Champions League next season and if they are in it, let’s be honest, they will not be there to win it.”",
      "Silvestre believes the United hierarchy has no option other than to back under-pressure manager Amorim as he looks to revive the club’s fortunes, as he suggests the club’s botched attempts to fill the void left by Ferguson’s retirement in 2013 has left a lasting scar.",
      "“The transition for the future wasn’t prepared when Sir Alex left,” he continues. “Everyone in his backroom staff went with him and that was a problem. There was a big gap to be filled and a very difficult one.",
      "“The whole United organisation was built on Sir Alex’s knowledge and everything was based around this personality. So in my view, the club has never recovered from his departure.",
      "“Now it feels like there are some people in place at the club who have been quite successful where they have been before.",
      "“When I was there, it was Sir Alex at the top and everyone around him, but now the club have built an organisation that has different parts and now they have to back Amorim.",
      "“I think he showed why he didn’t want to come in when he did last year, in the middle of the season, because it was always going to be difficult.",
      "“It was always going to be a case of giving him time and getting players into the squad to play in the system he wants to play, so Amorim needs time and assurances from the club if they want to build a squad that can compete for the title with him.",
      "“You need to back him up as long as possible. You are not going to build something quickly. We have seen that with Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. He needs time.”",
      "Every United defeat sparks what has become an all-too-familiar stream of criticism and talk of a crisis developing around Amorim and his team, with Silvestre suggesting the United manager and his players would be shrewd to ignore the criticism.",
      "“It doesn’t help for sure that there is so much negativity out there around United, but it’s hard to block out the noise,” he added.",
      "“The media are everywhere and social media is also very strong now. The players, the staff and everyone in the club are working on trying to improve things and they have to be resilient to ignore the noise when there is pressure.",
      "“If I was a player now, I would block the comments on social media, for sure. Then it is just the traditional media that you need to hear about.",
      "“Otherwise, you will have thousands of messages after a match and if it has not gone well, most of them will be negative. If you start listening to all of this negativity, you will not be able to do your job properly.”",

      "Manchester United are ready to spend a club-record fee to sign Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest, as per a report, and Manuel Ugarte is among four players who could leave Old Trafford to help fund the swoop.",
      "According to Manchester World, Man Utd are ready to spend £100million (€114m / $132m) on a ‘top midfield target’ in 2026. Forest star Anderson has emerged as their priority option, while the report claims Brighton & Hove Albion’s Carlos Baleba is still on the shortlist.",
      "Man Utd ‘are also interested in Joao Gomes and Angelo Stiller’ – described by the report as two cheaper options – but they ‘know it will take a club-record fee to sign an elite option’.",
      "A £100m deal for Anderson would eclipse the £89m paid to Juventus to bring Paul Pogba back to Old Trafford in August 2016, which was a world record at the time.",
      "United are ramping up their interest in Anderson after learning Manchester City have also decided to chase him.",
      "It was recently claimed the England international is leaning towards City, but this has yet to be confirmed by other outlets.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side received a boost on Tuesday as Forest landed on Lyon’s Tyler Morton as a possible replacement for Anderson.",
      "United made an approach for Baleba during the last transfer window, but we understand they have since cooled their interest due to his drop off in form.",
      "United see Anderson as the dream solution to their midfield issues, and our transfer insider Fraser Fletcher reported on November 18 that they could follow up on his capture with two more signings in the position.",

      "DIVE DEEPER 🌟 Key factor in Elliot Anderson hunt revealed as Man Utd face Liverpool, Man City threat – sources",

      "The Red Devils are ‘planning a major overhaul’ of their midfield ranks, and Ugarte will be a ‘casualty’ as he will be allowed to move on.",

      "The Daily Mail add that ‘the clock is ticking’ over the future of Casemiro, as he will soon enter the final six months of his contract.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has also discussed the future of Andre Onana, who is currently on loan at Trabzonspor.",
      "On his YouTube channel, the reliable journalist said ‘Onana’s chapter at United is closed’. The goalkeeper will return to United in June but will quickly ‘try to find a new solution’ as he is not in Amorim’s plans.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim has decided to keep Joshua Zirkzee, despite his tough spell at Old Trafford so far.",
      "Sources state that Zirkzee’s upturn in form has seen him earn a place at United for the full campaign.",
      "Nevertheless, United could still add another centre-forward to their ranks in January, and they are battling Arsenal for a €50m (£44m) Bundesliga hitman."

      "Introducing the Premier League of Christmas Jumpers, a definitive table ranking each Premier League team’s Christmas jumper offering to find the best, the worst, and the tackiest Christmas jumpers money can buy.",
      "We have ranked the jumpers on originality, ugliness, Christmas-feel and more festively vague factors that will almost definitely ruin Christmas for many fans who disagree with our line-up.",
      "Introducing the Premier League of Christmas jumpers 2025:",
      "",
      "1) West Ham’s Christmas collection",
      "The design team at West Ham have been having a lot of fun with their Christmas jumpers and we absolutely approve.",
      "‘Santa is a Hammer’, ‘I’m forever blowing baubles’ and ‘All I Want For Christmas Is WHU’ are inspired choices and the club has even rolled out Jarren Bowen to model the collection.",
      "Tacky, pun-tastic and perfectly blending club-specific chants with a Christmas theme. The Hammers have nailed it.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool’s Candy Cane",
      "Liverpool’s standard Christmas jumper is about as disappointing as an Ibrahim Konate contract saga. It’s a bit red and white with some generic Christmas fare such as snowflakes.",
      "Luckily something is going right at Anfield at the moment because whoever designed the Candy-kit inspired Christmas jumper has knocked it out of the park. It is one of the greatest kits of all time and the white patterns lend themselves perfectly to a Christmas feel.",
      "The kit is completed by the slightly unnecessary word ‘Christmas’ as sponsor and a retro badge. Simple but effective.",
      "",
      "3) Bournemouth’s retro away kit",
      "This is how to do a Christmas jumper. Choose a famous retro away kit, in this case the stunning 1992/94 away shirt, replace anything slightly triangular with Christmas trees and get ready for the orders to flood in.",
      "Bournemouth’s retro jumper is bright, Christmassy and distinctly unflattering. It is a triumph at every level.",
      "",
      "4) Newcastle’s striped monstrosity",
      "Newcastle’s confused striped Christmas jumper gets plenty of points because it is truly ugly, like all Christmas jumpers should be.",
      "The dazzling array of stripes, Christmas tree shapes and snowflakes is certainly dazzling but it does lose points for not even trying to fit in the Newcastle Brown Ale star as some sort of Christmas tree topper.",
      "",
      "5) Everton’s Spirit of the Blues",
      "Everton’s 1998-inspired Christmas jumper and the One2One kit is a nice idea but is slightly ruined by the memory of one of the worst ever Premier League teams to somehow avoid relegation.",
      "Instead, the Spirit of the Blues Christmas jumper is our pick because the song that inspired it is the most Christmassy of all the football chants heard across the Premier League. The ‘woo’ part may baffle opposition fans but it just feels festive. Good work, Everton.",
      "",
      "6) Chillin at Cold Trafford",
      "Despite risking an angry phone call from Cole Palmer’s lawyers, Manchester United have released a fantastically hideous jumper featuring a snowman and the phrase ‘Chillin at Cold Trafford’.",
      "The patchwork style jumper is so bad it’s good and we’re picking this one over the admittedly quite nice red and white jumper featuring the famous statue of George Best, Dennis Law and Sir Bobby Charlton.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal’s Highbury Wonderland",
      "The Arsenal Highbury kit worn during the 2005/6 season is demonstrably one of the greatest Premier League home shirts, helped by the fact it was worn by some of the league’s best ever players.",
      "The Highbury Wonderland jumper based on the kit is quite nice. In fact, it’s too nice. Apart from the reindeer leaping over the Arsenal badge there is no hint of garish Christmas symbolism being crowbarred into a football theme. Disappointing.",
      "",
      "8) Spurs’ retro Christmas jumper",
      "Spurs have the enviable position of playing in all white, making any sort of Christmas design pretty easy. The retro Christmas jumper has plenty of nice touches. The Christmas pudding sponsor, the subtle snowflake pattern and the retro Spurs badge reminding us of happier times at White Hart Lane.",
      "Unfortunately the jumper loses points because it’s trying too hard to look like a football kit. We want snowmen and holly patterns, not nicely striped collars.",
      "",
      "9) Leeds’ Christmas jumper",
      "The Leeds Christmas jumper is quite nice. It has the Yorkshire rose, the club’s foundation date, some reindeer and a few snowflakes in a patchwork pattern.",
      "It is a very run of the mill Christmas jumper slightly ruined by the giant modern Leeds badge on the back. There is nothing particularly offensive by it and it’s a solid mid-table effort.",
      "",
      "10) Chelsea’s Christmas jumper",
      "Chelsea’s Christmas jumper is your bog standard effort. It’s blue and white, with Christmas trees, snowflakes and the Chelsea lion all blended into a neat patchwork design.",
      "It’s just fine. Nothing too exciting, very little design flair, but ticks all the Christmas boxes. Like a Mourinho defence of old this one is playing it safe and grinding out the points in the Christmas jumper table.",
      "",
      "11) Villa Park Christmas jumper",
      "Villa Park is one of the best grounds in the Premier League and it should be celebrated as an old school football stadium with a fantastic atmosphere.",
      "It should not, however, be celebrated on a Christmas jumper. The design is fine in that it features a bit of snow and some snowflakes, but the giant badge and stadium design feels a bit too serious.",
      "",
      "12) Wolves’ Christmas jumper",
      "Wolves offer exactly the same Christmas jumper as Burnley’s sorry effort but there is another option. Like Spurs, Wolves have gone down the classic kit route and the 1982-inspired jumper does have a nice stocking built into the alternative Goodyear logo.",
      "It is a bit bland, featuring no other highlights outside of a subtle snowflake pattern, but the Old Gold does at least feel a bit Christmassy.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester City’s Elf",
      "Manchester City have not really got into the Christmas spirit. There’s a pretty generic City badge design covered in snowflakes and one that features an elf design that is completed with your head when it’s worn.",
      "It’s a tired Christmas jumper trope but this one is saved by the fact the club will done £5 from every sale to support patients and their families at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.",
      "",
      "14) Forest’s Christmas jumper",
      "For a club whose badge is literally a tree crowned by two stars there is a distinct lack of Christmas feel in the fairly tame Forest Christmas jumper.",
      "Turning the badge into the Christmas tree is a missed chance that is so glaring Sean Dyche is probably treating the designers to their very own Gaffer’s Day as a punishment.",
      "The jumper is fine, but lacks any sort of flair. At least Dyche will agree with that bit.",
      "",
      "15) Crystal Palace Christmas jumper",
      "Crystal Palace have had some of the best kits in the Premier League in recent years so we had high hopes for the Christmas jumper of 2025.",
      "Unfortunately it’s a bit of a mess. The blue and red combine to make it seem sort of brown somehow and the design is unimaginative. Christmas jumpers are supposed to look a bit hideous but this one just looks a bit depressing.",
      "A big swing and a miss with the ‘South London and Proud’ slogan instead of something more Christmassy too.",
      "",
      "16) Sunderland Christmas jumper",
      "Sunderland’s jumper is red and white, features the word Sunderland and some half-hearted Christmas patterns.",
      "",
      "17) Burnley’s Christmas jumper",
      "Is there some sort of connection with garden gnomes and Christmas we do not know about? The Burnley Christmas jumper is pretty standard fare until you drill into the details.",
      "It features rows of sort of Christmas-themed images including baubles and snowflakes. Then you get to the aforementioned gnomes. At least they’re holding Christmas presents.",
      "A very confused Christmas jumper from a club that has a jumper aficionado as manager. Disappointing.",
      "",
      "18) Fulham’s Christmas jumper",
      "The same as the Burnley monstrosity, this is just a templated Christmas jumper featuring the baubles, the gnomes and the layered pattern.",
      "Fulham slip into the relegation places because there is too much black compared to Burnley’s slightly more festive effort.",
      "",
      "19) Brentford’s Christmas jumper",
      "The Brentford Christmas jumper is ugly enough to pass as a Christmas jumper but apart from two reindeer either side of the huge Brentford badge, it’s not screaming actual Christmas.",
      "The club has made the choice of using bee patterns instead of snowflakes and while that is unique, it feels more like a spring or summer jumper. And since they don’t exist it means relegation for Brentford.",
      "",
      "20) Brighton’s Christmas jumper",
      "Brighton have used a Millwall-style dark blue for their Christmas jumper and then stuck BHAFC on and done little else with the design.",
      "It is a jumper designed to be trendy and modern, but that is not the point of a Christmas jumper. It should make you look ridiculous at your office party.",
      "As a punishment for taking the task too seriously and ignoring the club’s actual colours, Brighton finish rock bottom of the Christmas jumper table."

      "FC Barcelona are uncertain about signing loanee Marcus Rashford permanently and could send him back to Manchester United at the end of the season, according to reports in Spain.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona on loan from the Red Devils in July and has made 18 appearances for his new club.",
      "The 27-year-old has registered six goals and nine assists this season, helping him return to the England squad as he stakes a claim for a spot in Thomas Tuchel’s 2026 World Cup squad.",
      "After falling out of favour under Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, Rashford shone on loan at Aston Villa during the second half of last season, but upon returning to Old Trafford, he was informed by the Portuguese head coach that he still wasn’t in his plans.",
      "Barcelona were happy to take Rashford on loan for the season and negotiated a buy option believed to be worth around €30million (£26.3m).",
      "That would be viewed as a bargain if not for the England winger’s mammoth £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Rashford’s wage is one of the reasons Barcelona are reluctant to sign him permanently, and Catalan journalist Alfredo Martinez says no decision has been made by the La Liga champions.",
      "“There are voices for and against (his staying),” Martinez explained (quotes via Sport Witness).",
      "“Some don’t want him to stay because Rashford isn’t the type of player who presses high up the pitch, and besides, he has a very high salary. Barcelona is looking, among others, for a left winger, a player to provide cover for Raphinha.”",
      "The Rashford news cycle is…interesting. When he’s fit and flying, there isn’t much noise, but a few poor games in a row and the knives come out.",
      "Spanish media were quick to realise the weight his name carries, reporting back in September that Barcelona wanted to ‘send Rashford home’ after being unconvinced by his performances.",
      "Rashford didn’t help himself with a disciplinary issue before a La Liga game against Getafe later that month, but it wasn’t blown out of proportion and he was swiftly reinstated by Barca boss Hansi Flick.",
      "There were plenty of reports about Rashford’s future in both England and Spain at the time, coinciding with some damning criticism from Manchester United legend Paul Scholes.",
      "While there have been some questionable reports about Rashford’s conduct and relationship with Flick, the Englishman has kept his head down and is enjoying his football in Catalonia.",
      "Since the start of October, he has registered four goals and five assists. But Martinez won’t let good stats get in the way of a good story.",

      "That being said, it’s not impossible that Barcelona genuinely aren’t convinced. But what’s even more likely is that Barca are playing a game to get Rashford for less than the €30m buy option.",
      "Despite Rashford’s good form in Spain, it’s obvious that his Manchester United chapter is over as long as Amorim is in charge, and United’s hierarchy have been very patient with him so far, hinting that there will only be one winner in that battle.",
      "It’s reported in Spain that Barca are scouring the market for alternatives, yet a recent report from the Daily Mirror claimed club president Joan Laporta was delighted with the terms of the buy option, believing it’s a ‘genuine bargain’.",
      "In truth, nobody knows. Not even Laporta knows if it’s a done deal yet. However, what is certain is that Rashford’s name will always be used and exploited for clicks.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford has been ‘offered’ a swap deal involving Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Rashford may not get his permanent move to Barcelona in the summer but PSG have ‘tested’ the Man Utd waters with an intriguing swap offer amid interest from Arsenal.",
      "Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford reportedly had a ‘serious row’ with Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick after Tuesday’s 3-0 loss against Chelsea.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has told the club the value of the transfer of Marcus Rashford would be “great” as the Spanish media have responded poorly to his latest ...",
      "Barcelona reportedly feel Chelsea star Pedro Neto fits perfectly into their system, as there’s uncertainty over the future of Marcus Rashford despite praise from boss Hansi Flick.",

      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",
      "“It’s sad, because I love Neymar. I thought a couple of years ago it’d have been a perfect move because he can still be an amazing player. He could really boost United with his inventiveness and talent.",
      "“I think perhaps the way he has had his career guided needed to be challenged in the past. I don’t know how he can set about putting things right and rebuilding anymore. United need players who will sacrifice themselves for the team, who are in love with the club. I’m not sure Neymar is the man to offer that to United at this point in his career.”",
      "When asked whether Man Utd should go into the transfer market again in January, Saha added: “If they find the right target, yes. If they don’t, they have to take the hit and miss out this winter. The market has not been the easiest one for many years. So they need to take their time, and not act just for the sake of it. They need real purpose in the transfer market.",
      "“They have to be very deliberate about who they recruit. You need to find the right people, the right players. Players need to have a bit of fire to play for Manchester United.",
      "“They need to want to play for Man United more than anything, and this is what they have really done well in the summer. They signed players who really want to play, and don’t think about themselves only.",
      "“So there are elements of joy to see that they’re completely in line with the mission, and the challenge ahead. They’ve stopped looking at players who just see United as a stepping stone. That doesn’t work. I think if they find the right players, they can act, but they don’t need to add players just for the sake of it.”",
      "Neymar has been linked with a transfer to England, Major League Soccer and various other places and former USMNT star Brad Friedel has suggested he could link up with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at Inter Miami.",
      "Friedel told Goal: “If Neymar is fit, then I think it works, I really do because he’s still a huge name in certain parts of the US. The trouble is if he’s not fit and he’s injured a lot, then it becomes a negative media-driven reality. I can understand arguments on both sides for sure.",
      "“I would assume, and these are smart guys, it would be a tiered contract based on performances and being fit. Having spent some time in Miami, before Messi came you wouldn’t have really known that Miami had a team. From the time that he came, there are pink and black shirts everywhere. If Neymar came, it would add to that.”",

      "Arne Slot finally bowed to the inevitable and dropped a misfiring, underperforming Mo Salah from his Premier League starting XI at the weekend.",
      "And the Liverpool boss was instantly rewarded with victory (albeit a victory carrying a powerful West Ham caveat) which prompted us to wonder which other misfiring, underperforming regulars around the Premier League should be far more droppable than they apparently are.",
      "We set ourselves what was in hindsight a quite stupidly restrictive benchmark of 10 Premier League starts, which does mean some of these end up being quite harsh.",
      "But the point is to be looking at apparent undroppables who perhaps shouldn’t be quite so undroppable; doesn’t really work if they aren’t in fact starting nearly all the games, does it? At least try to bear that in mind before getting all angried up below the fold, yeah?",
      "",
      "Just an endlessly fascinating goalkeeper but one who probably does need withdrawing from the limelight for a bit, for his own good as much as anything else.",
      "We didn’t particularly care for the spectacle of his own fans – and not a small minority, either – booing him after his absolute catastrof*ck against Fulham. But that explosion of frustration and anger had been bubbling up over the course of an increasingly error-riddled season.",
      "The thing with Vicario is that the saves he makes are often logic-defyingly outstanding. Put him in a situation where a striker has the ball six yards in front of him with nobody else around, and you can back Vicario confidently to do something absurd to keep the ball out of his goal.",
      "But send a shot vaguely towards the middle of the net from 20-odd yards, and as often as not he’ll make it look absolutely unstoppable.",
      "And that’s before the Fulham unpleasantness. Wherever you stand on Vicario, what he absolutely is not, for better or worse, is a keeper who goes unnoticed. And for so many reasons he just feels far more of an Angeball keeper than a Frankball one.",
      "The problem here is that his understudy Antonin Kinsky is basically a younger, less experienced Vicario clone. So we don’t really know what to suggest.",
      "",
      "West Ham have been largely rotten this season, the tentative signs of life in recent weeks under Nuno Espirito Santo washed away by an inexplicably and pretty much indefensibly soporific and passive display against a Liverpool team absolutely there to be got at.",
      "Paqueta is far from alone in underperforming for the Hammers this season, but as a senior pro getting a second chance many thought he would never get, you’d like to see a bit more than we’ve seen so far.",
      "And that was before Not Contributing Much gave way to Active Sabotage against Liverpool as utter and complete headloss saw him talk his way into two yellow cards in the space of a minute.",
      "It was already wearying enough for a player with Paqueta’s history to have got himself suspended for collecting five bookings in the space of seven games; to then get himself so pointlessly and needlessly suspended again immediately on his return is just unforgivable.",
      "",
      "Eleven Premier League starts, each of them lasting at least 67 minutes. Two chunky half-hourish cameos off the bench in Villa’s other games. And still only the one single, solitary goal to show for it despite Villa’s general resurgence.",
      "Funny thing is that the one goal he did score might be the single most significant, sliding-doors goal anyone has scored this season anywhere.",
      "It might not have helped Watkins himself, it turns out, but it has thoroughly transformed the trajectory of Villa’s season.",
      "Before that goal, Villa were winless through five games. The goal they’d scored in a disappointing 1-1 draw at 10-man Sunderland the previous weekend was the only one they’d managed in five limp efforts.",
      "And then they found themselves 1-0 down at home to Fulham on matchday six with an entire season – an entire project – seemingly circling the drain.",
      "But from nowhere, Watkins lifted a shot over Bernd Leno to bring Villa level. They went on to win 3-1, and have won six of seven Premier League matches since.",
      "The cruellest of ironies indeed that this transformative goal has done two-fifths of f*ck all for the fortunes of the scorer himself.",
      "",
      "Salah has fallen. Could the other grand pillar of Modern Liverpool really be next?",
      "It does feel wholly unsustainable for Slot to persist with his present course of simply having the visibly creaking 34-year-old play every single minute of every single game in both the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "It should be noted that most of Van Dijk’s Liverpool career has been spent under the weight of such demands, and in his prime, in his absolute pomp, it was a responsibility and workload in which he clearly and demonstrably revelled.",
      "But we are no longer talking about Absolute Pomp Van Dijk. And he looks awful tired.",
      "",
      "The biggest beneficiary of United’s European failure and Carabao humiliation, with the resulting one-game-a-week schedule allowing the oft-brittle Shaw to start every Premier League game this season in his now familiar left-of-the-back-three position.",
      "But that record is about to collide head on with the Busy Festive Period, the glorious month of December in which even titchy little clubs like United with no other competitions to worry about find themselves facing another game every three or four days and no real clue who they’ll be playing from one game to the next and then also playing the same team twice in the space of about a fortnight for some reason.",
      "Can Shaw really continue to be relied upon in every game? The extreme levels of weariness on display against the 10 men of Everton last week rather suggest not.",
      "",
      "Let’s be entirely fair about it; this one would have been far more valid a month ago than it is now. In a way, the sight of a previously struggling Gibbs-White scoring in three straight games should perhaps make us rethink this entire feature. Maybe they all just need more time. But we’re not doing that. We are not in the business of learning things here.",
      "None of the other players on this list have Gibbs-White’s mitigation, for one thing, of starting the season on the back of a deeply bizarre summer in which he thought he was joining Tottenham (lucky escape etc. and so forth ho ho ho) only to then sign a new contract announced in a video alongside Mr Marinakis that definitely wasn’t unsettling or strange at all.",
      "The recent goals have coincided with Forest’s recent resurgence under Sean Dyche, but they do still also mask to some extent a significant reduction in Gibbs-White’s role as this team’s creative spark. Having hit double figures for assists last season, he has just one to his name so far in this campaign.",
      "",
      "Perhaps the clearest indicator of the difference between Bournemouth last season and Bournemouth this season is the fact Senesi has already racked up more Premier League minutes in 25/26 (1158) than in the entirety of 24/25 (1107).",
      "He’s not been bad, per se, it’s just that as the one constant in a defence that has now shipped 12 goals in four winless games, it does start to draw attention. Feels like maybe it’s time to try something else.",
      "And Andoni Iraola has no choice now anyway; the defeat at Sunderland from 2-0 up was disastrous for many reasons, but disciplinary chaos was high on the list. For the second Premier League game in a row, Senesi picked up a booking in injury-time, taking him to the five-card suspension threshold which will see him join Lewis Cook and David Brooks on the naughty step for the midweek Everton game.",
      "Veljko Milosavljevic, this is your time to shine.",
      "",
      "So anonymous even in the impressive victory at Tottenham that Spurs fans didn’t even remember to boo him for being Arsenal. In fairness they were a bit preoccupied booing their own players, but they did still remember when Emile Smith Rowe came on. And Emile Smith Rowe has sadly become a byword for anonymous.",
      "Iwobi has started every single game for Fulham this season as he closes in on reaching the 100 Premier League appearances landmark for a third top-flight club, but hasn’t contributed either a goal or assist since the 3-1 win over Brentford in September, which is eight games ago now.",
      "",
      "Harsh and vindictive to single Joao Gomes out, but Wolves are at the stage where trying almost anything they haven’t already attempted feels like it doesn’t really have any significant downside. What’s the worst thing that can actually happen next to a team with two points from 13 games?",
      "Basically, nobody wants to be the player with the most minutes in a side that has lost 11 Premier League games before the advent calendars come out. You do start to look like a bit of an albatross, even if that’s not really very fair.",
      "Statistically, though, the evidence suggests that instead of dropping Gomes, Rob Edwards should actually make him captain. Wolves’ points per game rockets from 0.15 all the way up to 1.00 when Gomes has the armband. Although one game is admittedly a small sample size.",
      "",
      "And again. Is this particularly fair? No. But have Leeds lost six of their last seven Premier League games meaning that at this time only Wolves are less sh*t? Yes.",
      "So we’re once again in ‘can’t really make things worse’ territory. There are three contenders in the Leeds squad and our airily dismissive snap judgement is that Bogle has been less good than Joe Rodon and they’ve already tried leaving Gabriel Gudmundsson out in the Man City game, with, well, quite confusing results given he came on just after Leeds had somehow got that game back to 2-2.",
      "But that ultimately futile comeback after leaving out a previous ever-present surely only shows proof of concept for trying it again, doesn’t it? Against a team that maybe isn’t Man City? When you need a tenth name for a feature: yes, yes it does.",
      "Move over Jurrien Timber and Eberechi Eze and welcome Daniel Munoz and Phil Foden. Manchester City are the great entertainers.",
      "Liverpool were rotten once again as they picked up just a point v Sunderland, while Aston Villa are the best team in the land.",
      "Ian Wright gets lauded for doing what parents of toddlers and friends of p***heads do every day as the Daily Mail curry favour.",
      "Winning trophies is a very good thing to do. It is nice and fun and good and teams should definitely be trying to do it. But Spurs? Has that worked?",
      "Suddenly, Aston Villa have gone from surprise candidates for relegation to ‘dark horses’ for the Premier League title. It’s quite the turnaround…",
      "Oliver Glasner will obviously leave Crystal Palace at some point. It has to happen. But *how* it happens matters more than *when* – and here’s why."

      "Just some responses to today’s mailbox. Firstly Mr Garey Vance. He says that Amorim used his halftime talk to inspire urgency. Fair point but that undermines the “whole coaching them all week” point you made. What was he coaching them? Because it wasn’t urgency against a team that played in Europe on Thursday. We were the team who looked like we had played in midweek such was our apparent apathy and lack of urgency. Why do we need to sacrifice a whole half for the manager to get this team to do what he had a whole week to prepare for?",
      "Also if looking at your bench and choosing the only non-youth team player who can play striker because of an injury is management then I’m expecting a call up any day now. I will concede that the Mount pick was good but again those two goals came from two moments of individual genius from dead ball situations. Like I said up until the 76th-ish minute the only touch we had in the opposition box was Zirkzee’s goal.",
      "And this domination you’re talking about was not part of the game I watched because we were under siege in the last ten minutes or so and Opta (however much weight you’d like to give them) showed that except for 15 minutes, it was Palace who were the more threatening team. We were lucky not to be 3-0 down at half time with Mateta just squeezing one wide and that Palace shot from a long throw in that went straight at Lammens.",
      "Sorry mate. I really do want to celebrate a United win but this win had some SERIOUS caveats attached to it and we as United fans shouldn’t be happy with a band aid victory after that Everton defeat where Amorim REFUSED to change shape and left us with 5 at the back against ten men.",
      "Andreas Hasle makes some excellent points and I agree with almost his whole email. One thing I absolutely agree has to be changed in the PL and football in general is the after shot tackle as he mentions about Konsa. How a player is allowed to absolutely plough into an attacker and face no censure after the player has taken his shot is completely ridiculous. I don’t know why it’s allowed and honestly it’s ridiculous and dangerous. But I suppose asking for refereeing consistency and accountability is tilting at windmills in the extreme",

Anything Mikel. Please.",

I wondered before the game if having two away matches back-to-back would help – all other recent losses away have been followed by a home match, so the tired line was repeated about ‘putting things right’ which you can’t do by retreating back to your comfort zone. We’ll never know but psychologically I wonder if going straight to another hostile stadium and tough opponent was what changed the mentality from seeking comfort to sharpening focus.",
      "The Pope decision being taken out of Howe’s hands due to injury was helpful. Burn being trusted at CB showed us again that he is an outstanding defender in the right position, but that cannot be full back where Hall was excellent and brings so much to the attack that Burn cannot. Thiaw is just in that kind of form top CBs can get into – imperious in defence but in the right place in attack – peak Van Dijk, Dias & Gabriel have shown how much impact that kind of defender can have at both ends of the pitch, we have to keep him fit.",

I wasn’t reading too much into Tonali not playing as he needs a rest but if Bruno is left to do all the playmaking we’ve seen that doesn’t work, Miley helped balance that and Joelinton was very impressive in the 2nd half. Now we know we can rotate in midfield we need to see more of it.",
      "Woltemade’s finish was filthy, but like the City game he played better overall, had more chances and if anything looks more of a threat than those earlier games where he was scoring maybe from one chance. And Elanga gave what was comfortably his best performance. He should have done better with that first chance in the first few seconds of the game, but tactically he was very good and that was key to a very good team performance. Getting his first assist will help I’m sure.",
      "Only downside is how dependent we are on Hall and Livramento staying fit in order to play as we did against Everton and against City. Lovely when they are together but if either is out our other options at FB cannot offer the same mobility, drive and dynamism. We need another left back as Burn should not be the first choice back up.",
      "What I love about Howe is that he does change things. He might wait a bit too long and he seems reactive rather than proactive, but he will adapt. Contrast that with Amorim who won’t change a thing regardless of circumstances and I can only give my opinion that Howe will outlast Amorim as a top coach. I wrote in a couple of weeks ago saying this period will make or break the season and Howe’s reputation and I stand by that, but we’ve got a home match against a Spurs team who are at a very low ebb tomorrow, win that and its three league wins back-to-back, with another home game against Burnley at the weekend.\nJames, Leeds",

      "“A young talent is coming and Manchester United hope he could be the new Caicedo or this kind of deal for the future,” Romano said on his Here We Go Podcast.",
      "“Of course, it’s about potential and developing this boy, but his name is ‘Cristian Orozco’.",
      "“The club believes they found a hidden gem.”",
      "Man Utd are also looking to sign a more established midfielder to strengthen in this department and it has been widely reported that Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba are among their targets.",
      "Now, a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Man Utd are ‘preparing an offer’ worth 70 million euros (£61.5m) to sign Wharton, who has become their ‘priority target’.",
      "The report claims.",
      "‘Wharton represents an ideal profile: energy, stamina, good positional awareness, and vision for distributing the ball. Therefore, United seem prepared to pay a hefty sum and make a move in the next transfer window.",
      "‘Crystal Palace have valued Adam Wharton at over £70 million; some sources put his value closer to £80-100 million. Furthermore, the player’s representatives have made it clear that he will only consider a move if his next destination guarantees him European football. As Manchester United await Champions League or Europa League qualification, any approach must come with that commitment.’",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank is not in immediate danger of losing his job but has been given a timeline to improve Spurs’ form, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are set to break their transfer record next summer on one of two players as they look to bring in a new midfielder, according to reports.",
      "England international Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly edging closer to leaving Manchester United, who have already ‘sealed’ a January signing.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on head coach Arne Slot’s situation at Liverpool after they were beaten 4-1 by PSV Eindhoven.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are not prepared to stand still as they are plotting a £133m double deal and a key player has “signed” a new contract.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed Real Madrid’s stance on sacking head coach Xabi Alonso after it was reported that he faces a player ‘revolt’."

      "United fought back from a goal down to secure an away win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday but continue to be held back by inconsistency under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "They have managed to beat both Liverpool and Chelsea this season but the embarrassment of their defeat to 10-man Everton is still fresh in the memories of fans and Amorim.",
      "The signings of Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have added quality to their forward ranks, with Amad also providing some sparkling displays and, although they sit seventh in the Premier League, the gap to Manchester City in second is only four points.",
      "When asked about the level at which United will be competing in two years' time, Amad said: \"Honestly, why not winning the league? Dreaming is possible, no?\"",
      "Mbeumo added: \"If you come to Manchester United, you want to win titles and the Premier League is one of them, so why not?\"",
      "Amorim took charge of his 40th Premier League match against Palace and averages 1.18 points per game, which remains significantly lower than previous boss Erik ten Hag's record of 1.72 points per game.",
      "However, results and performances have improved this term with United taking 21 points from 13 games at a rate of 1.61 per game.",
      "Amad believes the team is moving in the right direction under Amorim, having changed their mindset following last season's record-low 15th-placed Premier League finish.",
      "He said: \"From my personal side, I think we are improving a lot, especially as a team, because I can remember last season some of the games weren't easy for us.",
      "\"We were going into games already thinking we lost the game, but this season is different. Different mindset, different energy.",
      "\"We go to the game and we feel we can win this game, so I think we are improving and the staff also are helping us to make that step.",
      "\"We are not really happy where we are in the table we are right now, but we will improve. What I can say, I'm sure we will do much better for the next game.",
      "\"I think we are a different team now. We know this season is different than last season. We play one game a week, so we have to try to do better every game.",
      "\"The mindset is positive in the dressing room. We are a different team. Bruno [Fernandes] is a leader, [Harry] Maguire, everyone, even Bryan.",
      "\"I think the energy is positive. Honestly, it's much, much better than last season. Like I say, we want to do better every game and I promise we will.\"",
      "Mbeumo, a summer signing from Brentford, has adapted quickly to life at United and is the club's top scorer in the Premier League this season with five goals.",
      "Despite making the transition from west London to Manchester look easy, Mbeumo reveals it's been anything but.",
      "He said: \"First of all, it's not been easy at all.",
      "\"I think I just rely on the hard work, on training, even outside of the pitch, what I'm doing on the side to put every chance for me to do well here. The whole team has helped me a lot to grow as a player here, to find my place and find my place with the team.\"",
      "Amad and Mbeumo have forged a strong understanding on United's right, playing as wing-back and winger respectively and combining to good effect in the final third.",
      "Their chemistry was on show when Amad assisted Mbeumo for the opening goal in the 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield. They combined again for the opener in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham.",
      "\"We have a good relationship,\" said Mbeumo.",
      "\"He helped me when I came, obviously we speak the same language, so it was easier for me to go with him. He was telling me a bit how it was working here as well, so I think we built the relationship from the first day.\"",
      "He added: \"We speak the same language, so it's easier to find the links because we can talk about what happened, even during the game it's easier because sometimes he wants the ball somewhere, so I know and for me it's the same.",
      "\"Even after the game we can discuss about some offensive play that could have been better.\"",
      "The pair will hope to continue building their mutual understanding at home to West Ham on Thursday as Manchester United aim to build on their comeback win over Palace.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek...",
      "Arsenal keep rolling in an efficient and relentless manner.",
      "Mikel Arteta's men are now unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions, their longest streak under the Spaniard, and they're doing it with a defensive base that is as sturdy as anything in Europe.",
      "In fact, Arsenal boast the most clean sheets (7) and joint-fewest defeats (1) across all competitions in Europe's major leagues - elite numbers that tell you precisely where their authority lies.",
      "And Brentford are exactly the sort of team Arsenal tend to keep at arm's length.",
      "Arsenal and under 3.5 goals has landed in nine of their last 15 Premier League outings. That's the pattern. Professional wins.",
      "No need for fireworks when discipline and dominance will do, and that bet is on offer at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Ezri Konsa has quietly become one of the Premier League's most adept players at winning fouls. The numbers make the case: Konsa has been fouled at least twice in six of his last 11 starts, and across the season he's averaging 1.6 fouls drawn per game.",
      "Konsa's role under Unai Emery is tailor-made for drawing pressure. He steps into midfield, he drives into space and he becomes the trigger point for opposition presses.",
      "Konsa is on offer at 5/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls - it's a price that hasn't fully caught up with the player's true foul-drawing ability.",
      "Crystal Palace are giving off uneasy vibes - even for a fixture of this winnable magnitude.",
      "On the pitch, they remain a team with so much going for them but the mood music in the background is beginning to change. Oliver Glasner isn't exactly hiding his frustration with the lack of ambition being shown above him, and when a manager starts sounding such soundbites, it rarely stays contained.",
      "You don't need a psychology degree to know how quickly that can seep into a dressing room. Players can sense uncertainty. And suddenly a team that should be bullying lesser opposition becomes tentative and starts to feel that extra workload in their legs the world has been talking about.",
      "A draw looks on the cards, with Burnley on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet looking a bet with potential.",
      "Wolves and their increased threat from set pieces under Rob Edwards remains a betting angle to explore.",
      "Yerson Mosquera has the attributes to be a big threat from such situations - he's tall, athletic and aerially competitive - and those qualities have been spotted by Edwards, based on how prominent Mosquera was in Wolves' set-piece structure in the defeat at Villa.",
      "The defender had two shots there and was denied a goal by a save-of-the-season contender from Emiliano Martinez. If Edwards rinses and repeats those set-piece routines, then Mosquera is great value in the shots market where he's Evens with Sky Bet to have one or more shots.",
      "Football seasons aren't defined by the headline fixtures like beating Liverpool at home and grabbing a point with 10 men against Arsenal. Those moments can create momentum and belief but they don't win titles. What does define a challenger for top honours are the awkward and gritty away days where the favourites must prove their resilience rather than their brilliance. And Chelsea's visit to Elland Road falls into that category. Win here and a title push could be on.",
      "If Chelsea are genuine title contenders then these are the games they must navigate. It's easy to raise your levels for Liverpool and Arsenal, it's far harder to reproduce that clarity when you're getting hunted by a team whose primary motivation is to make your evening a miserable one. This could be a fiddly fixture for Chelsea. The draw looks the bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "If you've been riding the Liverpool goals conceded train in recent weeks, Sunday's 2-0 stroll against a meek and mild West Ham shouldn't spook you off the scent.",
      "One clean sheet against a side seemingly allergic to progressive passes doesn't suddenly fix what has become a very clear trend in that Liverpool are conceding big chances - and plenty of them. Only West Ham, Burnley, Manchester United and Everton are conceding more than Liverpool (23).",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have shipped 16 goals.",
      "The aura of defensive invincibility that Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate once radiated has dimmed.",
      "Sunderland tick the exact boxes Liverpool have struggled with in that they're energetic, press with enthusiasm and attack space quickly when it's there. They don't need to dominate the game to score. All this adds up to both teams to score and over 2.5 goals being a nice slice of value at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen to score at 3/1 with Sky Bet is a generous gift from the traders at Sky Bet. An early Christmas present perhaps.",
      "Bowen is the spark in this West Ham side. He leads the way for shot-creating actions, progressive carries, ball progression and shots on target - Bowen does it all. When West Ham manage to pose a threat, it often goes through him.",
      "Manchester United have kept just two clean sheets in their last 21 games and there remain big structural issues in defence, with no authority in key areas.",

      "Arsenal were not themselves at Chelsea. They were off the pace at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Several misplaced passes in the build-up phase and they lost the duel battle to Chelsea. They lost two-thirds of their first 24 duels in the opening quarter of the game, while they only won one of the first 10 aerial duels.",
      "There were several factors behind it. Chelsea played well - having had an extra day to prepare after their midweek European action - while the absences of William Saliba and Gabriel filtered throughout the team to create an unconvincing display.",
      "It has also been a busy schedule. \"It's been a big week,\" said Mikel Arteta after overcoming the triple header of Spurs, Bayern Munich and the Blues last week. So is it time for the Arsenal manager to rotate?",
      "Wednesday night's visit of Brentford may be a good opportunity to give minutes to those who need it, but more crucially rest those who have been called upon a lot.",
      "For example, Ben White could come in for Jurrien Timber. The likes of Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres are aiming for first starts after injury. Even Christian Norgaard, against his former club, and Ethan Nwaneri could be called upon.",
      "Brentford's record against the bigger sides makes them a decent test so there cannot be wholesale changes. But one thing the Bees are good at is winning duels via first and second balls. Arsenal will need fresh legs more than on-pitch quality.Sam Blitz",
      "Liverpool vs Sunderland - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "It cannot just be a coincidence that Liverpool kept their first Premier League clean sheet since they beat Aston Villa a month ago - and only their third all season in the top flight - in their much-needed win at West Ham United on Sunday in a game that also saw Joe Gomez make his first league start in almost a year, incidentally also in a victory at the London Stadium.",
      "Despite a series of calamitous recent defensive displays, including a 3-0 loss to struggling Nottingham Forest, followed by a 4-1 defeat to PSV Eindhoven - both at Anfield - in the lead-up to the game, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot had been stubbornly resisting calls to start Gomez, who has been carrying a slight knee niggle of late.",
      "But the versatile 28-year-old returned on the right-hand side of the champions' defence in east London, with the Reds immediately looking more assured at the back, with no visiting player making more interceptions, while he also created their second goal for Coady Gakpo.",
      "Fitness permitting, expect Liverpool's long-serving player to still be in the hosts' starting line-up when high-flying Sunderland visit Anfield.",
      "Richard Morgan",
      "Burnley vs Crystal Palace - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Only two Premier League teams have missed more than 25 big chances this season - Crystal Palace are one of them.",
      "With 26, Palace have a major problem with converting the big opportunities they are managing to create.",
      "Oliver Glasner bemoaned his side's lack of business, calling for some level of sympathy as his side tired in their defeat to Manchester United. However, in their ascendancy, Palace failed to capitalise on a rampant first half, which could be costing them more than their squad depth.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta, who took his tally of big chances missed up to 12 against United, is only behind Erling Haaland for big chances spurned.",
      "Creativity was the main concern for Palace when Eberechi Eze moved on to pastures new in the summer. However, creating isn't what's holding Palace back; it's their inability to score.",
      "Burnley will provide the sternest test of Palace's ability to find the back of the net. Scott Parker's Clarets have the league's highest expected goals against with 28.79, meaning - on paper - there will be ample opportunity to exorcise their big-chance demons.William Bitibiri",
      "Wolves vs Nottingham Forest - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Wolves are in trouble. As we enter the final month of the year, they remain winless. It's a dismal start that has seen their foreheads pressed against the barrel of a relegation to the Championship.",
      "Defeat at Forest would mean that they have lost seven straight matches in the top flight.",
      "The last time the club fell to that many defeats was during the 2011/12 season, during Terry Connor's infamous reign, which was an all-time low in a relegation season.",
      "The records are likely to compound if fortunes fail to turn at Molineux. Wolves are on target to lose 32 matches this season.",
      "Derby County in 2007/08, statistically the Premier League's worst team, had six points recorded by this point while Wolves have two. They are on track to take Derby's crown.",
      "Only once has a team recorded lass than two points at this stage in Premier League history and that was Sheffield Wednesday, who had one and were ultimately relegated. While the chances of a Wolves survival remain slim, fans will hope to retain some semblance of respectability starting with Forest on Wednesday.William Bitibiri",
      "Leeds vs Chelsea - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "This is a fixture packed with history - and plenty of thumping tackles and intensity. The 1970 FA Cup final replay was the most fearsome of all but expect another boiling hot atmosphere at Elland Road when the sides meet again on Wednesday.",
      "Can Enzo Maresca's side keep their heads in the pressure cooker?",
      "The midfielder will be suspended for the Leeds trip but ill-discipline is becoming a theme for this Chelsea team. There have been six red cards shown to Chelsea players this season. Their four in the Premier League is twice as many as any other side.",
      "Even Maresca has served a suspension after being sent to the stands for his jubilant celebrations of Estevao's last-gasp winner against Liverpool.",
      "It's a concern which really came into focus at the back end of last season, when Nicolas Jackson saw red at Newcastle, Chelsea were beaten, and the race for a Champions League place was went right down to the wire.",
      "Against Arsenal, Chelsea battled valiantly with 10 players. A point gained? Or was it two dropped, given how they had started the derby with 11?",
      "There's a lot to like about the team Maresca has built at Chelsea - but they can be their own worst enemy and must keep the focus to maintain their positive start to the season at Leeds.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton vs Aston Villa - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Brighton's unbeaten home record faces its toughest test yet with the visit of in-form Aston Villa.",
      "Both sides started the campaign slowly, earning just one win between them from their opening five games, but now they're firmly in the race for European football.",
      "Villa recorded their fifth clean sheet of the season on Sunday and have the second-best defensive record in the division, although at the other end of the pitch, they're not having so much joy.",
      "They're second bottom for xG while Ollie Watkins has scored just once and was dropped for the victory at Wolves, with Donyell Malen preferred. The quick turnaround may see Watkins reintroduced from the start.",
      "There's been no such issues for Brighton striker Danny Welbeck, who has only been getting better at 35. His seven goals, combined with the efforts of Yankuba Minteh, have powered Fabian Hurzeler's side up the table.",
      "The winger has the second-most assists and touches in the opposition box in the league, with only Jeremy Doku and Mohammed Kudus having completed more dribbles. Villa's defence will have to be at its best.David Richardson",
      "Man Utd vs West Ham - Thursday, kick-off 8pm",
      "Manchester United may have picked up a crucial away win at Selhurst Park on Sunday, but Old Trafford will be expecting far more come Thursday night.",
      "The embarrassment that was the defeat to 10-man Everton will still be at the forefront of the minds of the fans and Ruben Amorim.",
      "The performance and the way Everton kept out a limp Red Devils provides Nuno Espirito Santo with the blueprint for how to get a result. That means there has to be a marked change from the hosts, perhaps even in personnel.",
      "United are expected to dominate the ball against the team who have had less possession in all but two of their away Premier League games this term. The anomalies being against promoted sides.",
      "Amorim will need players on the pitch who can break down the Hammers. That may present an opportunity to Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The 20-year-old has only been afforded 171 minutes in the Premier League this season. It is a far cry from the role he had at the time of scoring the winning goal in the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "However, United have consistently struggled with breaking down low blocks and Amorim won't change his system.",
      "If his stubbornness on the front is going to persist, the dice needs to be rolled one way or another.",
      "There is a question as to whether the defensive presence of Casemiro is as vital for this game compared to against the likes of Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle later this month.",
      "Keeping the Brazilian fresh for those must be a priority, so the door may open for Mainoo to make his first league start of the season and show once and for all he is deserving of more from Amorim heading into 2026.",

      "Sunday 30 November 2025 18:27, UK",
      "Mason Mount saved Manchester United from a further inquest when he fired home in a  2-1 comeback victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "The midfielder rifled in from a well-worked set-piece after being teed up by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "That goal, Mount's second of the season, came minutes after Joshua Zirkzee ended a year-long wait for a Premier League goal with a finish from what looked like an impossible angle.",
      "With a combined xG of 0.05, United completed a second-half turnaround in a game that, before the halftime whistle, offered very little hope for Ruben Amorim's side. The Portuguese boss was critical of their display in the early exchanges in his post-match, saying his side \"cannot play like that in the Premier League\".",
      "Crystal Palace:  Henderson (4), Munoz (5), Richards (6), Lacroix (6), Guehi (6), Mitchell (5), Wharton (6), Kamada (6), Pino (6), Sarr (5), Mateta (7)\n\n\nSubs:  Lerma (5), Nketiah (4), Uche (6), Hughes (6), Devenny (6).\n\n\n Man Utd:  Lammens (5), Dalot (5), Yoro (3), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Amad (6), Casemiro (5), Bruno Fernandes (7), Mbeumo (6), Mount (8), Zirkzee (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Mazraoui (6), Martinez (n/a), Dorgu (n/a), Mainoo (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mason Mount",
      "United were outclassed and outfought by Palace in the opening 45 minutes despite showing early promise when Dean Henderson denied Casemiro an early goal with a smart stop. Amorim watched on as his side generated just 0.01 expected goals without set-pieces.",
      "In a run of play that summed up United's sorry showing, Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta in the area to give away a sure penalty.",
      "Having initially sent Senne Lammens the wrong way, Mateta had to do the same again after being adjudged to have touched the ball twice by VAR.",
      "More chances followed for Palace in the first half with Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw called upon to make huge interventions to prevent further damage.",
      "Amorim could be seen anxiously pacing in the mixed zone during the half-time break, taking a moment before what would have been his most significant talk to his players, hoping to avoid a repeat of Monday's hopeless showing against the 10 men of Everton.",
      "Whatever he said worked, helping United end a run of three without a win to move up to sixth, above Palace who are denied a place in the top four. Amorim also becomes the first United boss to win at Selhurst Park since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020.",
      "Manchester United must figure out a way to overcome their Jekyll and Hyde complex. Ruben Amorim's side were nowhere near it in the first half at Crystal Palace.",
      "They lacked energy, belief and any ideas as they were under the pump at Selhurt Park. But then a moment of magic from Joshua Zirkzee changed it all.",
      "Across the season, United's starts have been fairly positive and where United have typically found their joy.",
      "However, they have failed to sustain their early displays. In recent performances, United have been far more effective in the second half; their problem, though, is their slow starts.",
      "The defensive numbers are where the difference is stark. Across United's first 11 games this season, in the first half, they had an expected goals against of 5.71. This changed in the second half where that number nearly doubled to 11.07.",
      "However, in their last two games, at Palace and in defeat to Everton, United have a first-half expected goals against of 1.26, while after the break, this number massively decreases to 0.26.",
      "It's important to note that in both games United fell behind in the first half, therefore were naturally more attack-minded in the second period.",
      "However, there's a clue in the numbers that Amorim's team are a different side when they go ahead early, like they did eight times in their first 11 league games, compared to when they concede early on.",
      "Perhaps there are signs of complacency in their leads that Amorim has to fix while also finding a way to motivate faster starts.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"It [Joshua Zirkzee's goal] was really important.",
      "\"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half, he struggled in the duels, and he won some duels in the second half.",
      "\"And we improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. And that is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We played better because Josh played better in the second half.",
      "\"I just said to the players [at half time] we need to be more alive, and you can feel that. So if you are more alive, you are in more places, you are near the ball more often and I think everyone did that.",
      "\"But we also need to understand that the opponent was tired in the second half. And when you increase the rhythm and the opponent gets tired a little bit, suffers a goal right away, you feel that we had the control of the game and that's it.\"",
      "Asked whether he felt his side would come back, Amorim said:",
      "\"I felt that because I had the feeling, if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box.",
      "\"And you can feel it, the way they move, that they were getting tired for the second half.",
      "\"We talked about that and again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League.",
      "\"So we increased that and I had the feeling, we had the feeling that if we score one goal, this is going to change completely.\"",
      "\"Ismaila Sarr has been, by far and away, one of Crystal Palace's standout players since he arrived at the club from Marseille in August 2024. The numbers speak for themselves: 66 appearances, 20 goals, 10 assists.",
      "\"But he may well have played his last game of the year for Oliver Glasner's side.",
      "\"The Senegal forward went down under a challenge from Luke Shaw inside the first four minutes at Selhurst Park and made a motion with his hand as if to suggest he had twisted his ankle. He lasted just over half an hour more, before being replaced by Eddie Nketiah.",
      "\"Asked about Sarr's condition in his post-match press conference, Glasner said: \"The ankle is quite swollen, so I think he will miss a few games, maybe the whole time until he goes to AFCON.\"",
      "\"Senegal start their AFCON campaign on December 23, when they face Botswana in Tangier, Morocco. If Pape Thiaw's side make it as far as the final, Sarr would not return to domestic action until late January or early February.",
      "\"Glasner has already made it clear Palace must strengthen in January, with an attacker at the top of his shopping list - and now it appears to be even more imperative than before.\"",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner:",
      "\"What disappointed me? Almost everything.",
      "\"Conceding two goals from set-plays, three of the last four goals being conceded from set-plays. That makes it really frustrating, because I think we played a very good first half, and deserved to have the lead.",
      "\"I can't remember a big chance from open play in the whole game.",
      "\"We are not fresh enough in many games and the energy level dropped, but I think we made it just harder for us because we conceded these two goals.",
      "\"In the situation we are in now, it looked like it was tough, but I think, at the end, we tried everything.",
      "\"We had a few set-plays as well, an even better situation, the free-kick. But we missed it, they took it, and so that's why we lost it.\"",
