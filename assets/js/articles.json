      "Manchester United are hopeful of agreeing a deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo in time for him to start pre-season with them. United submitted a second bid for Mbeumo, understood to be £55million, with the delay in concluding the deal down to agreeing the add-ons involved.",
      "Brentford are said to want the total deal to potentially reach as much as £63m, more than the £62.5m United paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha. Mbeumo wants to make the move to United, despite his former Brentford boss Thomas Frank being keen on reuniting with him at his new club Tottenham.",
      "Personal terms between United and Mbeumo are understood to have been agreed, with the 25-year-old set to earn around £200,000-a-week. United return for pre-season training on July 7 and boss Ruben Amorim wants Mbeumo on board to start then, along with Cunha, to give them sufficient time to integrate into their new squad.",
      "Mbeumo, who joined Brentford for £5.8m from French side Troyes in 2019, scored 20 goals and provided eight assists last season to help the Bees finish 10th in the Premier League - five places above United.",
      "Having signed Cunha, United identified winger Mbeumo as their next summer signing, with Amorim and the club looking to offload current wide men Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "United are also looking to sign a striker to lead their attack, but failed in their pursuit of Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea from Ipswich, while Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres prefers a move to Arsenal, where he can continue to play in the Champions League.",
      "For only the second time in 35 years, United will not play European football next season, after losing the Europa League final to Spurs, who will compete in the Champions League under Frank. It was Frank who urged Brentford to demand a sizeable fee for the French-born Cameroon international after his stellar season for the Bees.",
      "As quoted by Tipsbladet before joining Tottenham, the former Brentford manager said: \"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",
      "\"There is a reason why he costs X number of million pounds, and we do not have X number of million pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",
      "\"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\""

      "Paul Ince believes that Manchester United should look to sign Ollie Watkins this summer. The Red Devils have been working hard to improve Ruben Amorim's squad since the opening of the transfer window, securing Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5million move earlier this month.",
      "Recruiting proven firepower is thought to be a priority at Old Trafford in the coming months, given that Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee failed to have much of an impact in the Premier League in 2024/25 - scoring a combined seven goals.",
      "And as a result, United have been endless in their pursuit of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while also showing an interest in the likes of Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres. An initial bid of £55m for Mbeumo was rejected, but it is thought that their improved figure exceeding £60m may get a deal over the line for the 25-year-old winger.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, has also proved to be a tough acquisition for Amorim and the United board. While Arsenal are thought to have held pole position for the 27-year-old striker, who found the back of the net 39 times in the Primeira Liga this season, it appears as though the Red Devils are now back in the running - although a move could cost another £60m.",
      "Newcastle United talisman Alexander Isak is another of the summer transfer window's most talked-about names having impressed at St. James' Park since arriving from Real Sociedad back in 2022. However, the £150m price tag set on the 25-year-old - given that he is considered one of the best goal-scorers in Europe at present and is under contract with the Magpies until 2028 - may prove off-putting to a cost-cutting United side.",
      "With those players totalling as much as £270m, Ince, who played at Old Trafford between 1989 and 1995, believes that his old club could find a far cheaper solution in Aston Villa's Watkins this summer.",
      "\"He can run it behind, he's quick, he can hold the ball up. He's got all the attributes of a striker that you want. And if you look at the way he was kind of pushed out towards the back end of the season when [Marcus] Rashford came, there might be something.",
      "\"He won't be happy about not playing towards the back end of the season. So, there might be something doing. Maybe not, that's down to Ollie and his agent and getting it sorted out. But if I was trying to bring a striker in, I'd bring in Ollie Watkins.",
      "\"And I think it would take a lot of weight off Hojlund. Rasmus Hojlund is a young striker and he's been asked all last season to play at the biggest club under the biggest expectations, under the biggest pressure and the biggest spotlight to score goals.",
      "\"And, you know, it's not happened for him and he's been criticised for it - and I think sometimes a bit unfairly. I think he's one of those young players who maybe needs to maybe go on loan somewhere for a year, score goals or just be a support act for whoever they bring in so he's not under pressure every time when he starts a game.",
      "\"And that coincides with United being poor, United not playing well, players not adjusting to the system. It's been a tough, tough year for him but he’ll learn. It's character-building.",
      "\"But he needs that striker where he can just say, ‘Right, well, the pressure’s not on me to go and score a week in and a week out, and when the game opens up, maybe I can get 15, 20 minutes on the pitch where I can - hit the back of the net.'",
      "\"But it wasn't just the goals and people just talk about the goals. I think, you know, he's got to work on his hold-up play. For me, he needs to be a lot, lot better at his retention of the ball. But these are all things you expect from a young player, but things that he needs to be working on every day.\"",
      "It comes after Arsenal made a bid for Watkins in the January transfer window to the tune of around £60m, which left Villa officials fuming given it was made public just two hours before their Champions League clash with Celtic. Watkins impressed in the Premier League this season, finding the back of the net on 16 occasions in 38 appearances while providing eight goals overall - and should United be serious in bolstering their lead line ahead of 2025/26, the 29-year-old would undoubtedly fit the bill.",
      "Paul Ince spoke ahead of the final #RifeDontMiss Challenge, celebrating the launch of the new RIFE Black Edition putters. To register for the final qualifier and be in with a chance of winning £50,000, sign up here.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Wayne Rooney is reportedly being eyed for a sensational return to management by non-league Macclesfield. The Manchester United icon has been out of work since being sacked by Plymouth Argyle earlier this year.",
      "He endured a dismal spell with the side - that following disappointing periods in charge of Derby, DC United and Birmingham City. But that does not appear to have put off other clubs, with Rooney being lined up for a sensational return to the dugout.",
      "According to The Sun, National League North side Macclesfield are eyeing a move for the former forward as they aim to find a replacement for Robbie Savage. He is set to leave the club for League Two side Forest Green Rovers.",
      "Savage spearheaded a stunning charge to promotion to the sixth tier of English football last season, Macclesfield winning 35 of their 42 games and collecting an eye-watering 109 points.",
      "And while club chiefs are keen on a move for Rooney, he has recently spoken out on his future and hinted that he wasn’t looking for a return to management any time soon. Speaking to talkSPORT, he said: “Obviously just doing some TV work at the minute, so that’s what I’m doing. I’m enjoying it. So, that’s where I’ll be.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his wife Colleen has also offered her take and claimed that Rooney’s punditry work was enough to keep him busy. She said: “At the minute, he's really happy on TV, podcasts and just being at home.",
      "“Plymouth was a bit far. It hasn't worked out at certain clubs. It's something he's passionate about. It's something he might revisit. He's passionate about TV.”",
      "Rooney was sacked by Plymouth back in January following a rotten spell at Home Park. He left with the club bottom of the Championship, while they were eventually relegated under his replacement Miron Muslic, who has since quit for German side Schalke.",
      "Ironically, Plymouth have now turned to another former United player in the form of Tom Cleverley, who was sacked by Watford at the end of the season. Meanwhile, Savage is still in talks over a move to Forest Green having previously claimed he would sack himself at Macclesfield should he fail to earn promotion.",
      "He said: “If I fail, I know my time will be up. I won’t be able to go back to being a director of football, sitting in the stands and judging other people if I’ve come up short. I know everything is on the line.",
      "“Some of the stuff that was said when I took on the job was unpleasant to say the least. It was a horrible summer.",
      "“But this team will get in the play-offs, and I believe we will go up, but if we don’t win promotion I will walk away from the dugout, take a back seat as a part-owner and watch from afar. There will be people who hope I fall flat on my face, but if that happens it won’t be for a lack of effort.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United have lost the opportunity to sign former wonderkid target Youssoufa Moukoko at a bargain price, years after Erling Haaland praised the Borussia Dortmund striker's skills on the pitch. The 20-year-old has been the subject of much transfer speculation over the years following his history-making Bundesliga debut.",
      "However, it now appears that the young talent will be leaving Germany and joining FC Copenhagen in an unexpected move for the former prodigy. The forward made history in 2020 by becoming the youngest player to debut in the German league at 16 years old during Dortmund's 5-2 victory over Hertha Berlin.",
      "Following the match, Manchester City forward Haaland, who was also with Der BVB at the time, hailed Moukoko as the best young player he'd ever seen. He said: \"He's the biggest talent in the world right now. I am over 20, I am getting old now!\"",
      "This wasn't the first time Haaland had lavished praise on Moukoko. He told the Bundesliga's official website that the young striker was superior to him at that age, adding: \"Moukoko is much better than I was at his age.",
      "\"The advantage for him is that he's already playing for Dortmund at the age of 15. At his age, I was still playing for my home town of Bryne.\"",
      "Now, five years later, Moukoko is securing his transfer from the German club, but not to the major European giant that many would anticipate.",
      "In 2022, United were quoted a hefty £26.2million for the promising young striker, who was garnering attention from rivals such as Liverpool, as well as European giants Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "At the time, Moukoko's representative, Patrick Williams, was frank when he spoke to BILD about his client's need for more game time to blossom. He made the point to warn Dortmund over the looming end of the player's contract.",
      "Williams said: \"It is not a matter of course that Youssoufa is extending BVB. Of course, many clubs are interested in Youssoufa, that's no secret. The end of his contract in the summer of 2023 is getting closer, the top clubs have that on the slip.",
      "\"Yes, injuries have thrown him back a bit this season. Yes, the competition at BVB is of course great. But he hardly gets the playing time that he needs in the current phase of his career in Dortmund. So of course we think about what is best for the future.\"",
      "Unfortunately, a transfer to United never came to fruition, and Moukoko is reportedly now heading off to Copenhagen for a much more modest £4.3million. Fabrizio Romano has reported that the star will undergo a medical on Friday, paving the way for a new journey in the Superliga.",
      "Even though Moukoko has slipped through their fingers, the Red Devils aren’t avoiding making any transfer moves this summer. United have already secured Brazilian star Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million on a five-year deal, signalling their intent for the future.",
      "It's also been reported that they're set to beat Tottenham Hotspur to the post in signing Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo, with the 25-year-old on the verge of sealing a £60m deal with the Red Devils.",
      "However, boss Ruben Amorim will be keen for more arrivals at Old Trafford - and departures too - in what is sure to be a hectic few weeks ahead of the Premier League season kick-off.",

Rashford scored four goals and registered five assists in 17 appearances for Villa, who weren't convinced him enough to trigger their £40million option to buy him permanently.",
      "That's still the amount which United are holding out for, with Rashford expected to return for pre-season training next month if no buyer is found. The forward's preference is to join Barcelona, even sending a come-get-me-plea last week.",

In light of Barcelona's stance, Newcastle emerged as alternative destination - although that, too, now looks like a dead end for the 27-year-old.",

      "They faced Manchester City on Thursday, with the winner knowing they would likely avoid Los Blancos and set up a meeting with Al Hilal. The game was delicately poised at the break, with City 2-1 ahead, only for Erling Haaland, Phil Foden and Savinho to all score in the second half to earn a 5-2 win.",

      "\"I'm a Manchester United fan, and if it happens, it would mean a lot to me and my family. Of course, it would be a dream come true.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has admitted he was \"devastated\" when Carlos Tevez left the club to join local rivals Manchester City. Rooney and Tevez spent two seasons together at Old Trafford between 2007 and 2009.",
      "Along with Cristiano Ronaldo, the pair were part of a formidable attacking trio that fired United to two Premier League titles and a Champions League. However, Tevez was only at United on loan and he ended up joining rivals City in 2009 after the Red Devils failed to agree a permanent deal.",
      "Tevez went on to spend four years at City and notably helped them win their first league title since 1968 in 2012, with United finishing runners-up that season on goal difference. Reflecting on Tevez's move, Rooney told the BBC : \"I was gutted to be honest.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure Carlos wanted to stay at Manchester United. Man City at the time were trying to build and become competitive and I knew that he'd be a massive part of that because obviously the ability he has.",
      "\"I think we've seen when he went there, he had some great times there as well. I was devastated, I would've really like him to stay longer and continue to play with him.\"",
      "Rooney also named Tevez as his \"favourite strike partner to play alongside\", claiming that most defenders \"hated playing against the two of us\". Rooney added: \"When Carlos joined Manchester United, there was a lot of talk about whether Carlos and I could play up front together.",
      "\"I was really excited when we signed him. We were similar in ways how we played - both worked hard and could both play as a nine, both play off the forward as well. We had a really good understanding and chemistry on the pitch, off the pitch.",
      "\"I used to pick him up to take him to the airport before Champions League games. It was interesting actually because we couldn't really have a conversation. I think his English was better than he let on.",
      "\"He's a player you'd always want on your team and he scored some great goals for us, at big moments for us as well. Two years at Manchester United - two league titles, the Champions League... he was a massive part of that.",
      "\"I think Carlos was my favourite strike partner to play alongside. Most defenders we played actually hated playing against the two of us and we could feel that. We knew we were nasty as well. Very instinctive, intense, off the cuff. Anything could happen at any moment.\"",

      "Having only made one appearance for Sporting before making his first team breakthrough in the 2023/24 campaign, it was a brief message he received from the Manchester United boss as his loan at Vitoria was coming to an end that sparked the beginning of Catamo's dreams coming true.",

      "Gyokeres, 27, is at the heart of the summer's messiest transfer saga. He is desperate to leave Sporting Lisbon, having scored 54 goals in 52 games last season.",
      "Gyokeres wants to test himself in one of Europe's biggest leagues, but hasn't found clubs rushing to knock down his door. Sporting insist they've not had any offer put their way, while club president Frederico Varandas has accused the player's agent of falsely claiming the club would accept £59million to sell the player as part of a 'gentleman's agreement'.",

      "As such, there's been a major falling out among the two parties and claims that Gyokeres won't return for pre-season. But Gyokeres isn't getting the interest he perhaps felt he would this summer.",
      "He turned down the prospect of a move to Saudi Arabia last month. Al-Hilal made a £55m offer that was rejected by Sporting, but Gyokeres made clear he had no intention of moving to the Middle East, wanting to continue to compete in Europe.",
      "Real Madrid have made clear they don't want to spend big money to take him to the Bernabeu, as they seek a back up No.9 in the mould of former striker Joselu. Liverpool have been linked in recent days, but the Premier League champions have no interest in the Swede.",
      "Juventus have been linked, but the Italian side aren't flush with cash and no bid has been forthcoming, while Bayern Munich have Harry Kane and Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique isn't keen. Nor is his former club, Barcelona.",
      "That has left Arsenal and Manchester United front and centre, and the belief had been that Gyokeres' No.1 choice was a move to North London. The Gunners can offer Champions League football and a likely title challenge next season.",
      "But while new sporting director Andrea Berta has been testing the waters with the Gyokeres camp and Sporting, Arsenal's preferred No.9 option is RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. A £60m deal is, at this stage, most likely for Arsenal and the RBL forward.",
      "As such, Gyokeres is increasingly aware that his best bet this summer may be to reunite with former boss Amorim and intermediaries have made contact on the player's behalf to signal he is ready to join the Premier League under-performers.",
      "However, he may have to play a waiting game with United too. Matheus Cunha is already through the door at Old Trafford and Bryan Mbeumo is expected next, but United must offload before they can spend big again.",
      "United are open to selling pretty much any member of their first team squad if the right money is offered, but they're particularly keen to quickly get rid of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho - none of whom are part of Amorim's plans. They're hopeful that Real Betis will present an acceptable offer for Antony sooner rather than later too.",
      "Then, United will be back pushing to land the No.9 that has been earmarked after last season's dire campaign. And Gyokeres is finally ready for that to be him.",

      "\"It was an epic match; losing 2-0 and turning it around to 4-2 in the second half. It was the best football we played all season.",

      "He would go on to mastermind convincing victories in all three matches, that ended 5-1, 4-1 and 4-2 in Sporting's favour. However, while the Sporting stars were devastated to see him leave, Amorim has not formed the same bond with his United players.",

While Sporting players were heartbroken when Amorim left, the current crop of United players do not have that same affection for the Portuguese boss, yet.",
      "One of Amorim's first major decisions at Old Trafford was to banish academy graduate Marcus Rashford, by leaving him out of the squad on several occasions before sending him on loan to Aston Villa in the January transfer window. In February, the Mail claimed several United players discussed whether Amorim should change his tactics, with the Portuguese boss insisting on using the same 3-4-3 formation he used at Sporting, for better or for worse.",

      "According to TalkSport, the Nigeria international is said to be available for a cut-price fee after failing to help the Foxes remain in the top-flight. Ndidi, 28, since 2017 when the Midlands club completed a £17million deal for his signature.",
      "The Leicester star has a release clause in his contract after agreeing a new contract following the club's Championship win in 2024. It saw him commit to the club until 2027 but with the caveat he could depart for £9m should Leicester fail to cement their status as a Premier League club.",
      "United may have competition for his signature with interest from Saudi Arabia and Everton in the 66-cap international. Ndidi has previously been linked with a move to Old Trafford albeit with when both clubs were situated in better positions in the league.",

      "Ndidi's modest current fee could see an affordable option as United look to strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad. After missing out on a estimated £100m cash injection by failing to qualify for the Champions League with Europa League success, the club saw no financial boost after finishing 15th.",
      "Amorim's side appear to still be looking to spend ambitiously however after Matheus Cunha's £62.5m arrival. And United have launched a bid of more than £60m for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "A move for Ndidi would see a continued effort to bring Premier League experience into the squad. That comes after Amorim suggested the contrast in United's league and European form came from the different demands of the competition in terms of physicality.",
      "Amorim suggested that is why Antony has found like difficult at United. \"When you play against any team in England, the physicality is there,\" he said.",
      "\"If you don’t have physicality, you will struggle a lot. Antony is so much better now in Spain. There are many factors, but I guarantee you it’s physicality.\"",
      "Ndidi may also offer some opportunity for United to act quickly, despite requiring to offload players. The club will hope to secure permanent exits for Antony, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

Both United and Rashford are on the same page over his departure from the club in the summer transfer window, but the nature of that exit is where the sticking point lies.",
      "Rashford has made it clear that he is keen to join Barcelona ever since concluding a long spell at Aston Villa. While his brief loan spell at Villa ended in injury, Rashford still managed to revitalise his career with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances.",
      "That suited United, who have made it clear that Rashford does not have a future at his boyhood club after a falling out with Ruben Amorim. The 27-year-old has his heart set on a move to Barcelona – and his representatives held talks with the club in late May over the potential move.",
      "However, there are a few difficulties that must be overcome if Rashford is to get his move to Barca. First of all, his £325,000-a-week wages at United, where he is under contract until June 2028, are too steep for Barcelona, who have struggled with La Liga’s financial rules in recent years.",
      "Then there was Barca’s move for Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams, who now looks likely to arrive in a £50million move this summer. Williams – and Barca’s stand-out player last season, Raphinha – play on the left of attack, which is Rashford’s best position.",
      "Barca boss Hansi Flick reportedly believes that, rather than playing off the wing, Rashford could become a back-up to Robert Lewandowski as a No.9. Lewandowski scored 27 La Liga goals to help Barcelona beat Real Madrid to the title season, but will turn 37 in August.",
      "Another problem is outlined by The Times, who report that United want £40m for Rashford, while Barca are preparing to make an offer of a loan deal. His impressive form for Villa has strengthened the club’s resolve that he is worth £40m – and that could scupper a move to the cash-strapped Catalans.",

      "It is easy to understand why Manchester United were attracted to Liam Delap ahead of the start of this summer's transfer window.",
      "The England Under-21 international was available via a £30million release clause this summer after his first season at Ipswich Town ended in relegation to the Championship.",
      "After joining the Tractor Boys from Manchester City last summer, a £30m release clause was inserted into his contract that would become active if the Suffolk club were to fail to preserve its Premier League status.",
      "Winning just four league games all season, Kieran Mckenna's men had next to no chance of beating the drop. Delap, however, produced some eye-catching moments by plundering 12 Premier League goals in his first season as a regular starter at this level.",
      "As a result, clubs were attracted to him and held discussions about signing him. Despite the best efforts of United, Everton and Newcastle United, Delap chose Chelsea, saying their project was what convinced him to move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "It means United are now having to explore alternative avenues in their search for a No.9. United struggled for goals last season and desperately need to add a focal point to the tip of their attack that can find the back of the net on a regular basis.",
      "The club has already shown plenty of ambition in their efforts to beef up their attacking options, signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and attempting to get a deal over the line for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. The addition of an out-and-out centre-forward, though, remains vital.",
      "United have been linked with a plethora of strikers in recent weeks, both domestically and abroad, but their financial situation will dictate who is a realistic target. At £30m, Delap was an enterprising option, but the Reds would have once again been gambling on potential in their search for a goal-getter.",
      "As respectable as Delap's haul of 12 goals was last season, he is not the finished product. United need somebody who has proven they are a reliable goalscorer over several seasons.",
      "When analysing which of the Premier League's centre-forwards from last season reached double figures, they were all north of 22-years-old with the exception of Delap. Brighton & Hove Albion's Joao Pedro and Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson were the only strikers to reach double figures in the Premier League that were as young as 23.",
      "Of the 13 recognised strikers that got into double figures for Premier League goals in 2024/25, nine of them were 25 or older. It has been a similar theme in recent seasons, too, highlighting that more experienced strikers find it easier to score goals in the Premier League in comparison to youngsters who are trying to make the grade.",
      "Of course, Manchester City's Erling Haaland is an exception to the rule, scoring 36 times in his debut Premier League campaign at the age of 22 in 2022/23, but the Norwegian is in a league of his own. His freakish record is unlike anything many of us have seen before.",
      "In the sense that Delap would have been an easy target to obtain and sign relatively quickly had others not stuck their nose in, missing out on him is a blow for United, as they have been left trying to solve a search with currently no obvious answer.",
      "However, he was not the striker they needed at this particular juncture, with the club gambling on potential two years ago in the form of Rasmus Hojlund. Signing a striker that little bit older and more experienced is the way forward this summer.",
      "For example, Yoane Wissa (28), Ollie Watkins (29) and Chris Wood (33) were three of the top five scoring strikers in the Premier League last term. United should be attempting to sign someone around the age of 26 or 27 who is about to enter their prime years.",
      "Of course, signing a striker of that profile is going to set United back in terms of spending, but they knew ahead of this summer's transfer window they would have to loosen the purse strings in search of attacking reinforcements.",
      "Any transfer has the capacity to fail or succeed, meaning nothing is a guarantee. But United's Premier League counterparts have proven they will be wiser going for a more experienced goal-getter."

      "Instead, they have adopted an aggressive approach to the start of their biggest window in years. After wrapping up the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha earlier this month, they are now close to landing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After seeing an opening offer of £55m knocked back earlier this month, United submitted a new and improved offer in excess of £60m for the Cameroonian earlier this week.",
      "Barring any late snags or hitches, the 25-year-old, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, is on course to become their second signing of the summer. Between them, him and Cunha scored 35 league goals in 2024/25.",
      "After seeing their opening offer for Mbeumo rejected, United anticipated they would have to pay a similar fee to the one they did for Cunha. It means that if they get the Mbeumo deal over the line, their spending will go through the £120m mark.",
      "As a result of missing out on European football, United's budget for transfers this summer is not as big as what it would have been had they won the Europa League final. No European football means United are missing out on a minimum of four home games that would have improved cashflow via various matchday revenue streams.",
      "It means more strain will be put on the finances heading into the new financial year. Their latest financial results for the first three months of 2025 revealed a more encouraging picture, despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe, earlier this year, suggesting the club was on course to run out of money by Christmas.",
      "United have slashed their workforce over the last 12 months or so, with around 450 staff being made redundant. As a result, United, earlier this month, played down concerns about breaching UEFA's FFP rules and the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "The end of the 2024/25 financial year for Premier League clubs is Monday, meaning some sides will be under pressure to balance their books. United, however, are not in a position where they are under immediate threat.",
      "An improved start to this calendar year means the club have increased its expected revenue for the financial year ending June 2025 from £660m to £670m. Additionally, United's net cash inflow of £22.3m during the last quarter was an increase of £7.2m from the same quarter last year, highlighting how funds have been freed up.",
      "United know they need to sell players this summer to bring in funds and strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad, and the likes of Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony have been earmarked as priority sales. Alejandro Garnacho is also available at the right price.",
      "If United bank the fees they are looking for for the aforementioned quartet, they will secure somewhere in the region of £150m. No exits are understood to be in the pipeline ahead of Monday, meaning the prospect of them all being sold would see the funds generated from their departures go into the next PSR cycle.",
      "United are understood to want to try and sign Mbeumo ahead of the June 30 deadline and that means the clock is ticking to get the deal over the line. Formally completing a transfer requires various steps and agreements to be put in place and the Brentford attacker is yet to have had a medical.",
      "Ideally, United would like to get him signed and sealed before the end of the Premier League's financial year, but failing to do so would not necessarily be disastrous.",
      "If anything, United's preference to get him in the building ahead of the June 30 deadline highlights they have room to manoeuvre and are not on the brink of landing themselves in hot water with the governing body."

      "United continue to be linked with the likes of Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli's Victor Osimhen, both of who have established themselves as two of the best strikers in Europe, but they are yet to make an official approach for a centre-forward.",
      "It is no secret United will almost certainly have to rely on sales to fund the addition of a No.9, meaning it remains to be seen who they will be able to turn to.",
      "However, if it is possible, Ince, who was speaking ahead of the Manchester #RifeDontMiss Challenge, which is offering the public the opportunity to win £50,000 and break the world record for the longest putt at American Golf Trafford at the beginning of next month, would like to see United swoop for Watkins, who scored 16 Premier League goals last season.",
      "\"He has got all of the attributes that you want to go to Manchester United. I am not saying that is going to be the case, but if you look at last season when [Marcus] Rashford went to Villa Park, Watkins got his nose put of joint and didn't really play much.",
      "\"There might be something where if he was available, I'd be looking at him for sure. I think Gyokeres has done well in Portugal, and you have got to remember that he scored a lot of goals at Coventry before he went there.\"",
      "Watkins, 29, joined Villa from Brentford in 2020, has scored 50 Premier League goals since the start of the 2022/23 season, establishing himself as one of the division's most reliable goalscorers.",
      "United, however, have been unable to rely on a reliable striker in recent seasons. They turned to Rasmus Hojlund in August 2023, signing him from Atalanta, but he has struggled to deliver the goods.",
      "Ince, though, has sympathised with the Dane, highlighting how he arrived at Old Trafford as a 20-year-old and was immediately tasked with spearheading United's attack.",
      "\"I honestly think Hojlund is one of those where he is still young and he needs someone who can come in and take the weight off his shoulders,\" Ince added.",
      "\"I think he is better as a second striker who might come on later on in a game. When you are asking a young lad to deal with the pressures of Man United, at Old Trafford, at such a young age and to have to keep scoring goals, it puts a lot of pressure on him.",
      "\"I think someone like Watkins would take the pressure off him. Maybe they should send Hojlund out on loan for a year and let him score some goals, come back and be confident.\"",
      "Paul Ince spoke ahead of the Manchester #RifeDontMiss Challenge, celebrating the launch of the new RIFE Black Edition putters. To register for the final qualifier and be in with a chance of winning £50,000, sign up here."

      "United's players will report to Carrington following their summer break in the week commencing July 7. And several stars face make or break periods during the next few weeks.",

      "United splashed an initial £72million on the frontman and haven't had a return on their investment.",
      "But pre-season gives him a chance to build some momentum ahead of the new campaign. If his struggles continue, his United future will be in jeopardy.",

      "Andre Onana, who is set to remain as first choice goalkeeper despite an error-strewn 2024-25, needs a stable start to ensure his place doesn't come under further threat, while Luke Shaw must prove he is capable of offering form and fitness after suffering with several injuries in recent years.",
      "He could find a home as a left-sided centre-back in United's set-up but it remains to be seen if he will be able to convince Amorim of his durability.",
      "In midfield, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo have yet to fully convince Amorim. The latter has been in and out of the side through injury and form while he has been used in a variety of positions by the Reds chief, seemingly suggesting that the Portuguese boss hasn't quite settled on how best to utilise the England international.",
      "Ugarte had a mixed debut campaign at Old Trafford and despite working under Amorim earlier in his career, United are looking at potentially adding an athletic midfielder over the summer.",
      "That would place extra pressure on Ugarte and the Uruguay international will hope he can convince his manager of his importance over the coming weeks.",
      "Amorim has shown already that he is not afraid to make big calls, United have several big names who still need to convince."

United's reported asking price of €45million (£38.38m) is said to be too high for Inter, but the Italian side could propose a loan deal with an option or conditional obligation to buy.",

Since then, rumours have been swirling about the business that United will look to complete next as they prepare for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Should United add Mbeumo to Ruben Amorim's pool of attacking options, he will become their second statement signing of the summer. Between them, Cunha and Mbeumo got 35 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "United scored just 44 league goals as a collective last term and they remain hungry to sign an out-and-out striker.",
      "With the start of the new Premier League season now less than 50 days away, it will be here before we know it, meaning United will be determined to finalise their squad ahead of the big kick-off. It means plenty of work is still to be done, particularly in the attacking department.",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport has had a look at what United need to do between now the start of the campaign to try and assemble an ideal pool of attacking options for Amorim.",
      "With Cunha already signed, Mbeumo is expected to be the next new face through the door. United are closing in on his signature and it feels as though it will only be a matter of time before he arrives at Old Trafford.",
      "Once Mbeumo is through the door, focus must switch to signing a No.9. After missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen who United will turn to in their search for a goal-getter.",
      "They desperately need a proven and reliable goalscorer this summer, meaning ongoing links with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen make perfect sense. Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike is also under consideration.",
      "However, United do not have unlimited funds available, meaning sales are set to dictate what is achievable. They also want to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer.",
      "Rashford is valued at £40m, Antony is available for £32.58m and Sancho is valued at somewhere in the region of £20m-£25m. Offloading each of them, however, is already shaping up to be an easier-said-than-done task, particularly in the cases of Rashford and Sancho due to their salary demands.",
      "Fellow winger Alejandro Garnacho is also expected to leave after United informed him last month he will be sold if they receive an acceptable offer. Napoli had a bid of £40m turned down for the Argentine in January, meaning somewhere north of £50m is likely to be United's valuation of the 20-year-old.",

      "If United oversee the aforementioned incomings and outgoings, their attack will have a more rounded and healthier look to it. Cunha is a natural fit for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and Mbeumo is versatile enough to operate as the right-sided No.10, the right wing-back or as the centre-forward.",
      "The addition of a striker, whoever it proves to be, is a necessity, and the chosen candidate will be installed as the club's starting No.9. Competition would come from Mbeumo (if signed), possibly Cunha, who can operate as a striker, and Chido Obi.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, he is an option to play as one of the two No.10s, likewise Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Cunha, Mbeumo and Amad, meaning Amorim will not be short of options.",

      "The Mirror have reported that Gyokeres has now changed his mind on a move to Manchester to reunite with Ruben Amorim. It's claimed that intermediaries have made contact on the player's behalf to signal the 27-year-old's decision to join United.",
      "However, as has been the case with United's pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo, the move for Gyokeres won't happen overnight. The Brentford star is understood to be the subject of a £60m+ move since the start of June and it is yet to be finalised.",
      "Once the 25-year-old is signed, United will turn their attention to offloading players to raise funds. The majority of Amorim's squad is understood to be up for sale with a particular keenness to get rid of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho.",
      "Player sales would then be the trigger for United to open the door to sign Gyokeres. The club's pre-season starts at the beginning of July with them jetting-off to the United States in the middle of the month.",
      "In an ideal world, Amorim and United will have the deal wrapped up in time for the tour. However, it could be some time until United fans get to see Gyokeres in red."

      "As a result, other clubs are valuing their assets higher than usual and Newcastle United have fallen victim of that. The Magpies have already attempted to sign Nottingham Forest and former United winger Anthony Elanga this summer, failing in their £45m bid earlier this week.",

      "According to the Daily Express, United will earn 15 per cent of any profit that Forest make on top of the £15m fee for Elanga. If Newcastle successfully negotiate a £50m deal, that would represent a £35m profit for Forest and see United add £5.25m to their kitty.",
      "Whilst it's not a hefty windfall, the influx of cash could bolster United's attempts to generate funds. Much has been made of the job on Jason Wilcox's hands to sell players to add further reinforcements .",

      "If it was Manchester United's plan to banish the demons generated by their Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur five weeks ago via the transfer window, it's working.",
      "After wrapping up the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves exactly a fortnight ago, United are now closing in on the signing of Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It is understood a deal is edging closer towards being finalised after United submitted a new and improved offer in excess of £60m earlier this week. Barring any late snags or hiccups, he will become the club's second signing of the summer.",
      "United went into this summer's window with no choice but loosen their purse strings after a forgettable 2024/25 campaign marked their worst season in 51 years. However, few anticipated they would be as ambitious as they have been in the opening weeks of the window.",
      "United announced they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Cunha just 14 hours after the transfer window had opened on June 1, ensuring they put down an early marker, and now they are closing in on the signing of Mbeumo less than four weeks later.",
      "Defeat in Bilbao was supposedly going to hinder United's ability in this summer's transfer window. Instead, it has given them the jolt they needed.",
      "It goes without saying that two signings won't be enough for United this summer, and they will need to bring in more faces once they flex their muscles in the seller's market, but to have Cunha and potentially Mbeumo through the door by the end of June is admirable.",
      "United finished last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10, meaning they needed to commit funds to strengthening their attacking department. After missing out on Champions League qualification, it felt as though attracting big-name players would be a struggle.",
      "However, United have been reminded by both Cunha and Mbeumo that they will always be a powerhouse. Cunha had his heart set on a move to Old Trafford for months and Mbeumo has followed suit by prioritising a move to M16 over Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "The elephant in the room, however, is that once the deal to bring Mbeumo to Old Trafford gets over the line, United will have spent north of £120m on the duo. Considering sales are expected to dictate what is possible for United this summer, the Reds have certainly shown plenty of ambition early on amid the fact they are yet to oversee a single outgoing.",
      "Cunha is the first signing of the Ineos era to have cost more than £60m. United brought in five new signings last summer and Leny Yoro was the most expensive addition at a base price of £52.2m.",
      "After years of being taken for a ride in the market, United have become a little bit wiser under Ineos' governance, refusing to pay over the odds. Sir Jim Ratcliffe admitted last year that he would prefer to discover a hidden gem \"rather than spend a fortune just trying to buy success\".",
      "You could argue Ratcliffe has contradicted himself by allowing United to sign Cunha for £62.5m and lodge a bid worth more than £60m for Mbeumo. However, every club that shares the same ambitions as United has to splash the cash every once in a while to strengthen their squad.",
      "United will be unable to preside over many more £60m-plus deals this summer. In fact, they may not be able to preside over another if they are unable to offload the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Nevertheless, they have made an exception to their own rule to get Cunha through the door and attempt to sign Mbeumo, and it does make sense this time around. Their attack was in a sorry state last season and they could not afford to do nothing about it this summer.",
      "Cunha scored 17 goals last season across all competitions, and Mbeumo plundered 20 in the Premier League. Between them, their tally of 35 in the league was only nine fewer than what United scored as a collective.",
      "With that in mind, United are right to have settled on them as two of their priority targets. There is no guarantee they will be successes at Old Trafford just in the same way no managerial appointment is ever guaranteed to pay off.",
      "But in choosing to try and recruit two attackers with Premier League pedigree, United are trying to make up for last season's failings in the best possible way."

      "Were Barcelona to act on their interest in Manchester United's Marcus Rashford, all three parties involved can look forward to the dream scenario developing quickly.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs may have hoped Aston Villa would be the ones to eliminate an issue before it sprung, though the Premier League rivals have not taken up their £40m option to sign Rashford at the end of his recent short-term loan. Therefore a new home will have to be found for the 27-year-old who has been out of Ruben Amorim's plans since last December.",
      "Barca sporting director Deco has already openly discussed their interest with the summer transfer window in play, now the latest rumour is of a loan deal for the season ahead.",
      "It might not fetch Man United a fee right away, though the La Liga champions have actually just confirmed their latest major financial boost - one that could help shift Rashford on for good at a later date.",
      "On Wednesday, it was announced Sunday, August 10 will be the date that Barca return to playing home matches at the Spotify Camp Nou. The iconic stadium has been through a £1.25bn restoration project that meant the club have been forced to play elsewhere over the past two seasons.",
      "Originally with capacity of 99,000, the Spanish side moved from Camp Nou to their temporary home at the city's former Olympic Stadium, which holds a reduced 60,000. Their renovated stadium is aiming to house 105,000 - the largest football venue in Europe.",
      "Revenue from ticket sales and all fees supporters are charged with around the match-going experience will serve to drastically increase Barca's income over a period of time and put them in a much more secure financial position to go out to sign their top targets at will.",
      "In Rashford's case, even if just a loan now it will be a dream come true, or so it is said, for him to be a part of a new era with the five-time Champions League winners.",
      "Barca get what they desire most - added depth amongst their pool of wingers - and for Man United it is an opportunity to get a player off the books again for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "If they offer the La Liga club the same £40m option that Villa were handed, only for next summer's transfer window, they could at least land the fee they have been asking for all this time Rashford has been out of the fold at his boyhood club.",
      "A win, win, win scenario."

But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle. The Magpies want to keep the Swede, and there is talk of a new structure-smashing contract, but they can sell a sale to their fans if they are getting silly money.

The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",

So time is of the essence for Gyokeres but Arsenal are working to their own timetable even if Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19.",
      "",
      "10) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nSpurs are reported to have piqued Mbeumo’s interest and the prospect of staying in London to play for a manager he trusts would certainly appeal. But now United have returned to Brentford with a second offer, how serious are Spurs about reuniting Mbeumo and Thomas Frank?",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nChelsea were linked with the Brighton striker but Newcastle always seemed most keen, which has led to a £50million offer. Brighton reportedly wanted £60million initially, but the forward has made it clear he wants to move on. We would expect the Magpies and Seagulls to find common ground soon. Pedro won’t be going to from the south coast to the North-East to play second fiddle. So what could that mean for Alexander Isak?",
      "",
      "8) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own.",
      "",
      "7) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Arsenal seem to feel they will get a better deal on the other guy…",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nOnly the fact that United have made a second bid puts them ahead of Tottenham. We wait to see Spurs’ reaction and whether they counter – Brentford will pray they do something to prolong any bidding war. Apparently, United have been having conversations with the Bees so we have to assume they are confident this offer will suffice, but only if Daniel Levy and Thomas Frank don’t show similar intent.",
      "",
      "5) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "4) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – but Quansah won’t be heading to Germany until after he’s faced them in the European Under-21 Championship final.",
      "",
      "3) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nNice and easy, this, because of the £5million clause in his Chelsea contract. A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper. Apparently, Kepa has done his medical and put pen to paper on a deal that should give David Raya the heebie-jeebies.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. A medical is in the offing.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment six weeks ago but, finally, the midfielder is in London to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we must be getting close to an unveiling."

      "The Club World Cup has been a breeze for Manchester City so far, and Juventus were the latest to be brushed aside — on a particularly enjoyable day for one summer signing.",
      "Man City have played an absolute blinder here. Rayan Ait-Nouri for £31 million is one hell of a bargain — one that should make Wolves supporters sick to their stomach and Manchester United fans wonder why they signed Patrick Dorgu and not this guy.",
      "We were quick to write off Rayan Cherki after one game, and we’re just as ready to declare Ait-Nouri the best left-back in the world after only his second game for the club.",
      "On a comfortable Orlando afternoon (rainstorm aside) for Pep Guardiola’s men, the Algerian left-back was absolutely fantastic. His decisive through ball to assist Jeremy Doku for City’s opener was sublime, leaving Juventus defender Alberto Costa for dead and Pierre Kalulu, for some reason, unaware that the Belgian would cut in onto his right foot.",
      "There was plenty of transfer narrative, with Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders thriving — and a couple of Premier League targets doing absolutely nothing of note on the other side. Dusan Vlahovic got his goal in the end, and it was very well taken, but didn’t do enough to convince potential suitors he’s their man, while City-linked stars Kenan Yildiz and Andrea Cambiaso both started on the bench.",
      "MORE: Wirtz, Delap, Cunha: Top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window",
      "It’s City’s new boys who started on Thursday that really stole the show. Reijnders and Ait-Nouri have added youth, energy and a much-needed injection of self-belief to a team that spent most of last season feeling sorry for themselves. Guardiola is treating this tournament as the start of 2025/26 — and who can blame him after the empty-handed mess that was 2024/25?",
      "It’s the right call — and with Ait-Nouri leading the charge, City purred in possession. But for all the early signs of a slick new core forming, there were also some pretty loud reminders that the old core is, well…getting older.",
      "They’re still comfortable trying to break down teams, but transitions look like a weakness. Ederson choosing this moment to gift Juventus an equaliser — right after telling the world he wants to stay at City — was not ideal. That might not be your decision, fella.",
      "Luckily for him, Kalulu had an absolute shocker to outdo it, scoring one of the most avoidable own goals you’ll ever see, handing City the lead back.",
      "It was tight going into the second half, with the first somehow played to a finish despite monsoon conditions. But one simple like-for-like change blew it wide open.",
      "There were acres of space all game between Juventus’ deepest midfielder and their backline, with Omar Marmoush camped on the defender’s shoulder with his back to goal. Bringing on Erling Haaland was the easiest tactical decision Guardiola’s ever made. Igor Tudor had to react, but no adjustment could stop City slicing through with the same defence-splitting passes every five minutes.",
      "Reijnders — who’s already looking like a monstrous signing — was the one to deliver a gorgeous through ball to Matheus Nunes, who, as it turns out, might actually be a bloody decent right-back. Haaland was left completely free to tap in his 300th career goal with one of the scruffiest finishes you’ll ever see.",
      "Juve chucked on some positive subs in desperation, but City were rampant. Soon it was 4-1 — Phil Foden tapping in after Haaland produced a silky first touch and perfectly weighted through ball to set up Savinho. His calm touch around Michele Di Gregorio left Foden with a walk-in.",
      "Then came the pick of the bunch: a thunderous long-range belter from Savinho that left Di Gregorio rooted as embarrassment for the Old Lady turned to outright humiliation.",
      "There was still time for Rayan Cherki to miss an absolute sitter, but overall it was a very productive afternoon in Florida for City. They’re the only team to win all three of their group games at the Club World Cup and should be the clear favourites to lift the trophy.",
      "While this tournament could yet take a toll on their domestic campaign through sheer physical and mental fatigue, winning it might also provide the boost they need. The pre-CWC signings already look like inspired additions, injecting fresh energy and belief into a squad that looked flat and on the way out last season.",
      "Reijnders and Ait-Nouri, in particular, are settling in brilliantly. And it’s a refreshing change of pace for City to have a natural full-back playing in, well, full-back. Ait-Nouri already looks like a serious weapon going forward, and his pace should go some way to easing those nagging concerns in transition. Doku, meanwhile, will only benefit from having someone alongside him who occupies defenders and offers an end product.",
      "We haven’t even mentioned Rodri yet. He’s very much in Like A New Signing territory, starting his first City game since last September in the 5-2 win.",
      "So far, City look like they’re absolutely nailing a crucial transfer window. We still can’t quite believe it. £31 million? FFS.",
      "The opening fixtures of the 2025/26 Premier League season will feature a number of early and potentially awkward reunions, including Arsenal at Old Trafford.",

Of course he didn’t know at the time he could be as far as he is now, but his mindset – it separated him from the others.”",
      "Asked if Mbeumo can handle the pressure of playing for Manchester United, Almeida replied: “I think so. I saw him jump from us at Troyes to Brentford in the Championship and then to the Premier League. He handled it really well.",
      "“I know he is a little shy but, at the same time, he trusts himself. So he knows how strong is he, what capabilities he has, how strong he is as a player. Of course, Manchester United is a different level club, but I am trustful he will do it well.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo was a big part of that small improvement. He barely played in a group stage that was worryingly tame but started all four matches of a more controlled, more effective knock-out phase.",
      "Mainoo turned 20 in April. He’s proven his worth in an England shirt. He’s a Stockport-born United academy graduate with 50 Premier League appearances under his belt. That his future isn’t completely certain this summer is an indictment not only of the club, but of football’s financial governance.",
      "Specifically, it highlights the flaws in football’s financial governance frameworks. In the Premier League, profit and sustainability rules (PSR) allow clubs to make a £105m loss in any given three-year period.",
      "Because teams are on an endless quest for improvement on the pitch, players need to be bought and sold. In the PSR era, those sales are increasingly coming from the ‘Do Not Sell’ pile.",
      "Profit from sales is booked immediately and transfer fees are amortised over the lengths of the players’ contracts. Clubs sell players with value to pay down their losses and replace them with expensive successors, whose futures will be subject to the same calculations down the line.",
      "United themselves are pertinent to the PSR debate – if debts aren’t part of the calculation and clubs have to sell players against their wishes on June 30 only to buy someone more expensive on July 1 to comply with allowable losses, is it really doing its job? – but the basic fact of the matter is this: Manchester United shouldn’t be considering the sale of Mainoo in a million months of Super Sundays.",
      "And yet they might. It’s the same with Alejandro Garnacho, albeit the winger’s departure would be welcomed more positively given his penchant for bridge-burning.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho did not command transfer fees on the way in but would on the way out, and that helps United equip Ruben Amorim with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Mainoo has been forced out of the spotlight through a lot of injury and a little under-use since shining in the latter stages of the European Championship. He started exactly half of United’s Premier League matches in 2024/25, five fewer than the previous season which he began injured.",
      "He might even have been slightly forgotten by the most casual football supporters beyond the ranks of Red Devils but he’s still an exciting prospect who will be looking ahead to 2025/26 with hopes of getting his fitness back on track.",
      "There have been reports that Mainoo’s wage demands could be a factor in his club’s calculation. His contract expires in two years; a decision would be made soon at a smart club and might be made soon at United too.",
      "His coaches speak of maturity, physical strength and imagination on the ball. Even at 20, his one-on-one skills are beyond doubt, proven at the highest level. Mainoo has the mentality and ability to be a part of what United need to become.",
      "Manchester United have been a dominant commercial force in football for decades. They’ve taken their brand, their sponsorship appeal, their global fandom, and turned it into varying degrees of success.",
      "They’re a colossus – a shadow of their despised and dastardly dominance nowadays, maybe, but they’re not wiped out on the mat just yet.",

      "Clubs up and down the Premier League are looking to their player development as the magical route to blissful spending inside PSR compliance but United, perhaps more than anyone, know the intangible benefits of bringing players through for their own line-up.",
      "Consider where United are today.",
      "They finished a few places outside the Premier League relegation zone and might have been even lower if Aston Villa hadn’t laid an egg on the last day of the season. They spurned a last-gasp chance for salvation by losing the Europa League final. They were awful.",
      "United have backed their head coach after a poor season in which the tone was set by his predecessor and a club hierarchy that leaves an enormous amount to be desired.",

      "Mainoo can control and affect the game. He travels nicely with the ball and can influence the play by doing the simple things well in the middle of the pitch with the easy confidence of a player ten years older.",
      "David Beckham won’t look enviously into his passing toolkit but Mainoo is more than just a relaxed character in midfield. What he does there is technical.",
      "“It is how he prepares before he receives the ball,” former United academy coach Paul McGuinness told Adam Bate before the European Championships.",
      "“What he does off the ball makes it seem like he has time on it. To receive it, he has to look before it comes. Amateur players look up after they have received the ball and then decide what they are going to do. The top professionals, and that is a good phrase for Kobbie, they are efficient and everything they do has a flow to it.”",
      "One of the reasons Amorim will even make it as far as the start of the new season is that he adheres to a specific system and didn’t have the players to apply it mid-season with any degree of success – it’s almost like somebody should have said something.",
      "The outrageously talented tactical analyst and tea-maker Adam Clery recently filmed a video explaining why Cunha is the perfect signing for United’s system.",
      "In his illustration of Amorim’s 3-4-3, Clery defined the four players midfield players as follows: Flying Machine on the left behind(ish) an inverted winger, Inverting Enthusiast on the right behind(ish) a creative number 10, and a Ball Winner and Plays Everywhere in the centre.",
      "His energy and tenacity contribute to a midfield’s ball-winning ability too but that Plays Anywhere role is made for Mainoo.",
      "United’s recruitment should be defined entirely by the system if they’re to climb back up the table in any meaningful way and, in Mainoo, they have a player ready to develop into one of the most important spots.",
      "One year in every four, the decisions made by players take on a different hue. 2025 is a World Cup year minus one, the year in every World Cup cycle in which players either don’t move or seek a safe bet with the attention of their international managers in mind.",
      "There’s no obvious buyer for Mainoo but PSR can do funny things and Bruno Fernandes not going to the Saudi Pro League means that the chances of the midfielder leaving are higher than zero.",
      "One of the major problems with the way football finance is governed by the Premier League and other bodies in Europe is its dehumanising impact on players. In the very worst cases, they’re shuffled around like pawns on a chessboard. They are their book value and nothing more.",
      "But if Mainoo has a say, he should stay. He needs regular football in a familiar setting and that means both staying fit and staying put.",
      "If Mainoo were to leave it would be a big deal. As a United youth made good he’s part of a rich heritage and his premature departure would shine a light on PSR’s negative impacts. He is, culturally and tactically, where he should be.",
      "Yet there’s another pattern emerging. As United falter, exiled players and discarded pieces are demonstrating an ability to perform elsewhere.",
      "Marcus Rashford was loaned to Villa and took a big step back towards his best. Jadon Sancho at least did enough at Chelsea to get a move away from Old Trafford this summer. Antony might even have played himself back into Amorim’s thinking.",
      "Scott McTominay joined Napoli last summer and a year later he’s a Serie A champion, the league’s official MVP, one of the most successful Brits in Italian football history and a beloved adopted son of Naples.",
      "That’s not bad, but it’s not for Mainoo. Not yet. United is the right spot for the 20-year-old despite last season because he’s at a club that needs him, a club he loves, and a club where he will be able to continue his development – development he still needs – without the upheaval of a transfer.",
      "This article was originally published on High Protein Beef Paste, an entirely free weekly football newsletter to which you should subscribe immediately.",
      "As wind-up tactics go, wearing the shirt of another club next to a yellow Ferrari is a guaranteed way to annoy fans and burn bridges with one’s employer.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Ruben Amorim might finally have lost it at Manchester United; four players he is trying to sell won’t come on tour and he wants new signings fairly soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has told four “bad apples” at Man Utd that they won’t be coming on their tour of the United States in July if they haven’t already found a ...",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada has confirmed their “target” date to win the Premier League amid his surprise at Ruben Amorim’s dire start."

      "Christian Norgaard to Arsenal appears very much like it might well be A Thing.",
      "Now we like Norgaard rather a lot. In our view, his has been an under-rated contribution to Brentford’s post-Toney attacking success, with his lower-key creative input significantly and understandably overshadowed by the more eye-catching Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.",
      "Point is, he’s a very good player available at a very good price and he might be just the thing. But…bit underwhelming, isn’t it? One thing Norgaard is not and never can be is the big-name striker Arsenal fans crave so desperately.",
      "But sometimes this precise kind of initially underwhelming transfer can obtain enormous significance come the final reckoning, like these five lads whose eventual contribution to title glory in their first season was far greater than the excitement that greeted their arrival.",
      "We’re talking specifically players who actually helped win their teams the title, not Ralph Wiggum-style helping. So no Federico Chiesa here, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "Manuel Akanji (Man City, 2022)\nOne of the problems with a feature like this is the fact that a vast number of Premier League titles have been won by Manchester United ages ago and Manchester City more recently, meaning any new signings – underwhelming, overwhelming or those that merely adequately whelm – are coming into teams already well used to winning titles by the sh*tload and thus making it harder to make decisive contributions.",
      "But if we try to do this feature without any contribution from Manchester we’re in very deep trouble, so we will have to make the best of it.",
      "And thus, Manuel Akanji is our man. There was little fanfare when he arrived right at the end of the 2022 summer transfer window to join two-time defending champions for whom Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias had formed an estimable first-choice defensive pairing with top-tier reinforcements in the shape of John Stones and Nathan Ake.",
      "At the very least it would be fair to say that of City’s two signings from Borussia Dortmund that summer, Akanji’s (for less than a third of the fee City threw Leeds’ way for Kalvin Phillips) was the lower profile.",
      "And while, yes, the very much not underwhelming signing of Erling Haaland certainly played its part in City’s continued success, so too did Akanji. He would end the season with more Premier League appearances than any of Ake, Dias, Stones or Laporte despite not making his debut in the competition until mid-September, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League knockouts and in every round of the FA Cup for the treble winners.",
      "Now Manchester City need an upgrade, but then he was an underrated revelation.",
      "",
      "Marcos Alonso (Chelsea, 2016)\nChelsea’s rollercoaster journey from 2014 to 2017 will always be one of the Premier League’s very best bits, with a pair of hugely impressive title wins under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte sandwiching a comically disastrous season that ended Mourinho’s second spell and resulted in a 10th-place finish.",
      "As well as appointing Conte, something else Chelsea did in the summer of 2016 was sign Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina.",
      "Now he had proved himself a very capable player for La Viola in Serie A, but here in England we have very correctly never really placed much stock in what a player might achieve in daft little foreign leagues like that one. It only matters what you’ve done here. And in Alonso’s case, that was ‘be a bit-part player in a relegated Bolton team and half-a-season of relegation-battling with Gus Poyet’s Sunderland’. In other words, nothing very interesting at all.",
      "Yet he was absolutely crucial to Chelsea’s success under Conte. We’ve all enjoyed the banters about the sorcery of Conte’s ability to win the league with Victor Actual Moses as his RWB – a magic trick matched only by Conte’s ability to regrow his own hair – but it’s easily overlooked now just how brilliant and integral Alonso was on the other side, and how that really was not something everyone knew would be the case at the time.",
      "As well as his defensive work, Alonso became a key progressive component of Chelsea’s dominant title-winners, more than doubling his career tally of top-flight goals in that one season.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante (Leicester, 2015)\nFeels like it’s a bit of a cheat to include anything at all from Leicester’s 2015/16 miracle, because for very, very understandable reasons not one soul on earth was talking about any Leicester signing of any xW (expected whelm) as being the one that might just propel them to the title after their escape from relegation in 2015.",
      "But equally it feels like you just can’t have this list without Kante given the sheer gulf between the lack of fanfare that greeted the arrival of a player on the back of one mid-table season in Ligue 1 with Caen and the mammoth significance of his contribution to Leicester pulling off the Premier League’s greatest ever madness.",
      "Such was his impact that he moved on to Chelsea after just one season – duly winning the season again as a signing that was in no way underwhelming – and his name remains to this day an instantly understood shorthand for a very specific and very special type of player.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick (Man United, 2006)\nIt’s one of those things that’s been largely memory-holed now by all involved, but at the time of Carrick’s move from Tottenham to Manchester United there were plenty of United fans who felt they’d been sold an overpriced pup by those wily southern chancers.",
      "The mood was febrile enough around Old Trafford back in the summer of 2006 on the back of a truly unthinkable three-year Premier League title drought. It seems hilarious to think of that now – largely because it is hilarious – but at the time United had never previously gone even two seasons of Barclays without winning the thing.",
      "Jose Mourinho had come along and ruined everything, the great Special prick that he was, and there was widely held suspicion about the idea a pretty-passing midfielder of such conspicuous pretty loser stock as West Ham and Tottenham could significantly change matters.",
      "Five Premier League titles and 316 Premier League appearances later, opinions had altered a bit.",
      "",
      "Jens Lehmann (Arsenal, 2003)\nGot to have a bit of Arsenal in here, haven’t we? And there really is only one contender when you look through the names.",
      "Now it’s not like Arsenal fans thought they’d signed a dud when Lehmann arrived, but he was a goalkeeper with a reputation for being something of a loon.",
      "As the man to replace the very safest of English goalkeeping hands in David Seaman, it was undoubtedly a bit of a punt. Yet a punt that led to Lehmann being an ever-present member of the first and still very much only unbeaten English league champions since the Victorian era.",
      "Look, fair play.",
      "According to reports, there was one key reason behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to favour Arsenal-bound Christian Norgaard over an alternative.",
      "Arsenal have reached an ‘agreement’ for their third summer signing as a replacement for a midfielder who looks to be Barcelona bound."

      "Newcastle are prepared to move heaven, earth and the Angel of the North to keep Alexander Isak from the prying hands of Liverpool, but it can backfire.",
      "While they face relegation if Isak is sold, speculation persists that Newcastle might be unable to resist the title-contending overtures of Arsenal and Liverpool.",
      "It seems unlikely either club can afford the requisite sums while persuading Isak to leave a club coming off the back of a trophy-winning, Champions League-qualifying season. But any player thriving outside the Big Six is destined to be linked to those in it.",
      "Newcastle still hold the cards with a full three years left on the contract Isak signed when he joined, but reports of the Magpies considering breaking their wage structure to make him the highest-paid player in the club’s history bring hope and warnings from the past.",
      "",
      "Arsene Wenger once said his principle on wages was “to pay something that makes sense and is defendable in front of every single player,” adding: “We make exceptions sometimes but they are not maybe so high. If you want to keep making profit you have to respect that.”",
      "He also said that “we have no players on £200,000 a week and I think other clubs will come down to us with financial fair play”.",
      "That remarkably optimistic and hilariously naive philosophy just about held up when Mesut Ozil joined on £140,000 a week eight months later, even if that deal, in the words of the Daily Telegraph at the time, meant Arsenal had ‘broken their wage structure’.",
      "But it was entirely obliterated when the German signed his next contract in January 2018. After some preposterously protracted and public negotiations it was decided that handing Ozil a reported £350,000 a week for three years was the “cheapest option” instead of losing him for nothing that summer and having to replace him.",
      "“On the other side all of our players are well paid. Very well paid. To feel sorry for them – I’m not sure that it’s the most objective assessment,” the manager added, lighting the ticking timebomb he had just carefully planted in a dressing room he would vacate months later.",
      "It is unknown whether Mikel Arteta or the club’s hierarchy agreed whether keeping Ozil was indeed the most economical choice possible when he a) refused to take a pay cut during a global pandemic, b) was paid in full until his departure for Fenerbahce in January 2021 despite not playing for the Gunners since March 2020, and c) still had 90% of his record Arsenal wage paid by the club during his first five months in Turkey.",
      "",
      "The line heavily pushed on Florian Wirtz this summer was that while his transfer fee shatters the club record, his incentivised salary will fall in line with the club’s highest earners – or at least those behind the Egyptian king.",
      "As far as basic wages go, Salah is the clear bar-setter at Anfield. Salah became the best-paid player in the club’s history on around £350,000 a week when he extended his deal in 2022, then when those terms were approaching expiration in April 2025 he agreed a rise of up to £480,000 if performance-related bonuses were triggered.",
      "Had that deal been sorted before that season he would have earned a fortune, but those 34 goals and 23 assists in 52 title-winning games provided a decent bargaining position during talks.",
      "“When you have someone as special as Salah the rule that you have to have in place you have to certainly bend them, maybe not necessarily break them but you have to maybe go closer to a position that maybe you don’t want to,” said Carragher at the time, dancing around the fact the Reds quite understandably felt compelled to make a significant exception to keep their best player.",
      "The usual Liverpool transfer exceptionalism notwithstanding, few could argue Liverpool were wrong to make Salah a pay-scale anomaly on either occasion.",
      "",
      "“I was a bit annoyed with the first offer put to me,” said Keane in August 1999. “Deep down they must have known it wasn’t something I could sign. Our dealings have to be realistic. I am not naive enough to settle for anything less than a reasonable valuation of my worth.”",
      "A £38,500-a-week deal would have made Keane the highest earner at Man Utd while remaining commensurate to his teammates. But with Juventus and Bayern Munich prepared to throw ludicrous and lucrative figures around in the age of fresh Bosman hysteria, the realisation quickly set in at Old Trafford that they stood to lose a prized asset for nothing.",
      "Keane was free to talk to those clubs and sign a pre-contract from January 1; his new £52,000-a-week Man Utd contract was signed on December 8, putting him on twice as much money as Ballon d’Or runner-up David Beckham mere months after the Treble – and making him the best-paid player in the Premier League.",
      "The BBC said Man Utd had ‘smashed their pay structure’, while The Guardian called it a ‘dismantling’. It also meant Keane was earning considerably more than Sir Alex Ferguson, who ensured after the Wayne Rooney deal fiasco in 2010 to get it in writing that no player at the club could be on a higher wage again.",
      "Keane being Keane and Man Utd being Man Utd, there was still controversy to be enjoyed as the ink dried.",
      "“I’m not one for holding grudges but this was a stupid mistake, a bad public relations exercise and something that should never have happened,” the Irishman said of a letter the club sent to supporters preposterously justifying an increase in ticket prices as a means to help pay Keane’s salary.",
      "Don’t give Sir Jim Ratcliffe any ideas.",
      "",
      "Before Isak came Kane, the modern standard-bearer for exceptional Premier League forwards operating outside the absolute elite, destined to forever be cast unrequited admiring glances from those within it.",
      "An unhealthy portion of Kane’s career at Spurs was spent linking him with a move to those clubs for unthinkably large sums while he excelled as an individual in a team tapping forlornly against a glass ceiling, and that fate has promptly befallen Isak.",
      "Daniel Levy happened to reach the same ingenious solution Newcastle have stumbled upon: paying something closer to the wages on offer elsewhere. With Kane already sitting alongside Hugo Lloris at the top of the Spurs pay structure that was easier said than done, but perhaps mindful of a potential World Cup-based boom in interest, the England forward secured a 100% pay rise in June 2018.",
      "Kane won the Golden Boot for the semi-finalists in Russia, but a new deal which forced Spurs to ‘rip up their wage policy’ in the words of the Daily Telegraph, had two significant knock-on effects.",
      "It perhaps contributed to Tottenham becoming the first team in Premier League history not to make a single signing across a summer transfer window. Mauricio Pochettino had challenged the hierarchy to be “brave and take risks” but likely had something different in mind.",
      "And that six-year contract with no exit clause effectively trapped Kane when his personal numbers continued to inflate at a time Spurs as a collective inevitably dropped off.",
      "If Isak does exploit the tedious Arsenal and Liverpool speculation his representatives will not make the same mistake – mainly because they have the experience of managing other clients and won’t be distracted by the motorbike and fake tyre tracks on his office floor.",
      "If Florian Wirtz triggers enough of his add-ons to become a Premier League record transfer then he may find himself among some fine Manchester United deals.",
      "Liverpool will hope Alexander Isak can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging.",
      "Harry Kane has basically joined Manchester United after an ‘Arsenal hijack’. It’s all happening…",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ivan Toney became the 35th and 36th players to be capped while playing for foreign clubs.",
      "Roy Keane has tipped an England player to be “fuming” at manager Thomas Tuchel for the role he gave him in the Three Lions’ 3-1 loss to Senegal on Tuesday.",

      "",
      "10) Marcus Edwards (Burnley)\nNot long ago, there was talk of Edwards joining the Premier League from Sporting CP for around £30million. Instead, he’s now a Burnley player for a measly £8.4m. That might suggest he was never quite good enough to justify a big-money move to a top club, but we’re still convinced this is a brilliant deal for the Clarets.",
      "Signed on loan in January, Edwards didn’t exactly set the Championship alight, but we’d suggest not digging too deep on that; he should be a key player for Scott Parker next season.",
      "",
      "9) Jeremie Frimpong (Liverpool)\nFilling Trent Alexander-Arnold’s boots is a tall order, and Jeremie Frimpong is the man Liverpool have picked for the job. There are some reservations. He’s not really an out-and-out full-back and will probably get caught out defensively just as often, if not more, than Trent, which has always been the main stick used to beat him with.",
      "Right-wing-back in a back three is Frimpong’s natural habitat, and Arne Slot is unlikely to tear up his entire system just to accommodate him.",
      "But now that the pessimism is out of the way, there’s a strong chance he’ll be a roaring success. He’s one of the quickest players in the league, which helps cover a multitude of sins – just ask Kyle Walker – and his end product is frankly ridiculous. In a Liverpool team that sees loads of the ball, he’ll probably be just fine.",
      "",
      "8) Liam Delap (Chelsea)\nThis was supposed to be a long, tedious transfer saga with every top Premier League club in for the young striker thanks to his £30million relegation release clause. But, in a rare act of competence, Chelsea wrapped it up quickly – fast enough, in fact, to take him to the Club World Cup.",
      "He made an immediate impact on debut in the United States, assisting Enzo Fernandez against Los Angeles FC. Then on his first start, he scored. It was a lovely goal too. Delap’s all-round game was on show: stayed onside, perfect first touch, confident take-on, instinctive finish.",
      "That ability to run the channels and produce an end product – whether a pass or a shot – makes him look like an absolute snip at £30m. And he’s only 22.",
      "Will he be the next victim of the cursed No.9 shirt at Stamford Bridge? Probably. But at least he’ll go down swinging.",
      "",
      "7) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. Like Frimpong, the Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re more confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",

      "6) Kendry Paez (Chelsea)\nSince Todd Boehly’s arrival, Chelsea have invested heavily in young talent. While not every signing has worked out (see Diego Moreira, Deivid Washington, and Angelo), the expectations for 18-year-old Paez are exceptionally high.",
      "The teenager already has 18 caps for Ecuador and will have the support of big brother figure Moises Caicedo to help him settle in west London — a move that could be a significant adjustment for someone so young.",
      "The potential is clear. Paez could well become one of the Premier League’s standout players within the next four years. Chelsea will need to carefully manage his development and make the right decisions to help him reach that promise.",

      "Cunha was outstanding for Wolves last season and arrives as the perfect ‘wide 10’ in Ruben Amorim’s system. Add Bryan Mbeumo on the right and an elite finisher up front, and the Red Devils might just sneak a top-half finish next season. Lofty ambitions, sure.",

They’re normally prepared to bin anyone who doesn’t explode onto the scene from day one.",

      "This signing injects a rare shot of excitement that Premier League fans aren’t exactly used to. Chelsea supporters should be buzzing that this kid chose them over the typical big hitters.",
      "",
      "3) Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford)\nAnother intra-Premier League move, Kelleher has finally left Liverpool to spread his wings as a top-flight No.1. As his ranking shows, this looks like an outstanding pick-up for Brentford, who have replaced Mark Flekken superbly and sorted the goalkeeper spot early this summer.",
      "Kelleher had to leave, especially with Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving, and considering how brilliant Liverpool are at flogging fringe players, we’re honestly stunned his initial fee is only £12.5million. It could rise to £18m, which is still a steal.",
      "Selling him for half what Jarell Quansah will fetch at Bayer Leverkusen probably sums up Liverpool’s weak stance in transfer talks. Kelleher wanted out, and keeping him made little sense. Brentford will be bloody chuffed.",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nNico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "Tongue no longer in cheek, the Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. Because that’s what really matters – not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone who’s world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summer…so far.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",

Or, just Harvey Elliott.",
      "The perceptive/cynical Red Devils fans must be concerned as they supposedly near the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for a fee similar to the £62.5m they paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha that they either won’t have much more money to spend on further significant squad surgery required this summer, or are kicking a huge potential PSR problem down the road by continuing to spend big and continuing to be balls.",
      "After promising to be more savvy in the transfer market having taken over the club, after overpaying for pretty much everyone they signed last summer and selling the current best player in Serie A, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have made one very obvious transfer and are on the verge of another.",
      "That’s not to say that either Cunha or Mbeumo will be bad signings for United, but they didn’t think the innumerable flops they’ve signed for similar or greater fees over the last ten years would be either. And there’s a danger that with both 26 years of age by the time the season starts that they – again, like seemingly many to have arrived at Old Trafford in the last decade – will consider their career complete having been handed four-year contracts worth around £200,000-per-week. They will never need to work again.",
      "One would hope due diligence is done to assess the hunger of these players, but that desire wouldn’t be in doubt if United were instead signing teenagers or players in their early 20s on contracts deemed lucrative by them but not to the club, who have potential to grow in quality and – crucially – value. We thought that was INEOS 101 and page one of Project 150, but apparently not.",
      "The Mbeumo deal’s not done yet, and amid reports claiming Amorim ‘wants to recruit at least two offensive players’ in what remains of the transfer window anyway, an admittedly left-field possible addition to fix United’s attacking problem was driving England to victory over the Netherlands to reach the U21 Euros final in stunning fashion.",
      "Elliott was a man possessed here, as he has been throughout the U21 Euros – he might just be the best player in the tournament. His touch to take the ball away from the defender and his fierce shot into the roof of the net provided unambiguous evidence of his level above anyone else on the pitch to give Lee Carsley’s side the lead in the second half.",
      "Manchester City’s James McAtee has been mooted as a ‘controversial’ possible signing for United, as Elliott would be for similar rivalry reasons, but possibly due to the greater experience of the Liverpool man in pressure situations or simply because of his superior quality, this wasn’t McAtee’s night, it was Elliott’s.",
      "The playmaker has consistently stated his desire to fight for his place at Liverpool even after just 360 minutes of Premier League football last season, but the writing isn’t so much on the wall following the £116m signing of Florian Wirtz but drilled into it in 20ft-high letters: his Liverpool career is over.",
      "Brighton are interested and will likely now be convinced he is worth Liverpool’s £40m valuation, as United should be because – let’s be clear – someone who’s not quite good enough for Liverpool is exactly the level of footballer the Red Devils should be targeting. Plus, he ticks every other box…",
      "He’s a 22-year-old with a point to prove and plenty of room to grow, just shy of 100 Premier League appearances, ideally suited to that inverted winger role in Amorim’s 3-4-3, who currently earns just £40,000-per-week and can arrive and thrive to thoroughly f*** off a rival fanbase who could do with being knocked down a peg or two.",
      "“If Lionel Messi had done this, the world would be stopping,” Joe Cole said while analysing Elliott’s second goal of the night, as the Liverpool star turned away from a defender 30 yards from goal, drifted past another, and another, before letting fly into the corner from the edge of the box.",
      "It was superb, he’s great, and we suspect there will be a few more sporting directors asking for his agent’s number on the back of this quite wonderful display. Jason Wilcox should really be among them.",
      "Chelsea are one of five teams interested in the Liverpool, who looks to be on his way out of Anfield this summer amid reports of a ‘£40m formal offer’.",

      "Still, though, the ‘£26m transfer agreed’ in a headline about Man Utd and Bryan Mbeumo in fact being a deal where Real Betis agree a fee with Atletico Madrid for Johnny Cardoso is still a heck of a leap given that neither of those clubs is Man United and Cardoso is not and never has been a Man United player.",
      "So what, exactly has been unlocked? Betis could spend that money on buying Antony, couldn’t they? And thus from two non-click-generating Spanish clubs agreeing a deal comes a headline that serendipitously contains the far more potent words ‘Man Utd’ and ‘Bryan Mbeumo’ and ‘transfer agreed’.",
      "That’s the good stuff."

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
