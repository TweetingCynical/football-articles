      "Inconsistency has plagued Manchester United's season so far. The Red Devils have suffered damaging results that piled the pressure on Ruben Amorim but also earned victories that signified progress under the Portuguese boss, namely their 2-1 victory at Liverpool.",
      "The month of December is always a hectic one in English football, and it's a period that can make or break a club's season. Given United are only in two competitions this season, with the FA Cup third round commencing next month, the Premier League is of even more importance than usual.",
      "Inconsistency is one word that paints United's season so far. After earning just two wins in their first six league games, the Red Devils then enjoyed a three-match winning streak, including an impressive away win at Liverpool.",
      "But then came a three-match run without a win, including an embarrassing 1-0 home defeat by Everton, who played much of the game with 10 men. Morale then was boosted by their 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace, and it's the topsy-turvy nature of their results that leaves ex-Tottenham Hotspur and Portugal midfielder Pedro Mendes convinced uncertainty exists within the United changing room.",
      "Speaking to BoyleSports, the 46-year-old said: \"Manchester United will get back into the Champions League, but they are difficult to understand. How can you go for three, four wins in a row, playing really well, and then lose at home against Everton? You know, it's just another setback.",
      "\"When you think the confidence is building and everyone is getting up there and knows what it takes, and then they go away and win against Crystal Palace, which was a more difficult game than Everton at home.",
      "\"So that's the uncertainty also that's around the United dressing room that harms their confidence. But I honestly think that United have the quality and the players to finish top five and get in the Champions League for next year.\"",
      "The Red Devils skipper is traditionally an attacking midfielder but has been playing deeper in Amorim's system, with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount all ahead of him.",
      "Fernandes, 30, has been a regular scorer at United since arriving and has 100 goals in 304 games for the club. But, with his role placing him further away from the goal, his numbers have struggled, with just two league goals to his name in 13 games this season.",
      "Mendes believes Fernandes wants to play further forward and has urged Amorim to find a solution so his talisman can get back to doing what he does best. \"When Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, with Morten Hjulmand or Manuel Ugarte before, and Pedro Goncalves was in the middle,\" Mendes explained.",
      "\"So, someone holding and someone just to take the ball and make the team play. I think at Man United, you have Casemiro, you have Ugarte, you need someone different and Bruno can give that to the team. For sure Bruno would love to play more upfront to score more goals but then you have good players upfront.",
      "\"You have Matheus Cunha, you have Benjamin Sesko, you have Joshua Zirkzee, you have good players upfront, so Bruno can have more presence and more importance in the team at this stage playing that middle role.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has had plenty of set-piece disasters to analyse with his staff over the time he has been at Old Trafford, but this one was a belter.",
      "It was Soungoutou Magassa who finished calmly to give West Ham United a deserved share of the spoils, but the chance came after Noussair Mazraoui had been forced to make a goal-line clearance because a visiting player had towered above the home defence to power in a header from a corner.",
      "And that player? The colossus that is Jarrod Bowen.",
      "Amorim’s team - and Amorim’s defence - really do keep finding new ways of tossing away winning opportunities. Not that this was an overall performance that merited a victory. It was a performance that was sluggish from the outset.",
      "Young Ayden Heaven set the tone, collecting a yellow card for a woefully mistimed slide towards Bowen and then giving a fiendishly fierce back-pass to Senne Lammens, who duly sliced it out of bounds.",
      "But Heaven’s hesitancy was typical of Manchester United’s early efforts. Their lack of intensity was hard to fathom, and a quarter of the match had elapsed before the home side forced their first corner.",
      "That sparked a brief spell of pressure which featured a Joshua Zirkzee effort being cleared off the line by Aaron Wan-Bissaka, but Nuno Espirito Santo’s team rarely looked in any danger in a first half when the most animated aspect of the home performance was Bruno Fernandes’ ongoing beef with referee Andrew Kitchen, taking charge of a Manchester United match for the first time.",
      "There was no danger of Kitchen being unable to keep up with play - it was strictly pedestrian stuff. And that suited West Ham, who, in Bowen, had the game’s most accomplished player.",
      "But this is a West Ham line-up that looks short of confidence, and there was a sense that Ruben Amorim’s men only had to step up a gear to get some joy out of the night. They ended the first half relatively strongly, which made a laborious opening to the second period even more surprising.",
      "There has been quite a lot of talk this season about the general standard of Premier League football and it is fair to say this was pretty grim evidence that it is most definitely not at a vintage level. It was untidy, it was dotted with clumsy fouls, scarred with some seriously poor passing.",
      "That Manchester United have a very realistic chance of finishing in a top-four position is a bit of an indictment of the overall quality of the competition. They did not deserve to win this contest but Diogo Dalot deserved to score his first Premier League goal at Old Trafford and his first Premier League goal anywhere in 18 months.",
      "His smart turn and finish came just before the hour mark after a miscued Casemiro shot had landed at his feet just inside the penalty area. That should have been the platform for a Manchester United win, but West Ham showed great resolve and no little creativity and carved out a couple of half-chances before Magassa’s composure earned them a valuable point.",
      "There were a smattering of jeers after the full-time whistle but, like Manchester United’s attempts to avoid another disappointing finale to a game, they were strictly half-hearted.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "And Amorim was left frustrated at his side not seeing the win through. He said: \"[The performance] was not constant.",

      "Asked why his side were not able to see the victory over the line, Amorim claimed that his side were not committed enough in the challenge, or in attempting to score goals.",
      "He added: \"Just losing second balls. And when they kick the ball long. Mateus [Fernandes] running with the ball. They win the first ball and then Bowen was making the runs. You can't control that kind of game. We should be better with the ball after the first goal.",
      "\"We had a big opportunity with Cunha. We had the ball near the box but the crosses were not good. Sometimes the players' characteristics inside the box are not good. They are not enough to score goals from that position.\"",
      "United will be aiming to get back to winning ways on Monday evening as they travel to struggling Wolves. Amorim has demanded his side to get back on track to ensure they do not lose any more ground on the top four.",

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane reckons the Red Devils were 'frightened' to earn victory against West Ham. Ruben Amorim's side could only earn a draw at home despite opening the scoring, and Keane believes they are not 'nasty' enough.",
      "United gave up a 1-0 lead at Old Trafford after Diogo Dalot opened the scoring in a lacklustre match. The Irons fought their way back into the game, and Noussair Mazraoui's goal-line block from Jarrod Bowen's header proved to be in vain as Soungoutou Magassa slotted in the rebound after 83 minutes.",
      "United once again missed the chance to move up to the upper echelons of the table. Like in defeat to Everton, Amorim's men dropped points when they could have moved into fifth position.",
      "The players were booed upon the full-time whistle, with the crowd at the Theatre of Dreams seemingly as irked as club icon Keane. The Irishman could not contain his frustration at the end of the match, criticising the team's lack of ambition to extend their advantage.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappointing. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"We are talking about fifth here by the way. Same old problems.\"",
      "Keane was frustrated with the lack of intensity present in the squad to go and claim a win. \"United are making substitutions, and he is entitled to do that, but I was watching people come off and it was like they had won the league!\" he added.",
      "\"Show some intensity. It was all a bit, 'this is cool'. You cannot be cool when you're 1-0 up. Get the job done!",
      "\"United have better players than West Ham but this is not a good United team. It was too relaxed, get the job done!\"",
      "United settle into eighth in the Premier League, while West Ham fail to break out of the relegation zone after Leeds' win. A crucial point in their battle, nevertheless.",
      "Pundit Gary Neville was impressed by their goalscorer. \"Magassa has been all action - all around the pitch,\" he said. \"Plenty of tackles. He's been a destroyer out there and he's gone and got a goal. He rescued West Ham a vital point.\"",

      "Manchester United failed to make it back-to-back Premier League wins after a late sucker punch from West Ham at Old Trafford",
      "After beating Crystal Palace last time out, United were aiming to secure consecutive victories and with it move towards the Champions League places. And it looked as though a win was exactly what they were going to get as Diogo Dalot's first Premier League goal in a year-and-a-half opened the scoring.",
      "West Ham were not to be denied though as Soungoutou Magassa scored late on to ensure a share of the spoils.",
      "The draw sees Ruben Amorim's side move up to eighth ahead of next Monday's clash with struggling Wolves. In the meantime, West Ham remain in the relegation zone after just one defeat in their last five games.",
      "Here are all of the talking points from Old Trafford:",
      "After injuries to Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, Ruben Amorim was forced to name a somewhat patched up backline that included Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui in central positions alongside youngster Ayden Heaven. And the former Arsenal man appeared to struggle getting to grips with the game.",
      "He was spun on a few occasions by Callum Wilson and picked up an early yellow card. That forced Amorim into action at half-time with Leny Yoro introduced in place of Heaven.",
      "Man United were well aware of Aaron Wan-Bissaka's defensive abilities when they agreed to let him join the Hammers. And they were on show at Old Trafford to deny the Red Devils' biggest chance of the first half.",
      "Amad skipped past El Hadji Malick Diouf and produced a teasing cross towards Zirkzee. After scoring against Crystal Palace, the Dutchman did well to get his body on the ball and divert it towards goal, only to find Wan-Bissaka on the goalline.",
      "The defender proved to be a stubborn opponent throughout the game. United might have felt he should have been dismissed for two yellow cards but it was still an impressive showing nevertheless.",
      "With Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo back for the Red Devils, some might have thought that their opening goal of the game would come through either of the pair. But it came from a very unlikely source - Diogo Dalot.",
      "After West Ham failed to clear the ball, it fell to the Portuguese defender. He took a moment to compose himself before finishing coolly. It was the 26-year-old's first Premier League goal since May 2024, not that anyone would have known given the cultured nature of his finish.",
      "While it was not the result that the Red Devils will have wanted, there were still a few impressive performances - chief among them coming from Casemiro. It was another brilliant performance from the Brazilian in what has been an impressive season.",
      "The midfielder made three tackles, provided an interception and a clearance apiece and also blocked three shots. Given how close he looked to leaving Old Trafford last season, his turnaround really is impressive.",
      "And if United seal a return to the Champions League, it's not misguided to say that the former Real Madrid star would have been a key part of that.",
      "In honesty, there wasn't too much on quality on show at Old Trafford. Only the goals really stood out.",
      "While Dalot's was a cultured finish, the same could certainly be said of Magassa's equaliser. The ball came towards the 22-year-old after being cleared off the line by Mazraoui.",
      "But he did not panic and converted coolly into the bottom corner. The excitement certainly got to him as he celebrated with gusto, but given it was his first Premier League goal, not many can really begrudge him of that.",

      "Manchester United star Casemiro is set to pocket £247,000 courtesy of his former club Sao Paulo, after a formal agreement was reached to settle a labour dispute - according to reports from Brazil. The midfielder transferred to Real Madrid from his boyhood club in 2013, but has remained linked with Sao Paulo due to claims of unpaid money.",
      "As per Brazilian outlet UOL, via Sport Witness, the case, which had been active since 2014, is now resolved with £247,000 agreed as the payment to the 33-year-old. This will provide him with a nice financial boost at the end of the year, on top of his substantial weekly wage.",
      "The claim, associated with employment-related payments from his academy days, was understood to be around £290,000, although the final figure is slightly less than that. The case included image-rights charges, match-related earnings, bonuses and holiday entitlements, which are standard contractual extras.",
      "Casemiro will receive the payment on a monthly basis, but he may actually rake in up to £363,000 if Sao Paulo fail to keep up with the payment schedule. They have agreed to these terms, with the regional labour court approving the settlement this week.",
      "Next month, Casemiro will be free to negotiate with clubs outside England as he enters the final six months of his United contract. A transfer away last summer seemed to be inevitable, but the seasoned midfielder stayed put and has repaid Ruben Amorim for his faith.",
      "With United typically playing just once weekly, Casemiro has been delivering exceptional performances, although his stamina may face a stern examination in the coming period.",
      "He featured for the full 90 minutes during the 2-1 triumph against Crystal Palace last weekend, with his game-time now likely to be carefully monitored as Amorim's squad take on West Ham United, Wolves and then Bournemouth across the next 12 days.",
      "Casemiro risks missing one of those fixtures through suspension, however, as he sits on four yellow cards in the Premier League.",
      "After the Bournemouth meeting, Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui will all become unavailable as they depart for AFCON. Despite various injury concerns across the squad, United have suffered defeat in just one of their previous seven Premier League matches, leaving them eighth in the standings.",
      "A win against the Hammers would propel them into fourth place, with every other side having already completed their game-week 14 fixtures.",
      "When questioned - during his press conference - about getting into Champions League qualification places and maintaining that position, Amorim responded: \"I understand the question and if the table is there, if you have the opportunity. one game per week, you need to go for it.",
      "\"But then you look at the table and everyone is like two points behind. Everything can change in one week.",
      "\"Let's focus. I think the best way of doing things, especially with our team, is to focus just on the next game. If we win the next game we will maintain the position at least. That is the main focus.",

      "Danny Welbeck is arguably enjoying the finest form of his career, over a decade after making the tough choice to leave Manchester United. The Brighton striker came through United's youth system and racked up 142 senior appearances before moving to Arsenal in 2014.",
      "Welbeck realised a childhood ambition when Sir Alex Ferguson promoted him into the first-team squad as a promising young forward. He collected multiple major trophies during his spell at Old Trafford, including the 2012/13 Premier League title, but his United future became increasingly uncertain following Ferguson's retirement.",
      "During David Moyes' short tenure, Welbeck was frequently deployed out wide and his opportunities became even more limited when Louis van Gaal took charge. On transfer deadline day in 2014, he completed a £16million switch to Arsenal, with the striker later sharing his reasons for leaving United.",
      "\"At the time I was playing on the left-wing a lot and in a 4-4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can't make an impact on the game,\" Welbeck explained. \"I can play it to the best of my ability but that's not best for the team, and I could make a bigger impact playing in my preferred position.\"",
      "He added: \"You start to have thoughts but at that time you're still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game - that's just me, I'm not going to change that. But you do start to think about what's best for you.\"",
      "The sting of Welbeck's move from United was made worse by a parting shot from Van Gaal. When asked about the club's choice to offload Welbeck, the United manager said: \"He has played, after [his loan spell at] Sunderland, three seasons at Manchester United but he doesn't have the record of [Robin] Van Persie or [Wayne] Rooney and that is the standard.\"",
      "Determined to silence his critics, Welbeck's ambitions were hampered by recurring fitness issues that stopped him from delivering consistent performances for the Gunners. His five-year spell at Arsenal was followed by a difficult campaign at Watford.",
      "Yet Welbeck has enjoyed a remarkable resurgence since joining Brighton as a free agent in October 2020. He's now notched up more appearances and goals for the Seagulls than at any previous club.",
      "The 35-year-old is currently heading towards another personal best campaign, having finally reached double figures for Premier League goals last season. With an impressive seven goals in 13 league matches, Welbeck appears to be getting better with age, sparking suggestions he could force his way back into the England squad ahead of this summer's World Cup.",
      "Speaking about his goalscoring run, Welbeck told The Argus: \"I'm happier than ever. I think like the main thing for me is the consistency of staying on the pitch and getting a rhythm of playing game after game after game.",
      "\"Unfortunately, throughout my career, I've had some really big injuries that have maybe derailed that, and it's difficult.",
      "\"You have to try and get back into form, you have to try and get back to match fitness and that sort of stuff. But the last couple years have been really good, and I'm feeling really good. Long may it continue.\"",

      "A whole host of Europe's elite have been credited with an interest in Mouzakitis, 18, in recent weeks, including a number of Premier League clubs. And the youngster was being watched closely by some of his suitors as he caught the eye for Olympiacos in their 4-3 loss against Los Blancos.",
      "The Sun report that Manchester United have 'ramped up their interest' in Mouzakitis by having representatives in Greece to watch him. Intriguingly, Real Madrid are one of the other clubs who are understood to be keeping tabs on the midfield maestro's development, meaning they got the chance to see his prodigious talents firsthand.",
      "It's claimed that Mouzakitis, who won the coveted Tuttosport Golden Ball Web award earlier this week, is valued at around £40million by Olympiacos.",
      "However, his value is expected to rise ahead of the January transfer window as a whole host of clubs continue to track him. Those include Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan and Juventus, while Arsenal and Aston Villa are among Mouzakitis' other suitors in the Premier Leagues.",
      "While it remains to be seen if United are planning to formalise their interest in Mouzakitis in the January transfer window, they do continue to be linked heavily with another midfielder.",
      "The Red Devils spent around £200m to overhaul their attack in the summer and Ruben Amorim and Co are expected to turn their attention to United's engine room next.",
      "Gomes will be unable to feature for Wolves when they travel to Manchester to play United on Monday night, though. That's because the £44m-rated star is suspended after accumulating his fifth yellow card of the season in the 1-0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim will miss the opportunity to scout one of his midfield transfer targets in action next week when they face Wolves in the Premier League. The position is an area of priority for Jason Wilcox next month after investing over £200milllion elsewhere back in the summer.",
      "United are expected to weigh up their options in January when the transfer window opens. The Reds bolstered their squad with a new goalkeeper, striker and two additional forwards in the previous window, but failed to secure a new central midfielder.",
      "A potential deal for Carlos Baleba fell through after Brighton and Hove Albion's asking price was deemed too steep. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson are also reportedly on United's radar following their standout performances this season.",
      "However, another name has surfaced in recent months - Wolves' Brazilian sensation Joao Gomes. The 24-year-old was previously linked with a move to Old Trafford, prior to United's £50million acquisition of Manuel Ugarte in 2024.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Wolves believe that Gomes' value is higher with the club in the Premier League, rather than as a Championship side if they suffer relegation. Other reports have suggested that the midfielder could command a fee close to £44m.",
      "After their midweek loss to Nottingham Forest, the Wanderers are heading to Old Trafford on Monday in search of their first victory of the season. The match was seen as a chance for Amorim to watch Gomes play live before the transfer window, but that's now off the table.",
      "Gomes received his fifth yellow card on Wednesday night, resulting in a one-match ban. This means Rob Edwards will have to delve into his squad for the journey to Old Trafford, with Marshall Munetsi tipped to step in.",
      "Fellow Brazilian Andre is another Wolves player that both Amorim and United will be keeping tabs on. The midfielder has previously been linked with a move to United and is also rumoured to be on Arsenal and Liverpool's radar.",
      "Whether United will be active in the January transfer window remains to be seen. However, potential exits could significantly impact their plans, with several players garnering attention.",
      "Reports suggest that Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, Ugarte and Tyrell Malacia could all be allowed to depart. None of the quartet have been regular starters this season, and ESPN have reported that the club is open to offers.",
      "With Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui set to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations, United could find themselves short-handed for the second half of the season, leaving Amorim in a tricky spot.",

      "Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson has long held the position that consistency is key when it comes to managerial success. As such, he would likely recommend Liverpool stick with Arne Slot despite a downpour in results at Anfield of late.",
      "A disappointing 1-1 draw at home to Sunderland on Wednesday has left the Merseysiders with only four wins from their last 14 games. And after dazzling English audiences by winning the Premier League title in his debut campaign last term, Slot is now struggling to escape scrutiny.",
      "United legend Ferguson was no stranger to the sensation during his 27 years in charge at Old Trafford. And although he retired in 2013 as arguably the greatest manager in British history, even Ferguson came in for serious questioning at points across that tenure.",
      "The Scot left an all but impossible lead to follow when David Moyes was appointed his immediate United successor. And after his countryman was fired only 11 months into the role, Ferguson called for clubs to show patience with their picks even when pressure is being ramped up.",
      "\"There's no evidence that sacking a manager gives you success,\" said Ferguson in 2015. \"But there is evidence at Manchester United, at Nottingham Forest, at Arsenal that [if] you retain the manager for long periods, you get consistency and you get success.\"",
      "Former rival Arsene Wenger was in charge at Arsenal for almost 22 years and brought the Gunners into the 21st century. The Frenchman won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups in England, but his greatest impact at Arsenal was arguably instilling a culture and style that only comes with time.",
      "Ferguson also referred to Nottingham Forest and Brian Clough's 18-year spell in charge at the City Ground. And it was under Clough's command the club won back-to-back European Cups, attaining huge success in the late 1970s in particular.",
      "Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) proved they made the right pick in appointing Slot as Jurgen Klopp's successor last season. But that instant gratification has been muddied by a torrid couple of months.",
      "That being said, while Manchester United have displayed a habit for fast turnover when it comes to coaching appointments, Liverpool traditionally show a little more faith. Slot is Liverpool's seventh managerial appointment of the 21st century, while the Red Devils have had six since Ferguson departed the club only 12 years ago.",
      "Not only that, but the fact Slot accomplished so much, and was in fact in the running for a quadruple, in his debut season should give him a stay of execution. It's also easy to forget Liverpool initially made a sensational start to the season by winning their first seven games of the campaign.",
      "Bearing that in mind, it may not take many tweaks before the Liverpool of that not-too-distant past is back. And Ferguson's own history serves as proof a little bit of trust can go an awful long way.",

Ruben Amorim is believed to be searching for midfield reinforcements, particularly as Kobbie Mainoo has slipped down the pecking order under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Additionally, Casemiro is in the final 12 months of his Old Trafford deal and is yet to commit his future to the club. United have been strongly linked with a swoop for Forest star Anderson, who has been in impressive form this season.",
      "Manchester City are also reportedly monitoring the 23-year-old midfielder, who under contract at the City Ground until June 2029. Forest are said to be reluctant to part with Anderson during the January window, even if bids approaching £100million arrive.",
      "However, reports suggest potential suitors believe an offer exceeding £80m might be enough to persuade club owner Evangelos Marinakis to reconsider his stance. Former Premier League striker Dean Saunders has now urged United to make their move and pip City to Anderson's signature.",
      "The ex-Wolves and Wrexham boss reckons he could prove instrumental in helping Amorim drive the club forward.",
      "Speaking to BoyleSports, he said: \"Elliot Anderson understands the position. He understands when he should go forward and who he's playing with. He doesn't give the ball away, which is a common trait among the best players I ever played with.",
      "\"They've all got one thing in common - they don't give the ball away and he's one of them. He's getting better. Forest just needs to get a few more wins and get him up the league so he can play without the pressure being on him.",
      "\"Manchester United picked up another win at the weekend, which is keeping the wolves from the door. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, I think they're better than what they had. They've signed three good players there and adding Anderson to it would be special.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has just got to keep surviving. He's just got to keep getting three points when he needs it and giving himself time to work this jigsaw puzzle out.\"",
      "Multiple clubs are reportedly lining up to secure Anderson's signature, with the midfielder earning widespread acclaim for his commanding performances since arriving at Forest just over 12 months ago. Whilst a move back to former club Newcastle has been dismissed due to financial constraints, Liverpool are also believed to be monitoring his situation closely.",
      "Anderson's impressive form has earned him a place in the England squad, with manager Thomas Tuchel singing his praises. The German tactician has hailed Anderson as an \"important\" player for the Three Lions, despite the midfielder having only accumulated six caps to date.",
      "Speaking last month, Tuchel said: \"Anderson is a key player for us at the moment. He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League - that's why he is with us and starting for us. He deserves it because he has been nothing but impressive. He has to keep on going now though.",
      "'He is a very complete and mobile midfielder, and that's what he keeps showing me. He is an elite player with the right attitude and a lot of talent. He is fulfilling his role in the best way possible so we are very happy with him.\"",

      "United’s win at Selhurst Park ended Crystal Palace’s longest-ever unbeaten home run in the Premier League, as Oliver Glasner’s side had gone 12 consecutive games without defeat on their own turf. Jean-Philippe Mateta’s retaken penalty put Palace ahead, but goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount—both set up by Bruno Fernandes’ free kicks—turned the game in United’s favor.",
      "The victory was a much-needed response for the Red Devils following their disappointing home loss to 10-man Everton. Now sitting seventh in the table, United are just three points behind third-placed Chelsea as gameweek 14 approaches.",
      "Since a rocky start to the season, with four defeats in their first seven matches across all competitions, Ruben Amorim has overseen just one loss in United’s last seven outings. However, the Portuguese manager faces the prospect of an unwanted record: if United lose on Thursday, Amorim will have suffered 10 Premier League defeats at Old Trafford in just 20 matches—reaching that milestone faster than any other manager in the club’s history.",
      "December has not been kind to Manchester United in recent years, as they are currently on a three-game Premier League losing streak in the month, failing to score in any of those matches. Still, the Old Trafford crowd may have more to cheer about than their visitors, whose three-match unbeaten run ended against a resurgent Liverpool side last weekend, thanks in part to Paqueta’s dismissal.",
      "Between goals from Alexander Isak and Cody Gakpo, Paqueta received his marching orders after dissent, then made headlines with a fiery online attack on the FA, criticizing their lack of support during his spot-fixing investigation—a case in which he was ultimately cleared.",
      "Depending on other results this week, Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, currently 17th, could find themselves in the relegation zone before Thursday’s kickoff. The West Ham manager will be seeking his first Premier League away win with the club at the fifth attempt. The last time a West Ham boss failed to win any of their first five top-flight away games was Avram Grant in 2010.",

      "Ruben Amorim’s side found themselves behind at the break in south London following Jean-Philippe Mateta’s penalty, but responded after the interval. Goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount ensured that United bounced back from last week’s home defeat by Everton.",
      "Manchester United are confident of keeping academy starlet JJ Gabriel following Barcelona’s interest in the teenager. The 15-year-old came to wider attention following a hat-trick for United’s U18 side at the weekend and has scored 10 in as many games so far this term.",
      "Barcelona have previously invited Gabriel and his family to the Camp Nou, with the United prospect also meeting first team players and touring the club’s facilities. However, United are determined to fend off Barcelona’s long-standing interest in the England U16 international.",
      "United boss Amorim, who has already involved Gabriel in training, has spoken about the youngster: “Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media. You could see the U21s had a game and we had less players and tried to pick players for training that have talent.",
      "“Not just for me to see for tomorrow but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace. If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with West Ham in the Premier League on Thursday night. United got back to winning ways in the Premier League against Crystal Palace last weekend but they failed to build on that victory.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed:",
      "Anger on the touchline",
      "United were on course to claim back-to-back Premier League victories, but they conceded from a corner with just eight minutes remaining.",
      "Carlos Fernandes, United's set-piece coach, stands up on the touchline to oversee every set play, and he angrily reacted to Magassa's goal by storming back to his seat on the bench.",
      "Fernandes looked furious as he returned to his seat. United have majorly improved their threat from attacking set-pieces this season - no team in the league has scored more - but they must improve defensively.",
      "Magassa equalised because he was the most player alert in the box, which will irk Fernandes.",
      "Amorim was happy with Dalot",
      "Dalot was recalled to the starting team last weekend and delivered an improved display at left wing-back after briefly losing his starting role to Patrick Dorgu. Dalot made his 150th appearance in the Premier League at Selhurst Park and followed that milestone by scoring his 10th goal for United.",
      "Casemiro's shot fortuitously made its way to Dalot in the box and he finished well. Once the team celebrations were over, Dalot roared to the Stretford End and pumped his fists.",
      "Amorim made the decision to replace Dalot with Dorgu in the 68th minute, and it was interesting to see Dalot exchange words with his manager as he left the field. The United boss appeared to explain why Dalot had been taken off, and he nodded in approval of his performance.",
      "The gloves came off",
      "Joshua Zirkzee was given the nod to start again after scoring against Crystal Palace last weekend and looked sharp in the first half, linking up intelligently with his teammates around the box.",
      "He had a chance of his own, which was headed wide, but picked up where he left off when play resumed following half-time, combining brilliantly with Bryan Mbeumo to create a chance in front of the Stretford End.",
      "It came to nothing. Zirkzee reacted by removing his gloves, throwing them to the side, which felt like he meant business. Although Zirkzee did not score, his display was pleasing, and he brought gasps from the crowd when he brought the ball down dead with a superb first touch. \"What a touch,\" a fan said near the press box.",
      "The problem is that Zirkzee is not a natural goalscorer, and United might have put the game to bed if he'd scored before he was brought off for Mason Mount in the second half.",
      "Hellish start from Heaven",
      "Ayden Heaven was selected to start his first Premier League game since the final day of last season due to Matthijs de Ligt's absence. The youngster started in the centre of the back three and made a poor start to the game, picking up a yellow card in just the seventh minute for a clumsy tackle.",
      "Callum Wilson has entered the winter of his career but he had the better of Heaven when he picked up the ball. The former England international drove at Heaven at every opportunity.",
      "Heaven almost brought Wilson down in the box with an outstretched leg, which made Amorim react as he sent Leny Yoro to warm up on the byline just 17 minutes into the game.",
      "Yoro warmed up for the rest of the half, which suggested Heaven would be hooked. Then Yoro emerged to warm up during half-time - this time without his jumper - and the change was made by Amorim.",
      "Heaven has been given limited minutes this season and he was, understandably, rusty.",
      "Vivell in the directors' box",
      "Christopher Vivell was spotted in the directors' box. Vivell joined United on a temporary basis last year and was appointed permanently as the director of recruitment in February.",
      "The German slid over in the directors' box, seemingly to look at which scouts and agents were present at the game, and he will be hugely influential again when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Amorim recently confirmed that United could be active in the market, although the club spent £215million (excluding add-ons) in the summer window and funds will be limited in January.",
      "A lot will depend on what happens with Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo. Zirkzee retained his starting role against West Ham, but Mainoo is still yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "Mainoo requested to leave on loan in the final week of the summer window and is expected to do the same next month. Whether such a request is entertained remains to be seen.",

      "If anything sums up Manchester United's inability to plot a smooth course under Ruben Amorim, it is the manner of the goal that denied them a crucial win against West Ham.",
      "A day on from talking up their ability from set-pieces, United were undone by one. The equaliser from an 83rd-minute corner was a reminder that vulnerabilities remain and for all the improvement in the other box, they are still weak in their own. It was a painful blow for a side who looked on course to stick themselves into the Champions League conversation.",
      "There was no anger at the final whistle this time, as there had been against Everton. Instead, it was a resigned silence. None of the players on the pitch slumped to their knees, but they put their hands on their hips and stared at the ground. This wasn't the performance of a team destined for the big time in Europe, but a win had them heading in that direction.",
      "Now they will look on and curse another result that got away, another goal conceded from a corner and another second-half they have failed to win.",
      "This was the one-year anniversary of his first defeat as head coach and they have been regular occurrences since then, 22 all told, including penalty shoot-outs to Fulham and Grimsby.",
      "That this didn't end in another defeat was little consolation for a crestfallen Amorim. There has been the whiff of progress recently, but this team's ability to shoot themselves in the foot - and just about every other part of the body - is crushingly frustrating. To sandwich a win at Crystal Palace with a dismal defeat to 10-man Everton and a draw with a dire West Ham, both at Old Trafford, only reinforces the sense that it is one step forward and one backwards.",
      "United were again slow to get going, showing a lack of intensity in the early stages that is baffling, given their reduced schedule this season. Once again, they allowed a team to get a foothold in a game at Old Trafford.",
      "Ayden Heaven's early woes didn't help. The 19-year-old was starting his first Premier League game of the season and was in the middle of a back three, but his inexperience was preyed on by grizzled veteran Callum Wilson. It didn't take long for Wilson to realise he had the upper hand.",
      "It was Bryan Mbeumo who began to rouse United into life. His short-corner routine with Bruno Fernandes led to a curling shot that forced Alphonse Areola into a fine save. Joshua Zirkzee bundled an effort goalwards that was cleared off the line and Fernandes volleyed a follow-up just off target.",
      "Set-pieces have often been the route to goal this season, but with Matthijs de Ligt joining Harry Maguire and Benjamin Sesko on the sidelines, there was a lack of height against a team who had plenty of it.",
      "That was putting the onus on United to find their ruthless streak as well as their creative streak. They had moments of the latter. Amad's quick feet created Zirkzee's first-half chance and he often looked the most likely to make something happen. Zirkzee's first-time pass into Mbeumo early in the second half deserved a finish.",
      "Instead, Mbeumo was beaten to the ball by Freddie Potts and that seemed to sum up United in front of goal. Zirkzee's link-up play was good, Matheus Cunha was probing, Mbeumo was lively and Amad was direct, but none of them have the killer touch in front of goal.",
      "So it was no surprise that the game was unlocked via a slice of good fortune. Casemiro's long-range shot wasn't going to trouble West Ham, but the deflection spun it into the path of Dalot, unmarked and 10 yards out. He had enough space to take a touch and fire a low finish into the Stretford End net.",
      "United looked to hold what they have and Amorim's defensive subs reflected the nervousness, but having talked up their set-piece ability, they were undone by one instead. Amorim admitted that they still had work to do defensively and West Ham found it too easy to level. Jarrod Bowen's flick-on was brilliantly cleared by Noussair Mazraoui, but Soungoutou Magassa slammed in the rebound.",
      "It was from two corners that Arsenal condemned Amorim to his first defeat a year ago. That another corner proved their Achilles heel against the Hammers summed up a team that just can't kick on.",

      "Manchester United saw the chance to go fifth in the Premier League slip through their fingers as they threw away a lead against West Ham at Old Trafford. Diogo Dalot's goal just before the hour mark looked like landing Ruben Amorim back-to-back wins in the Premier League but momentum was again checked.",
      "West Ham had posed little threat following a bright opening but found an equaliser from a corner when Soungoutou Magassa slammed home after Noussair Mazraoui had cleared off the line.",
      "Here are the United player ratings from Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens: One wayward kick in the first half but was solid aside from that. Didn't have a lot to do but safe hands when Bowen's shot was deflected his way. Nothing he could do to prevent the goal. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Solid on his return to the team. A vital late block and a goalline clearance that deserved more than the rebound going in. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: First Premier League start of the season but he had a half to forget. Callum Wilson played on his lack of experience, he got too tight at times and was booked for a rash tackle on Jarrod Bowen. 4",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended well for the most part and saw plenty of the ball in the second half when United were probing for an opening, but a lack of height at the back was exposed. 6",
      "Amad: Created a chance for Joshua Zirkzee with quick feet and looked like making things happen again. Needs to get the ball high up the pitch to really influence the game. 7",
      "Casemiro: Wasn't great on the ball and didn't bring the composure United needed in their game. Got an assist but more through luck than judgment. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: His range of passing in the first half was good but snatched at two injury-time chances to win the game. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Struggled against Aaron Wan-Bissaka at times in the first half but showed superb composure to take his goal well. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Probably the most likely of the front three to score and forced Alphonse Areola into a good save, but should have done better with a second-half chance. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha: Not at his best on his return to the team. The odd nice touch but seemed a little lost in his role and didn't really threaten. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Did well to force Wan-Bissaka into a goalline clearance in the first half and his link-up play was outstanding at times, with one brilliant pass to Mbeumo. 7",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Unconvincing under one early high ball and clearly lacking a bit of confidence at the moment. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: An enterprising run after replacing Dalot and will be pleased with his solid cameo. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Came on to see the game out and failed. 5",
      "Mason Mount: Not much time to make an impression. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Arrived late on. N/A",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Malacia, Mainoo, Lacey",

      "Ruben Amorim said he had no regrets over his second-half substitutes in Manchester United's draw with West Ham despite criticism they had been too negative. After replacing Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro at half-time, he brought Patrick Dorgu on for Diogo Dalot and in a bid to see out the game took off Joshua Zirkzee for Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha for Manuel Ugarte.",
      "With West Ham level in the 83rd minute, the United head coach then took off Luke Shaw for Lisandro Martinez and left Kobbie Mainoo on the bench, despite his team needing a winner. But Amorim said he had made the changes because his team were losing too many second balls and he felt they still had the firepower to score goals.",
      "\"No,\" he said when asked if he would change the replacements. \"We are losing because of the second ball. Sometimes there's not more men in front that you are going to win the ball. We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?",
      "\"It was the second ball. I was worried with Matheus. I know that Bruno has reached the box really well. Mason Mount is playing in his position. They were trying to push us. Bryan has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one position. So that was my idea.\"",
      "Asked how he felt after seeing his side concede a late equaliser that cost them a chance of going fifth in the Premier League, he said he was \"frustrated and angry\", but then rejected claims his team were failing to progress.",
      "\"It’s not going backwards, we had some moments,\" he said. \"That can happen. You were talking about when we had the [good] run we were perfect, we are not, we are really inconsistent.",
      "\"If you look at the goal, 83 minutes we have a log ball and everything under control and we have to do better.\"",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 against West Ham in the Premier League on Thursday.",
      "The Reds produced their most disappointing display of the season against Everton in their first game back after the international break, losing 1-0 at Old Trafford despite the visitors playing much of the game with 10 men.",
      "Crystal Palace was an opportunity to bounce back from that defeat and Ruben Amorim's men did just that, putting a poor first-half display behind them to win 2-1 thanks to goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount.",
      "But United were unable to build on that performance, drawing against West Ham.",
      "Recap what happened at Old Trafford here.",
      "If anything sums up Manchester United's inability to plot a smooth course under Ruben Amorim, it is the manner of the goal that denied them a crucial win against West Ham.",
      "A day on from talking up their ability from set-pieces, United were undone by one. The equaliser from an 83rd-minute corner was a reminder that vulnerabilities remain and for all the improvement in the other box, they are still weak in their own. It was a painful blow for a side who looked on course to stick themselves into the Champions League conversation.",
      "There was no anger at the final whistle this time, as there had been against Everton. Instead, it was a resigned silence. None of the players on the pitch slumped to their knees, but they put their hands on their hips and stared at the ground. This wasn't the performance of a team destined for the big time in Europe, but a win had them heading in that direction.",
      "Now they will look on and curse another result that got away, another goal conceded from a corner and another second-half they have failed to win.",
      "Read the full article here.",
      "Senne Lammens: One wayward kick in the first half but was solid aside from that. Didn't have a lot to do but safe hands when Bowen's shot was deflected his way. Nothing he could do to prevent the goal. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Solid on his return to the team. A vital late block and a goalline clearance that deserved more than the rebound going in. 6",

      "Read the full ratings here.",
      "That's the final whistle here.",

      "Dalot has been replaced by Dorgu.",
      "United have lacked a killer touch in front of goal tonight. Some good, direct wing play from Amad, Zirkzee’s link-up play been excellent, Mbeumo and Cunha lively at times, but none of them looked like scoring. No surprise the goal involved in a stroke of luck but Dalot showed composure in the finish.",
      "Casemiro's shot is deflected and Dalot fires home from the six yard box - he couldn't miss.",
      "We have lift off at Old Trafford. United will move to fifth with a victory.",
      "Mbeumo's shot from the edge of the box was on target, but it deflected off Souceck and Yoro.",

      "Could have scored and promising signs 6",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "United have looked most likely to score when Fernandes has played the ball into the box. Mazraoui should have done better just there. United have improved in the last 10 minutes after making a poor start.",
      "Malacia, Mainoo and Mount have been sent to warm up.",
      "Fernandes just sent another cross to the back post but West Ham cleared ahead of Zirkzee.",
      "Heaven was all over Wilson just there and might have been lucky to get away with it. Amorim will be tempted to take him off. United just came close to scoring, with Wan-Bissaka denying Zirkzee from the goal-line.",
      "Set-pieces could be vital again tonight for United but they do lack a bit of height to attack then, especially against a big West Ham team. That corner showed there is more than one way to skin a cat. Mbeumo worked a shooting position from his own corner and his effort was an excellent one. First sight of goal United have had and it needs to get them going, because this has been a poor start.",
      "Great save from Areola to deny Mbeumo from the edge of the box.",
      "Fernandes played a hopeful ball in the box but Zirkzee wasn't close enough to connect.",
      "Yoro has been sent to warm up already, which tells you how Heaven has started this game.",
      "Wilson just had Heaven on toast there and the yougster came close to bringing him down with an outstretched leg.",
      "Heaven got turned a little too easily by Wilson on halfway in the first couple of minutes of this game and he’s been dragged up the pitch by Bowen on a couple of occasions. A big task for him to play that central role in the back three today and West Ham look to be trying to play on a lack of experience. That was a crude tackle and being on a yellow card for more than 80 minutes isn’t ideal.",
      "Heaven has made a nervous start to the game and was just booked for a clumsy tackle.",
      "Wan-Bissaka ran past a few United players to get into a dangerous area then and West Ham should have made more of that chance. He was running at speed but there was a lack of appetite and focus to go with him. He flew past Casemiro, he didn’t seem attuned to the threat he was posing. West Ham worked a couple of promising attacks so far and been some signs of some good link-up play.",
      "Dalot was superb from the left last weekend and was just involved in some decent link up play with Zirkzee. Amorim spoke about needing more from Dalot going forward on that side. It seems he got the message.",
      "Mbeumo just picked the ball up in a central area and beat his man. He drifted in from the right in the second half last weekend and it was quite effective. Amad just went down in the box but it was not a penalty."

      "United took the lead in a scrappy game through Diogo Dalot's goal just before the hour mark and a win would have taken them fifth in the Premier League, but they failed to see the game out as Soungoutou Magassa equalised seven minutes from time.",
      "That goal came from a corner, with Noussair Mazraoui clearing Jarrod Bowen's initial header off the line before Magassa turned in the rebound, but Amorim was more frustrated at the soft concession of the corner.",
      "The Hammers had a clear height advantage against United, who seemed to be under no threat when a long ball was sent into their half, but Leny Yoro failed to win the header and they ended up giving a crucial corner away.",
      "\"Second ball is sometimes a tactical thing, we try to adjust with the players that we put in and then we control.,\" said Amorim. \"In the final minutes we had the possession, the ball was far from the opponent, it was not a clear full press from the opponent.",
      "\"We cannot let a team that is so much taller than us to have a corner when the ball is in the goalkeeper. This kind of detail makes the difference and today a corner in the second half made the difference.\"",
      "It continued United's wretched second-half record in the Premier League this season. The two goals they scored at Crystal Palace at the weekend is the only time they have won a second half this season and Amorim accepts they must improve after the break.",
      "\"There are second halves that we lost control of the game today, I think it was not that case,\" he said. \"Maybe after the first goal we lost some second balls and Matheus won one or two second balls there and made a transition.",
      "\"We tried to defend all the time, far from the goal because we knew it. They tried to make a cross, win a corner. It happened. Long ball, they win a second ball against three guys of us in the defence. So we need to be better in second halves.\"",
      "United's goal came from Casemiro's deflected shot falling kindly for Dalot, but they struggled to create much aside from that. Bryan Mbeumo had a shot turned away by Alphonse Areola and Joshua Zirkzee had an effort cleared off the line by Aaron Wan-Bissaka.",
      "They continue to struggle to create chances from open play and Amorim knows goalscoring is an area that has to improve, given their propensity for failing to see out leads.",
      "\"I always have the feeling that everyone has the feeling that we need to score more goals and nothing is sure,\" he said. \"Even with Brighton, we were 3-0 and then suddenly, so we suffer with that. We are inconsistent, we need to improve.\"",

      "A year ago today, Manchester United lost to Arsenal, conceding two goals from corner kicks. Later in the month, they would concede set-piece goals to Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth at Old Trafford, as well as seeing Tottenham and Wolves score direct from corners against them.",
      "The heat was on Ruben Amorim's assistant Carlos Fernandes back then. United were a soft touch at set pieces and offered virtually no threat at the other end of the pitch, and that woeful combination led to calls for Fernandes to be stripped of set-piece planning responsibilities.",
      "Now, every time United get a corner or a free-kick, Fernandes still rises to his feet to oversee the plans, but gone are the jitters that come defensively and the expectation that nothing will come of it in the opposition's penalty area. United's comeback success at Selhurst Park last weekend was thanks to two set-piece goals and only Arsenal have scored more of them this season.",
      "But United are creating a higher xG from set-pieces and are scoring goals from them at a better rate than the Gunners, who only top the scoring charts because they have more attacking corners and free-kicks than Amorim's side. Amorim has admitted to stealing set-piece ideas from other clubs, but gave credit for the upturn in fortunes to the work Fernandes is doing on the training ground and the research he is putting in on the opposition.",
      "He is backed up by 27-year-old first-team analyst Kaita Hasegawa, who is devoted to set-pieces. Hasegawa has also recruited a team of data experts tasked with focusing on them. Once Hasegawa and his team have passed the information on to Fernandes, the 31-year-old devises routines and gets down to business at Carrington on running the players through them. The work is paying dividends.",
      "\"In this league, set pieces can win you games,\" said Amorim. \"Or you can lose if you don't pay attention to that. I'm really pleased with the job that they are doing.\"",
      "United's approach to set-pieces seemed shambolic when Amorim first arrived, but, as with so much of the Portuguese head coach's first year, a lack of time on the training ground played a part in that.",
      "Now, United have a week to prepare for most games, having failed to qualify for Europe and been dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August. That free time is helping to improve their sharpness at set-pieces.",
      "\"Last year we trained without the real movement we can put in the position,\" said Amorim. \"If you don't have space and you cannot put load because they are recovering, it's not the same thing.",
      "\"[Now] you have more time to kick corners and free-kicks and you can create real game situations this year. That helps. If you train more time you will improve. That is normal.\"",
      "Amorim believes United can still improve defensively when it comes to set-pieces and admitted that area of the game is now so crucial in the Premier League that it is impacting his team selection.",
      "\"You have to think about who you put in the squad, if you play with Amad, Bryan, Bruno, all these guys,\" he said. \"If you don't have Casemiro - and we suffer against Tottenham with that - not Sesko, not Harry.",
      "\"So you have to make a balance sometimes, thinking 'yes, the idea for the game is this one, but if you have set pieces against it cannot be this team'. Our league is like that at the moment.",
      "\"You need to think not just the way you are going to play but also in set pieces. If you look at it with a little bit of attention to the league you understand that set pieces are massive for the game. Sometimes, to open the game. If you score a goal you are in better conditions to win the game.\"",

      "Roy Keane has accused Manchester United of being \"frightened\" to see games out. The former United captain slammed Ruben Amorim's side after they failed to maintain the lead at home to West Ham United.",
      "The 1-1 draw with the Hammers meant that they missed another opportunity to close the gap on the Champions League places and move up to fifth in the Premier League. Diogo Dalot handed United the lead after 58 minutes but seven minutes from time, Soungoutou Magassa levelled proceedings.",
      "United have failed to win at Old Trafford in their last two, losing out to Everton last Monday. The defeat to the Toffees heaped misery on the Portuguese tactician after they failed to take advantage of Idrissa Gueye's first-half red card.",
      "But Keane took aim at the mentality of the United team as he highlighted the frustration following the point.",
      "\"After getting the goal you're thinking United...'now go on'. They're playing a team in the bottom three they're probably lacking confidence,\" he said.",
      "\"You get a goal in front and United, they just take their foot off the gas. They made some substitutions, their subs are going off...everyone at Old Trafford now gets a standing ovation.",
      "\"It's all a bit silly. You're 1-0 up...United now last two home games, one goal. You're just putting yourself under pressure.",
      "\"Every time I watch this United team, they just leave you disappointed. They weren't clinical and nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"United again, people are scratching their heads. One minute, you're giving United credit and if they win they go fifth.",
      "\"There will be a lot of frustration at Old Trafford tonight. I think the standard of United's play in the last three or four games has been desperate, really really poor.",
      "\"Almost frightened to get the job done, frightened to go up to fifth. My goodness, we are talking about fifth here by the way, not top of the league. Same old problems.\"",
      "United move above rivals Liverpool in the table, to eighth, as they sit four points off Chelsea, who currently occupy the final Champions League place.",
      "Amorim's side travel to rock-bottom Wolves on Monday looking to kickstart momentum before the hectic festive period kicks in when they face Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Newcastle before hosting the reverse fixture against Rob Edwards' side in 12 days.",
      "From a defensive standpoint, Magassa's leveller compounded a disappointing run of games without keeping a clean sheet.",
      "The Frenchman's 83rd-minute effort meant that United have not kept a clean sheet in seven, their last coming in the 2-0 win over Sunderland on October 4.",

      "Ruben Amorim spoke to the media on Wednesday ahead of Manchester United's Premier League clash with West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim offered an update on the fitness of Matheus Cunha with the Brazilian back in training and available to face the Hammers.",
      "But United do have fresh injuries with two players doubts while Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire remain sidelined.",
      "Recap all the latest from Amorim's press conference below",
      "That's a wrap from Ruben. Here's the main headlines from what he had to say and from around United today.",
      "United have two fresh injury doubts for West Ham after cryptic Amorim answer",
      "What Amorim told Yoro after United reaction",
      "United stance on JJ Gabriel transfer as Barcelona step up interest",
      "It’s normal in any profession when you are exposed to it. I don’t read it, I protect myself.",
      "I don’t watch TV when they are talking about Manchester United. Not because I don’t agree, a lot of time I do, but it’s a way of me being healthy.",
      "My feeling as a coach is enough, I don’t need other feelings. The only way is protect myself. Of course I lose money from sponsors on Instagram, for my protection of my family and living a normal life is not worth some pounds.",
      "I protect myself and nobody can tough me more than me when we lose and when we don’t play well. Nowadays it’s really normal to have that abuse so it’s the only way to survive.",
      "Ruben Amorim has told Leny Yoro to stop beating himself up over mistakes, and revealed he had pulled the young centre-back aside after he showed his frustration in Manchester United's win at Crystal Palace on Sunday.",
      "Yoro conceded the penalty which allowed Jean-Philippe Mateta to open the scoring at Selhurst Park, before goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount saw United side roar back in the second half.",
      "Amorim took Yoro off during the celebrations for the equaliser, with Noussair Mazraoui already stripped and ready to come on. The 20-year-old showed his frustration as he was withdrawn and needed an arm around the shoulder from Mason Mount at full-time.",
      "That gesture was praised by Amorim, who revealed he had spoken to Yoro about his reaction to mistakes and also used this week to show him clips of positive elements from his performance at Selhurst Park to try and rebuild his confidence.",
      "Read more here",
      "I had no doubts he will have success. He’s really experienced, he knows how to work with different squads, understands really well the league.",
      "We know it’s going to be tough, he’s really smart preparing the games.",
      "The preparation is about the opponent but I’m focused on what we need to do and what we need to improve.",
      "He can do a lot of things better, like other players. When you see a very good game of Diogo he can show he has the quality, but sometimes he drops a little bit.",
      "He’s really powerful, he’s good on set-pieces, he can play both sides. To have that ability of playing both sides that can help you to think about the squad. He’s a very important player for us but he needs to improve like another player.",
      "Try to explain every day how to play, if you're comfortable and don’t have any doubts when you are playing that will help the kids.",
      "Then to work the physicality, the speed of the pressure, the moments to have the ball and pass the ball is completely different to U21s.",
      "He’ll have the chance, I don’t know, but he’s ready to play.",
      "It’s really important. I also spoke with him because he thinks too much, he makes a mistake and then he struggles.",
      "He wants to do everything so well. He’s growing, with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy.",
      "He cannot show that to the people the way he came to the bench, he knows that. It shows he cares, he knows it wasn’t his best game.",
      "He has more levels to go. He’s at a different club, different pressure, he was struggling because he was not scoring, he was thinking too much about the numbers but the influence he has in the team is important to us.",
      "Amorim confirms Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire remain out but Matheus Cunha is back.",
      "The United boss also says that two other members of his squad are doubts for the contest but didn't name them and will make a late call on their inclusion for the game against the Hammers.",
      "Read the full story here",
      "The Brazilian has been missing for the past few weeks with injury but has returned to training.",
      "That is a huge boost for United given striker Benjamin Sesko is also sidelined. Amorim will provide a more detailed update on the fitness of his squad shortly.",
      "Cunha hasn't featured since the draw with Spurs ahead of the international break.",
      "The United boss will be speaking just about now to the journalists in the room at Carrington.",
      "As ever, the press conference runs to a 15 minute embargo meaning we will be able to bring you the live quotes from 1.30pm.",
      "So stay tuned!",
      "There is a rare midweek Premier League outing for Manchester United this week as the busy Christmas period nears.",
      "United host West Ham United on Thursday night (8pm kick-off) and they go into the game in good spirits. Despite being 1-0 down at half-time, Ruben Amorim’s side came out as 2-1 winners against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The game against West Ham will now give the team chance to gain momentum and record back-to-back wins. United captain Bruno Fernandes had given United a slight injury scare in the closing stages of the game against Palace, but Amorim has confirmed that he had just been on the end of a kick and should be fine.",
      "The side have also been given another boost ahead of the clash against the Hammers with forward Matheus Cunha providing an update on his injury. Here’s a look at the latest from the treatment room at Carrington.",
      "This week presents a relatively unique experience for Manchester United, who for the first time since the end of August have a midweek game and a short turnaround between fixtures. The embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby further cleared an already quiet schedule for a team not in Europe this year, and United have benefited from the lack of midweek games to drill down into Ruben Amorim's plans on the training pitches at Carrington.",
      "They have played only 14 games this season, compared to the 20 contested by Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle. A gap of just four days between Sunday's win at Crystal Palace and Thursday's Old Trafford date with West Ham is unusual for a team that has become accustomed to the pattern of long lead-ins to games. They have had at least six days to prepare for every match since the start of September.",
      "However, the fixture list is arguably still kind to United, who will play six games in December.",
      "Read more here",
      "There was a nod to his teammates from Luke Shaw at Carrington on Tuesday as he was presented with a commemorative framed shirt to celebrate his 300th appearance for Manchester United, a milestone he might have never expected to reach during his lower moments at Old Trafford.",
      "Shaw's United career has often been one of survival. From spells where he has looked one of the best in the world in his position, to times when injuries have repeatedly struck him down and left him frustrated on the sidelines and a source of criticism from the stands.",
      "The 30-year-old has started every Premier League game this season and has developed into a senior statesman in this squad. He was presented with the shirt by director of football Jason Wilcox and head coach Ruben Amorim, before delivering a speech to the squad and first-team staff. That is something Amorim has introduced this season.",
      "Read more on the changing dressing room dynamic here",
      "Manchester United are confident of keeping hold of JJ Gabriel despite Barcelona stepping up their efforts to sign the academy starlet. The 15-year-old and his family have been guests of Barcelona at the Nou Camp on at least one occasion recently and were given a tour of the facilities as the Catalan club try and woo the United teenager.",
      "Their interest in Gabriel is long-standing. Gabriel has met Barcelona players during his visits to the Spanish city and it has been made clear that the club would like to bring him to their iconic La Masia academy at some point in the future. The England Under-16 international has long been talked about as one of the best talents to emerge from the United academy in recent seasons, but his goalscoring exploits for the Under-18s have seen him enter the wider consciousness this season.",
      "Read more here",
      "Hello and welcome to our live press conference blog. Amorim will speak to the media at 1.30pm today as he looks ahead of Thursday's Old Trafford clash with West Ham.",
      "We can expect an update on injuries with Matheus Cunha in contention to return to the squad against West Ham and there will also be an update on the availability of Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo around the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Keep across this blog throughout the day for updates from Carrington."

      "While Amorim is dealing with an almost fully fit squad, he still has a couple of injury and fitness issues to deal with. Harry Maguire, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha have missed the last two matches, but the United head coach is expected to welcome one of the injured trio back for the game against the Hammers.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim also confirmed in his pre-match press conference that he has two fresh doubts from the win at Palace. However, he refused to name either of the stricken duo.",

      "Injury: Knock",

      "What Amorim has said: \"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we're going to approach it, let's see if they can play. The rest of the squad is good. Matheus is back. Harry and Sesko are still out.\"",
      "Potential return date: vs West Ham (H), Thursday, December 4",
      "Injury: Knee",
      "Former RB Leipzig man Sesko was forced off the pitch in the second half against Tottenham before the international break and has missed the last two matches. But, unlike Cunha, Thursday's game at home to West Ham is going to come too soon for the Slovenia international, who is still out.",
      "What Amorim has said: \"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we're going to approach it, let's see if they can play. The rest of the squad is good. Matheus is back. Harry and Sesko are still out.\"",

      "That is something Amorim has introduced this season, ensuring achievements are marked in the right manner, and it has become clear in recent weeks that the atmosphere in the dressing room is as strong as it has been for many years.",
      "Carrington insiders talk of how easy every player is to deal with and there has been a collective approach to things like media duties and community appearances this season. It may not be a coincidence that naturally quieter players, such as Shaw and Mason Mount, have found their voice. Shaw has helped Matheus Cunha settle in and has struck up a friendship with the Brazilian, while Mount is now bringing his experience to bear on the squad.",
      "It was noticeable that Sunday's matchwinner wrapped an arm around Leny Yoro at Selhurst Park on Sunday and Mount, having shunned media duties in his first couple of years at the club, has become an excellent talker off the pitch.",
      "The dressing room now feels a more level, meritocratic place. Some notable figures and personalities have left the club in recent years. Players such as Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho could bring the mood down and dominant personalities like Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo have gone.",
      "Despite the frequent turnover of managers in recent years at United, it is the players who have often faced scrutiny from supporters. That feels like it's changing this season and even if there are questions around the quality of some players, the idea that the dressing room is toxic or plotting behind the back of the manager has gone.",
      "That might be Amorim's biggest success so far. There are signs of progress on the pitch, but off it he has changed the culture and the environment at Carrington, which has been absolutely vital. He has been especially ruthless with players whom he considered to be a bad influence or who affected the mood of the dressing room, axing Rashford, Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho as a result.",
      "The benefits of that approach are now being seen. This feels like a squad on the same page and willing to stick together and that hasn't always been the case for Amorim's predecessors.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Manchester United are running out of turning points.",
      "They can’t keep taking one step forward and then two steps back, and that’s the incredibly unsexy dance they performed once again in their 1-1 draw at home to West Ham after beating Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "That was a huge win, an unexpected win, against a very good team. They had to back that up with another win against a pretty poor one. Alas, they didn’t.",
      "Ruben Amorim should be criticised for his substitutions, which ultimately cost them victory on Thursday night. He even managed to spark debate with his starting XI.",
      "The Manchester United head coach made the bold call to hand young defender Ayden Heaven his first start of the season, with Matthijs de Ligt – the club’s player of the month – out due to a minor injury. Heaven didn’t come in for De Ligt, but for Leny Yoro, whose dropping to the bench was a “tactical” decision.",
      "Heaven needed to settle quickly, and he did the opposite, smashing into Jarrod Bowen with a slide tackle and receiving a yellow card after only eight minutes. Not ideal, but it clearly didn’t rattle him because he didn’t have a poor first half. Still, he evidently wasn’t good enough in Amorim’s eyes as he was substituted at half-time for Yoro, with the booking clearly concerning the Portuguese.",
      "Heaven starting on Thursday reaffirmed what we already knew: Kobbie Mainoo is in Man United exile.",
      "After emerging as one of the club’s best players under Erik ten Hag, becoming an England regular and starting in the final of Euro 2024, Mainoo can’t get a kick anymore, and a January sale is looking more likely with every passing week.",
      "Another appearance on the bench while Heaven was in the starting XI left Mainoo in worrying company with Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martínez and Tyrell Malacia as United’s only first-team players yet to start in the Premier League this season. If you were unsure, that’s their third-choice goalkeeper, a guy who has been injured all season, and someone who was in Amorim’s pre-season bomb squad.",
      "While his standing in the Red Devils’ squad hierarchy is striking, it’s not like he’d have transformed a cautious United performance.",
      "Amorim has said that he’s competing for a starting spot with club captain and best player Bruno Fernandes, and from the minor minutes we’ve seen of them together, it actually makes sense. But for Mainoo, it’s a horrible situation; Fernandes is literally undroppable. His form needs to fall off a cliff to be benched, and he’s only missed nine Premier League games in five full seasons, largely due to suspension.",
      "Casemiro has also been pretty good in midfield for the Red Devils and is Amorim’s biggest success story. He has been criticised for his rashness in the past, but he is more disciplined in that position than Mainoo.",
      "Man United fans are desperate to see Mainoo play more because they love him and he’s an academy graduate with incredible potential, but during a disappointing performance against West Ham, there can’t have been many people watching and thinking the game was crying out for him.",
      "Their performance made for a very dull first half at Old Trafford, highlighted largely by Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s defensive contributions.",
      "The first genuine moment of quality came from Alphonse Areola, who acrobatically tipped Bryan Mbeumo’s cross-cum-shot over the bar, denying United another set-piece goal that would have seen them overtake Arsenal in that statistic in the 2025/26 Premier League season.",
      "In terms of attacking quality, that was really all she wrote in the opening 45 minutes. There was a brief flurry of shots that could have sparked Ruben Amorim’s men into life; Wan-Bissaka cleared a Joshua Zirkzee header off the line, Matheus Cunha had an overhead kick blocked, and Bruno Fernandes’ scissor volley clipped the post. It wasn’t the shot in the arm United needed, just three shots.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was player of the half, adding an incredible sliding tackle on Cunha in his own box before producing an expertly read headed clearance from a tantalising Fernandes cross.",
      "It was unfortunately much of the same when the game restarted, but in a match between two teams that can be excruciating to watch that was crying out for a goal, we finally got one just before the hour mark, and in fairness, it did improve proceedings.",
      "Diogo Dalot benefited from a bit of luck when Casemiro’s blocked shot fell straight to him, though he still had plenty to do. His first touch was perfect and the finish was that of an experienced No.9, shifting the ball past Wan-Bissaka and in the opposite direction of Areola’s momentum.",
      "Beating West Ham at home was the only acceptable outcome for United, and going up into the Champions League places would’ve been a welcome bonus. But after taking the lead, they didn’t push for a second, and as the second didn’t come and their opponents found an equaliser, Amorim’s substitutions will rightly be criticised.",
      "Patrick Dorgu on for the goalscorer, Manuel Ugarte for Matheus Cunha, and Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee suggested that Amorim thought it had to be a case of holding onto the one-goal lead rather than pressing on against one of the worst teams in the Premier League this year and putting the game to bed.",
      "Ironically, when Nuno Espírito Santo brought on Andy Irving, his first contribution was to instantly take a corner kick that led to Soungoutou Magassa’s 83rd-minute equaliser.",
      "United might feel aggrieved that Wan-Bissaka wasn’t shown the most blatant of second yellow cards you’ll see all season, but the fact of the matter is that they didn’t do nearly enough to win the game. Areola wasn’t tested enough and any half-chance they did get was rashly wasted, like Fernandes’ left-footed volley in the fifth minute of injury time.",
      "There was a serious lack of quality at Old Trafford. It was just a bad game of football. The United players looked dejected at the end, knowing it was an unacceptable performance and that West Ham at home should have been an easy three points.",
      "Questions will be asked about Amorim’s in-game management again. It cost United and epitomises their season so far: one step forward, two steps back. Just when you think they could get back amongst it, they do something stupid. It’s tiring for us, let alone someone who actually goes to the games.",
      "It’s bottom-club Wolves next. Another team in the relegation zone. No matter how poor they are, United can’t relax and act as if the game is won at 1-0. Or, knowing this team, even at 2-0.",
      "Amorim’s substitutions were so negative that they rubbed off on his players, who seemed to think it was game over and that they could just see it out. Nope. West Ham can still punish you. Even Wolves can still punish you.",
      "United can’t become too casual in these fixtures. They cannot follow an impressive win at Palace with a poor draw at home to West Ham. And we can’t keep looking at games and saying afterwards, ‘Well, Amorim will learn from this.’",
      "It’s clear that this team still has a long way to go. They’ve taken a step forward and a step back so many times they no longer have any idea which way they’re facing.",

      "However, one win in their last four matches since has hinted that the same inconsistencies under Amorim remain as they struggle to push themselves towards the top of the league.",
      "Man Utd spent most of their summer budget on three attacking signings with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Only four Premier League clubs scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term but many fans, former players and pundits were shocked that they failed to sign a new midfielder over the summer.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",

Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.

Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",

      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",

      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",

      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But , well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",

      "“You can leave them out of the side and the rest of the squad can cope. But when you have three or four players who are really talented, but just aren’t at the races, then it drags the team down a level.”",
      "“It’s really hard for the manager to turn that situation around, so I think it’s very important to act decisively in situations like that, so Amorim got rid of them (the disruptive players).",
      "“He replaced them with Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha, and now United are playing at a higher level than what we had before. These three work hard, they’re willing to defend, they don’t think they’re bigger than the team. With a negative attitude, a team is in big trouble.",
      "“I think that was the main goal for United in the transfer market. Players who thought about themselves above the team, they needed to go. The squad is more balanced now.",
      "“You need at least three quarters of your team to be dedicated, willing to sacrifice, and talented too. You can afford a few flair players who might not always have that attitude, but it has to be a small minority. Back when I was there, we had Gary and Phil Neville, John O’Shea, Wes Brown. They made life easier for us.”"

The one that feels his methods clash with the club’s identity. And here are the seven names leading this stance: Jude Bellingham, Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Valverde, Brahim Diaz, Ferland Mendy, and Eduardo Camavinga. Endrick joins them, also expressing his discomfort.’",

      "“At that age, you just want to play football, you just want to express yourself. He burst onto the scene and for a while he was always the first name on the team sheet. Now all of a sudden no matter what he does, he’s not on the team sheet. So where do you go from there? For me, he has to look elsewhere. He needs to get football. He needs to get minutes.",

      "“Hence the reason why I’m saying that no matter what he does, he’s not going to start unless something happens and unless Casemiro’s form drops again, or someone gets injured, I think he just will not get a start on merit. Which is the sad thing, because he would be in there otherwise.”",

      "Back in early November, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed what we can expect from Man Utd in the January transfer window.",
      "Romano told his YouTube channel: “Ruben Amorim sends clear indications in public and in private for Manchester United in the January transfer window. In private, the conversations have started between Amorim, the board, and the management of Man Utd ahead of the January window.",
      "“I told you about the midfielder. I told you that Man Utd are looking for that position. But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "Romano added: “But Amorim sends a clear message also in public talking about January. First of all, he says the window will be open and there is the possibility they will do something. So, not closing the doors to the opportunity to bring in new players, and it’s already an update for Man Utd. But he also says, ‘I don’t want players for the short-term.’",
      "“Amorim is not bringing in a player for just a few months. A player will join Man Utd only if they believe the player could be an option for the long-term. They don’t want to add a player just in terms of numbers, also because Man Utd have one competition this season plus the FA Cup incoming, and they want to focus on the Premier League.",
      "“They already have several players. So, if someone joins in January, it will be a player who Man Utd can trust for the present but also for the future.”",
      "Manchester United have reportedly decided to break the £100m barrier on their next addition, though four stars may need to leave first.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed why Manchester United feel that their first 2026 signing is a “hidden gem” and has been likened to a Chelsea star.",
      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100m for Elliot Anderson after Man City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will not be signing Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window, according to reports.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Mikael Silvestre fears his former club face an uphill battle to make a Champions League return, as he painted a gloomy picture for Ruben Amorim’s team.",
      "Silvestre was a Champions League winner with United back in 2008 and also won four Premier League titles during Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign at Old Trafford, but he has warned the club’s supporters that they face a wait to see their team back in Europe’s elite competition.",
      "Speaking exclusively to Football365 with Poker Scout, the former France international defender has suggested United boss Ruben Amorim and his team cannot be expected to return to the Champions League next season after a lowly 15th place finish in the Premier League last season.",
      "“The top four for me is not realistic from where they were last season,” said Silvestre. “It’s just too difficult to picture how they will do that because of the lack of consistency.",
      "“We saw it against Everton when they lost 1-0 (at Old Trafford last week). You cannot have this kind of blip in the Premier League and expect to finish in the top four.",
      "“Of course, the other teams around you have to perform and we can see that Liverpool are not having a good time, but I feel the top four is too much for United this season.",
      "READ: Every Prem club’s player of the season so far includes four sold by Newcastle",
      "“For me, it would be a big surprise if United are in the Champions League next season and if they are in it, let’s be honest, they will not be there to win it.”",
      "Silvestre believes the United hierarchy has no option other than to back under-pressure manager Amorim as he looks to revive the club’s fortunes, as he suggests the club’s botched attempts to fill the void left by Ferguson’s retirement in 2013 has left a lasting scar.",
      "“The transition for the future wasn’t prepared when Sir Alex left,” he continues. “Everyone in his backroom staff went with him and that was a problem. There was a big gap to be filled and a very difficult one.",
      "“The whole United organisation was built on Sir Alex’s knowledge and everything was based around this personality. So in my view, the club has never recovered from his departure.",
      "“Now it feels like there are some people in place at the club who have been quite successful where they have been before.",
      "“When I was there, it was Sir Alex at the top and everyone around him, but now the club have built an organisation that has different parts and now they have to back Amorim.",
      "“I think he showed why he didn’t want to come in when he did last year, in the middle of the season, because it was always going to be difficult.",
      "“It was always going to be a case of giving him time and getting players into the squad to play in the system he wants to play, so Amorim needs time and assurances from the club if they want to build a squad that can compete for the title with him.",
      "“You need to back him up as long as possible. You are not going to build something quickly. We have seen that with Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. He needs time.”",
      "Every United defeat sparks what has become an all-too-familiar stream of criticism and talk of a crisis developing around Amorim and his team, with Silvestre suggesting the United manager and his players would be shrewd to ignore the criticism.",
      "“It doesn’t help for sure that there is so much negativity out there around United, but it’s hard to block out the noise,” he added.",
      "“The media are everywhere and social media is also very strong now. The players, the staff and everyone in the club are working on trying to improve things and they have to be resilient to ignore the noise when there is pressure.",
      "“If I was a player now, I would block the comments on social media, for sure. Then it is just the traditional media that you need to hear about.",
      "“Otherwise, you will have thousands of messages after a match and if it has not gone well, most of them will be negative. If you start listening to all of this negativity, you will not be able to do your job properly.”",

      "Manchester United are ready to spend a club-record fee to sign Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest, as per a report, and Manuel Ugarte is among four players who could leave Old Trafford to help fund the swoop.",
      "According to Manchester World, Man Utd are ready to spend £100million (€114m / $132m) on a ‘top midfield target’ in 2026. Forest star Anderson has emerged as their priority option, while the report claims Brighton & Hove Albion’s Carlos Baleba is still on the shortlist.",
      "Man Utd ‘are also interested in Joao Gomes and Angelo Stiller’ – described by the report as two cheaper options – but they ‘know it will take a club-record fee to sign an elite option’.",
      "A £100m deal for Anderson would eclipse the £89m paid to Juventus to bring Paul Pogba back to Old Trafford in August 2016, which was a world record at the time.",
      "United are ramping up their interest in Anderson after learning Manchester City have also decided to chase him.",
      "It was recently claimed the England international is leaning towards City, but this has yet to be confirmed by other outlets.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side received a boost on Tuesday as Forest landed on Lyon’s Tyler Morton as a possible replacement for Anderson.",
      "United made an approach for Baleba during the last transfer window, but we understand they have since cooled their interest due to his drop off in form.",
      "United see Anderson as the dream solution to their midfield issues, and our transfer insider Fraser Fletcher reported on November 18 that they could follow up on his capture with two more signings in the position.",
      "Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Conor Gallagher of Atletico Madrid are also on United’s radar.",
      "DIVE DEEPER 🌟 Key factor in Elliot Anderson hunt revealed as Man Utd face Liverpool, Man City threat – sources",

      "The Red Devils are ‘planning a major overhaul’ of their midfield ranks, and Ugarte will be a ‘casualty’ as he will be allowed to move on.",

      "The Daily Mail add that ‘the clock is ticking’ over the future of Casemiro, as he will soon enter the final six months of his contract.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has also discussed the future of Andre Onana, who is currently on loan at Trabzonspor.",
      "On his YouTube channel, the reliable journalist said ‘Onana’s chapter at United is closed’. The goalkeeper will return to United in June but will quickly ‘try to find a new solution’ as he is not in Amorim’s plans.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim has decided to keep Joshua Zirkzee, despite his tough spell at Old Trafford so far.",
      "Sources state that Zirkzee’s upturn in form has seen him earn a place at United for the full campaign.",
      "Nevertheless, United could still add another centre-forward to their ranks in January, and they are battling Arsenal for a €50m (£44m) Bundesliga hitman."

      "Introducing the Premier League of Christmas Jumpers, a definitive table ranking each Premier League team’s Christmas jumper offering to find the best, the worst, and the tackiest Christmas jumpers money can buy.",
      "We have ranked the jumpers on originality, ugliness, Christmas-feel and more festively vague factors that will almost definitely ruin Christmas for many fans who disagree with our line-up.",
      "Introducing the Premier League of Christmas jumpers 2025:",
      "",
      "1) West Ham’s Christmas collection",
      "The design team at West Ham have been having a lot of fun with their Christmas jumpers and we absolutely approve.",
      "‘Santa is a Hammer’, ‘I’m forever blowing baubles’ and ‘All I Want For Christmas Is WHU’ are inspired choices and the club has even rolled out Jarren Bowen to model the collection.",
      "Tacky, pun-tastic and perfectly blending club-specific chants with a Christmas theme. The Hammers have nailed it.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool’s Candy Cane",
      "Liverpool’s standard Christmas jumper is about as disappointing as an Ibrahim Konate contract saga. It’s a bit red and white with some generic Christmas fare such as snowflakes.",
      "Luckily something is going right at Anfield at the moment because whoever designed the Candy-kit inspired Christmas jumper has knocked it out of the park. It is one of the greatest kits of all time and the white patterns lend themselves perfectly to a Christmas feel.",
      "The kit is completed by the slightly unnecessary word ‘Christmas’ as sponsor and a retro badge. Simple but effective.",
      "",
      "3) Bournemouth’s retro away kit",
      "This is how to do a Christmas jumper. Choose a famous retro away kit, in this case the stunning 1992/94 away shirt, replace anything slightly triangular with Christmas trees and get ready for the orders to flood in.",
      "Bournemouth’s retro jumper is bright, Christmassy and distinctly unflattering. It is a triumph at every level.",
      "",
      "4) Newcastle’s striped monstrosity",
      "Newcastle’s confused striped Christmas jumper gets plenty of points because it is truly ugly, like all Christmas jumpers should be.",
      "The dazzling array of stripes, Christmas tree shapes and snowflakes is certainly dazzling but it does lose points for not even trying to fit in the Newcastle Brown Ale star as some sort of Christmas tree topper.",
      "",
      "5) Everton’s Spirit of the Blues",
      "Everton’s 1998-inspired Christmas jumper and the One2One kit is a nice idea but is slightly ruined by the memory of one of the worst ever Premier League teams to somehow avoid relegation.",
      "Instead, the Spirit of the Blues Christmas jumper is our pick because the song that inspired it is the most Christmassy of all the football chants heard across the Premier League. The ‘woo’ part may baffle opposition fans but it just feels festive. Good work, Everton.",
      "",
      "6) Chillin at Cold Trafford",
      "Despite risking an angry phone call from Cole Palmer’s lawyers, Manchester United have released a fantastically hideous jumper featuring a snowman and the phrase ‘Chillin at Cold Trafford’.",
      "The patchwork style jumper is so bad it’s good and we’re picking this one over the admittedly quite nice red and white jumper featuring the famous statue of George Best, Dennis Law and Sir Bobby Charlton.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal’s Highbury Wonderland",
      "The Arsenal Highbury kit worn during the 2005/6 season is demonstrably one of the greatest Premier League home shirts, helped by the fact it was worn by some of the league’s best ever players.",
      "The Highbury Wonderland jumper based on the kit is quite nice. In fact, it’s too nice. Apart from the reindeer leaping over the Arsenal badge there is no hint of garish Christmas symbolism being crowbarred into a football theme. Disappointing.",
      "",
      "8) Spurs’ retro Christmas jumper",
      "Spurs have the enviable position of playing in all white, making any sort of Christmas design pretty easy. The retro Christmas jumper has plenty of nice touches. The Christmas pudding sponsor, the subtle snowflake pattern and the retro Spurs badge reminding us of happier times at White Hart Lane.",
      "Unfortunately the jumper loses points because it’s trying too hard to look like a football kit. We want snowmen and holly patterns, not nicely striped collars.",
      "",
      "9) Leeds’ Christmas jumper",
      "The Leeds Christmas jumper is quite nice. It has the Yorkshire rose, the club’s foundation date, some reindeer and a few snowflakes in a patchwork pattern.",
      "It is a very run of the mill Christmas jumper slightly ruined by the giant modern Leeds badge on the back. There is nothing particularly offensive by it and it’s a solid mid-table effort.",
      "",
      "10) Chelsea’s Christmas jumper",
      "Chelsea’s Christmas jumper is your bog standard effort. It’s blue and white, with Christmas trees, snowflakes and the Chelsea lion all blended into a neat patchwork design.",
      "It’s just fine. Nothing too exciting, very little design flair, but ticks all the Christmas boxes. Like a Mourinho defence of old this one is playing it safe and grinding out the points in the Christmas jumper table.",
      "",
      "11) Villa Park Christmas jumper",
      "Villa Park is one of the best grounds in the Premier League and it should be celebrated as an old school football stadium with a fantastic atmosphere.",
      "It should not, however, be celebrated on a Christmas jumper. The design is fine in that it features a bit of snow and some snowflakes, but the giant badge and stadium design feels a bit too serious.",
      "",
      "12) Wolves’ Christmas jumper",
      "Wolves offer exactly the same Christmas jumper as Burnley’s sorry effort but there is another option. Like Spurs, Wolves have gone down the classic kit route and the 1982-inspired jumper does have a nice stocking built into the alternative Goodyear logo.",
      "It is a bit bland, featuring no other highlights outside of a subtle snowflake pattern, but the Old Gold does at least feel a bit Christmassy.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester City’s Elf",
      "Manchester City have not really got into the Christmas spirit. There’s a pretty generic City badge design covered in snowflakes and one that features an elf design that is completed with your head when it’s worn.",
      "It’s a tired Christmas jumper trope but this one is saved by the fact the club will done £5 from every sale to support patients and their families at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.",
      "",
      "14) Forest’s Christmas jumper",
      "For a club whose badge is literally a tree crowned by two stars there is a distinct lack of Christmas feel in the fairly tame Forest Christmas jumper.",
      "Turning the badge into the Christmas tree is a missed chance that is so glaring Sean Dyche is probably treating the designers to their very own Gaffer’s Day as a punishment.",
      "The jumper is fine, but lacks any sort of flair. At least Dyche will agree with that bit.",
      "",
      "15) Crystal Palace Christmas jumper",
      "Crystal Palace have had some of the best kits in the Premier League in recent years so we had high hopes for the Christmas jumper of 2025.",
      "Unfortunately it’s a bit of a mess. The blue and red combine to make it seem sort of brown somehow and the design is unimaginative. Christmas jumpers are supposed to look a bit hideous but this one just looks a bit depressing.",
      "A big swing and a miss with the ‘South London and Proud’ slogan instead of something more Christmassy too.",
      "",
      "16) Sunderland Christmas jumper",
      "Sunderland’s jumper is red and white, features the word Sunderland and some half-hearted Christmas patterns.",
      "",
      "17) Burnley’s Christmas jumper",
      "Is there some sort of connection with garden gnomes and Christmas we do not know about? The Burnley Christmas jumper is pretty standard fare until you drill into the details.",
      "It features rows of sort of Christmas-themed images including baubles and snowflakes. Then you get to the aforementioned gnomes. At least they’re holding Christmas presents.",
      "A very confused Christmas jumper from a club that has a jumper aficionado as manager. Disappointing.",
      "",
      "18) Fulham’s Christmas jumper",
      "The same as the Burnley monstrosity, this is just a templated Christmas jumper featuring the baubles, the gnomes and the layered pattern.",
      "Fulham slip into the relegation places because there is too much black compared to Burnley’s slightly more festive effort.",
      "",
      "19) Brentford’s Christmas jumper",
      "The Brentford Christmas jumper is ugly enough to pass as a Christmas jumper but apart from two reindeer either side of the huge Brentford badge, it’s not screaming actual Christmas.",
      "The club has made the choice of using bee patterns instead of snowflakes and while that is unique, it feels more like a spring or summer jumper. And since they don’t exist it means relegation for Brentford.",
      "",
      "20) Brighton’s Christmas jumper",
      "Brighton have used a Millwall-style dark blue for their Christmas jumper and then stuck BHAFC on and done little else with the design.",
      "It is a jumper designed to be trendy and modern, but that is not the point of a Christmas jumper. It should make you look ridiculous at your office party.",
      "As a punishment for taking the task too seriously and ignoring the club’s actual colours, Brighton finish rock bottom of the Christmas jumper table."

      "A perfect Champions League record would land clubs a minimum of £115m this season, with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City due more with TV payments.",
      "There is a reason that eight of Europe’s biggest spenders in the 2025 transfer window came from the Premier League, including all six Champions League qualifiers: prize money.",
      "The levels of money on offer in numerous competitions are preposterous and perhaps no more so than in the Champions League, in which clubs can earn well in excess of nine figures.",
      "",
      "As part of the revamped formats for their three main competitions, UEFA have announced a revenue distribution system for how the total prize money of around £2.88billion would be allocated each season up to 2026/27.",
      "Just over £2.1bn (74.38%) will be distributed to clubs competing in the Champions League and Super Cup, £490.7m (17.02%) to teams participating in the Europa League, and £247.5m (8.6%) split between those in the Europa Conference League.",
      "In the Champions League, the pot is further broken down into:",
      "1) Equal shares (£581.7m/27.5%) – a set ‘starting fee’ of £16.2m for all 36 clubs which qualify for the league phase, who are guaranteed this money regardless of subsequent results in the competition.",
      "2) Performance-related fixed amounts (£793.6m/37.5%) – £1.8m per each league phase win, £608,000 per each league phase draw and £238,000 per each league phase position, going up in increments from the team in 36th receiving £238,000 and the team in 1st receiving £8.57m.",
      "Undistributed amounts from each league phase draw – £608,000 – are also allocated proportionately to these ranking payments at the end of the league phase, so the prize money for positions will be higher.",
      "There is also extra money on offer for finishing in the top eight and for coming between 9th and 16th. This is how Liverpool made a fortune despite being knocked out in the last 16.",
      "3) The ‘value pillar’ (£740.6m/35%) – a combination of payments based on club coefficient rankings and the TV pool. This can be harder to accurately calculate but will naturally reward the ‘bigger’ clubs and traditional elite.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and the Premier League’s four regular European qualifiers in Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would be the biggest winners here, with Qarabag, Pafos and Kairat due more modest sums.",
      "A rough estimation of all 36 participating clubs’ value pillar payments will be factored into the final prize money total, which for a few clubs should far exceed £100m.",
      "There is also a fixed fee of £3.73m for all clubs eliminated in the qualification play-offs before the commencement of the league phase. That is for the Celtics and Rangers’ of this world.",
      "",
      "The following is an estimated breakdown of how much prize money each team has already earned from participating in the Champions League in 2025/26, before matchday revenue and other factors are taken into account.",

      "FC Barcelona are uncertain about signing loanee Marcus Rashford permanently and could send him back to Manchester United at the end of the season, according to reports in Spain.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona on loan from the Red Devils in July and has made 18 appearances for his new club.",
      "The 27-year-old has registered six goals and nine assists this season, helping him return to the England squad as he stakes a claim for a spot in Thomas Tuchel’s 2026 World Cup squad.",
      "After falling out of favour under Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, Rashford shone on loan at Aston Villa during the second half of last season, but upon returning to Old Trafford, he was informed by the Portuguese head coach that he still wasn’t in his plans.",
      "Barcelona were happy to take Rashford on loan for the season and negotiated a buy option believed to be worth around €30million (£26.3m).",
      "That would be viewed as a bargain if not for the England winger’s mammoth £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Rashford’s wage is one of the reasons Barcelona are reluctant to sign him permanently, and Catalan journalist Alfredo Martinez says no decision has been made by the La Liga champions.",
      "“There are voices for and against (his staying),” Martinez explained (quotes via Sport Witness).",
      "“Some don’t want him to stay because Rashford isn’t the type of player who presses high up the pitch, and besides, he has a very high salary. Barcelona is looking, among others, for a left winger, a player to provide cover for Raphinha.”",
      "The Rashford news cycle is…interesting. When he’s fit and flying, there isn’t much noise, but a few poor games in a row and the knives come out.",
      "Spanish media were quick to realise the weight his name carries, reporting back in September that Barcelona wanted to ‘send Rashford home’ after being unconvinced by his performances.",
      "Rashford didn’t help himself with a disciplinary issue before a La Liga game against Getafe later that month, but it wasn’t blown out of proportion and he was swiftly reinstated by Barca boss Hansi Flick.",
      "There were plenty of reports about Rashford’s future in both England and Spain at the time, coinciding with some damning criticism from Manchester United legend Paul Scholes.",
      "While there have been some questionable reports about Rashford’s conduct and relationship with Flick, the Englishman has kept his head down and is enjoying his football in Catalonia.",
      "Since the start of October, he has registered four goals and five assists. But Martinez won’t let good stats get in the way of a good story.",

      "— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) September 19, 2025",
      "That being said, it’s not impossible that Barcelona genuinely aren’t convinced. But what’s even more likely is that Barca are playing a game to get Rashford for less than the €30m buy option.",
      "Despite Rashford’s good form in Spain, it’s obvious that his Manchester United chapter is over as long as Amorim is in charge, and United’s hierarchy have been very patient with him so far, hinting that there will only be one winner in that battle.",
      "It’s reported in Spain that Barca are scouring the market for alternatives, yet a recent report from the Daily Mirror claimed club president Joan Laporta was delighted with the terms of the buy option, believing it’s a ‘genuine bargain’.",
      "In truth, nobody knows. Not even Laporta knows if it’s a done deal yet. However, what is certain is that Rashford’s name will always be used and exploited for clicks.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford could now return to Old Trafford as Barcelona are ‘not convinced’ by the England international, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford has been ‘offered’ a swap deal involving Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Rashford may not get his permanent move to Barcelona in the summer but PSG have ‘tested’ the Man Utd waters with an intriguing swap offer amid interest from Arsenal.",
      "Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford reportedly had a ‘serious row’ with Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick after Tuesday’s 3-0 loss against Chelsea.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has told the club the value of the transfer of Marcus Rashford would be “great” as the Spanish media have responded poorly to his latest ...",
      "Barcelona reportedly feel Chelsea star Pedro Neto fits perfectly into their system, as there’s uncertainty over the future of Marcus Rashford despite praise from boss Hansi Flick."

      "“PSR situations, it happened with Garnacho in the summer to Chelsea. So I think Kobbie Mainoo will have an interesting window.”",
      "Ogden added: “I don’t think he will go to Arsenal, but I think he’s a player that Arsenal could look at if they were getting to the end of the window and they did a short-term option to be a cover option for Martin Odegaard.”",

      "“But with Arsenal stacked in all areas and the club having spent big in the summer, the best option in January could be a short-term loan move for a player with the ability to stand in for Odegaard, but also with the knowledge that he will only be a Plan B for when the captain is sidelined.",
      "“Options will be limited because of the calibre of player required, but domestically, Manchester United’s Kobbie Mainoo, who linked impressively with Declan Rice for England at Euro 2024, might be available, but only if United can find a replacement for the unsettled 20-year-old.”",

      "Manchester United blew the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League on Thursday when West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford; Roy Keane slammed a 'frightened' performance and questioned the standards of the home side after conceding again from a corner",
      "Thursday 4 December 2025 23:54, UK",
      "Roy Keane accused Manchester United of being too \"frightened\" to see out victory over West Ham after blowing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League, and called the performance \"desperate\".",
      "West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford when Soungoutou Magassa's 83rd-minute equaliser cancelled out Diogo Dalot's opening goal.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have only taken 20 points from 27 games at Old Trafford, and only managed one win from their last five in the league - drawing three of those, despite being ahead in each.",
      "\"After they get the goal, you are playing against a team in the bottom three, they take their foot off the gas,\" said Keane. \"Take nothing away from West Ham and they just about deserved the equaliser.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappoint. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"Same old problems. The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group of players? I've watched the games closely, the lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team. There is expectation at this club, you have to deal with that.\"",
      "Keane also questioned the standards of the home side after they switched off from a set-piece to concede the leveller. Since the start of last season, only West Ham themselves (17) have conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (15).",
      "\"The reason you are playing for Man Utd is that you deal with these situations,\" Keane added.",
      "\"If they are anxious, you worry why they are playing for Man Utd and what they are fearful of. Fearful of West Ham, why?\"",
      "\"I don't get it, I don't get the lack of urgency, and the lack of intensity. I don't get the slow play. I don't get the lack of risk in the game.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he's not going back into the changing room saying 'guys, play slowly tonight'. He's saying 'let's get the ball moving quicker, let's run forward, let's play with real threat and vigour'.",
      "\"It doesn't transpire out on the pitch, so I don't know, why does that happen? I've got no understanding.",
      "\"I don't see the actual appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game, and everything you've got, and throw it forward and take risks. They're showing us what they are, the seventh, eighth or ninth team in the league.\"",
      "Defender Diogo Dalot said his side became \"anxious\" after opening the scoring at Old Trafford, and must look at themselves after squandering another lead.",
      "\"We cannot get as anxious as we get. We were a bit more sloppy with the ball in possession. Obviously disappointed with the draw, we had the game there.",
      "\"It's a solution we need to find. In the end, we have to look to ourselves. It's more our fault.\"",
      "It was established far further back than Thursday night that Manchester United lack resolve under pressure. Diogo Dalot says his team-mates are hindered by anxiety. Really, it's just about concentration levels.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have not registered a clean sheet in seven games - since early October. They establish a foothold in games and then inevitably hand it back. They win a game and then suffer a setback in the next. There is no continuity here.",
      "United dominated every attacking metric against inferior West Ham, creating higher xG, landing more shots on target and generating three big chances - two of those were missed. They had 42 touches in the opposition box. That's a staggeringly high amount if the yield is only one goal.",
      "Ultimately, this United team have very little conviction. Amorim bemoaned a lack of second-half control post-match and blamed \"second ball losses\". If you don't compete, or can't compete, for a whole 90 minutes that is what will happen.",

      "United fought back from a goal down to secure an away win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday but continue to be held back by inconsistency under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "They have managed to beat both Liverpool and Chelsea this season but the embarrassment of their defeat to 10-man Everton is still fresh in the memories of fans and Amorim.",
      "The signings of Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have added quality to their forward ranks, with Amad also providing some sparkling displays and, although they sit seventh in the Premier League, the gap to Manchester City in second is only four points.",
      "When asked about the level at which United will be competing in two years' time, Amad said: \"Honestly, why not winning the league? Dreaming is possible, no?\"",
      "Mbeumo added: \"If you come to Manchester United, you want to win titles and the Premier League is one of them, so why not?\"",
      "Amorim took charge of his 40th Premier League match against Palace and averages 1.18 points per game, which remains significantly lower than previous boss Erik ten Hag's record of 1.72 points per game.",
      "However, results and performances have improved this term with United taking 21 points from 13 games at a rate of 1.61 per game.",
      "Amad believes the team is moving in the right direction under Amorim, having changed their mindset following last season's record-low 15th-placed Premier League finish.",
      "He said: \"From my personal side, I think we are improving a lot, especially as a team, because I can remember last season some of the games weren't easy for us.",
      "\"We were going into games already thinking we lost the game, but this season is different. Different mindset, different energy.",
      "\"We go to the game and we feel we can win this game, so I think we are improving and the staff also are helping us to make that step.",
      "\"We are not really happy where we are in the table we are right now, but we will improve. What I can say, I'm sure we will do much better for the next game.",
      "\"I think we are a different team now. We know this season is different than last season. We play one game a week, so we have to try to do better every game.",
      "\"The mindset is positive in the dressing room. We are a different team. Bruno [Fernandes] is a leader, [Harry] Maguire, everyone, even Bryan.",
      "\"I think the energy is positive. Honestly, it's much, much better than last season. Like I say, we want to do better every game and I promise we will.\"",
      "Mbeumo, a summer signing from Brentford, has adapted quickly to life at United and is the club's top scorer in the Premier League this season with five goals.",
      "Despite making the transition from west London to Manchester look easy, Mbeumo reveals it's been anything but.",
      "He said: \"First of all, it's not been easy at all.",
      "\"I think I just rely on the hard work, on training, even outside of the pitch, what I'm doing on the side to put every chance for me to do well here. The whole team has helped me a lot to grow as a player here, to find my place and find my place with the team.\"",
      "Amad and Mbeumo have forged a strong understanding on United's right, playing as wing-back and winger respectively and combining to good effect in the final third.",
      "Their chemistry was on show when Amad assisted Mbeumo for the opening goal in the 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield. They combined again for the opener in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham.",
      "\"We have a good relationship,\" said Mbeumo.",
      "\"He helped me when I came, obviously we speak the same language, so it was easier for me to go with him. He was telling me a bit how it was working here as well, so I think we built the relationship from the first day.\"",
      "He added: \"We speak the same language, so it's easier to find the links because we can talk about what happened, even during the game it's easier because sometimes he wants the ball somewhere, so I know and for me it's the same.",
      "\"Even after the game we can discuss about some offensive play that could have been better.\"",
      "The pair will hope to continue building their mutual understanding at home to West Ham on Thursday as Manchester United aim to build on their comeback win over Palace.",

      "Wednesday 3 December 2025 19:09, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek...",
      "Arsenal keep rolling in an efficient and relentless manner.",
      "Mikel Arteta's men are now unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions, their longest streak under the Spaniard, and they're doing it with a defensive base that is as sturdy as anything in Europe.",
      "In fact, Arsenal boast the most clean sheets (7) and joint-fewest defeats (1) across all competitions in Europe's major leagues - elite numbers that tell you precisely where their authority lies.",
      "And Brentford are exactly the sort of team Arsenal tend to keep at arm's length.",
      "Arsenal and under 3.5 goals has landed in nine of their last 15 Premier League outings. That's the pattern. Professional wins.",
      "No need for fireworks when discipline and dominance will do, and that bet is on offer at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Ezri Konsa has quietly become one of the Premier League's most adept players at winning fouls. The numbers make the case: Konsa has been fouled at least twice in six of his last 11 starts, and across the season he's averaging 1.6 fouls drawn per game.",
      "Konsa's role under Unai Emery is tailor-made for drawing pressure. He steps into midfield, he drives into space and he becomes the trigger point for opposition presses.",
      "Konsa is on offer at 5/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls - it's a price that hasn't fully caught up with the player's true foul-drawing ability.",
      "Crystal Palace are giving off uneasy vibes - even for a fixture of this winnable magnitude.",
      "On the pitch, they remain a team with so much going for them but the mood music in the background is beginning to change. Oliver Glasner isn't exactly hiding his frustration with the lack of ambition being shown above him, and when a manager starts sounding such soundbites, it rarely stays contained.",
      "You don't need a psychology degree to know how quickly that can seep into a dressing room. Players can sense uncertainty. And suddenly a team that should be bullying lesser opposition becomes tentative and starts to feel that extra workload in their legs the world has been talking about.",
      "A draw looks on the cards, with Burnley on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet looking a bet with potential.",
      "Wolves and their increased threat from set pieces under Rob Edwards remains a betting angle to explore.",
      "Yerson Mosquera has the attributes to be a big threat from such situations - he's tall, athletic and aerially competitive - and those qualities have been spotted by Edwards, based on how prominent Mosquera was in Wolves' set-piece structure in the defeat at Villa.",
      "The defender had two shots there and was denied a goal by a save-of-the-season contender from Emiliano Martinez. If Edwards rinses and repeats those set-piece routines, then Mosquera is great value in the shots market where he's Evens with Sky Bet to have one or more shots.",
      "Football seasons aren't defined by the headline fixtures like beating Liverpool at home and grabbing a point with 10 men against Arsenal. Those moments can create momentum and belief but they don't win titles. What does define a challenger for top honours are the awkward and gritty away days where the favourites must prove their resilience rather than their brilliance. And Chelsea's visit to Elland Road falls into that category. Win here and a title push could be on.",
      "If Chelsea are genuine title contenders then these are the games they must navigate. It's easy to raise your levels for Liverpool and Arsenal, it's far harder to reproduce that clarity when you're getting hunted by a team whose primary motivation is to make your evening a miserable one. This could be a fiddly fixture for Chelsea. The draw looks the bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "If you've been riding the Liverpool goals conceded train in recent weeks, Sunday's 2-0 stroll against a meek and mild West Ham shouldn't spook you off the scent.",
      "One clean sheet against a side seemingly allergic to progressive passes doesn't suddenly fix what has become a very clear trend in that Liverpool are conceding big chances - and plenty of them. Only West Ham, Burnley, Manchester United and Everton are conceding more than Liverpool (23).",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have shipped 16 goals.",
      "The aura of defensive invincibility that Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate once radiated has dimmed.",
      "Sunderland tick the exact boxes Liverpool have struggled with in that they're energetic, press with enthusiasm and attack space quickly when it's there. They don't need to dominate the game to score. All this adds up to both teams to score and over 2.5 goals being a nice slice of value at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen to score at 3/1 with Sky Bet is a generous gift from the traders at Sky Bet. An early Christmas present perhaps.",
      "Bowen is the spark in this West Ham side. He leads the way for shot-creating actions, progressive carries, ball progression and shots on target - Bowen does it all. When West Ham manage to pose a threat, it often goes through him.",
      "Manchester United have kept just two clean sheets in their last 21 games and there remain big structural issues in defence, with no authority in key areas.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
