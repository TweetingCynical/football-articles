      "David Beckham stunned an Argentine football fan by taking an interest in his team and posing for a photo with his obscure top. Beckham, along with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, is probably the most instantly recognisable footballing figure in the world.",
      "The 50-year-old’s accomplishments with Manchester United and England were legendary, and he has kept up his high profile with various business ventures, documentaries and photoshoots. One venture includes founding his own MLS side, Inter Miami, in 2018.",
      "They began competing in 2020 and have since attracted the likes of Messi. Fans from Latin America and beyond frequently flock to Florida to watch the Argentine icon in action for Beckham’s side, having pulled off the miracle signing in July 2023.",
      "One such fan was Imanol Waisgold, who was fortunate to bump into the Inter Miami founder and co-owner during a trip to the USA. Mr Waisgold was carrying a shirt belonging to second-tier Argentine football club Chacarita Juniors.",
      "Much to his astonishment, the former England captain took a genuine interest in both him and the Buenos Aires-based team, before posing for a picture holding the jersey having shut down the club's store for him.",
      "The photo ended up going viral and increasing the popularity of Chacarita. Discussing with Argentine publication Diario Ole how that interaction came to be, the fan highlighted how down-to-earth the Chingford-raised celebrity was.",
      "He labelled Becks a “very cool guy” - high praise when considering he was estimated by the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List to be worth around £500million.",
      "Imanol said: \"It was crazy. He (Beckham) went into the club's official store, they closed everything, and I was left with my girlfriend next to him. I asked him for a photo, he came over, and I showed him the jersey.",
      "\"I was drinking [the Argentinian drink] mate and he said, 'Argentina?', and asked me about the club's crest. I told him what Chacarita was and that it was a second division club. Very cool, really cool guy!”",
      "He added: \"I always take the Chacarita jersey with me everywhere, on any trip I take. I also got [Inter Miami player] Marcelo Weigandt to talk to me, and he also stayed and talked with the best disposition.",
      "\"He reacted normally because he knows the club. I wanted to wait for Leo [Messi] and Rodri [De Paul], but they left in their cars.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Neville has delivered a brutal assessment of Benjamin Sesko - insisting that the striker is 'well off it' despite flashes of promise in Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Slovenia international, who sealed his move to Old Trafford during the summer from RB Leipzig for an initial £66.4million fee, has yet to demonstrate his finest form. United had made signing a striker their top priority, with Sesko being one of three forwards to join the club alongside Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The Red Devils' primary target had been Viktor Gyokeres, who instead opted to join rivals Arsenal, his favoured destination. Sesko, however, was pinpointed as an alternative choice, having been monitored by the club since way back in 2022.",
      "Since the campaign began, Sesko has been handed six starts under Ruben Amorim. At the City Ground, he was given consecutive starts after providing an assist in last weekend's 4-2 triumph over Brighton.",
      "During the first half, the 22-year-old had several opportunities come his way, but then found himself restricted to minimal chances after the break. Neville, however, expressed his frustration with Sesko's display and continues to demand greater output from him.",
      "\"I'm no further forward with him. The jury is out,\" Neville told NBC Sports. \"He's well off it compared to the other summer signings that Man United made up front in Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "\"He looks awkward, he had a couple of really good opportunities in the first half - when balls got played over the top. And his touch wasn't quite right.",
      "\"For £80million, you can say he's young, or has a lot of potential and he's only just settling in, but you still want to see a bit more.\" United were hoping to grab a fourth straight triumph after defeating Sunderland, rivals Liverpool and then Brighton, but were forced to accept a stalemate at the City Ground.",
      "Casemiro put Amorim's team ahead, albeit in controversial fashion, and Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicola Savona netted within two minutes of the restart to flip the match on its head. Amad salvaged a point with less than ten minutes left on the clock.",
      "Following the final whistle, Amorim commended his squad's battling qualities - after they fell behind.",
      "\"I feel in the recent past if we had had this situation, going from 1-0 up to 2-1 down, we would've struggled so much more than we did today,\" the Portuguese head coach said.",
      "\"My feeling is that we played well, but we dropped a little bit of energy. When we are full of energy, we're the better team. My players are giving everything, but we have the potential to do better and sometimes we have these moments.",
      "\"In the end, we lost two points and we need to get three points in the next game.\"",

      "Manchester United's new signing Benjamin Sesko is being cheered on by his girlfriend Anita Vidovic at Old Trafford. The striker was signed this summer for £74million from RB Leipzig.",
      "Ruben Amorim's squad has seen a recent surge in form following a disappointing start to the season, with some of their new summer signings starting to find their footing. In United's most recent clash against Brighton, both Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha found the back of the net.",
      "Sesko also featured in this 4-2 victory, and although he didn't manage to score, he demonstrated his growing rapport with his team-mates by setting up Mbeumo's first goal.",
      "Throughout this time, he's been backed by his partner Anita, who is five years his senior and has a brother who might be familiar to many Brits due to his appearance on a well-known reality TV show.",
      "Anita, 27, hails from Slovenia like Sesko and is said to have graduated from the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Public Administration. Sesko is currently 22 years old.",
      "The pair reportedly started dating in 2022, but they've kept a relatively low profile, only appearing together in a handful of social media posts. Anita is no stranger to the football scene, as her brother Boris played professionally in Germany and Poland before hanging up his boots in 2024.",
      "Boris gained popularity earlier this year when he appeared on series 12 of Love Island UK, entering the villa as a Casa Amor bombshell. Whilst Sesko rarely shares glimpses of his partner on social media, limiting Anita's appearances to the odd Instagram post, the 27-year-old WAG frequently documents her boyfriend's thoughtful gestures on TikTok.",
      "Anita's videos, which typically attract around 20,000 views apiece, highlight Sesko's tender moments for birthdays, anniversaries and other memorable occasions. Her profile features numerous clips of the pair dancing, cuddling affectionately and travelling together, alongside footage of her cheering him on from the stands at Leipzig.",
      "In a recent post from early 2025, Anita shared a montage of romantic moments between them, writing, \"It was always you,\" alongside a white heart emoji. The compilation shows Sesko interacting with a young lion cub, honing his skills at the driving range, watching a basketball match and dancing aboard a boat.",
      "Sesko's opening months at Old Trafford have proved inconsistent, though he has acknowledged there is considerably more to deliver, and he is still adapting to the pace of the Premier League.",
      "\"In the end, this is my job; trying to score as many goals as possible, trying to win the games, trying to help the team in every single situation, and hopefully [there is] more to come,\" he said earlier in October after netting in United's victory against Sunderland.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I'm still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more. I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.",
      "\"I think it's way quicker, you have less time in general, I think this is one of the biggest changes I would say, and obviously also the physicality, everyone is really physical and athletic.",
      "\"I am getting used to it and I will come to the level of this soon. To play for a club like this or even train every single day, it's an obvious pleasure.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "There is only one set of Premier League supporters who should be truly furious about the Boxing Day fixture list - Newcastle United. Getting away from Old Trafford after a night game is mildly hellish at the best of times. Having to do it deep, deep, deep into Boxing Day will be a real pain.",
      "Of course, the Premier League’s Boxing Day fixture list is not actually a list. It is one fixture. Manchester United versus Newcastle United at 8pm. And it seems quite a lot of people are in uproar. They are all going on about something known as ‘tradition’.",
      "Well, it was once a tradition to play games on Christmas Day but we don’t miss that routine since it stopped in the late 1950s. And don’t forget, the owners of Premier League clubs have long since sold tradition to the highest bidders.",
      "Yes, Newcastle fans have a right to be annoyed at the prospect of that seven-hour return journey to Manchester late on Boxing Day but that annoyance should be with the club’s owners. Similarly, the buck stops with them for the demolition of the Premier League’s Boxing Day programme.",
      "Because whichever way you look at the fixture list, it is, essentially, dictated by the demands of television. The brief given to the Premier League by club owners down the years has been simple … get as much money as you can.",
      "And the Premier League executives - led by Richard Masters - have obliged. The latest domestic deal - which runs for four years from the start of this season - is worth £6.7billion. Great.",
      "Which is also a contributory factor, it seems, to there being only one Premier League fixture, a situation that has wound up a lot of people, it seems. I might be in a minority but it seems no big deal.",
      "In fact, on a traditional sporting day, it will be nice for fans to maybe go and watch their local non-league team (there is a full programme). Or go and watch an EFL game (there is a full programme).",
      "Or sit back and watch the highlights from the first day’s play of the fourth Ashes Test (with England already three up). Or have a flutter on one of National Hunt's big races, the King George at Kempton.",
      "Some of us complain about the dominance of the Premier League. So, you can’t get too upset when it leaves the stage clear for others.",
      "You can, though, complain about some of the inconsiderate, often scandalous scheduling of fixtures. Just make sure those complaints are directed at the owners who have sold the Premier League to television.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has fired an early warning ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations, but he isn't the only manager wary of losing players in December. Amorim's concern is maybe more pronounced than that of some rivals, though, with Ivorian international Amad and Cameroon forward Bryan Mbeumo having combined well down the right flank.",
      "\"We will have time to suffer,\" Amorim said when discussing the pair. \"We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity.",
      "\"When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us.",
      "\"They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general.\"",
      "The Africa Cup of Nations begins on December 21, with players linking up with their national sides a little before then. With the final not taking place until January 18, some teams could be without senior stars for a full month, and Amad's goal against Nottingham Forest only reinforced how big a miss he may be.",
      "There are some high-profile absentees from the upcoming AFCON, with Ghana among those missing out. That means the likes of Mohammed Kudus and Antoine Semenyo will stay with their clubs while other African stars head out to Morocco for the tournament.",
      "League leaders Arsenal won't suffer any disruption, but it's a different story for their title rivals. Manchester City will lose Rayan Ait-Nouri to the Algerian national team and Omar Marmoush to Egypt, while Liverpool star Mohamed Salah can also expect to be part of Egypt's squad.",
      "High-flying Bournemouth and Sunderland both have representatives pushing for a place in hosts Morocco's squad, with Amine Adli and Chemsdine Talbi both called up in the October break. Talbi isn't Sunderland's only potential absentee, with Reinildo (Mozambique), Habib Diarra (Senegal), Simon Adingra (Cote d'Ivoire), Bertrand Traore (Burkina Faso) and Arthur Masuaku and Noah Sadiki (both DR Congo) all qualifying and backup keeper Blondy Nna Noukeu an outside bet for the Cameroon squad.,.",
      "Tottenham will keep Kudus in London but potentially lose both Yves Bissouma (Mali) and Pape Matar Sarr (Senegal). United, as mentioned, will be without Amad and Mbeumo, while Noussair Mazraoui could be back in the Morocco picture after injury.",
      "Chelsea have a chance to take advantage in December and January with no first-teamers away at AFCON, while Aston Villa will only lose Ivorian international Evann Guessand. Crystal Palace could have a tougher time of things, though, with Ismaila Sarr (Senegal) and Christantus Uche (Nigeria) both in recent national squads while Cheick Doucoure (Mali) and Chadi Riad (Morocco) could yet represent their countries if they recover from long-term injuries in time.",
      "Brentford are preparing to lose record signing Dango Ouattara (Burkina Faso) and midfielder Frank Onyeka (Nigeria) as well as young goalkeeper Marley Tavaziva (Zimbabwe), and they aren't the only ones at risk of losing a big-money summer addition. Yoane Wissa (DR Congo) has yet to make his Newcastle debut but could be away on international duty before long.",
      "There's some welcome news for Brighton with Yankuba Minteh's Gambia side failing to qualify, though Carlos Baleba is set to link up with his Cameroon team-mates. Everton striker Beto will also stay home after Guinea-Bissau only finished third in their qualifying group, but Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gueye (both Senegal) and summer signing Adam Aznou (Morocco) may well be missing.",
      "Leeds have no one departing for Morocco but it's a different story for fellow new boys Burnley. Former England youth international Axel Tuanzebe now represents DR Congo at international level, while Hannibal is in the picture for Tunisia and Lyle Foster scored goals for South Africa in their qualification campaign.",
      "The final four clubs in the Premier League will be affected to different degrees. Alex Iwobi (Nigeria) could be a big miss for Fulham, with Calvin Bassey and Samuel Chukwueze also part of the last Super Eagles squad, though Nottingham Forest's former Fulham man Ola Aina could end up missing the tournament through injury and Taiwo Awoniyi is not an automatic pick for manager Eric Chelle.",
      "Forest are still expected to lose Willy Boly and Ibrahim Sangare (both Cote d'Ivoire), while West Ham are preparing to be without full-backs Aaron Wan-Bissaka (DR Congo) and El-Hadji Malick Diouf (Senegal). Finally, Wolves could find themselves without several players including Marshall Munetsi and Tawanda Chirewa (both Zimbabwe), Emmanuel Agbadou (Cote d'Ivoire), Tolu Arokodare (Nigeria) and Jackson Tchatchoua (Cameroon).",

      "Manchester United have been linked with several players ahead of the January transfer window. The Red Devils may be primarily focused on their Premier League campaign but the club will already be making recruitment plans behind the scenes.",
      "United’s summer signings have made an early impact, with Senne Lammens becoming the club’s first-choice goalkeeper while forwards Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have provided the team with more attacking options. Manager Ruben Amorim will hope United can make more positive signings when the transfer window reopens in January.",
      "Ruben Amorim is already prepared for some of his United players to ask to leave the club in January. While the Red Devils have found a somewhat settled side, others are struggling for regular starts, such as Kobbie Mainoo, who handed in a loan request during the summer.",
      "\"A lot of things can happen,” Amorim said in a recent press conference. \"Even in our club, and you know that we have the World Cup, some players are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything.\"",
      "However, the United boss is not solely focused on the club’s potential outgoings. Amorim has insisted the club will look to sign players who could have a long-lasting impact on his side.",
      "\"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United,\" he continued. \"We are not just buying one guy because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now.",
      "\"We want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea. I don't know what is going to happen. But of course, we think about how we can improve the team, and in January, the window is open, we can do something.\"",
      "Former United winger Nani believes the club should reignite their interest in Joao Palhinha, who favoured a move to Bayern Munich over Old Trafford last year. The Portuguese midfielder has since been loaned out to Tottenham Hotspur, where he has been a regular starter, with Spurs having the option to sign him permanently for £27million in the summer.",
      "Nani is a former team-mate of Palhinha’s from their time at Sporting CP and believes he could be a success at United. \"He's a player with energy, with power to recover balls and to fight - and that is something that fits into Man Utd's DNA,” Nani told Covers.com.",
      "“Having players who are able first to fight on the field, like to recover the ball and challenge opponents to help the team win games. You can't give your opponents any time in the Premier League and he has the energy and physical abilities to be such an asset for anyone.\"",
      "Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo has admitted to being aware of the speculation around his future. He was a reported target for United and Liverpool during the summer, with Semenyo claimed to have met with Amorim before signing a new Bournemouth contract.",
      "The Cherries are said to value Semenyo at around £75million, but the transfer noise has not impacted Semenyo’s early performances this term. Despite seeing many of his team-mates seal high-profile transfers, the 25-year-old has explained his decision to stay with Bournemouth.",
      "\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens.",
      "\"When they (his former team-mates) all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club. But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year.”",

      "The report claims that Rashford could be offered a longer contract, until 2030, providing he reduces his salary. The United academy product has already taken a pay-cut to join Barcelona this season and may have to be willing to do so next summer, even with increased competition for his signature, should his form continue.",

      "Napoli are willing to cover all of Kobbie Mainoo's wages in the hope of signing him in the January transfer window. The Italian champions are desperate to lure the Manchester United outcast to Naples as soon as possible.",
      "Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has told United he is prepared to honour Mainoo's £35,000-a-week contract. De Laurentiis has spoken to Napoli stars Kevin De Bruyne and Scott McTominay about Mainoo - and the duo have told him the England midfielder would be a great signing for Antonio Conte's side.",
      "Napoli tried to sign Mainoo in the summer, but he decided to remain at United when Ruben Amorim told him he wanted to keep him. But Mainoo has remained on the fringes of Amorim's team and has made just eight appearances in all competitions this season.",
      "It's understood Napoli want to take Mainoo on an initial loan, with a view to making the deal permanent in the summer. Mainoo knows he will have to leave Old Trafford to secure regular starts, if he wants to stand a realistic chance of being included in England's squad for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Napoli have enjoyed success by signing unwanted United players, with McTominay being named the Serie A Player of the Season in their title-winning campaign. Rasmus Hojlund has also made a strong start since joining on loan in the summer, scoring four goals in seven games so far.",
      "Mainoo fits into the same category as a frustrated player who is seeking regular game time. Coming into this weekend, the 20-year-old United academy graduate had started just one game for United this season, and that came in their disastrous defeat by Grimsby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "He has been stuck as a substitute in the Premier League, with Amorim picking Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in central midfield. Mainoo's exit was blocked on deadline day, with Amorim explaining in September what he expects from the youngster.",
      "\"I didn't have a conversation with him before the window closed because I didn't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having a conversation with him just to hold on to him,\" he said. \"I did it this week.",
      "\"I believe in him a lot. He is a top player. But some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done [a complete player]. I think he can do so much better. For some guys [talent] is enough, but for him it is not. Maybe it's not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie and that's it.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag was left stunned by his sacking at Manchester United, who'd already agreed terms with Ruben Amorim in secret. United decided to part ways with the Dutchman in the days leading up to his final match, a controversial 2-0 defeat away to West Ham.",
      "Ten Hag, 55, had spent nearly two-and-a-half years in the Old Trafford hot seat, winning a trophy in both of his full seasons. But a lowly eighth-placed finish in the Premier League and poor recruitment ultimately cost the former Ajax boss his job.",
      "Amorim, who was hot property thanks to his success at Sporting Lisbon, was the man chosen to replace him and has now been in charge for just under a year. As we approach the anniversary of his official appointment, the story of how he agreed to become United's manager has surfaced - and it's brutal for Ten Hag.",
      "In the summer of 2024, Old Trafford chiefs privately spoke to different coaches about replacing him. After holding talks with Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi, United's new-look hierarchy - headed up by Sir Jim Ratcliffe - opted to keep Ten Hag, triggering a one-year extension in his contract as a show of commitment.",
      "But a poor start to his third season at the helm prompted Ratcliffe and Co to rethink. After going back to the drawing board, Amorim emerged as their top target and a meeting in Spain was set.",
      "The Athletic report that by October 25, 2024, the Portuguese had agreed personal terms and said 'yes' in calls with Red Devils CEO Omar Berrada and soon-to-be director of football Jason Wilcox. That was all while United's players, Ten Hag and staff were travelling to London preparing to face West Ham.",
      "Ten Hag's side were fresh off a 1-1 draw with Fenerbahce in Turkey, having beaten Brentford 2-1 at home the weekend prior. But United's bigwigs had already made their minds up.",
      "Will Ruben Amorim have a more successful reign than Erik ten Hag? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "So when the Red Devils conceded a late penalty at the London Stadium, the axe was being sharped. On the Monday, October 28, Ten Hag was summoned to Carrington and informed of his sacking by Berrarda.",
      "His reaction was one of shock. Ten Hag believed that he'd be given more time under the club's new leadership after proving that he could deliver silverware.",
      "After deciding to wait until the beginning of the 2025-26 season to return to management, Ten Hag was appointed by Bayer Leverkusen, replacing the highly successful Xabi Alonso. His reign lasted just three games.",

Moments earlier, Nicola Savona appeared to deflect a dangerous cross and keep the ball in play, yet the assistant referee, positioned on the opposite side of the pitch, signalled for a corner.",

      "Manchester United's winning streak was halted by Nottingham Forest on Saturday afternoon. After a challenging year at the helm of the Red Devils, Ruben Amorim's squad entered the match on the back of three consecutive Premier League wins.",
      "The Portuguese mastermind's side took the lead through Casemiro and held the advantage going into half time. However, Sean Dyche's team flipped the script as Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona found the net within the first five minutes of the second half.",
      "The Reds were teetering on the edge of defeat until Amad Diallo stepped up to score a breathtaking equaliser with just nine minutes remaining, securing a 2-2 draw for the Reds. Here's how the United players fared at the City Ground...",
      "Despite pulling off several key saves, he couldn't prevent Forest's two goals, especially the second one. Rating: 6/10.",
      "Most of Forest's attacking play avoided Yoro, which could be seen as a testament to the Frenchman's defensive skills. Rating: 7/10.",
      "He made an excellent recovery to deny Nicolo Savona in the first half, but should have done better with Forest's second goal. Rating: 6/10.",
      "If he continues this form, he'll surely earn a recall to the England squad. It was unfortunate he was part of a defence which conceded twice. Rating: 6/10.",
      "He had a couple of cracking chances when he darted in from the right wing. Despite failing to win the header against Gibbs-White, he netted a stunning equaliser to make it 2-2. Rating: 7/10.",
      "The Brazilian ace got United off to a dream start with a superb header. He seemed to flag as the match progressed, but managed to clock up his first full 90 minutes in the Premier League this season. Rating: 6/10.",
      "The Portuguese maestro was somewhat quiet in the first half until he whipped in a gorgeous cross for Casemiro's goal. He rattled the woodwork in the second half, but Casemiro couldn't pounce on the rebound. Rating: 6/10.",
      "Dalot always raises eyebrows when deployed on the left flank and he was caught out at various points during the game. Amorim expected more from him, but he failed to deliver. Rating: 3/10.",

      "A quickfire double at the start of the second half saw Nottingham Forest come close to stunning Manchester United at the City Ground, only for Amad to volley home a stunning equaliser. United could have gone second in the Premier League with a win, but the point will still be a welcome sight for Ruben Amorim after his team trailed going into the final 10 minutes.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona netted within the space of three minutes to turn the game on its head after Casemiro had given United a half-time lead. However, Amad lashed the ball beyond Matz Sels from the edge of the box and the goal was allowed to stand after a VAR check.",
      "Casemiro had earlier been given the freedom of the City Ground to send a free header into the bottom corner from a Bruno Fernandes set piece. However, the start of the second half provided a reminder that things aren't quite as desperate as they seem for Forest or as positive as they once seemed for their opponents.",
      "Bruno Fernandes fired against the foot of the post as United looked to bring themselves level, but Forest kept creating themselves. Igor Jesus was inches away from making it 3-1 with 25 minutes remaining and that might have been too much for the visitors to come back from.",
      "Ruben Amorim's team went into the game chasing a fourth straight victory and started on the front foot. Benjamin Sesko has yet to hit top gear following his summer move but got an early sight of goal - with his effort deflected off-target - and showed some decent hold-up play in the early knockings.",
      "Forest began to grow into the game, with Callum Hudson-Odoi offering a threat from out on the left and Elliot Anderson battling hard in the middle. They also squandered a promising opening when Nicolo Savona broke free down the right but got his final ball wrong, while United themselves continued to impress in flashes and Amad's deflected effort forced Matz Sels into a sharp stop.",
      "After snatching a lead and going in ahead at the break, United, might have expected their struggling opponents to crumble. The opposite was true, though, with Forest showing the kind of fight they will need to survive.",
      "Last weekend, Forest conceded against Bournemouth from a corner they don't believe should have been given. History repeated itself this week, though things weren't quite as cut and dried.",
      "There was no doubt that a Bournemouth boot touched the ball last before Marcus Tavernier's Olimpico last time out. Here, the question concerned whether Savona was able to keep the ball from going behind, and plenty of outside observers agreed with Savona that play should have continued.",
      "One thing that is for sure is that Forest should have got closer to Casemiro from the corner, just as they should have kept out Tavernier's effort at the Vitality Stadium. Set piece frailty is hardly the earmark of a Sean Dyche side, and he'll have reason to be annoyed.",
      "Amad is unlikely to score many better goals than the one on Saturday. The Ivorian's connection was as sweet as they come, with Sels powerless as the ball nestled in the back of his net.",
      "Forest's complaint will be about what came before.. The ball appeared to strike Patrick Dorgu on the arm as it spun up a few seconds before Amad struck, but neither the on-field referee nor the video assistant felt it was anough to disallow the goal.",
      "That's two United goals which brought Forest complaints and they'll have to show spirit to put it all behind them. Amad won't mind, though, and it could be a vital moment for the Ivorian and his team.",
      "If Savona was allowing himself to stew on that corner drama in the first half, he was soon over it. The Italian isn't known for his goals - he had just two in Serie A for Juventus last term - but sometimes quick reactions are all you need.",
      "During Ange Postecoglou's brief tenure, Forest's players often looked lost and unable to form a united front. The period featured players looking unsure of their exact role, and the Italian was one of them.",
      "New boss Dyche has long been a man who builds from the back, whether that's in the middle or in the full-back positions. Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic might look like the most obvious beneficiaries, but they're not the only ones.",
      "It has taken a year, but Ruben Amorim at last named an unchanged Manchester United XI in the Premier League. He might feel he doesn't quite have the squad he needs to put his system into effect, but he at least has 11 players he is willing to trust to do it in back-to-back games..",
      "That meant another start for Casemiro and a goal for the Brazilian. He might not be at his Real Madrid levels, or even the level he was in his first United season, but Amorim has found a way to use him.",
      "“I think he gives a lot of experience. He's an example for everyone,\" Amorim recently said of Casemiro. “In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer], but he fought and he worked, and now he's back in the national team. He's so important for us.”",
      "There was a moment in the first half when Senne Lammens was given the closest thing a goalkeeper can get to a hospital pass. The ball was pinged in his direction at pace by a United defender, but he calmly controlled the ball and continued as if it was no big deal.",
      "He remained a composed figure for the remainder of the first half, and didn't give the impression he could have done much with Forest's goals. One thing's for certain, though, and that's that he appeared unruffled throughout.",
      "United were reluctant to throw the Belgian in from the start after his arrival from Royal Antwerp, with suggestions they were worried about over-exposing him to the pressure of the role. On current evidence, though, he's exactly the right fit.",
      "It feels like every week or two we're handed a definitive assessment of where Manchester United sit on the 'it's so over' to 'we're so back' scale. Sometimes we even get variations within the space of a single game, and it felt like today was one of those days.",
      "As always, it can help to develop some perspective. The season doesn't end in November, and there's a long way to go from here for both United and Forest.",
      "The challenge for managers is to block out the noise and get the message across to their players that things don't move as dramatically from one week to the next as some might have you believe. That is easier said than done, but any boss able to do just that is on to a winner.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "“I know [the fans might care] but it’s not my way of seeing things, I just want to win every game and to finish top of the league. I want to be in the position to be champions of the Premier League, so I don’t care about the moment in the table.",
      "“I remember people said I was naive to talk about winning the Premier League. The goal of this board, of the owners, the staff, is winning the Premier League, that doesn’t change. I don’t know how long it’s going to take.",
      "“So we never change our narrative. We never change because we are winning now, we are going to change what we want to do. And when we were losing we said all of the same things. We want to win the Premier League, that is our goal. Let’s see how long it is going to take.”",
      "Asked to reflect on a year in charge in his pre-match press conference, Amorim said: “It was a journey. A big journey. It was tough. It was really tough, good moments, bad moments. I learned a lot, that is really important.",
      "“I found out that even in my lower moments, I can stick with the things I believe and that is a good thing for anyone, to understand that. Today, the answer is different from three weeks ago. So, it’s important to understand that. It’s one of the biggest honours of my life to be here and I want to continue here for many years.”",

      "Ex-Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has lauded the impact of £62.5m summer signing Matheus Cunha, but also challenged him to maintain his form. Cunha, who was signed from Wolves during the summer transfer window, has been a key addition to Ruben Amorim's squad, scoring once since his move and becoming a regular starter under Amorim.",
      "The Brazilian netted his first goal for United during their 4-2 victory over Brighton last weekend. Despite not yet registering an assist, he has received high praise for his start at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen, who served as Sir Alex Ferguson's assistant manager during several Premier League title-winning campaigns, has been impressed with Cunha - but believes the next challenge for the player is to reach the same levels as those big names who shone under Ferguson.",
      "\"I was very positive about United signing Matheus Cunha. He's a great player,\" Meulensteen said in an interview with Compare.bet.",
      "\"I think he also has all the mental attributes to play for a club like Manchester United. He's got that aura.",
      "\"He wants the ball. You can give him the ball and it's hard to get it off him.",
      "\"He has raised the ceiling of this United squad and that will rub off on other players because when they see that Cunha, he's a player, and [Bryan] Mbeumo is a player, too, it lifts everyone to push their own games.",
      "\"I still find it a shame seeing Cunha and Mbeumo together, with Bruno Fernandes having to play that deeper role, because if you could have Bruno in a more advanced position where he can really roam around as we are used to, there are even more goals there playing with Cunha, Mbeumo and [Benjamin] Sesko - without a shadow of doubt.",
      "\"The challenge now for Cunha is making sure that he shows that consistency that Manchester United need now, week-in and week-out.",
      "\"That's what made United great under Sir Alex Ferguson. We had a good squad, we had good players, we had balance in the squad, it was the performance.",
      "\"They were so consistent, no matter who we played in the Premier League, in the FA Cup or any other cups or Champions League, the players performed. That is what United need to get back to - starting with Nottingham Forest and Spurs.\"",
      "Cunha's next chance to impress for United will be during their Premier League clash against Nottingham Forest on Saturday afternoon. United go into the game against Forest on the back of three consecutive wins in the top flight which has seen them climb up to sixth place in the overall standings.",

      "Manchester United legend Nani has revealed his delight at watching Marcus Rashford flourish - even though it's happening away from Old Trafford at Barcelona.",
      "After a troubled period under Ruben Amorim before departing the Red Devils, Rashford has been brilliant on loan at the Catalan giants - enjoying a complete change of scenery. The 28-year-old has netted five goals and provided seven assists across 13 outings in all competitions so far.",
      "While making an instant impact, Rashford has, previously, suffered poor patches of form and became embroiled in disciplinary woes at United even before Amorim's arrival at the club. The manager ultimately decided he needed to move him on this summer.",
      "Meanwhile, the Red Devils have endured another testing start to this season, despite their recent upturn in form. Nani's joy at witnessing Rashford's revival since departing United might well surprise some, though.",
      "Obviously, United would have much rather witnessed him recapture his finest form at M16 instead of excelling at a European competitor. Nevertheless, Nani confessed he's happy to witness the England player returning to his peak.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford entertained Man Utd fans for many years and he's a great player - scoring beautiful goals at Old Trafford,\" he told Covers.com. \"I don't know what happened with him at the club and, unfortunately, he's no longer part of the team.",
      "\"However, we're always happy for those who start at our club, to see them shining all over the world, especially if he's playing for Barcelona. It's a big club with a lot of talent and, if he stands up there, shows his quality and scores goals, we'll always be happy.\"",
      "However, Amorim will also be aware that it's in United's best interests for Rashford to maintain his best form and deliver top-notch performances in La Liga. Barcelona are tipped to make his move permanent - if he maintains his impressive form this season.",
      "Rashford has a £30m buy option in his contract. Barcelona, though, might aim to negotiate a slightly lower price.",

      "The pressure was on Amorim ahead of a home meeting with Sunderland in October. They won that game, and followed it up with victories over Liverpool and Brighton as the new-look front three of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko started to click.",
      "Next up for United is a trip to the City Ground and now it's his opposite number Sean Dyche who is up against it. \"It was a poor result for Sean Dyche against Bournemouth, especially after doing so well in Europe. It will be a rocking atmosphere at Forest, as always when Man United come to town,\" Shearer told Betfair.",
      "\"United are looking for results to keep the good run going and they’ve had a week off due to being knocked out of the Carabao Cup. I think Forest will get something out of the game, but I'm not sure they'll win, so I'm going to say a draw.",
      "\"I think it’s too early to say they’re the real deal and that United can finish in the top four or five. If they can continue this in a month's time, I might change my mind, but let’s see what the next couple of weeks bring, and then we can judge whether they’re certainly improving.\"",
      "Shearer's comments come as Forest star Morgan Gibbs-White made the unusual move of publicly showing his delight in United's persistence and turnaround. \"It’s been incredible to see, obviously they’ve been going through a tough time in the past couple of years,\" the England international told Stan Sport (via Goal).",
      "\"But they’ve stuck with the gaffer [Amorim] and the past four or five games, you’re really starting to see how Man United should be playing, that grit and that determination to want to play for the badge. I feel like it’s been incredible to see, it’s something I feel like the league has missed.\"",
      "“They are beginning to turn things around, it seems, but we have to safeguard against that,\" Dyche said of United. \"There are subtle changes in the way they’re playing, and they have delivered performances that can win. We’ve got to be aware of that, but equally – if you look at our performance against Porto – that was a performance that we think would win against a lot of teams.",
      "“We need to find our own freedom to it, especially here at the City Ground, where they’re always in good voice, but against the bigger names, on paper. We think we can get that energy between us and that front-foot thinking from the stands, which the players will buzz off.”",

The Manchester United icon revealed he stepped away from live TV work this season to focus on caring for and spending more time with his 20-year-old autistic son.",
      "\"I made a decision this year because of Aiden, obviously due to his special needs you might know about,\" Scholes told the Stick to Football podcast.",

      "Scholes revealed he and wife Claire have split up, but they continue to devote themselves to their three children. Discussing Aiden's routine, he added: \"I pick him up every Tuesday from his daycare and we go swimming. Loves swimming then we get his pizza on the way home. Thursday pick him up, go for something to eat, go home. Sunday, I pick him up from Claire's house and we go to Tesco where he buys a trolley full of chocolate.",
      "\"So, he doesn't know what day or time it is, but he knows from what we're doing what day it is. He'll be 21 in December.\"",
      "Alicia has subsequently taken to Instagram to praise her dad's courage in speaking about her brother. She wrote: \"I’ve never known anyone hate talking about themselves more than you! I can only imagine how hard it was to speak about Aidie and the reality of a very very hard situation.",
      "\"My whole life your priority has always been being my dad, and growing up and realising how hard you had to work everyday alongside that is something I can’t even comprehend.",

If anyone met you they wouldn’t have a clue the life you’ve lived, they’d just see a genuinely kind, polite, caring person",

      "In addition to Alicia and Aiden, Scholes has another son named Arron.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim wasn't the only contender to replace Erik ten Hag in 2024. United also explored moves for Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi several months before landing the Portuguese, it has been claimed.",
      "Ten Hag's position was under threat towards the end of the 2023/24 season, with the Premier League side considering their options after some concerning results and performances. After winning the FA Cup final, though, the Dutchman was given a stay of execution.",
      "By the time Ten Hag eventually lost his job in October last year, De Zerbi and Tuchel had already found employment elsewhere. Former Brighton boss De Zerbi took over at Marseille shortly after leaving the Amex Stadium while Tuchel agreed terms with England in the autumn and ultimately took charge in January 2025.",
      "According to The Athletic, United were still considering Tuchel a fortnight after their cup final win. The German met with United chiefs in Monaco but didn't reach an agreement and indeed is said to have not been prepared to return to football so soon after leaving Bayern Munich.",
      "De Zerbi's talks, meanwhile, were reportedly halted after the Italian rejected an initial offer from United. An improved offer didn't arrive, and the 46-year-old is now in charge at Marseille.",
      "Ultimately, Ten Hag was backed in the transfer market to the tune of around £200million as United looked to turn things around under the ex-Ajax boss. He only lasted a few months, picking up 11 points from nine league games to leave United 14th in the table.",
      "Results picked up under caretaker boss Ruud van Nistelrooy but Amorim was unable to inspire a full recovery in the league. He led the team to a Europa League final - and within 90 minutes of a trophy and a Champions League spot - but an eight-game winless run in April and May brought a 15th-place finish.",
      "United made a slow start in Amorim's first full season but things have gradually picked up. Three wins on the spin have seen the Red Devils climb a congested table to sit in sixth place ahead of Saturday's meeting with Nottingham Forest.",
      "“During my career as a manager, most of the time I was winning,” Amorim told MUTV as he brought up a year in charge. “When you are winning, you can say that you have convictions and you are loyal to your ideas, but you learn when you lose, when you are under pressure and I learned that when I’m under pressure, I’m stronger on my ideas and I keep with my ideas.",
      "“Of course, it’s really important to feel the support of everyone in the club, especially the fans that help you, to give you that confidence to continue on your path, but that was the biggest learning point: when I’m under pressure, I can stick with my plan.”",

      "Ruben Amorim has already admitted that Manchester United will struggle when Amad goes to the Africa Cup of Nations. United wouldn't have salvaged a point against Nottingham Forest without the Ivory Coast international.",
      "Amad's stunning volley from the edge of the box will be prominent in this season's highlights reel. The 23-year-old looked disappointed when the full-time whistle went, despite scoring a stunner. The away end chanted \"we love United, we do\" after a spirited fight to avoid defeat.",
      "Amorim named an unchanged team for the first time in the Premier League. Amorim has previously chopped and changed, but rewarded the players who delivered against Brighton.",
      "United had lost their last two away league games against Nottingham Forest. Anthony Elanga scored in a 1-0 Forest win in April when Amorim desperately resorted to throwing Harry Maguire up front.",
      "United have been the leading goalscorers in the Premier League since the victory against Burnley at the end of September so Maguire was not required as an auxiliary forward again.",
      "Forest sacked Nuno Espirito Santo just three games into the campaign. Ange Postecoglou was appointed as his successor and lasted just 39 days in charge after failing to win any of his eight games.",
      "Sean Dyche has a reputation for rescuing sinking ships. Dyche appears to be a sensible appointment and he urged their fans to create an intimidating atmosphere against United in his programme notes.",
      "There was a rousing rendition of 'Mull of Kintyre' as the players prepared for kick-off. United fans unfurled a Brazil flag in the away section following Matheus Cunha's first goal for the club.",
      "Diogo Dalot received an earful from Amorim throughout the opening exchanges. The United boss wanted him to burst forward quicker when he received the ball and constantly encouraged him down the left.",
      "Amorim praised Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson before the game and the midfielder whipped up the home crowd after a shot from Callum Hudson-Odoi was almost sent into the River Trent.",
      "Anderson has been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but he is exactly what his shirt number suggests: a No.8. United do not need a player of that profile and should focus on other targets next summer.",
      "United created chances in the first half and Benjamin Sesko looked lively, although he scuffed a shot in the box and dragged an effort wide of the post after skilfully fashioning a yard of space for himself.",
      "Amad should have done better when he guided a shot at Matz Sels. Amorim couldn't stand still on the touchline, clearly wanting more cutting edge from his players after a mixed start.",
      "United were ahead shortly after following a stroke of good fortune, scoring from a corner when the ball didn't look to have gone out of play for the set piece to be awarded.",
      "Fernandes was responsible for the delivery and briefly congratulated Casemiro before being summoned to the touchline to receive tactical instructions from Amorim.",
      "There were loud boos for referee Darren England when he returned to the dressing room for the interval, the Forest fans feeling aggrieved about the decision to award a corner.",
      "The chatter among the home supporters on the concourse on the way to the press room was about the dubious decision. The chatter in the away section was probably about how important Casemiro is again.",
      "The 33-year-old has enjoyed an unlikely resurgence this year and he was serenaded after opening the scoring. \"Du, du, du, du, Casemiro,\" sang the 3,000 Mancunians housed in the Bridgford Stand.",
      "The Forest fans who were complaining were on their feet twice just six minutes into the second half. The disadvantages of playing Amad at right wing-back were highlighted when Morgan Gibbs-White won their aerial mismatch to score a header. Then Forest scored again through Nicola Savona.",
      "United were punished by another ball into the box. Dyche was beaming from the dug-out. He enjoyed success at Burnley and Everton by setting up his teams to score similar aerial goals.",
      "\"Lino, what's the score?,\" chirped the Brian Clough Stand. Forest had last clinched a league win against Brentford in August and their fans sensed the first big result of Dyche's tenure.",
      "The draw is a reminder that there is more work for Amorim to do. The 40-year-old enjoyed an October to remember, but he must secure successive wins again during the winter.",
      "Amorim will be pleased with the spirit shown after falling behind, particularly from Amad after losing the battle with Gibbs-White for his goal. Amad is the kind of character that Amorim wants in the dressing room.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United would have lost against Nottingham Forest if the game had been played last season.",
      "United opened the scoring at the City Ground thanks to a header from Casemiro, but the match was turned on its head almost immediately after play resumed for the second half.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White levelled the scores in the 48th minute and Nicolo Savona made it 2-1 just two minutes later.",
      "Forest fans sensed their first win in the league since August, but Amad popped up with nine minutes remaining to score a stunning goal which ensured the points were shared.",
      "Amorim was asked whether United would have lost the fixture last season and responded: \"Yeah.\"",
      "He paused before adding: \"By more goals [they would have lost]. That is my feeling.\"",
      "When asked why, Amorim said: \"It's the confidence, of course, it's completely different. We came from three good games and we have a different confidence. We understand each other better.",
      "\"We talk more about this, that football is like this, and we proved it this year. We can have bad moments, but suddenly we have three good games. So football is like that. And the game is like that also.",
      "\"We had good moments, we score, you can sense we are in control of the game when the first half finished. We started the second half, we suffer, disconnect for five minutes and that's enough in the Premier League, but we managed to recover from that, which is a good feeling.\"",
      "Discussing his thoughts on the game in further detail, Amorim said: \"We lost control of the game for five minutes and paid the price. We did some things well. Our level of energy dropped a little bit.",
      "\"And when our energy drops a little bit, you can feel it. We can play well, but it's not full power. But my feeling is that the players tried, really tried. They tried during the week and tried again today.",
      "\"In the past, if we had this kind of bad five minutes and we suffer two goals, we didn't recover. Today is a different feeling and you can sense we could win this game, but we weren't going to lose, and that's sometimes the feeling a big team sometimes has.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to win in the end, but we drew. We dropped two points. I think last year we suffered a lot. We want to win games and overcome these moments, but now they know how to do it.",
      "\"We just need to be inside of the game until the final 10 minutes of the game. That is part of football. In the past, we could have lost everything in the positions and the way we play the game.",
      "\"I think we are improving in that aspect. Again, we did some things right, but we also have potential to play so much better, which is the goal.\"",

      "There have been multiple occasions where many thought Amorim’s future was hanging by a thread, including earlier this season after the Carabao Cup humiliation against Grimsby. Despite the scrutiny Amorim has often faced, the United board have continued to back the 40-year-old coach.",
      "One of the reasons Amorim has retained the support of the United hierarchy may be the manager’s unwavering confidence in his ideas, as well as his ruthlessness when dealing with the squad. The Daily Mail reports that some players in the United dressing room have found Amorim to be “aloof and arrogant at times.”",
      "This approach may have aided Amorim when it came to shaping his team. In January, when asked about Marcus Rashford being continually left out, Amorim argued that he would rather pick goalkeeper coach Jorge Vital over a player who did not give his all in training. Rashford was later loaned out to Aston Villa and is spending this season at Barcelona.",
      "The United boss’ confidence also extends to his tactics. He insisted earlier this season that “not even the Pope” could get him to switch from his 3-4-2-1 formation. However, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe appears to appreciate Amorim’s honest approach.",
      "\"I really, really like Ruben,” Ratcliffe told The Times in March. “He's a very thoughtful guy. Every time I go to the training ground, I speak to Ruben.",
      "“I sit down and have a cup of coffee with him and tell him where it's going wrong, and he tells me to f*** off! I like him.\"",
      "The report added that Amorim and Ratcliffe speak weekly over the phone and exchange messages in WhatsApp groups. For his part, Amorim is grateful for the rapport he has established with Ratcliffe during his tenure.",
      "\"I think we have a really good connection,” he said. “We are both a little bit blunt and honest in conversations. He really likes the club, he's like a fan.\"",
      "The United boss added: “It's a good thing because publicly, it's a different thing. It shows a lot of confidence from the owner. I felt it since day one. Since day one, I felt that the people really like my work.",
      "“My work is the result, so also sometimes it's harder for me - my relationship with them - than theirs with me. We're really honest with each other. I'm a little bit the same.",
      "“I came from a normal family and now I'm here in Manchester and I'm still the same person. I feel that he is the same [type of] person, so we can talk like that.”",
      "While Amorim may tread a fine line with his X-rated replies to Ratcliffe and ruthless approach to recruitment, it has helped the Portuguese coach survive a tough first year at Old Trafford. After overcoming many challenges, United could be in a much better position under Amorim this time next year.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Brian McClair went virtually undetectable during a legends' charity match thanks to the stark difference in his appearance.",
      "The Manchester United icon, 61, was in the dugout for Celtic in their clash against the Red Devils in September, with former players taking to the field in their bid to raise money for a good cause.",
      "McClair, who now sports long white hair with a bushy beard, admitted that fellow ex-United stars including Dimitar Berbatov and Louis Saha failed to recognise him when heading into the Celtic dressing room.",
      "The former Scotland international said: \"I was going between each dressing room and just listening to people chatting. It was nice to see ex-United kit man Albert Morgan, who was telling me what was happening with them. It was good to see people I shared rooms with as well.",
      "\"I had all the Celtic kit on and saw Louis Saha. He just looked up and said, ‘F****** hell, I didn’t recognise you.’ I said that was me tidied up and making an effort.\" McClair, who hosts his Life with Brian podcast, added: \"Then I was outside and Berbatov was there and I said, ‘Hello, you all right?’",
      "\"He just looked at me kind of strangely but then I went back in again and he came over. He said, ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t recognise you, I thought it might have been you but thought no, no, it couldn’t possibly be you.’ It was nice to be recognised anyway even under this cunning disguise.\"",
      "It isn't the first time the former striker has gone viral due to his current look as back in 2023, he made the rounds on social media after being photographed with a fan at a Manchester pub.",
      "Discussing his drastic transformation from the short hair and clean-shaven look he displayed during his playing days, McClair previously told The Telegraph: \"It started in lockdown. I just thought: let things grow, see where we end up. Then before Christmas I decided to have a tidy up, but I never got round to it.",
      "\"I was out one night and next thing I see I’m trending on social media as ‘old man down the pub’. I’ve had the trim since. You’ll be disappointed to hear I look a wee bit less as though I’ve been cast away on a desert island.\"",
      "The attention the four-time Premier League winner received upon fans' realisation of his new-look appearance was \"bizarre,\" he admitted. He added: \"I think I’m normal, others think I’m weird. I tend to notice bizarre things, bizarre things come out of my head.\"",
      "The charity match saw McClair manage ex-Celts such as Joe Hart, Artur Boruc and Georgios Samaras, while United boss Bryan Robson featured the likes of Michael Carrick, Nicky Butt and Wes Brown.",
      "It was the Scottish side that ended up victorious via a penalty shootout after the game ended 2-2 in normal time. The triumph was the second time in a row that the Celtics legends beat their English counterparts.",

      "Ruben Amorim made no attacking substitutions against Nottingham Forest because he believed Manchester United had the right players on the pitch to come back in the game.",
      "United were leading 1-0 at half-time, but Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona both scored in the space of a few minutes at the start of the second half to turn the game on its head.",
      "Amorim eventually reacted by introducing Patrick Dorgu for Diogo Dalot in the 68th minute. Noussair Mazraoui was the next player to come on from the bench to replace Leny Yoro.",
      "The United boss refused to freshen his attack in pursuit of a way back into the contest, but Amad scored a stunning volley with nine minutes remaining to salvage a point.",
      "Speaking during his press conference, Amorim explained the changes, saying: \"Sometimes it's not if you put on more strikers, I don't feel we are going to play better. If you see Dalot, many times he has the ball with the space to make the cross, but he is a right foot and is always inside with that space.",
      "\"The only thing is Patrick [Dorgu] we are going to do the same thing. When you have the ball, go to the side, cross because the space is there. If you want to come inside, Cunha is always there to receive the ball.",
      "\"Nous [Mazraoui], if you see the end of the second half, Leny [Yoro] was always the guy with space to run with the ball, and Nous is a full-back, so we try to use the characteristics of the players.",
      "\"And then it's not the quality because we have a lot of quality on the bench, but sometimes I have the feeling if I stop the game all the time I'm going to break something.\"",
      "He continued: \"I think we were improving during the second half, so my feeling was I didn't change anything with the guys in front because we have the talent there. And I know Amad can do so much better.",
      "\"I know Amad is really dangerous one-against-one. So sometimes we expect a guy who is not having a great game can change the game for us. He managed to score. But we have the potential to do so much better and lost two points today.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee were left on the bench again. Amorim said: \"I could do the same thing with Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount... Mount was there also. Mainoo and Josh. Then you have to imagine the game. Josh is a little bit like Cunha playing between the lines.",
      "\"And if you see the game, we had a guy that needs to be inside the box and Ben is the best one to do that. It's just a moment, we try to do our best and it's nothing to do with the quality on the bench.\"",
      "He added about the result: \"I understand the momentum of our team. Nothing has changed radically from last week. It's just the confidence and the results. The way you see our team is different, but the way I see the moment of our team doesn't change, so it's my job to try maintain the team's balance.",
      "\"If you see the first [Forest] goal, it's a gamble. I want Amad playing in that position, but he is not the best one to defend crosses. I think we are better to press high, if you have more guys in front to control the games.",
      "\"If you play at Old Trafford, you can feel the vibe and that can help us in certain moments. We need to regain that feeling of a big team when it does matter the environment.",
      "\"We can control everything, but we are not there. But also, if you see the big teams in our league, they are more comfortable playing at home, so that is normal. We need to push ourselves that energy because our team needs to play with full energy [home and away] to be really good.\"",

      "Manchester United have already been named in connection with several players as they prepare for the January transfer window. While United's primary focus remains their Premier League campaign, recruitment plans will be being formulated behind the scenes.",
      "The club's summer signings have made a significant impact early on, with Senne Lammens stepping up as first-choice goalkeeper and forwards Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko bolstering the team's attack. Manager Ruben Amorim is hopeful of securing more positive signings when the transfer window reopens in January.",
      "However, Amorim is also aware that some members of his squad may want to seek moves away from Old Trafford, particularly with the World Cup approaching. In addition, former United star Nani has urged the club to disrupt a Premier League rival's transfer plans.",
      "Ruben Amorim has admitted he expects some of his United players will request to leave the club in January. Despite having a somewhat settled side, certain players, such as Kobbie Mainoo, who submitted a loan request over the summer, are struggling for regular game time.",
      "\"A lot of things can happen,\" Amorim said in a recent press conference. \"Even in our club, and you know that we have the World Cup, some players are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything.\"",
      "However, the United manager isn't only thinking about departures. Amorim has made it clear that the club will target players who can make a lasting contribution to his squad.",
      "\"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United,\" he continued. \"We are not just buying one guy because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now.",
      "\"We want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea. I don't know what is going to happen. But of course, we think about how we can improve the team, and in January, the window is open, we can do something.\"",
      "Former United winger Nani reckons the club should revisit their interest in Joao Palhinha, who opted for Bayern Munich over Old Trafford last year. The Portuguese midfielder has since joined Tottenham Hotspur on loan, where he has become a regular, with Spurs holding a £27million option to make the deal permanent in the summer.",
      "Nani played alongside Palhinha at Sporting CP and is convinced he would thrive at United. \"He's a player with energy, with power to recover balls and to fight - and that is something that fits into Man United's DNA,\" Nani told Covers.com.",
      "\"Having players who are able first to fight on the field, like to recover the ball and challenge opponents to help the team win games. You can't give your opponents any time in the Premier League and he has the energy and physical abilities to be such an asset for anyone.\"",
      "Bournemouth striker Antoine Semenyo has acknowledged the transfer speculation surrounding him. Both United and Liverpool were reportedly interested during the summer window, with claims that Semenyo held discussions with Amorim prior to signing a new contract with Bournemouth.",
      "The Cherries are reported to value Semenyo at £75million, though the ongoing transfer talk hasn't affected the forward's form this season. While several of Semenyo's teammates moved on in the summer, the 25-year-old has outlined why he opted to remain on the south coast.",
      "\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens.",
      "\"When they (his former team-mates) all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club. But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year.\"",

      "Manchester United loanee Andre Onana has insisted that he does not fear any opponent on the football pitch and would not define himself as a loser since moving to Trabzonspor on loan in September.",
      "Onana began the season as back-up to Altay Bayindir after suffering an injury during pre-season. The Cameroonian was given his chance to impress against Grimsby Town but a poor performance sealed his fate at Old Trafford.",
      "On deadline day, Senne Lammens joined United and after the window closed, the Reds took advantage of Turkey's extended market to allow Onana to leave on loan. The deal with Trabzonspor is a straight loan switch with no option to buy, but the goalkeeper has impressed his new club.",
      "He has not lost a game since his debut against Fenerbahce and has kept two clean sheets in his last three appearances. In an interview with Sporx this week, Onana spoke confidentally about his style of play and attitude towards being a goalkeeper.",
      "\"I never fear anyone. Because in this life, I only fear God,\" he explained.",
      "\"Therefore, to be honest, no one can scare me. For me, most of the time, the important thing is to try to do what's best for the team.",
      "\"If I need to play out from the back, I first analyse. Is the opponent pressing? Are they pressing with the winger, the striker, or are their centre-backs stepping up? These are the things I need to see when the ball is at my feet.",
      "\"I track how the opponent moves and look at the options before making my decision.\" United fans would argue that Onana did not distribute the ball as well as was expected during his time at the Theatre of Dreams, but the 29-year-old refuses to see that as a failure.",
      "\"Looking back, my career has really been amazing,\" he continued. \"There have been many ups and downs in this process, but that also meant a lot of learning moments, a lot of experiences.",
      "\"Coming from Cameroon and playing in Barcelona, Ajax, Inter, Manchester, and now in Trabzonspor is magnificent. Coming from there and looking at today, seeing what I've achieved in the last 10-11 years - amazing, really amazing.",
      "\"Every time I put on my boots or gloves, I want to win. Because at the end of the day, that's what we play for.",
      "\"We play to win, and I’m not afraid of anyone. When I step onto the pitch, I either win or I learn. I don’t see myself as a loser. If I don’t win, I take it as an opportunity to learn.",
      "\"Let me give you an example: my first match here was against Fenerbahce. We played well, but we didn’t win. But I don’t see it as a loss. I learned something, for instance, I learned how the referees are here.\"",
      "Onana's Trabzonspor now sit second in the Super Lig table and are just five points behind league leaders Galatasaray. Next up for them is a trip to the table-toppers on Saturday evening.",

      "He was initially given a yellow card before England was advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor. After a brief check, the decision was overturned and Dorgu was sent off.",
      "At the time, England was seen explaining the decision before brandishing the red card and former PGMOL chief and ex-FIFA referee Keith Hackett admitted that it opened the referee up to backlash.",
      "\"The red card issued by Darren England is correct, this is a challenge with excessive force, that endangers the safety of his opponent,\" he told Football Insider. \"Frankly, [when refereeing myself] I monitored the player leaving the field of play without engaging in any discussion, it is easy in the heat of the situation to be accused of saying something.",
      "\"You should monitor for sure, but there is no point of explaining why the player is being sent off, it is pretty obvious when you make a challenge with such force.”",
      "This week, the Premier League have announced their match officials appointments for the weekend's action and England will be in charge for United's trip to the City Ground. Scott Ledger and Akil Howson will be his assistants, with Bobby Madley joining the managers in the technical area.",

      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is enjoying a career revival at Barcelona.",
      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",
      "United and Rashford will always be linked but that chapter is now closed.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt urged his Manchester United teammates to cut out mistakes and take responsibility when he spoke after the disappointing Brentford defeat in September.",
      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "United lost their three-game winning streak when they drew 2-2 in the league with Nottingham Forest. The Red Devils were 1-0 up at the end of the first half through a Casemiro goal.",
      "But Forest hit twice in the space of two minutes at the start of the second half two go ahead, and though United pulled it back through Amad Diallo with nine minutes of regular time left, securing the draw, they were unable to add a fourth win to their streak.",
      "There are suggestions that Amad’s goal was the best that will be scored all season – he struck the ball on the volley from the edge of the box and it sailed into the right side of the Forest net.",
      "It was Amad’s first goal of the season to go with two assists, in a deeper role – wing back – than he was used to playing prior to Amorim’s arrival at United.",
      "The Ivorian has been challenged to be better than he’s currently being, though, with the manager feeling there is more to come from him.",
      "He said: “Amad has a lot of talent. We have a lot of players who are young and talented. He can be so much better and be more consistent. You could see in first half he had some opportunities. He has potential to do better.”",
      "On the game on the whole, Amorim said: “If I think about game, we lost control for five minutes. I feel in the recent past if we had had this situation [from 1-0 up and 2-1 down] we would have struggled so much more than today.",
      "“My feeling is we played well but we dropped a little bit of energy. When we have the full energy we are the better team. My players are giving everything but we have the potential to do better.",
      "“Sometimes we have these moments. In the end we lost two points and we need to get three points in the next game.”",
      "That was picked up by pundit Nedum Onuoha, who said: “What we’re seeing from Manchester United is the sense of confidence from them. They weren’t flustered when they went 2-1 down and they will believe they can win this game now, which is something we wouldn’t have seen a few weeks ago.”",
      "Are Man Utd set for a return to the Champions League? A landmark decision by Ruben Amorim for Nottm Forest bodes well.",

      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?",

      "Perhaps the best single month in post-Ferguson Manchester United history was enough to coax Jason Wilcox out from the shadows to reluctantly explain how the “clear plan” at Old Trafford was bearing fruit.",
      "The Director of Football shouldered a fraction of the public-facing responsibility Ruben Amorim carries every week, confirming a complete narrative volte-face for a club which had started the season with two wins from seven.",
      "It took just three consecutive victories for the complexion to transform, for the hierarchy to toot their own horn, for Manchester United to go from perennial crisis to Champions League-adjacent. When the bar is lowered towards the core of the actual earth by accepting finishing 15th, any and all positives are magnified.",
      "But as Wilcox said, one of the keys is to “not get too carried away when we win and not get too disappointed when we lose”. It remains to be seen quite what Manchester United do with a draw at Nottingham Forest in a game they should have won and could have lost.",
      "It instinctively feels far more like a point gained than two dropped. The Manchester United of last season would probably lose that game. There is clear development in the mentality and character required to go from a position of relative comfort to a sudden and total collapse.",
      "Casemiro scored from another Dyche-infuriating corner that never was and the visitors seemed in control. Forest had threatened but Luke Shaw in particular was excellent.",
      "Then half time happened. Forest scored twice within the restart as Manchester United crumbled under a couple of high crosses. Morgan Gibbs-White headed in the equaliser to finish a sublime move, before Nicolo Savona nipped in to capitalise on some haphazard defending.",
      "In those moments it is difficult to blame the manager; these were specifically individual player errors. Amad was weak in challenging Gibbs-White, and Diogo Dalot compounded playing Savona onside with reacting far too late to the danger. Amorim has deserved the blame for most of his 19 defeats in a year, but would have ranked far down the list of culprits for his 20th.",
      "That such finger-pointing was ultimately never needed is testament to the power of momentum. It swung so abruptly and violently in Forest’s favour at the start of the second half, but was also something Manchester United could harness once the shock wore off. While the winning streak is over, the confidence and conviction which came from it was evident in the final half an hour.",
      "Amad levelled with a stunning volley and almost secured a stirring win with another effort Murillo blocked on the line in stoppage time. But a chaotic draw in a game with 35 shots almost perfectly equally split between two flawed yet improving teams was a fair result on the balance of play.",
      "Manchester United are a work in progress – left wing-back is becoming a problem position and the expensive assortment of forwards signed this summer need to establish more consistency – but that progress is finally clear to see. A result and performance which won’t lead anyone to “get too carried away” nor “too disappointed” is no bad thing.",

      "Alan Shearer has hit out at Manchester United star Jadon Sancho after his “humiliating” start to life on loan at Aston Villa and told the winger to “get your attitude right”.",
      "Sancho joined Man Utd for £73m from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 but has only rediscovered his best form when back on loan at the Bundesliga side, with his displays for Manchester United, Chelsea on loan last season and now for Aston Villa falling way short of that peak.",
      "He’s made just five appearances for Villa since joining them in the summer and suffered the embarrassment of being substituted in last weekend’s victory over Manchester City having been introduced as a sub in the 29th minute.",
      "Asked about the winger’s disappointing form, Shearer said: “I don’t know what’s going on with Jadon Sancho in terms of his training or his life, but he’s got an opportunity at Villa now, and if it doesn’t work out here, people will look back and say, ‘Hang on, you’ve been given so many opportunities.’ You can only have so many.",
      "“I guess it is humiliating when you’re put on as a sub and then taken off again. It hasn’t worked out yet for him, but there’s only one way around it and that is hard work.",
      "“Get your head down, get your attitude right, and if you do that, things will turn around.”",
      "Aston Villa head to Anfield on Saturday night, and Shearer has backed Unai Emery’s side to plunge Liverpool into further crisis, but explained why he “wouldn’t be surprised” if the hosts win.",
      "“You’ve got one team in terrible form, losing six of their last seven, and one team in really good form winning six of their last seven. There’s an argument for both sides. It really is a massive game, but particularly with the way Liverpool were defeated in midweek,” Shearer added.",
      "“Liverpool can’t afford another defeat and if that does happen, then the alarm bells will really start to ring. I don’t know what to expect from Liverpool, there’s part of me that thinks it can’t continue this run, because they’ve got that much quality.",

      "“I don’t like what I’m seeing at Liverpool right now though – they’re not competing and they’re all over the place. I think Villa might take advantage of the pressure Liverpool are under.",
      "“When you gamble in midweek, the one thing you don’t want is to be battered. That filters into the football club and there’ll be an expectation for them to bounce back.",
      "“It wouldn’t surprise me if they did but I’m going to go for Villa because of the way football is, how it works sometimes, and the form that they’re in.”",

      "Signing a dynamic midfielder for Ruben Amorim is at the top of INEOS’ 2026 plans, but Manchester United’s “genuine interest” in Conor Gallagher, as reported by Fabrizio Romano, is as underwhelming as it is baffling.",
      "Casemiro’s uptick in form – evidenced by United conceding just three goal with him on the pitch and 16 goals without him – has made the requirement for a new central midfielder feel less urgent than it was even a couple of weeks ago, but that remains the area of the squad the Old Trafford hierarchy want to strengthen as a priority.",
      "Director of Football Jason Wilcox insists recruitment will be focused on “the right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure”.",
      "“They have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team,” he added.",
      "And while Gallagher – who swapped Chelsea for Atletico Madrid for £34m in the summer of 2024 – unquestionably meets that first requirement and arguably the second too, it’s hard to imagine how he would get into Amorim’s team to make that difference.",
      "It’s claimed the Red Devils were interested in Gallagher as the summer transfer window was coming to a close having asked about the availability of Carlos Baleba and been told by Brighton he would cost them £100m.",
      "But Gallagher is no alternative for Baleba, Elliot Anderson or the other midfielders Man Utd have been linked with of late.",
      "He’s played just three of his 63 games for Atletico Madrid as the defensive midfielder Amorim covets and at Chelsea was far more regularly used in an attacking midfield role, with protection always afforded to him by Enzo Fernandez or Moises Caicedo. Gareth Southgate played him in that deep-lying role for England at the start of Euro 2024 and it was a disaster.",
      "And yet, according to Romano, Gallagher remains very much on United’s radar.",
      "“I told you several times that Man United want to add a midfielder, but in this moment to go for a very expensive midfielder in the January transfer window might be difficult,” Romano told CaughtOffside.",
      "“Players like (Carlos) Baleba maybe are not even available. Same for Angelo Stiller and then there could be opportunities – a name that Manchester United considered in the summer transfer window final days was Connor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid.",
      "“Conor Gallagher remains an option in case Atletico Madrid decide to open doors to a loan move. At the moment Gallagher is only focused on Atletico Madrid. Manchester United’s interest is genuine since August. But Gallagher is one of the options they have in case it could be an opportunity on loan, in case it can be a typical general deal.",
      "“So we will be following the situation. But Gallagher is a name we have to keep there.”",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 The five ‘right’ signings Manchester United should make after statement of intent\n👉 Man Utd urged to sign ‘complete’ Tottenham star as he ‘fits into United’s DNA’ for two reasons\n👉 Man Utd: Murphy rules out PL top four finish for one reason as three stars need to do ‘more’",
      "It would be an underwhelming signing. Gallagher was very good in a very bad Chelsea team before departing for La Liga, but he’s a workhorse; in the same ‘safe pair of hands’ category as Mason Mount. He’s started just four games for Atletico this season.",
      "There will be huge doubts as to whether he’s a player who can take Man Utd forward, but above all, questions as to how he would even get in their team.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo isn’t playing as he can’t provide the foil for Bruno Fernandes to thrive as Casemiro or – ostensibly – Manuel Ugarte can. And that would surely also be the case for Gallagher.",
      "We understand Amorim’s desire for hard-working fighters in midfield, but what currently looks like a very wide net they’ve cast to find one needs to be narrowed to only include those who can dovetail with his captain. Conor Gallagher is not that man.",
      "Man Utd are looking to make a huge offer for Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Tottenham are one of the clubs interested in signing an Atletico star in transfer revenge, with the player’s World Cup “worry” potentially helping them out.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted to bring in Conor Gallagher before the transfer window shut but the Man Utd board insisted on keeping Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United had a last-minute ‘approach’ for a former Chelsea star ‘rejected’ on deadline day for one key reason.",
      "Manchester United have made an ‘enquiry’ over a late move for a former Chelsea star as Baleba alternative and ‘prefer a straight loan’.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "At times it looked like it wouldn’t happen, but Ruben Amorim has made it to a year in charge of Manchester United.",
      "After the sacking of Erik ten Hag, Man Utd announced on November 1 last year that Amorim would become their new head coach, starting work 10 days later once he finished his Sporting CP tenure. But it hasn’t been plain sailing for Amorim at Old Trafford since then.",
      "Only recently has the Portuguese tactician been able to steer United towards consecutive positive results in the Premier League. They finished 15th under his watch last season and simply have to keep improving from here.",
      "To give themselves a decent chance, they boosted their squad in the summer with a handful of new signings. But their work evolving Amorim’s squad isn’t yet complete.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has suggested Amorim will be given three years to prove himself, so if the co-owner keeps his word, the head coach will still be in situ this time next year too, ready to celebrate a second anniversary of his appointment.",
      "With two transfer windows to go before then, what might Man Utd’s best XI look like this time next year?",
      "Disappointed by the performances of Andre Onana, United faced a goalkeeping transfer dilemma this summer. Ultimately, they chose to look to the future and signed Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Amorim has been patient with the Belgian so far, but he is starting to look like his new first-choice goalkeeper ahead of Altay Bayindir.",
      "Next summer, United will need to work out what to do with Onana after his loan spell at Trabzonspor, but it’s unlikely they’d be reverting to him as a starter.",
      "As long as Lammens doesn’t make too many mistakes over the course of the season, he looks set to be entrusted with the regular starting duties in goal for the long term, having signed a contract until 2030.",
      "There could yet be scope for a more senior keeper to come in and replace him, with Bayindir then making way, but United will be managing their budget carefully and assessing what they’ve already got first.",
      "The defender that United hope will be one of their figureheads for many years, Yoro has been settling into a role on the right-hand side of a back three.",
      "After beating competition from Real Madrid to sign the Frenchman last year, United tied him down to a long-term contract until 2029.",
      "Comfortable on either side of the back three that Amorim favours, Yoro can carve out a defined future for himself on his more natural right-hand side.",
      "Despite joining United to link up with his former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, De Ligt has become a cornerstone of Amorim’s lineups recently.",
      "Generally, the Dutch defender has been stationed as the central defender in the back three, not missing a minute so far this Premier League season.",
      "At the age of 26, the once highly-touted De Ligt is approaching what should be the prime of his career, and it seems as if he’s stabilising his form in time to enjoy it in a settled role with United.",
      "DON’T MISS – The 10 Erik ten Hag signings still at Man Utd and when they could leave",
      "Upgrading at left centre-back would be a luxury for United rather than a necessity, depending on how Lisandro Martinez recovers from his latest injury setback.",
      "He has every chance of fighting for his place, but it can’t be denied that a dream target for United remains Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "So far, they’ve failed to prise him away, with Everton securing him to a new contract in the summer. However, there will reportedly be a release clause active in 2026.",
      "The price will be high, but if United find it reasonable enough and can afford it, the pathway to their dream signing could finally be cleared.",
      "If Branthwaite is out of reach, though, Martinez will likely continue as the main left-sided centre-back.",
      "Although he can also be an option in behind the striker, Amad has gained more gametime as a right wing-back so far this season.",
      "While he’s definitely more ‘wing’ than ‘back’, he has the traits to make that role his own niche in Amorim’s system.",
      "Diogo Dalot or Noussair Mazraoui will likely still be around as more defensive options, but at the age of 23, Amad is ready to take the next steps up in his career and will be aiming to put the pressure on for regular starts by virtue of his performances.",
      "United are dreaming of a midfield transformation in 2026, with sources explaining their plan to sign two new players in the department – ideally one in January and one in the summer.",
      "The preference at first would be someone with Premier League experience, with the likes of Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson on the shortlist.",
      "But Baleba struggled to impress at Old Trafford when visiting with Brighton recently and Forest’s valuation of Anderson is extremely high.",
      "TEAMtalk’s Dean Jones recently named Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton as the player suspected to be the preferred target for United as things stand, although he won’t be easy to buy either.",
      "One of the best English midfielders in the Premier League, Wharton originally hails from Lancashire and could return to the north west with United if they get their way.",
      "A player who can dictate the tempo like he can would be a major boost to Amorim’s midfield, where Manuel Ugarte is struggling to convince, Kobbie Mainoo is unfavoured and Casemiro isn’t getting any younger.",
      "The other midfielder United could face a serious dilemma over next year is their captain, Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The role Amorim has been using him in recently doesn’t get the best out of him, but on paper, he remains one of United’s best players – if not the best.",
      "Fernandes has vowed not to make a decision on his club future until after the World Cup, but there’s reportedly a clause in his contract that could lead to him leaving for a foreign club.",
      "Should United get their wish of signing a second midfielder, one candidate who has been heavily tipped for a move is Stuttgart’s Germany international, Stiller.",
      "Jason Wilcox is said to be driving United’s interest in the 24-year-old, who would be more likely to move next summer than in January.",
      "He won’t be too pricey, either, since his release clause will stand at around £35m.",
      "The left wing-back role is starting to stand out as one United could do with an upgrade in. If only they still had Alvaro Carreras…",
      "Patrick Dorgu was the first signing of the Amorim era but the step up from Lecce to Man Utd is substantial and the jury is still out on whether he’ll make it as a success.",
      "Come 2026, there could be scope for United to strengthen with a more senior left-back.",
      "Right now, it’s too early to nail down who the candidates could be. There have been links with Inter’s Federico Dimarco, but he wants to stay with his boyhood club.",
      "Someone else who’s been namechecked in the media is Fulham’s Antonee Robinson, who would bring some proven Premier League quality.",
      "That said, he will turn 29 next summer and still with two years of contract remaining, so it remains to be seen if United would still see him as an ideal profile.",
      "Their scouts will have to keep their eyes on which players emerge as standout left wing-backs over the course of the season before making a more informed decision.",
      "United transformed their attack this summer with three new signings who should set them up for the next few years.",
      "Of the new triple threat, the player who’s made the better early impression has been Mbeumo, who joined from Brentford to become the new right-sided attacking midfielder in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 shape.",
      "From his first 10 games, Mbeumo has scored five goals for United. He’s still only 26, so if he can keep this up, he should be a threat over the coming years.",
      "Man Utd stars Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, manager Ruben Amorim",
      "Operating alongside Mbeumo and in behind the main striker is Cunha, who has been more of a slow burner since his switch from Wolves.",
      "It took until his ninth appearance for Cunha to score his first goal for United, but now that he’s broken his duck, he’ll be aiming to make more of an impact.",
      "Like Mbeumo, Cunha arrived with Premier League experience and is 26 years old, expecting to spend his prime years at Old Trafford.",
      "United capped off their attacking rebuild by signing Sesko as their new centre-forward, deciding against going for a more experienced option.",
      "It’s now over to the Slovenian to showcase his worth and justify United’s decision to pick out a player with long-term potential up front, just as they tried with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee before only to be underwhelmed.",
      "Sesko has only scored twice from his first 10 games for United, but time will be on his side to step up – and besides, he arrived on the back of better seasons than Hojlund or Zirkzee before their moves.",
      "If Sesko doesn’t hit the mark, there might be calls for United to sign a more proven goalscorer – in fact, they might need a reliable veteran to back him up anyway, moving Zirkzee on – but this season will be practically all his to solidify his status.",

      "Amorim is slowly starting to turn things around at Old Trafford, winning three Premier League games on the bounce to lift them above Liverpool and into sixth place in the table, having been on the verge of the sack for the majority of his Old Trafford career to that point having been appointed last November.",
      "He became the club’s priority candidate after Erik ten Hag’s poor start to last season, after the Dutchman was handed a contract extension on the back of winning the FA Cup.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has since admitted it was a mistake to retain Ten Hag, and a report from The Athletic has detailed the process in that summer when he signed a new deal which saw the Man Utd chiefs scour the managerial market to identify a replacement, which very nearly saw De Zerbi take the reins at Old Trafford.",
      "It’s claimed their analysis of candidates at the time was focused on them ‘playing an attacking 4-3-3 system’ similar to the one used by Ten Hag, and there was ‘an emphasis on previous Premier League experience’.",
      "It led them to draw up a six-man shortlist featuring Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Roberto De Zerbi, Thomas Frank, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "‘Informal contact was made with all of them’ but Tuchel and De Zerbi were ‘the prime candidates’, with Amorim not considered owing to his tactical system and lack of Premier League experience.",

Tuchel came across incredibly well, but no terms were agreed and the German wasn’t ready for the United job. He was to take a short break from football after a difficult time at Bayern Munich that led to him leaving that club only the previous month.",
      "‘So De Zerbi became the frontrunner, and financial terms were discussed with the Italian in line with what United felt was fair. Those terms were rejected, and the club chose not to improve them.’",
      "In the end, Man Utd stuck with Ten Hag having failed to agree terms with a manager they deemed suitable to take over at the time, before ripping up their blueprint following his poor start to the campaign and plumping for a man with no Premier League experience, who plays a completely different formation in Amorim.",

      "“I still think they could get a bit more from their wing-backs,” Murphy added.",

      "“I like Dalot, he’s a talent, but is he really a wing-back? He’s a right-footer playing at left wing-back.”",
      "When asked how they could do more, Murphy continued: “Goals and assists. If you’re playing wing-back, you are getting in great areas, you really are. I’m not talking double figures but they need to chip in [with goals and assists].”",
      "Pundit Danny Murphy revealed who he thinks will win the Premier League and Champions League this season as one club is at a “different level” to Arsenal.",

      "– Manchester United have won their last three Premier League matches, their best winning run in one season since a run of four in February 2024. The Red Devils were one of three sides to win 100% of their games in October, along with Arsenal and Aston Villa.",
      "– Nottingham Forest scored three goals from seven shots in the first half of their opening Premier League match this season against Brentford (43% conversion). In their 17 halves of football since then, they have scored just two goals from 93 shots (2%).",
      "– From MD3 onwards, only Arsenal (16) have picked up more Premier League points than Manchester United (15 – W5 L2), while the Red Devils are the leading scorers in the division in that time (14).",

      "Dyche has opened with a 2-0 home win in Europe and a 2-0 defeat in the Premier League so we have little evidence to go on so far.",
      "But the manager’s reputation for getting his sides well organised suggests Forest will be competitive here and Dyche will appreciate having had a full week on the training ground to work on tactics.",
      "Although they snatched victory at Anfield, United’s revival has been based on much improved form at Old Trafford where they’ve won four on the spin after an opening-weekend defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Add in their poor recent form at the City Ground and Forest may have enough about them to earn a draw, available at 13/5.",
      "United skipper and talisman Bruno Fernandes has netted in two of his last four starts against Forest so a 12/1 Bet Builder of Fernandes to score anytime in a draw appeals at 12/1."

      "Andre Onana’s performances for Trabzonspor following his Manchester United exit have been summed up “in one word” as the chances of a permanent transfer have been revealed.",
      "Onana joined Man Utd from Inter Milan for £47m in the summer of 2023 but was allowed to leave the club in September after his less than convincing displays for the Red Devils last season.",
      "A four-game winning run has moved Trabzonspor into second place in the Turkish Super Lig and Onana hasn’t tasted defeat for his new club since his debut loss against Fenerbahce.",
      "And Trabzonspor correspondent Hasan Tuncel was full of praise for the 29-year-old when asked for his assessment of his performances, describing his contribution as “flawless”.",
      "“In one word: outstanding,” Tuncel said. “Onana’s debut came in the match against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor lost 1–0, but the story of that game was far deeper than the scoreline.",
      "“A Trabzonspor goal was controversially disallowed, creating real tension on the pitch. During that chaos, Onana’s leadership stood out – he calmed his teammates, used his experience, and pulled off some remarkable saves.”",
      "“From that moment on, not just the fans in Turkey but everyone watching internationally saw that he is still a top-level goalkeeper. He has maintained the same standard in the following matches.",
      "“His performance against Kayserispor was phenomenal – he practically saved every shot on target. In the match against Eyupspor, his two crucial saves were instrumental in keeping Trabzonspor’s title hopes alive.",
      "“So far, he’s been flawless. Beyond his goalkeeping, he’s become a leader in the dressing room.",
      "“He personally mentors three young goalkeepers – Onuralp Cevikkan, Ahmet Dogan Yildirim, and Erolcan Colak – guiding them during and after training sessions. This mentorship has earned him great respect within the club.”",

      "On how Onana was welcomed to the club, Tuncel added: “In Trabzonspor’s culture, big-name signings are usually welcomed with great passion – but Onana’s arrival was something beyond the usual,” he revealed.",
      "“We’ve seen large crowds at the airport before for players like Daniel Sturridge or John Obi Mikel, yet Onana’s reception had a different atmosphere. Because he arrived with his family, the club decided to organize a more personalized and emotional welcome.",
      "“Fans interacted with him directly, telling him: ‘Don’t worry, we’re with you all the way.’ That moment, combined with Onana’s smile, created a very symbolic image.",
      "“Players who come with their families usually adapt much faster – and that’s a crucial factor in professional football. Onana taking this process seriously and settling in with his family was seen as a very positive sign by both the club and its supporters.”",
      "Despite Onana’s excellent form, it’s unlikely Trabzonspor will have the wherewithal to complete his permanent signing",
      "Tuncel continued: “The club is extremely happy with his performances, but given the transfer fee Manchester United paid for him, a permanent deal looks financially difficult at the moment,” Tuncel admitted.",
      "“However, if Onana continues at this level and United lower their asking price, I have no doubt Trabzonspor would be interested in making a formal move.",
      "“For now, the focus is on having Onana mentor the club’s young goalkeepers and aid their development. But if conditions become favourable, Trabzonspor would certainly love to keep him on a permanent basis.”",
      "Here is our ranking of every Premier League No.2 goalkeeper. Liverpool will need to call on theirs soon to make his English top-flight bow due to injury.",
      "Man Utd are ‘expected’ to place a £60m bid for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",

      "They’ve won a few trophies and there were some good times under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then Erik ten Hag, along with other glimmers of joy, but the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the sinking Old Trafford ship while Liverpool simultaneously plunge into crisis has created a satisfaction stew which might just have made October 2025 the most enjoyable month for a Manchester United fan since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe came out in support of Amorim when reports of his sacking and talk of possible replacements were still rife despite a face-saving victory over Sunderland at the start of the month.",
      "The co-owner said he needed three years at Old Trafford to prove he’s a “great” coach; we gave him three weeks, still wholly unconvinced both by Amorim’s ability to turn things around and by the veracity of Ratcliffe’s backing of a manager with the worst record of any Man Utd boss since the halcyon Fergie days. But what a three weeks it’s been.",
      "Having incredibly failed to win consecutive Premier League games since joining the club last November, Amorim’s now won three(?!) on the bounce, with victory over fourth-placed Sunderland followed by their first win at Anfield in nearly a decade and then their latest triumph, over Brighton.",
      "And they were proper wins too, featuring some tactical nuance, game management, surprising confidence and some outstanding performances from summer signings to shift the narrative in dramatic fashion, to the point where we’re wondering what’s stopping United from qualifying for the Champions League next season.",
      "No midweek football thanks to the Europa League final and Grimsby Town defeats, while meaning scant opportunity for backups like Kobbie Mainoo, is granting Amorim plenty of time on the training ground with the players to hone ideas and implement a philosophy which they now appear to be finally getting to grips with.",
      "Senne Lammens has been a revelation in goal and Casemiro’s rejuvenation has, at least for the time being, put a stop to claims Amorim and United were doomed to perpetual false dawns at best until they signed a new No.6. Rumours of interest in Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and others have been conspicuous by their absence in the last couple of weeks.",
      "The centre-backs are all playing well, with the question now not which three are less likely to screw up but which in-form defender Amorim should leave out. Lisandro Martinez’s return looks set to raise those standards even higher.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are doing excellent work in relieving the creative pressure on the shoulders of Bruno Fernandes, who looks increasingly like the leader of Man Utd rather than a guy whining while wearing an armband.",
      "And although the jury may still be out on Benjamin Sesko, it’s testament to the work of his fellow forwards that he’s being allowed the space to ease into life in the Premier League rather than being harangued for not scoring regular goals as Rasmus Hojlund was.",
      "It’s all going swimmingly for them, and whether because of some mystical requirement for one of the two greatest English teams to be in crisis at any one time, or simply thanks to a glorious twisting of fates for the Red Devils, the aversion of their club emergency has coincided with Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming fully fledged in October.",
      "It’s seen the Reds lose three Premier League games before dumped out of the Carabao Cup, making it six defeats in seven. Mohamed Salah has lost it. Virgil van Dijk might just be past it. Their two £100m+ players have been stratospheric flops. And Arne Slot, while making excuses that would make Jurgen Klopp or Arsene Wenger blush having been a beacon of objectivity last season, is now second in the sack race. Amorim is eighth.",
      "Having been eight points behind Liverpool after five games, after nine Man Utd are above them. And while we can’t yet know whether October 2025 will act as a line in the sand, the point when Amorim’s Man Utd truly discovered their identity before going on to great things while Slot’s Liverpool scrabbled to recover theirs to no avail before his sacking, there’s no doubt that it’s been a standout month for Red Devils fans in the post-Sir Alex era; maybe the most enjoyable of all.",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "Are Man Utd set for a return to the Champions League? A landmark decision by Ruben Amorim for Nottm Forest bodes well.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030."

      "There has been so much noise around Viktor Gyokeres this season.",
      "Is he good enough? Is he scoring enough? Is he doing enough?",
      "However, the Sweden striker has quietly been going about his business and at Burnley, he produced his best 45 minutes in an Arsenal shirt so far - before he was forced off at the break with a muscular injury.",
      "Gyokeres struck the opener from a corner as Mikel Arteta's side also improved on their league-leading set-piece goals tally before the striker's brilliant pass freed Leandro Trossard in the build up to Declan Rice's superb header.",
      "It was an all-action display that showed his strength, his power, his pace, and his instinct to be in the right place at the right time to score, which is what ultimately Arsenal bought him to the club to do.",
      "\"Everything,\" Mikel Arteta said when asked what impressed him about Gyokeres's display. \"His high press, his position and his touches. His threat in behind, the way he linked play, the way he gets us from these situations to transition moments. I think he was in a really good moment. It's a shame that he felt something.\"",

      "With Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Jesus still out after long-term injuries, the Gunners can't afford to lose much more quality, especially in the centre forward position.",
      "Sometimes this job is a real privilege. Watching Moises Caicedo up close was a real thrill - even the Tottenham fans would have to agree. This was a performance that showcased everything you want from a world-class midfielder. Tenacious, intelligent, full of quality and affecting the game in the final third. Jamie Redknapp called him \"world class, perhaps the best of his type in world football.\"",

      "There's something N'Golo Kanté-esque about him, not just in engine or energy, but in humility. He doesn't crave the spotlight, he craves the ball. And when he gets it, the whole game dances to his tune. Xavi Simons looked almost frightened at times to dribble near the Chelsea enforcer such was the domination in the duels.",
      "He has that fear factor now. And that's one of the main reasons why he's the best in the world at what he does.Lewis Jones",
      "To beat Tottenham looks simple at the moment: defend set pieces properly and you're onto a winner. Chelsea, who before this game had conceded the most expected goals from set pieces this season, stood up and were counted against the Spurs set piece machine that had blown away Everton last weekend.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side didn't concede a single shot from set piece situations as Robert Sanchez commanded his area like he was the king of the skies. Yes, Spurs' delivery was unusually poor but the goalkeeper time-after-time took the pressure off his defenders by coming to catch and purposefully punch clear high balls.",
      "In a season where being able to defend your box under pressure from dead balls counts for a lot, Chelsea took a huge step in the right direction with this resolute defensive showing.Lewis Jones",
      "Jefferson Lerma had only made one Premier League start since the start of the season before the visit of Brentford to Selhurst Park - but he took his chance with both hands after Adam Wharton was ruled out through illness.",
      "The Colombian played a pivotal role in Crystal Palace's opener, latching onto a floated free-kick from Yeremy Pino and guiding a header into the path of Jean-Philippe Mateta, who did the rest. For their second, it was his long throw that Nathan Collins headed into the back of his own net.",
      "The nature of the second was ironic, given just how much of a threat the Bees have been from long throws this term. But Lerma was adept in that area before it was on trend.",
      "He won five of his seven duels on the day, too, and overall proved to Oliver Glasner that, while he is playing a bit-part role at the moment, he is ready and waiting to step up from the off whenever he's required.Dan Long",
      "Manchester United's winning run in the Premier League was brought to a halt at three at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest's quick start to the second half proved to be enough for the spoils to be shared. And in truth, Ruben Amorim's side only had themselves to blame.",
      "The Red Devils had gone into half-time with an albeit controversial lead, but were good value for their advantage. But what happened when the teams returned to the pitch was nothing short of a disaster.",
      "By minute 50, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head. And the United players just didn't look like they were with it in the slightest.",
      "It forced them to be in a position they haven't been in over the course of the last three matches - chasing a goal. And more often than not, Amorim's men have struggled in this very circumstance as when teams set up against them in a low block, they just can't break them down.",
      "Thanks to Forest's set-piece woes and a wonderful strike from Amad Diallo, they took something back up north with them. But it could've been more if they hadn't stayed asleep at the start of the second 45.",
      "Post-match, Amorim bemoaned his team's lack of energy away from home, saying that they \"need to work on bringing the same away from home,\" as they do at Old Trafford. They may be showing signs of improvement, but this is one bad habit that they are clearly yet to shake.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White said he and his Nottingham Forest team-mates were frustrated not to take three points against Man Utd. It's been a long wait for a second Premier League win of the season, with their first coming way back on the opening weekend on August 17.",
      "They were good value for the win, too, looking comfortable until Amad Diallo's wonderstrike. Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi went close to extending their advantage before that late equaliser and the Expected Goals data shows in their favour as well - 2 vs 1.15.",
      "But until Forest solve their set-piece problems, they are going to find winning matches hard. For all the controversy about the award of United's corner for Casemiro's opener, the defending from it was poor. Forest were static, the Brazilian given too much space to rise and head in.",
      "Amad's strike also came from a corner, when the ball was only half-cleared. That makes it 16 Premier League goals from set-piece situations conceded by Forest in 2025. That's the most of any other side in the competition.",
      "It's an obvious weakness. At least boss Sean Dyche can be encouraged that, if he solves that issue, he is developing promising signs elsewhere in Forest's play.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton's dominant win over Leeds saw them pick up their first clean sheet of the season - but Fabian Hurzeler's side provided a masterclass in defending from the front.",
      "The Seagulls' press was frenetic from the first whistle to the last, and didn't give the Leeds defence a moment of peace with the ball.",
      "The first shot on target for the visitors didn't come until the 85th minute - according to manager Fabian Hurzeler, that was just as much the result of the attack as the resolute defence.",
      "\"The clean sheet was well deserved. Everyone worked hard for it - not just the midfielders, but the defenders and the strikers.\"",
      "Consistency is the key from here on out for Hurzeler - but if the high press is this effective every week, the sky is the limit for his team.",
      "Noah Langford",
      "Leeds' struggles away from Elland Road continued with a limp performance on their way to a comprehensive defeat at Brighton, and this was perhaps the worst of the bunch.",
      "Their ineffective attack has been a key theme away from home this season - their only goals on the road came in their win against 20th placed Wolves.",
      "Leeds had only converted a staggering six per cent of their shots in October compared to 23 per cent for their opponents. November didn't start much better, as they only managed their first shot on target in the 85th minute against Brighton.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked lost at sea once again at the head of the Leeds attack - his only half-decent chance came from a 25-yard effort that was always veering wide. Brendon Aaronson and Noah Okafor, his partners in attack, looked nowhere near as dangerous as they did against at home against West Ham.",
      "A ferocious West Yorkshire atmosphere has been able to spur Leeds to home victories this season - but a boost in attacking quality is needed if they want to pick up points on the road.Noah Langford",
      "Despite having just watched his win-less side lose 3-0 loss at Fulham to remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League, beleaguered Wolves boss Vitor Pereira was still in a defiant post-match mood down by the River Thames, insisting they were capable of avoiding relegation.",
      "The Portuguese pointed to last season, when he replaced Gary O'Neil at Molineux with Wolves having also not won any of their opening 10 league games of the campaign, as is the case this season, only for them to then embark on a six-match winning run that saw them finish in 16th.",
      "However, things feel different this time, not only because no team in Premier League history has ever stayed up with just two points from their opening 10 matches [Wolves had picked up three under O'Neil at the same stage last season], but also more pertinently because of the quality of the three promoted sides this campaign.",
      "Pereira said he has tried everything to get back to winnings ways - a new shape and different players at Craven Cottage - but admitted after what he called his side's worst display since he took over last December, he still \"does not have the answer.\"",
      "For his and Wolves' sake, let's hope he finds it soon…Rich Morgan",
      "Hits and misses is a fun concept but Liverpool's win over Aston Villa highlighted the fine margins. Arne Slot's side ended their four-game winless streak as their pressing was rewarded for the opening goal, Villa making what Unai Emery called \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "The natural conclusion to draw was that Villa were foolish to attempt to pass out from the back, especially against a Liverpool side that have struggled against the long ball. But Villa came close to opening the scoring as a result of passing out from the back.",
      "Morgan Rogers struck the post with that chance, the move having been started by Emi Martinez in the Villa goal - the culprit for the error that led to Mohamed Salah's breakthrough strike. Matty Cash also struck the frame of the goal in the first half.",
      "\"The first 30 minutes we were fantastic continuing the way we did against Tottenham and Man City showing our capacity to dominate some times and create chances,\" explained Emery, adding: \"Of course, we need goals, but we hit two posts today.\"",
      "Slot acknowledged his team's fortune on the night. \"Maybe we were a bit more on the lucky side than we have been in the last few weeks. a mistake of their goalkeeper and a deflection led to two of our goals but these are the margins we are talking about.\"",
      "He added: \"In other games, we have created more in open play than we did today but football is about results not the chances you create from open play.\" Slot and Liverpool have found that out the hard way lately. This was Villa's turn to be on the receiving end. Adam Bate",

      "Amad Diallo produced a stunning volley to grab a point for Man Utd at Nottingham Forest as their winning run was halted by a rollercoaster 2-2 draw.",
      "With nine minutes to play and Forest looking comfortable, Amad cracked in a super left-foot strike when Nikola Milenkovic's header fell to him on the edge of the box. He then thought he'd hit a 94th-minute winner only to be denied by a goalline block by Murillo, capping a game packed with drama.",
      "United had led at half-time through a controversial Casemiro opener which sparked fury around the City Ground. The officials had awarded a corner when replays did not conclusively show all of the ball had crossed the line and the Brazilian subsequently headed in.",
      "\"It's not out,\" said former Premier League referee Mike Dean on Soccer Saturday. \"The ball is nowhere near out. It's just a guess by the referee.\"",
      "Forest had conceded from a corner which should have been given as a goal-kick at Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "Afterwards, Forest boss Sean Dyche called for a review of the rules, with VAR currently unable to intervene in those situations. \"We talk about the margins in football, we talk about VAR,\" he said. \"Why's it not brought in?",
      "\"Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",
      "Forest were fuelled by the injustice on Saturday, with Morgan Gibbs-White brilliantly heading in an equaliser three minutes into the second half before Nicolo Savona - who had been the player judged unable to keep the ball in for the controversial corner - pounced to prod in Forest's second.",
      "Nottingham Forest: Sels (6), Savona (7), Milenkovic (6), Murillo (8), Williams (7), Luiz (6), Anderson (8), Ndoye (6), Gibbs-White (8), Hudson-Odoi (7), Igor Jesus (6).\n\n\nSubs:  Yates (7), Awoniyi (6), Sangare (N/A)\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (7), Amad (8), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (7), Dalot (6), Mbeumo (7), Cunha (7), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Mazraoui (6)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest)",
      "Bruno Fernandes drilled a low shot against an upright as United sought to swing the contest again but Forest weren't far off a third, with Igor Jesus heading wide from close range and Callum Hudson-Odoi blasting narrowly off target.",
      "Amad's firecracker left Forest ruing those misses and in the end they were indebted to Murillo's quick reactions.",
      "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche:",
      "\"It's not conclusive. I've seen it back. Apparently today, the assistant referee can see 78 yards away. It's got to change. That's two in a week. Two decisions that are not right have gone against us in a week. Yes, of course, we then have to deal with the situation which we didn't do as well. But it is tough when there's a lot of noise about corners at this club and then they give corners that aren't corners.",
      "\"We had one last week, one this week. It's very tough on the team to take decisions like that. We talk about the margins in football, we talk about VAR, why it is not brought in? Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",

      "\"I think we dropped the energy level. You can feel it when our team is not at the top of their energy and aggression. You can feel it. We managed to score again, we tried to win the game, we had a big opportunity in the end. We missed that little bit of luck. We need to work to bring the same away from home as we do in our stadium.",
      "\"We are getting better. Everyone can see. We are getting that feeling that if we can't win, at least we aren't going to lose. The way we press, the urgency with certain things, I think we did better last Sunday. We need to be like that in every game.\"",
      "On Amad's equaliser: \"It's something good for the fans. It was a really important goal for us. But I'm more focused on the 90 minutes. And what we did good. That's what I'll tell the players. Sometimes I forget that part and I judge the players when I see the games. But, we are doing things right. We are controlling the game. Of course we can do so much to grow. But there are a lot of things we are doing right.",

      "The Portuguese head coach has endured a difficult 12 months since arriving from Sporting, finishing 15th, losing in the Europa League final and winning only one of the first five games this season - which left him wondering if he would make it to a year in charge.",

      "\"It's hard to say. We need to think positively, but we also need to be prepared that football is [up and down]. And we are not that team that I can say to you, no, no, no.",
      "\"Now we can lose here or there, but we are going to maintain. I trust in my players more. I think they trust me more. That will come with wins. And you can sense that because everyone now is saying that, how connected they are and they believe in the manager.",

      "Newcastle's £69m striker Nick Woltemade is contributing more than goals as Alexander Isak starts slowly at Liverpool; The Radar column also looks at the man-management techniques being used by Fabian Hurzeler on Charalampos Kostoulas and Brighton's other young players",
      "Sunday 2 November 2025 07:15, UK",
      "",
      "💪 Woltemade's strong start for Newcastle🔹 Kostoulas being challenged by Hurzeler🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Nick Woltemade scored his third header of the season in Newcastle's Carabao Cup win over Spurs on Wednesday. The 6ft 6in striker is proving difficult to handle. And not just aerially.",
      "His tally of six goals in only 760 minutes includes two ingenious flicked finishes, one against Union Saint-Gilloise and an even better one against Brighton. There was a penalty lifted into the top corner against Nottingham Forest as if struck with a pitching wedge.",
      "It is a fitting level of variety for a player who is difficult to define. Woltemade has the physical profile to play the role of a targetman. His presence has allowed Newcastle to send more passes long in line with the Premier League's shift towards directness.",
      "He has scored headed goals against Wolves and Arsenal as well Spurs. Not many strikers can claim to have bested Gabriel Magalhaes this season but Woltemade towered over him when scoring Newcastle's opener against the Gunners in September.",
      "As is becoming increasingly clear to his new audience, though, he is also an excellent technician capable of a light touch as well as brute force. He is comfortable holding onto the ball in tight spaces. He drops deep and pulls wide to link the play. He can even dribble.",
      "His team-mates certainly value his all-round contribution. \"He is so big, it is a little bit easy for him to score goals with his head but he is a very good player,\" said Sandro Tonali after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He runs all 90 minutes every time. He plays with us, the midfielders and the defenders. He is the first defender and the first striker.\" Eddie Howe added that he \"set the tone\" for Newcastle's pressing.",
      "He is already loved by Newcastle supporters. His arrival, for £69m from Stuttgart in the summer, having previously been a target for Bayern Munich, has helped to ensure that, so far, at least, the departed Alexander Isak has not been missed.",
      "It has escaped nobody's attention that Woltemade has comprehensively outperformed his predecessor, who is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool, his only goal since his record £125m transfer coming in the Carabao Cup against Southampton.",
      "Yoane Wissa's injury absence has added to the pressure on Woltemade to perform and he continues to deliver. He has more Premier League goals, with four, than any of the 18 other strikers signed by Premier League clubs during a summer transfer window which featured unprecedented spending on forwards.",
      "It is all the more impressive given he has played fewer minutes than many of the other players in the list, including all of Chelsea's Joao Pedro, Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres, Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "He is of course a different type of player to the man he has replaced. He is not generating as many shots or creating as many chances as Isak last term but he offers an aerial outlet, wins more duels, makes more pressures and regains possession more frequently.",
      "His heat map hints at a broader remit.",
      "While Isak was focused on stretching opposition defences with runs in behind, Woltemade is more likely to be seen further away from goal, helping to construct attacks as well as finish them.",
      "Woltemade is still acclimatising to certain aspects of the Premier League. Issa Diop and Calvin Bassey subjected him to rough treatment which often went unpunished against Fulham last weekend, much to the striker's frustration.",
      "But overall the speed of his adaptation has been hugely impressive. His challenge now is just to continue in the same vein.",
      "So, is his current scoring rate sustainable? Woltemade has scored four goals from four shots on target in the Premier League. Factor in his goals in the Champions League and Carabao Cup and, amazingly, it is six from six shots on target overall.",
      "He has reached that tally from chances worth only 3.46 expected goals, an overperformance which suggests a reversion to the mean may lie ahead. And yet, his actual goal total could easily be higher.",
      "Woltemade hit the post from close range in last weekend's 2-1 win over Fulham and struck the underside of the crossbar in the game against Nottingham Forest, during which he also had a goalbound effort blocked by defender Morato inside the six-yard box.",
      "Newcastle may ultimately need to service him with more scoring opportunities. They will need their wingers to contribute more goals too, with Jacob Murphy, Harvey Barnes, Anthony Gordon and Anthony Elanga having only found the net once in the Premier League between them so far this season.",
      "But in Woltemade right now, they have a player giving them exactly what they need, filling an Isak-shaped void, contributing a lot more than just goals, and, two months into the season, winning the battle of the Premier League's new No 9s.",
      "From Newcastle to Brighton, where it has been a slower start for Charalampos Kostoulas, another of the Premier League's newly-signed strikers having joined from Olympiakos for £31.4m in June.",
      "The 18-year-old came with a reputation as one of Europe's most exciting young frontmen and finally earned a first start in Brighton's Carabao Cup tie against Arsenal on Wednesday having scored his first goal from the bench against Manchester United.",
      "Unfortunately for him, it did not last long.",
      "Kostoulas looked menacing from the left flank in the first half at the Emirates Stadium but he was withdrawn at the interval with Fabian Hurzeler citing \"physical reasons\" afterwards.",
      "\"He needs to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League, he needs to adapt to the demands,\" said the Brighton boss.",
      "The 32-year-old talked up the importance of \"honest feedback\" having been firm with Baleba over his performances following a summer of transfer speculation. Hurzeler has taken him off at half-time on three separate occasions this season. \"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside,\" he said.",
      "Clearly, Hurzeler is pushing Kostoulas in the same way. And even if it feels uncomfortable, the striker should keep in mind that his team-mate appears to have benefitted. Baleba was Brighton's best performer against Arsenal, dominating the midfield in the first half and demonstrating the potential Hurzeler is trying to extract.",
      "No Dean Huijsen, no problem for Bournemouth. They have another young gem at centre-back in Veljko Milosavljevic.",
      "The 18-year-old Serb is pushing to face Erling Haaland and Manchester City on Super Sunday having helped Bournemouth keep a clean sheet against Nottingham Forest last time out.",
      "Sunderland host Everton on Monday Night Football. Tune in from 6.30pm ahead of the 8pm kick-off.",
      "Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and Tottenham's issues playing through midfield featured in last week's column. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes' stunning record for Man Utd ahead of his 300th appearance."

      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has promised investment in the \"right\" signings in order to realise the club's long-term vision.",
      "United have hit a groove of positivity, having won three league games on the bounce for the first time since boss Ruben Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their evident attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the Man Utd website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
      "United's summer transfer window is likely to be an important one given the fact that some members of the squad are approaching the final six months of their current deals, such as Casemiro and Harry Maguire. United had looked at possible options in the middle last summer but had prioritised other positions, especially up front. However, potential outgoings present an opportunity to strengthen in the middle of the park.",
      "The Old Trafford club have long been admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba - but he is just one of a number of midfielders they continue to monitor.",
      "Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is another on the radar Old Trafford, given his impressive performances have continued into this campaign.",
      "While transfer business is not on the immediate agenda, Wilcox heaped praise on United's summer acquisitions, who he says are guiding the club in the right direction on the pitch.",
      "\"They are all good guys,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Even from last summer's window, they are top professionals, top players and we are really optimistic we are going in the right direction.",
      "\"I am sure there are going to be bumps in the road but we have just got to make sure we stay calm irrespective of the noise outside.",
      "\"I see the intensity, I am at training every day, I see the way that they train, the way they apply themselves, the way they communicate and get on with each other.",
      "\"Like I say, when you lose football matches you are always going to be a little bit disappointed and especially at this club.\"",
