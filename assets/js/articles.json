      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim hailed Patrick Dorgu following his standout display in the 4-1 thrashing of Bournemouth in Chicago. Dorgu set up Rasmus Hojlund for United's first goal eight minutes into the game and then bagged one himself just under 20 minutes later.",
      "The young Dane capitalised on a quick free-kick from Mason Mount, shrugged off his marker, burst forward and coolly finished past Bournemouth keeper Djordje Petrovic, marking his first goal since his February move from Lecce.",
      "After an impressive outing against West Ham United in New Jersey last weekend, the 20-year-old was a persistent threat on the left, adopting the attacking positions that Amorim demands from his wing-backs.",
      "Amorim, delighted with Dorgu's development during his first pre-season with United, told MUTV: \"He is 20 years old. He looks more and more like he belongs in Manchester United.",
      "\"That is hard to do at 20 years old. He is so powerful, he is getting his technique in his game, he is defending so well, he is pressing so well, so I am really impressed with Patrick.\"",
      "While Dorgu could be set for a long future at United, Amorim has hinted Hojlund could be heading for the exit door. The Dane has seen striker Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrive this summer, while interest has been lodged in RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim is pleased with Hojlund's pre-season work but could not offer the 22-year-old any reassurance over his future. He said: “I’m really happy with Rasmus, but I don’t know what is going to happen until the end of the market.",
      "“The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He’s connecting really well with the team. He’s improving.",
      "“Again, I don’t know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a lot because of the lack of goals last season.”",
      "Cunha did not play against Bournemouth due to fatigue, while Mbeumo is scheduled to make his first appearance against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. Harry Maguire was replaced by Matthijs de Ligt, who scored an 88th-minute own goal, at half-time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "While Christian Eriksen may have drawn the curtain on his Manchester United career, he could still prove instrumental in the club's transfer plans this summer. Or at least regarding the destiny of one rumoured transfer target in fellow Dane Morten Hjulmand.",
      "The Sporting CP midfielder is reportedly on United's wish list as they look to bolster the engine room. And Eriksen, who departed this summer following three years at Old Trafford, might assist his former club in securing his own successor.",
      "That sum could prove too steep for United to complete a deal this summer, though Eriksen's sway might tip the scales in their direction. Hjulmand, who was also on United's wish list last summer, regards his international colleague as a mentor figure, while his existing bond with Ruben Amorim will also strengthen his position.",
      "Despite severing ties with the Red Devils this summer, Eriksen seemed to leave on excellent terms. And he was especially praising of Amorim and his contribution since taking over from Erik ten Hag last autumn.",
      "\"The manager has come in with new ideas,\" said the Danish stalwart in March. \"He's a very honest guy, straightforward, and we're just trying to adapt and get into the system and the habits in his style of play.",
      "\"He's a good manager. With a bit more belief like we had in the second half, we could create chances, commit more people offensively and then we got a few chances.\"",
      "Sporting are set to pocket a tidy profit for Hjulmand should they receive anything close to his release clause, whether that materialises this summer or in the near future. The defensive midfielder arrived in Portugal from Italian side Lecce during the summer of 2023, with the club securing his signature for a reasonable £17m fee.",
      "He claimed the Primeira Liga title under Amorim during his debut campaign at the club before being handed the captain's armband in July 2024. That appointment demonstrates the admiration Amorim holds for the player and his leadership abilities, and it seems the sentiment goes both ways.",
      "Hjulmand would also be reunited with fellow Danes Rasmus Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu and Chido Obi in Manchester. And he has previously outlined the beneficial impact Amorim has had on his development, saying he was \"sad\" to see him leave Lisbon.",
      "\"Ruben was one of the reasons why I came to Sporting,\" said the midfielder during the international break last November. \"When you are coached by him, you get a clear idea of the way he sees football and how he sees us being part of the team.",
      "\"It's a very important image for the player, to know what his role is, what he can contribute to the team. It was very important when I joined Sporting. The way he sees the players, how he manages the team on and off the field... it's something I've never seen in my career. Manchester United will be in good hands with Ruben.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo says Manchester United's team has \"gelled\" during their US tour and praised the impact made by new signing Matheus Cunha. Cunha, a £62.5million signing from Wolves, impressed in United's 2-1 US tour opener win over West Ham in New Jersey, with Mainoo claiming the forward brings something different to the team.",
      "\"Adding Matheus brings something different again and I think it worked well in the last game,\" said Mainoo. \"You can stitch him up [with a poor pass] and he'll deal with it! He loves playing under pressure and in one against ones, so it makes it easier for me.",
      "\"The team's definitely gelled well since we've been back and with the new additions - Diego [Leon], Matheus and Bryan [Mbeumo], it's been really good. It's been good, playing in there [midfield] with Manu [Ugarte], Bruno [Fernandes] or any of them - Casemiro, Toby [Collyer]. It's always good there.",
      "\"It's been good. It's very hot out here and in New Jersey, but it's been nice. Training's been good, we got the first win against West Ham so we're all feeling good.\"",
      "Reflecting on his rapid rise for United and England, Mainoo said: \"It's been a cool journey and I'm just looking forward to the season to see what happens.\"",
      "United, who could yet add to their ranks with a swoop for Benjamin Sesko, continued their pre-season progress with a 4-1 victory over Bournemouth on Wednesday. Rasmus Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu and Amad all found the net before youngster Ethan Williams got in on the action.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side play their final Premier League Summer Series match against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. After that comes a home friendly against Fiorentina, and then the Premier League opener at home to Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Rivals Arsenal have been busy in the transfer market themselves. They completed a £63.7m swoop for one-time United target Viktor Gyokeres, while also signing Kepa Arrizabalaga, Martin Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Christian Norgaard and Cristhian Mosquera.",
      "“There were other clubs, of course, but this wasn’t a hard choice. I chose Arsenal,” Gyokeres said, and he will now make his Premier League debut against his former Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard has already been impressed by the Swede, saying: \"“I think you've all seen what he's done in his career so far. Especially the last season at Sporting, the numbers speak for themselves.",
      "He's a very complete player. He's physical, strong, fast, good finisher, and intelligent as well. You can also see the hunger, the energy he brings. He's only trained a few times, but you can already see the quality and the willingness.”",

      "Manchester United have turned their attentions away from Ollie Watkins and towards Benjamin Sesko. However, fresh developments could yet allow them to come back in for the Aston Villa star.",
      "Villa's asking price on Watkins appeared to be a sticking point, with United seeming reluctant to part with the best part of £60m. Unai Emery's side were reluctant to sell, given their lack of back-ups in attack, but they are now eyeing up alternatives.",
      "Curiously, Villa's main attacking target is Sesko's team-mate Lois Openda. According to reports in Belgium, the Premier League side have been exploring a move for Lois Openda for a number of months, with the interest said to be mutual.",
      "Belgian international striker Openda has scored 41 goals across two seasons as a Leipzig player, but could be available after the German club missed out on European qualification. However, it is being reported that Villa will need to sell Watkins before they can bolster their attack..",
      "Villa have had a quiet window so far, with Dutch starlet Zepiqueno Redmond their only attacking recruit. They weren't able to seal permanent moves for loanees Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio, leaving them with fewer options in attack.",
      "Sesko and Watkins are both valued by their respective clubs at around £60million. However, United are more prepared to spend that kind of money for a player more than seven years younger than the England star.",
      "Slovenia international Sesko, who turned 22 in May, has 39 goals across two Leipzig seasons. He was also a target for Arsenal before they swooped for Viktor Gyokeres, while Newcastle could yet pounce if they lose Alexander Isak.",
      "While United wait to add to their attacking ranks, their current crop had a chance to show what they can do in front of goal. Ruben Amorim's side are in the United States for the Premier League Summer Series, where they made it two wins from two with a 4-1 victory over Bournemouth.",
      "United scored twice in each half, with Rasmus Hojlund among those to find the net. They play Everton over the weekend before rounding off their pre-season campaign with a home friendly against Fiorentina on August 9.",
      "Danish striker Hojlund is one player who could yet be sold to raise funds in a summer which has already seen United splash out more than £100m to bring Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford. “I’m really happy with Rasmus. But I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market,\" United's head coach said.",

      "The summer transfer window will soon overlap with the Premier League season. The campaign is a little over two weeks away, and several sagas still need to play out.",
      "Manchester United and Newcastle could yet involve themselves in a transfer battle for Benjamin Sesko, who looks like he could well leave RB Leipzig. The Red Devils want a new No 9 and the Magpies too could go after the young striker.",
      "Newcastle will only do so, however, if Alexander Isak does leave St James' Park after expressing a desire to look elsewhere. If he does leave then his likely destination will be Liverpool, who would then have spent upwards of £300million in one summer and potentially broken the British-transfer record twice in a matter of weeks.",
      "Arsenal continue to chase Eberechi Eze after landing Viktor Gyokeres with Mikel Arteta hitting the market hard this summer. There are also a number of individuals who need to iron out their futures - Jadon Sancho and Jack Grealish among them.",
      "Alexander Isak is now training away from Newcastle and is working on his fitness at former club Real Sociedad.",
      "The Liverpool target was left off the Magpies' tour to the Far East due to a thigh injury but it is understood he has made it clear he wants to leave St James' Park this summer.",
      "Still the decision to train in Spain seems bizarre when he should be undergoing rehab at Newcastle's facilities in the North East. Liverpool have yet to make a bid but are aware it will take a British transfer record offer to sign the Sweden international.",
      "Former Man Utd star Gary Pallister told BetVictor: “Could we see James McAtee at Man Utd? I watched him for England’s under 21s and he looks a terrific player. I've seen him bits and bobs in the Man City first team and he's like a Cole Palmer, isn't he?",
      "“He's that good a player and he doesn't want to wait around and wait for his chance. Phil Foden did. I think he could have gone down the same route as Palmer and now maybe McAtee. But he had the patience to see it out and got his rewards.\"",
      "Jorrel Hato is heading to Chelsea for his medical after a deal worth £37m, plus add-ons, was agreed with Ajax.",

      "Chelsea are also in talks to sign Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres agent has taken aim at Sporting Lisbon for creating a \"mess\" for the Swede as he sought to achieve an exit from the Portuguese champions. The lengthy saga ended with him joining Arsenal, but not before plenty of animosity.",
      "But Jonathan Chalkias, who works alongside Hasan Cetinkaya to manage Gyokeres, claims former Sporting chief Hugo Viana, who left to take up the same role at Manchester City, would've honoured the agreement to let him go and avoided the messy exit.",
      "He told Swedish network WTV: \"It was a mess. There was a gentleman’s agreement with the previous sporting director. If Hugo Viana were still at Sporting, the deal would have been done in an hour. Everything was written, we didn’t have time to start a legal battle.",
      "\"I don’t understand how a player who scored so many goals and won three trophies didn’t deserve more respect. The sacrifices we made were the turning point for the deal to happen. They offered Gyokeres to Real Madrid, they even made headlines with Man United, but there was a commitment with Arsenal.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim said he cannot guarantee Rasmus Hojlund will stay at Man United next season - after the club made their move for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United have prioritised a a move for RB Leipzig’s £70m-rated striker Sesko, with Amorim admitting he cannot give Hojlund any guarantees over his future.",
      "“I’m really happy with Rasmus,” said Amorim. “But I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers who are here are working really well, they are improving, they are helping the team and that’s the most important thing.\"",
      "Liverpool remain keen on landing Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace but do not agree with their £40million valuation given he is available for nothing come next summer. They also want to avoid a lengthy saga should they pursue the centre-half.",
      "Guehi has no desire to sign a new deal in south London and could leave for free in 12 months. If Liverpool are to move for the defender then it will revolve solely around the price being quoted.",
      "The Reds have already spent £200m this summer but are keen on making additions to their defence. Guehi has a lot of positives going for him but those on Merseyside have little interest in negotiations that drag on for weeks, reports the BBC.",
      "Aston Villa have identified RB Leipzig star Lois Openda as a replacement for Ollie Watkins should he join Manchester United. Belgian striker Openda scored 13 goals for Leipzig last season after notching an impressive 28 in his first term following his club-record £37m move from Lens in 2023.",
      "A report from Belgium states that Villa have been in contact with the 25-year-old's representatives for several months. However, it adds that Villa would have to sell Watkins before signing Openda.",
      "Arsenal are set to miss out on Salford City's teenage star Will Wright, who instead looks poised to head to Liverpool. The Reds have agreed a deal worth £200,000 with the League Two side for the 17-year-old striker, who scored more than 50 goals across age groups last season.",
      "Wright underwent a medical on Tuesday and a deal to take him to Anfield is now in its final stages. The Gunners were previously favourites to sign the young star, but appear to have missed out with those in the north west winning out.",
      "Oliver Glasner has pleaded with the Palace board not to sell any of their star players such as Eze, warning that it could derail their season. The 27-year-old is wanted by Arsenal, who've made him their priority as we approach the final month of the summer.",
      "Marc Guehi is also being linked with a move to Liverpool after the Palace captain entered the final 12 months of his contract. Eze, meanwhile, is tied down until 2027 but has a £68m release clause.",
      "Alexander Isak is reportedly set to become one of Liverpool's top earners if he seals a move to Anfield this summer.",
      "The Reds have been strongly linked with a move for the Sweden international, who could cost as much as £150million after his sensational displays in front of goal last season, scoring 27 times.",
      "According to Sky in Germany, Isak would earn around the same amount as new signing Hugo Ekitike, who has just penned a deal worth £250,000-a-week.",
      "Man United could have to spend upwards of £70million if they want to land Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig as talks are held over signing the striker. The Slovenian has now emerged as their main target in attack with Ruben Amorim still keen to land a No. 9 this summer if he can.",
      "Sources in Germany have indicated there is a gentlemen’s agreement between Leipzig and their young striker to let him leave for a fee of £60m to £70m plus add-ons - but only to select clubs. The German side have consistently shown they will part with their top players for the right fee and do not have the benefit of Champions League revenue this term.",

Amorim has already seen Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha arrive at Old Trafford, but neither would ideally like to play through the middle as the team's focal point and would be better suited playing behind a natural striker, leading to their interest in Sesko.",

United have prioritised a a move for RB Leipzig’s £70million-rated striker Sesko, with Amorim admitting he cannot give Hojlund any guarantees over his future.",

We suffered a a lot because of the lack of goals last season. But I think not just the goals, but the way Rasmus connects the play.",
      "“Every time we have to kick the ball, we are kicking the ball when we are more pressed. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in the support is helping us to play a lot better and we are playing better because he’s playing better.",

I'm really happy with Bryan [Mbeumo], Matheus [Cunha], even Diego [Leon]. You can see it. He's a smart guy. He's a guy that came from Paraguay to come to the Premier League. He's really powerful, so I'm really happy with the three guys.”",

      "“I think we had better possession compared to the last game, so the players are listening. Of course, scoring first in the beginning of the game can change the confidence of the team. We changed some positions and you feel that they know what to do in different positions. It was a good test.",
      "“We controlled quite well the runs of Evanilson, Semenyo. One against one, Luke Shaw was also really strong. It was a good day. It was just a pre-season game. But the feeling with the same players, even being a pre-season game, if you look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team and that is a good sign.",

      "Manchester United maintained their winning start to their US tour, defeating Bournemouth 4-1 at Soldier Field in Chicago.",
      "Victory saw Ruben Amorim's side avenge their 3-0 defeat at home to Bournemouth at Old Trafford last season, with Rasmus Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu, Amad and Ethan Williams scoring the goals in wet and wild conditions in the windy city.",
      "United's win also means they are the only side with a 100 percent record in the four-team Premier League Summer Series, heading into the final round of games in Atlanta on Sunday. Here are five talking points from United's comfortable win in the windy city.",
      "On the day United made their move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, the player currently leading their attack, Hojlund, provided a timely reminder of his goalscoring ability by plundering the opener.",
      "Hojlund toiled last season, managing just 12 goals in all competitions, which was one of the reasons United made recruiting a proven goalscorer their top priority in the summer transfer window, with Sesko and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins their top targets, having seen Liam Delap go to Chelsea, Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal and Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool.",
      "Hojlund may find himself surplus to requirements next season, if United get Sesko or Watkins, and may ultimately end up leaving or going out on loan, but his work-rate and desire cannot be questioned, even if he is not prolific enough to lead the line for United.",
      "After spending most of last season a hostage to injury, featuring in just 12 of United's 60 games, the new campaign is one of huge significance for Luke Shaw. Playing at left centre-back, Shaw started superbly, executing a perfectly-timed robust tackle early on to dispossess Antoine Semenyo as the Bournemouth attacker surged towards the United goal.",
      "Shaw played with confidence thereafter, surviving a scare on the half-hour when he went down after Semenyo had trodden on his left foot. Shaw came out on top in their personal battle and coming through the game and playing so impressively was a huge boost for Amorim, who described the 30-year-old as “world class” in an interview earlier on the tour and who intends for him to be a key player for him next season.",
      "“I really like this formation,” said Shaw ahead of the game. “But, honestly, I don't mind wherever the manager wants me to play. I'm happy to play anywhere. I've been playing left-centre back this pre-season and I'm just really happy to be doing this pre-season as I missed the last pre-season.”",
      "Another United player with a point to prove, after two injury-plagued seasons, was Mason Mount who, like Shaw, was handed a starting place. Like Shaw, Mount played with intensity and purpose, linking up well early on with Bruno Fernandes, the pair exchanging passes before the United skipper saw his shot saved.",
      "Mount played a role in United's opening goal after eight minutes, his clever run off the ball dragging a defender away and opening up enough space for Patrick Dorgu to pick out Rasmus Hojlund, whose glancing header beat Djordje Petrovic in the Bournemouth goal. In the 25th minute, Mount's quick-thinking led to United's second goal, after he spotted Dorgu's run and took a swift free-kick, scooping the ball high for him to run on to and dispatch beyond Petrovic. There was certainly enough in Mount's first-half display to suggest that, if he can stay fit, he can be influential for United next season.",
      "Amorim made six changes from his starting line-up from United's 2-1 win over West Ham in New Jersey in their US tour opener. The most notable absentee was Matheus Cunhaw, who was not even included in the match-day squad, after complaining of fatigue in the build-up to the game against Bournemouth.",
      "“We need to assess all the players,” said Amorim. “We have to be careful with everyone. He's available for the next one. Matheus felt a little bit fatigues. He was ready to play, he wants to give everything, but we gave to be careful.”",
      "Soldier Field, the 61,000-capacity home of NFL team the Chicago Bears, was not even half-full for United against Bournemouth and the game that preceded it between West Ham and Everton. But as the weather worsened and swirling winds were accompanied by driving rain, with no cover in any of the four stands, the attendance became even more sparse as fans decided to leave early because of the conditions.",
      "The hardy ones left behind putting on ponchos to protect themselves from the relentless showers that fell. After the searing heat of the previous week, in which the temperatures in Chicago hit the high 90s, the weather more akin to Manchester was no doubt welcomed by the players.",

      "A report from Belgium states that Villa have been in contact with the 25-year-old's representatives for several months. However, it adds that Villa would have to sell Watkins before signing Openda.",

Manchester United are said to be demanding £30m for the Brazilian winger and don't want to loan him out again after his successful spell with Betis last season.",
      "Spanish newspaper Estadio Deportivo add that Antony, 25, doesn't want to stay in the Premier League. That's despite rumoured interest from Newcastle and Nottingham Forest.",

      "United are keen to add a new striker to their squad this summer following a dire campaign last term. Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins had emerged as a target but the club’s attentions have now turned to the Slovenian.",
      "It is reported that United may have to pay around £75m (£64.6m) to convince Leipzig to sell Sesko over the coming months. And should they agree a price, it appears their chances of getting a deal done are positive given that Sesko has been left impressed by the club’s attempts to sign him.",
      "But while the signs are positive as it stands, there might be a slight bump in the road once Sesko arrives at Old Trafford when it comes to his squad number. The 22-year-old has donned the number 30 during his time with both his former club Red Bull Salzburg and his current employers RB Leipzig.",
      "And while the digit would usually be available given its unconventional nature, it’s already occupied by another summer signing. Young defender Diego Leon is its current occupant following his arrival from Cerro Porteno.",
      "That would give Sesko a dilemma over the number he chooses to wear at Old Trafford. He has worn the number 25 and 11 on the international front and as it stands, both are accommodated by Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee respectively.",
      "Another option could potentially be the number nine shirt, the number that was worn by Sesko’s hero Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Old Trafford. Speaking about the Swede, the striker said: “Zlatan Ibrahimovic was my idol.",
      "“I’m not saying I play like him but he was having fun, enjoying himself on the pitch, doing what he wanted to do. It makes me really happy when I see that kind of player. Every single video I could find, I was looking at him.”",
      "And while that could be an option for Sesko, a few things need to happen first. The digit is currently occupied by Rasmus Hojlund, who has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "But a switch is still some way off and should he remain at the club, it appears very likely that he will keeps the number for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, talks between United and Leipzig will continue.",

      "Manchester United have broken their transfer rule of opting for Premier League experience this summer after deciding to pursue Red Bull Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Ruben Amorim is desperate to equip his struggling side with proven English top-flight talent after the Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League last season.",
      "He's already added Wolves star Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, but neither player can play as an out-and-out centre forward - and Amorim has been left unimpressed by the performances of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Cunha demonstrated how important he can be as an impact player last year as he almost single-handedly saved Wolves from relegation with 15 strikes in the top flight, while Mbeumo dazzled with 20 goals for the Bees.",
      "But the signing of Sesko would not follow the same trend and would be a somewhat risky move for a player who has only proven himself in the Bundesliga.",
      "United were previously planning to go for another Premier League star to solve their striker worries in Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, but they have been put off the England man's £60m asking price.",
      "Watkins had been United's preferred option this summer after bagging 16 goals for Villa last season but they have now decided to go against their own policy by going all out for Sesko.",
      "The Slovenia international has emerged as one of the most promising talents in Europe in recent seasons after firing in 39 goals for the German side in the last two seasons.",
      "He was previously strongly linked with Arsenal before the Gunners opted to snap up Amorim's former Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres for £63.5m and that has now cleared the way for United to secure Sesko.",
      "It's understood United have opened informal talks with Leipzig over Sesko but are yet to table an official bid.",
      "He was seen as a much more viable option that Watkins because, although he is being priced similarly to the 29-year-old, he is much younger at 22 and represents long-term value.",
      "It won't be plain sailing for United in their pursuit of Newcastle, however. Newcastle are also keen on the player after Liverpool pipped them to the signing of Hugo Ekitike, with the Magpies concerned about losing Alexander Isak to the Reds too.",
      "Newcastle would be able to offer Isak Champions League football, but United showed with their signings of Cunha and Mbeumo that they still possess big club pull despite having no Europe.",

      "In the immediate aftermath of the 1-0 loss, Garnacho publicly questioned Amorim’s decision to bench him and said he would take the summer to consider his future.",
      "But Amorim has made that decision for Garnacho, deciding he is surplus to requirements, with revenue raised from his sale going towards funding a new striker.",
      "That new striker is unlikely to be Jackson, with United having prioritised a move for RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko or Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins.",
      "Chelsea have registered their interest in signing Garnacho but are not close to agreeing a deal with United, with the new season just three weeks away. Napoli were also linked with Garnacho but their interest appear to have waned over recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca shared his stance on Jackson's future, claiming that a red card at this summer's Club World Cup had not pushed him towards the exit door. The Italian said: \"No, the red card has nothing to do with Nico’s future. He had the first one against Newcastle when Liam was not even here and another one.",
      "“I’m not sure that it’s 100 per cent a red card but the referee decided for that, and Nico knows very well that in both situations (it) was not something good for the team.\"",

      "But Villa's £60million valuation of 29-year-old Watkins has proved a stumbling block to any deal being agreed for the England star, with 22-year-old Sesko seen as a more viable option given his age - even though he will cost a similar fee.",

      "It is understood United approached Villa about Watkins, but were only willing to pay in the region of £45m for him and saw their initial approach rebuffed as it fell way short of their valuation.",
      "Sources in Germany have indicated there is a gentlemen’s agreement between Leipzig and Sesko to let him leave for a fee of £60m to £70m plus add-ons - but only to select clubs.",
      "Sesko has been on United's radar for some time and their director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, could play a key role, having worked at Leipzig and the striker's former club, RB Salzburg.",
      "United had originally hoped to sign Liam Delap this summer, but the Ipswich striker moved to Chelsea instead. A number of other strikers have been considered, but Isak and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson were deemed too expensive.",

      "Manchester United have been told that Nick Pope is not for sale this summer, despite Newcastle United being on the brink of signing Aaron Ramsdale. The Red Devils have been linked with a number of shot-stoppers, as Andre Onana's future is up in the air, despite the fact they only signed him from Inter Milan two years ago in a £47.2million deal.",
      "The 29-year-old from Cameroon has made 101 appearances for United over the past two years. But he has only managed to keep 25 clean sheets, conceding 148 goals in total.",
      "The Red Devils are said to have enquired about AC Milan keeper Mike Maignan at the start of the transfer window, only for the 30-year-old to reportedly rebuff the move. An audacious loan move for Aston Villa No. 1 Emiliano Martinez was also made, however, hopes of an agreement there were quickly quashed, with Villa only considering an exceptional offer for the 2022 World Cup winner.",
      "Now, it appears as though United are eager to bring in Newcastle keeper Pope, according to talkSPORT, given his future as a starter at St James' Park is now in doubt. The Carabao Cup winners are closing in on Southampton's Ramsdale, with the Magpies having agreed a loan deal with an option to buy for the 27-year-old.",
      "It is said Eddie Howe is looking for someone to compete with Pope rather than replace him, on account of his admirable performances at St. James' Park since his arrival in 2022.",
      "Despite a deal nearing completion between Newcastle and Southampton, Ramsdale wasn't the Magpies' first-choice in terms of competition for their current No. 1.",
      "Newcastle prioritised Burnley's James Trafford for much of the window, even submitting a £31m bid for the 22-year-old who impressed in the Championship last term. However, due to a buyback clause that Manchester City inserted into their deal with Burnley when they sold him to the Clarets for £15m in 2023, Pep Guardiola's team were instead able to clinch him for £27m.",
      "Pope was in goal for most of Newcastle United's 1-0 pre-season friendly loss to the K-League XI at the Suwon World Cup Stadium on Wednesday, with Kim Jin-Kyu slotting home the winner after 36 minutes. Joe Willock's worrying looking injury late on is just another issue for the club to deal with.",
      "On top of failing to play a full-strength team for the clash, Newcastle could yet lose talisman Alexander Isak, who is open to parting ways with the club. The Swedish striker wants to explore his options elsewhere, and Liverpool seems the most likely move for Isak, but no agreement has been reached between the clubs as of yet.",
      "Elsewhere, the Red Devils have heavily relied on Altay Bayindir for their own pre-season endeavours, with Onana sidelined with a hamstring injury sustained in training earlier this summer. The 27-year-old impressed during United's 0-0 clash with Leeds earlier this month, before also playing a major part in the Red Devils' 2-1 win over West Ham on Sunday. He is also expected to start during United's game with Bournemouth at Soldier Field on Thursday, with kick off at 2.30am UK time.",
      "Whether United will continue their endeavours of looking at the prospect of signing Pope after the emergence of Newcastle's firm stance remains to be seen. But the right price could turn heads given he is in the last 12 months of his contract.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The £63.7million striker, who turned down a move to Old Trafford in favour of Arsenal, has told his ex-Sporting boss Ruben Amorim and United exactly what to expect on day one of the new Premier League season.",
      "Fresh off a solo training regime while waiting for his long transfer saga to end, Gyokeres has now joined his new Gunners team-mates in Hong Kong and insists he’s firing on all cylinders.",
      "Asked if he’ll be fit to face United on August 17, he nodded, smiled, and said: “Yeah.” Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is ready to unleash his marquee summer signing as early as Thursday’s friendly against Spurs in Hong Kong.",
      "“He’s only trained today (Wednesday), very little yesterday (Tuesday),” said Arteta. “We’ll assess tonight (Wednesday night). If the medical team are happy, there’s a chance he features.”",
      "Asked why he favoured Arsenal over United and other suitors, Gyokeres was crystal clear: “There were other clubs, of course, but this wasn’t a hard choice. I chose Arsenal.”",
      "And boss Arteta is delighted. Speaking after watching him train in front of a packed Kai Tak stadium, in Hong Kong, Arteta was even more convinced he has the right man who can cope with taking on all-comers, including United.",
      "He said: “When the news broke, and then you realise the magnitude of the club that you're going to be representing and how viral everything goes so fast in these days.",
      "\"I think his immediate reaction was, wow, and then he sees, you know, the way we were received again, the training session that we just had with 20,000 people. I think you're going to have a very good first impression, that's for sure.”",
      "Club captain Martin Odegaard is already excited by what he’s seen. He said: “I think you've all seen what he's done in his career so far. Especially the last season at Sporting, the numbers speak for themselves.",
      "\"He's a very complete player. He's physical, strong, fast, good finisher, and intelligent as well. You can also see the hunger, the energy he brings. He's only trained a few times, but you can already see the quality and the willingness.”",

      "Wayne Rooney's celebrity status has emerged as the reason behind the Manchester United legend being barred from watching his son Kai play football. The 15-year-old is the eldest child of Rooney and wife Coleen, who are also parents to three younger boys - Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai became part of the Red Devils academy in 2016, treading the same path as his iconic father who dedicated 13 years to Old Trafford and holds the club's scoring record with 253 goals.",
      "Despite being recognised as a promising talent, the young striker has informed his celebrated dad that his presence isn't welcome at matches, owing to the enormous crowds he attracts.",
      "The revelation came during Coleen's appearance on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. Prior to securing second place behind McFly vocalist Danny Jones, she shared details of her son's difficult choice with her fellow campmates, reports the Express.",
      "\"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen revealed to her jungle companions last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Despite his father's absence, Kai has continued to shine in the academy and even found the net in United's opening SuperCupNI fixture on Monday. The teenager converted from the penalty spot and mimicked the trademark celebration of Arsenal's latest acquisition, Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Following his assist for Sam O'Brien's opener against West Cork Academy, Kai confidently dispatched the spot-kick before team-mate Abdoulaye Bassirou Nkoto sealed a third.",
      "The celebration, which sees Gyokeres mask his face by weaving his fingers together, was devised whilst the Swedish striker was on his holidays, with the forward admitting his mates pushed him to devise his own goal celebration.",
      "\"Before I got it, my friends were always saying to me to find my own celebration because they were very tired of me doing all kinds of stuff when I was celebrating,\" he previously said. \"I had some time off. We went on vacation together. During that time, we came up with it after a while. We thought it looked good, and I started doing it straightaway. It felt even better on the pitch.\"",
      "Despite the existence of his ban, Rooney, 39, attended the tournament in Northern Ireland alongside his wife to keep a keen eye on their son in action. The ex-Plymouth boss spoke to BBC News NI about his son's career in the academy and the role he plays in his progression.",
      "\"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand-off approach,\" Rooney said. \"I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it – that's the main thing for me. It's a long time since I was here, but it does bring back great memories.",
      "\"The Super Cup, like many other tournaments, is a fantastic place to go away as a young person; you're away with your team-mates in a hotel together, and it's great for team building.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

A brace from Bruno Fernandes cancelled out Jarrod Bowen's strike for the London club, while new arrival Matheus Cunha also got valuable minutes under his belt.",

Philip Billing and Romain Faivre got themselves on the scoresheet for Bournemouth, while Kieron Bowie pulled one back for the Scottish side.",

In game two of the United States mini-tournament, Manchester United are set to face Bournemouth, while Everton take on West Ham.",

      "But the 30-year-old revealed last season’s prolonged spells out, due to persistent injuries, pushed him to the brink mentally like never before, as he missed 48 of United’s 60 games.",
      "“It's something I've not experienced to be honest,” said Shaw, speaking during United’s US tour. \"I know I've had a lot of injuries, but it was more mentally how tough it was. It was really tough. I won't go too much into that. I think last season it was one to forget.",
      "“It was horrible. It started with a calf and I've never had a calf injury in my life, so I was never used to that. Things just kept happening and it was really stressful, but I'm grateful that I'm here now and I feel fit.",
      "“I feel real happiness right now. I don't want to keep banging on about last season, but I couldn't have got any lower last season.",
      "“So right now I feel really good, really happy with great people around me in the team and a really good manager. I can't feel any better, to be honest. I'm really happy and I'm really looking forward to this season. I've got big ambitions this season and I'm looking to fulfil them.”",
      "After featuring for England at Euro 2024, where he started defeat in the final against Spain, Shaw missed pre-season with United and was ruled out until November.",
      "He came on as a sub in Amorim’s first three games in charge, then suffered another injury setback which saw him sidelined from December to mid-April.",
      "Shaw made his comeback towards the end of last season, but blamed himself for not being available, particularly in the final weeks of former boss Erik ten Hag’s time in charge.",
      "“I kind of felt like I let Erik down with the injuries and stuff,” said Shaw. “I wasn't there for him towards the end, and that wasn't nice. Then, when the new manager comes in and we speak about different things, different aims for the rest of the season that we had, then I get injured again.",
      "“For a lot of last season I just felt like I let a lot of people down in the club and the team, obviously because I was always injured. It was just something in my head where I found it really hard. I just put a lot of blame on myself.",
      "“I just felt that I was letting the team down not being available for a long time. But the team and the manager were really good with me. Especially the manager, he stuck by me.”",
      "Despite United’s embarrassing showing last season, Shaw is adamant they should set their sights high, rather than accepting mediocrity on the back of one miserable campaign. After last season, it might sound a bit ridiculous, but we want to be winning the Premier League,” said Shaw.",
      "“We should have those ambitions. Not just me individually, but the whole team. We all have to have the same ambitions and all push for that. Like I said, it can sound ridiculous because last season was so bad.",
      "“But we’re Manchester United and we need to be having those aims, otherwise there's no point in being here, you know? I think it's the biggest club in the world and it needs to have the biggest ambitions.”",

      "Manchester United were at rock bottom after losing in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat against Tottenham at the Estadio de San Mames meant a trophy was not salvaged from the club's worst season in 51 years. It also meant there would be no European football at Old Trafford in 2025/2026.",
      "Pundits suggested the consequences would be grave, while the fans of rival Premier League clubs said United would struggle to attract new signings in the summer transfer window.",
      "Although United must make a few high-quality signings to consider the summer a success, the window isn't unfolding like some pundits and rival supporters suggested it would.",
      "\"Who would want to join United?\" they asked. Matheus Cunha was linked with other clubs, but the Brazilian wanted a move to Old Trafford and his transfer from Wolves was straightforward.",
      "During Cunha's unveiling interview, he said: “It is the most common phrase that you can say at this moment, but this is the dream come true. Maybe outside, I think maybe my decision, they don’t understand. But when you have always dreamed to play here, it’s easier to pick this decision.",
      "“For me, no-one else is like United. Of course, I know it’s been a hard season for everyone. I think my decision shows what this club is for me, and what I believe this club can be.",
      "“It is hard to find a way to explain this club for me. My house didn’t have the channel to watch the Premier League. My cousin’s house didn’t have the channel. He’s older than me and he supports United and he showed me the way, to start to watch the Premier League and to need to support United.\"",
      "Then Bryan Mbeumo arrived from Brentford for £65million and £6m in add-ons. United said Mbeumo made it clear from the outset his desire to join and never budged from that position, despite the feeling that Brentford wanted the forward to join Newcastle or Tottenham.",
      "Mbeumo was also linked to Arsenal, but again, was adamant about moving to United. “Manchester is a big club. I think it’s a great opportunity. I’m someone who likes a challenge. There is a very good project in Manchester and I wanted to be part of it,\" he said in the USA this week.",
      "\"He [Amorim] said, ‘We are people who like winning, and we want to be the best team’, and of course that’s what we will try to do. It was a very friendly conversation and a constructive one.",
      "\"He explained his project to me, what he wanted to do and I really clicked on that. Of course I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects but the Manchester United one was very good for me.”",
      "Old Trafford was another pull. “You want to play on the greatest stages in the world, and Old Trafford is one of them, so being able to play here every two weeks is just big,\" said Mbeumo.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo received interest from elsewhere and both pushed for transfers to United, despite the club having just suffered its worst season in modern history. Why? The answer is pretty simple.",
      "United are a giant football club, one of the biggest in the world, and the attraction of representing a club steeped in rich history and tradition is still enough to turn the head of some players.",
      "That pull can only go so far, of course. There needs to be a project, a convincing manager and big wages offered to attract the best, but this summer has proven United's reputation still means something.",
      "That reputation may also help United sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, despite the striker having been identified as Newcastle's priority target amid uncertainty with Alexander Isak.",
      "Sesko is believed to prefer a move to Manchester instead of St. James' Park. Eddie Howe's side have finished above United for successive seasons, they have just won the Carabao Cup and will play in the Champions League again, but the indication is Sesko prefers a switch to United.",
      "Manchester United have endured a train wreck 12 months - but are still hugely attractive.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "With Manchester United in discussions for a new No.9, the incumbent got two goals against Bournemouth. Rasmus Hojlund charged around like a bull in Chicago.",
      "Hojlund's deft header in the eighth minute was smart striker play he is not synonymous with. Bournemouth were seemingly thrown by Patrick Dorgu crossing with his right foot and crossing well. Hojlund neatly helped the ball on its way.",
      "As meaninglessly as these games are judged, they have to be meaningful for the players. That was apparent with Hojlund's celebration, identical to when he equalised at Bournemouth in added time in late April.",
      "His evening did not start auspiciously. He kept his place but his mood was not improved by a recall for Diogo Dalot, fast becoming Hojlund's scourge. Hojlund was demonstrative with Dalot with less than four minutes on the clock, piqued that he had not read his heavy lay-off. Dalot nevertheless congratulated his teammate on his goal.",
      "In the 51st minute, there was a bullish high-ten from Dalot for Hojlund after he was crudely fouled. Hojlund got a similar amount of contact for his second goal yet was not immediately enveloped by his teammates. Amad's shot grazed Hojlund's shin and both claimed the glory. As it stands, it is credited to Amad.",
      "While United are in dialogue with RB Leipzig goalscorer Benjamin Sesko, Hojlund has to view his own situation as win-win. No Sesko means he continues at the tip of the arrow. If Sesko comes in, Hojlund can create a wider market for himself. Inter Milan enquired about his availability at the start of the transfer window.",
      "There was a Danish theme to United's win, with Dorgu notching his first senior goal for the club. Dorgu has been quietly effective and more attack-minded across all three friendlies. A left back by trade, Dorgu is developing into the pure winger that Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system demands of the wide roles.",
      "New Bournemouth goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic was flimsy for Dorgu's dink though it was a smartly-worked goal, instigated by Mason Mount's quick-thinking with a quickly-taken free kick. Dorgu invited it with his sudden charge into the final third.",
      "United look fitter than at this stage in past pre-seasons. Every starter bar Harry Maguire, withdrawn at the interval, played for 70 minutes. Maguire's replacement, Matthijs de Ligt, put through his own net late on.",
      "The Premier League opposition in this Summer Series appears to have reinforced United's focus. West Ham and Bournemouth both beat United last season. The intensity and edge about United was best exhibited by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "He sprinted back to block a cross before berating the referee for awarding a corner. Teammates were quick to congratulate Fernandes, unrelenting in his criticism of official Lewis Smith. That was in the 69th minute and marked his final contribution.",
      "Amorim downplayed the strength of the United side against West Ham last week and there were six changes in the Windy City. United still have the wind in their sails, with two wins out of two in the States.",
      "This handsome friendly win was replete with an academy goal from a newbie. Ethan Williams, one of ten substitutes to emerge, scored within two minutes of his first senior appearance. Williams, a winger, has inherited Chido Obi's old squad number and his finish was akin to a striker's.",
      "United were without both of their senior summer recruits as Matheus Cunha sat out the game due to fatigue. He is expected to be fit for the final tour match against Everton on Sunday in Atlanta, where Bryan Mbeumo is scheduled to appear, most likely from the bench.",
      "The main dampener on United's pre-season on Wednesday evening was the Chicago weather. There were more ponchos than replica shirts at Soldier Field and the United players' red replicas were so saturated from the swirling rain they turned blood red.",
      "Luke Shaw was one of the six players recalled, slotting in on the left of the back three. He does not have the durability to be entrusted with the left wing role and he may be at the back of the queue at centre back when Lisandro Martinez ends his rehabilitation.",
      "Amorim generously dubbed Shaw \"world class\" last week. \"He understands the problems I had last season were really tough,\" Shaw said on Tuesday. \"It's something I've not experienced, to be honest. I know I've had a lot of injuries, but it was more mentally how tough it was. It was really tough. I think last season was one to forget really. Like I said, I've had injuries in the past, but last season it was different kinds of injuries.",
      "\"It was horrible. To be fair, it started with a calf and I've never had a calf injury in my life, so I was never used to that. It was just a completely different rehab and stuff. Things just kept happening. It was really stressful.\"",
      "Shaw was anything but with a couple of well-read recovery tackles. He required treatment from the physio following an impact injury but soldiered on at Soldier Field.",
      "So is Hojlund.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Thursday, July 31.",
      "Those of you who decided to stay up overnight may well be feeling tired but shall be delighted with what you witnessed in Chicago. United continued their unbeaten start to pre-season with an exceptional 4-1 victory against AFC Bournemouth.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring, before Patrick Dorgu, Amad and youngster Ethan Williams added gloss to the scoreline. The only blotch on the performance was an own goal from Matthijs de Ligt but it would do little to dampen the enthusiasm for that display.",
      "Away from pre-season, United's main focus is now a move for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. The Reds are advancing their approach for the Slovenian after discovering that the pursuit of Ollie Watkins was unlikely to be fruitful.",
      "The determination to sign Sesko has led to questions over Hojlund's future which Amorim addressed in Chicago overnight.",
      "Take a look at all the United news, views and rumours in our dedicated blog below",
      "According to Football Insider, United are looking into the possibility of selling players to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "While no exact names have been mentioned in relation to being sold, Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have all requested to leave Old Trafford.",
      "The Middle East has become synonymous with big wages but now also big transfer fees with Chelsea banking £43.7m for Joao Felix.",
      "One brief worry for United fans waking up this morning is that new signing Cunha was not in the squad that beat Bournemouth.",
      "Fans will remember last summer that Leny Yoro picked up a severe injury during the pre-season tour of the US and United do not need history repeating itself.",
      "Thankfully, Amorim explained Cunha's absence and it is nothing too serious.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "With the pursuit of Sesko now intensifying, that only adds to the speculation surrounding the future of Hojlund.",
      "Since arriving at the club, the Dane has been the first choice centre-forward and whether his performances have merited that position or not is up for debate.",
      "What isn't up for debate is that this move to try and sign Sesko will clearly lead Hojlund to question whether he is best sticking at United and fighting for his place, or moving elsewhere.",
      "Yesterday, MEN Sport brought you the news that Benjamin Sesko was now United's top target in the summer transfer window.",
      "United had been weighing up whether to target him over Ollie Watkins.",
      "However, Villa are adamant that Watkins will be remaining at their club and thus United have decided to turn their attention to Sesko.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "Nicolas Jackson has flattered to deceive at Chelsea.",
      "Last season, he averaged a goal every three Premier League matches which is hardly the sort of return that shall spark unparalleled excitement.",
      "He is still at the early stages of his career but is two years older than Sesko.",
      "In truth, choosing not to sign Jackson is perhaps no bad thing.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United currently have no interest in swapping Garnacho with Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "Chelsea are thought to still be interested in a move for Garnacho.",
      "However, there is no desire from the Reds to bring in Jackson as part of that deal.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "If he were to leave after suddenly becoming surplus to requirements, a move to Italy has been highly talked about.",
      "Hojlund's standing in Serie A remains high after his performances for Atalanta.",
      "Inter were credited with interest previously, as have Juventus as they look to replace Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "From the end of last season, talk has been rife about the future of Hojlund with the striker asked on international duty if he was set to leave.",
      "He replied then that his plan was to be at United this season and that was all he is focused on.",
      "This stance has been reflected on the rumour mill too with journalist Fabrizio Romano among those to state that his preference is to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking to the assembled media in the US, Ruben Amorim was unable to give any guarantees that Hojlund would be staying at United beyond this summer.",
      "He explained:",
      "I am really happy with Rasmus. I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing. The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "Hello and welcome to the United transfer blog this Thursday morning.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through until lunchtime with all the latest United news.",
      "We shall start with reaction to the victory over Bournemouth where the latest on this man's future was discussed...",
      "RB Leipzig are demanding a fee of £64million plus add-ons as well as a sell-on percentage for a deal for Benjamin Sesko, as per The Athletic.",
      "Manchester United have made Sesko their first-choice striker option and want to agree a deal for the Slovenian before the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick has admitted he has been monitoring Marcus Rashford's career for some time now, following his summer loan move from Manchester United.",
      "Speaking in a press conference on Wednesday, Flick said: \"Rashford? I've been following him for many years, ever since he started his career at Man United. We hope he can show his quality this season.\"",
      "Speaking to Boyle Sports, Louis Saha has urged former club Manchester United to make a move for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez this summer.",
      "Emiliano Martinez is a winner, he's a leader, he's got character. He will definitely provide this kind of balance that sometimes Andre Onana didn’t show last season.",
      "Yes, he's a confident goalkeeper, Onana, but he made too many mistakes. It doesn't mean that Emiliano is not going to make any mistakes because that position is very fragile.",
      "Last year, I have never seen any goalkeeper go through that at Manchester United or at any of the big clubs, it was horrific to see and I'm sure that he understands what people were saying. I think the competition is going to be healthy.",
      "He needs to realise for his career that he needs to do better and that those types of performance are almost unacceptable.",
      "Manchester United remain interested in signing a goalkeeper and made an enquiry about Paris Saint-Germain No.1 Gianluigi Donnarumma earlier in the summer, according to The Telegraph.",
      "PSG are in the process of signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and the Ligue 1 side are believed to be braced for United renewing their interest in Donnarumma once that deal is complete.",
      "Chelsea are still pushing to sign Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho this summer, talkSPORT understands.",
      "Garnacho, 21, is keen on the move to Stamford Bridge but United are pushing for a deal of at least £40million.",
      "The Argentine has long looked destined to leave United in this transfer window, with the Reds keen to offload him.",
      "Manchester United head of scouting Christopher Vivell appears to be pushing the club's move for Benjamin Sesko, according to Sky Sport Germany.",
      "It's claimed that Vivell is 'very eager' to bring Sesko, 22, to Manchester this summer, after Ruben Amorim wanted Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins instead.",
      "United have already held talks with Sesko's camp and there is a feeling at Leipzig that Sesko would choose the Reds ahead of Newcastle United and other alternatives.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr have made a bid to sign Antony from Manchester United, according to Foot Mercato.",
      "The 25-year-old, who scored nine times and provided five assists in 26 appearances during a successful loan spell at Real Betis last season, is expected to leave United on a permanent deal this summer.",
      "Betis are keen to re-sign the Brazilian and Atletico Madrid have expressed an interest, but it's Al-Nassr who have made the latest move to secure his services.",
      "It's unclear how much the Saudi outfit have offered, but Antony could reunite with former United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo in the Middle East.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Nick Pope may end up on United's radar after Newcastle moved to add a new shot stopper on Tuesday.",
      "It is understood a deal has been reached for Newcastle to loan Southampton's Aaron Ramsdale this season.",
      "With Ramsdale arriving, Newcastle will likely need to part ways with a goalkeeper of their own and Pope may well be available on loan for United who have a limited budget for a new goalkeeper.",
      "He explained:",
      "It seems now that Amorim is identifying the players that he does not want in the squad - that's a positive. I do like, on paper, the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo. Why do I like them? A couple of reasons, well three actually. One, they have got Premier League experience. They look more like the United style of players, a bit more pace and power, and the ability to have that physicality to get from box-to-box. When you look at Garnacho, Sancho and Antony they are more 'jinkers'. I have always thought at United you need players who can open their legs up and sort of stretch teams - Cunha and Mbeumo do that. And the other thing I like is that they have not proved themselves at the highest level yet - in the Premier League or European level - so they should be desperate and hungry to play on a huge stage like Old Trafford. And that hunger has not always been there in the last ten years.",
      "Further to the news that United are advancing on a move for Sesko, his agent has always kept the door open for him in the north west.",
      "Despite rejecting the Reds in favour of RB Leipzig three years ago, Sesko's agent Elvis Basanovic has regularly attended Carrington.",
      "United did enquire about Gyokeres this summer but he had his heart set on a move to Arsenal who were also thought to be keen on Sesko earlier in the window.",
      "United are advancing with a potential move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Villa remain adamant Ollie Watkins is not for sale and United have received encouragement to pursue Sesko instead.",
      "Sesko, 22, is actually younger than United's current number nine, Rasmus Hojlund, and the Slovenia international has scored a modest 27 goals in 64 Bundesliga games.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "If Sesko has indeed decided that United is going to be his next club and the recruitment team are making him their priority, that is huge news for the Reds.",
      "There was a concern that United may struggle to lure the players they needed to Old Trafford without Champions League football.",
      "And yet, time and time again, the lure of United seems to be working as strong as ever before.",
      "It appears that the move for Sesko this summer is starting to take shape.",
      "Now, The Athletic's David Ornstein understands that United are now in favour of signing the Slovenian if they are to bring a striker to the club this summer.",
      "United are understood to be unwilling to spend what they believe Villa would want to bring Watkins to Old Trafford so their focus is now Sesko.",
      "It is thought that RB Leipzig will be looking for between £69m and £78m for the striker.",
      "Following on from the report that Sesko prefers a move to United, the Daily Mail understands that Newcastle are beginning to accept they wont sign the forward.",
      "It is claimed that there is a feeling in the north east that United will complete a deal for the Slovenian.",
      "They do add that this could mean the door opens for their own move for Watkins this summer.",
      "According to former footballer turned journalist Jan Aage Fjortoft, Sesko has decided on his next club.",
      "Thankfully for Reds fans, it is good news as it appears the Slovenian wants United.",
      "It is believed that RB Leipzig's talisman understands Newcastle can offer him Champions League football but he wishes to move to Old Trafford.",
      "In contrast to the reports from Tuesday, United are claimed to have opened talks to sign Donnarumma this summer.",
      "Sports Zone understands that United have contacted PSG over the availability of the goalkeeper.",
      "This comes as PSG have made progress to sign Lille’s Lucas Chevalier recently.",
      "Sadly for fans hoping that United would be able to bring him in, it seems Donnarumma's move to Old Trafford could be a non-starter.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano in his GiveMeSport column, the Italian is not currently on United's list of potential targets.",
      "Romano claims that no contact has been made but the Reds are considering signing a new goalkeeper.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog this Wednesday afternoon.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the next four hours of United news and gossip.",
      "First off, we are going to start with the latest on this man...",
      "Wayne Rooney believes the next few weeks of the transfer window are huge for United.",
      "Rooney has told the Belfast Telegraph:",
      "I think it’s a huge few weeks before the start of the Premier League to see if they can get any more players in, what players they can get in, and players out as well – probably more importantly.",
      "Antony has reportedly rejected two offers due to wanting a Real Betis return.",
      "Spanish sports newspaper Estadio Deportivo [via Sport Witness] claims the winger does not want to stay in the Premier League despite reputed interest from Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest. Antony is also said to want a move still within Europe."

    "body": [
      "The success of Manchester United's summer transfer window will not solely be judged by the players they bring into the club but the ones they sell and, crucially, the amount received for them.",
      "Marcus Rashford's exit to Barcelona seemed inevitable and while a loan deal was not ideal, it did manage to get a high earner off the wage bill. Despite Rashford's departure being a good start, there are still four players remaining at the club who want out.",
      "Antony, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and, crucially, Alejandro Garnacho are awaiting a new start that has yet to arrive. The latter's future is so crucial because of the pure profit value his sale would represent.",
      "Garnacho was bought for a minimal fee and thus, United would bank nearly the entirety of his eventual transfer sum in the form of profit. That money can then be used to fund their transfer ambitions for the remainder of the window - chief of which is signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "The difficulty for United is that Garnacho has narrowed down the pool of clubs he would be happy to join. His ambition is to remain in the Premier League, understandably. Unfortunately for him, Chelsea are the only club who seem to be showing genuine interest.",
      "One route to completing that transfer has now been closed off though. MEN Sport understands that United have no interest in entertaining a swap deal which would see Nicolas Jackson arrive at Old Trafford while Garnacho would go in the opposite direction to Chelsea.",
      "On the face of things, this is a wise idea. Jackson has not set the world alight at Stamford Bridge and United sure do not need another striker who is struggling to find his feet in the Premier League.",
      "However, the true success of this decision shall be measured, and ultimately rests entirely on, the ability to bring Sesko to United. If the Slovenian does not arrive in the summer window, the Reds shall remain without a new centre-forward and will have to rely on Rasmus Hojlund to lead the line again.",
      "It is unclear whether or not Jackson would be an upgrade on Hojlund but the Reds are clearly going down the Sesko route so they must now get the job done and bring him to Old Trafford.",

      "There was an inevitability that Manchester United would return to Benjamin Sesko's door.",
      "Liam Delap chose Chelsea, Viktor Gyokeres wanted Arsenal, Alexander Isak is out of their reach and Aston Villa are digging their heels in over Ollie Watkins.",
      "Sesko would be the biggest risk of the lot. He was born in 2003, played in Austria and has an underwhelming goalscoring record in one of Europe's top five leagues. That sounds familiar. The 22-year-old Sesko is actually younger than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "When United explored the possibility of signing Sesko in 2022, it was as one for the future. They effectively settled with that profile for Hojlund a year later, albeit as a starter. Pairing them does not add up.",
      "Hojlund would likely have to make way if Sesko comes in. There is an argument that United should actually keep Hojlund and seek a buyer for Joshua Zirkzee, more affordable, not an out-and-out striker and with a marginally higher stock after a respectable calendar year.",
      "But the noises from the United hierarchy about Hojlund are so damning that his card is marked. He is also part of the old regime, signed in dubious circumstances when he switched to the same agent as Erik ten Hag on the eve of his £72million transfer in July 2023.",
      "Sesko could command a higher fee. United sources promised they would only sign Bryan Mbeumo for a \"sensible\" fee. £65million for a proven Premier League forward with 20 league goals last season just about qualified. Delap had a £30m release clause.",
      "Sesko has played one club game in England and that was nearly three years ago. He does not have a record that justifies his reputed £79m value: 27 goals in 64 Bundesliga games for RB Leipzig. United baulked at the £30m Red Bull Salzburg demanded for Sesko in 2022.",
      "He would have a senior support cast to ease the burden: Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Bruno Fernandes, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo et al. But a United striker is judged on goals and Sesko would be entering a team reeling from its worst season in 51 years.",
      "Leipzig finished seventh in the Bundesliga last season. United are targeting a top-six finish in the Premier League. European qualification is essential, at the very least. Sesko would need broad shoulders.",
      "United are starting to scramble around for that new No.9. Sesko is a similar profile to Delap in that they were born three months apart and he has potentially excellent attributes. The crucial difference is, unlike Mbeumo and Cunha, he has no Premier League experience.",
      "\"You can understand if you look at our team last year, we need also experience,\" Ruben Amorim cautioned. \"Young players, because Matheus is young, still, but with experience. And then you watch every weekend, Matheus doing things against the players that you are going to face, that can help you to have more certainty when you choose players.",
      "\"So that was a policy that we tried to use this season. So I can say yes. It's not just that, because they have characteristics that we need, but we focus on getting players that can come here, and to face this kind of pressure, like you said, since the first day.\"",
      "Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has been a guest of United's at Carrington and Old Trafford on multiple occasions since his client rejected the club three years ago. This time, Sesko could be at United's door.",

      "Just as they did against West Ham United in New Jersey last weekend, United started with a spring in their step, getting their noses in front after just eight minutes when Hojlund headed in Dorgu's cross.",
      "The wing-back then scored a goal of his own just under 20 minutes later, latching onto a quick free-kick from Mason Mount. Amad increased United's lead not long after half-time, tucking the ball home from close range, before Williams buried a fine finish immediately after coming off the bench.",

      "Hojlund's deft header in the eighth minute was smart striker play he is not synonymous with. Bournemouth were seemingly thrown by Patrick Dorgu crossing with his right foot and crossing well. Hojlund neatly helped the ball on its way.",
      "As meaninglessly as these games are judged, they have to be meaningful for the players. That was apparent with Hojlund's celebration, identical to when he equalised at Bournemouth in added time in late April.",

      "How that wasn't a foul on Casemiro, I have no idea; he was dragged to the turf.",
      "Shaw is back on the pitch and is continuing after that minor scare.",
      "Bournemouth are denied a goal back from Semenyo because of an offside flag. In fairness to the linesman, he put his flag up straight away.",
      "Meanwhile, Shaw is had to come off to get some treatment after initially going down injured. It looks like it could be a dead let for him.",
      "Right on cue there! Poor from the 'keeper but Dorgu's run was positive, he hit the target and he got a goal. He has been a lot more attack-minded in pre-season (he was quite bright in Stockholm) and now he has got some noteworthy contributions to show for his efforts."

      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is firmly in the spotlight on Thursday morning after his goal against AFC Bournemouth in the 4-1 pre-season victory.",
      "The Dane opened the scoring inside eight minutes as his glancing header from Patrick Dorgu's cross set United on their way. His goal was crucial in more ways than one, considering hours earlier, the news broke that the Reds are advancing in their pursuit of RB Leipzig centre-forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Should the Slovenian arrive, it is expected that he will be the first choice leaving Hojlund's role at the club potentially in danger. With this in mind, MEN Sport has rounded up the latest news surrounding the striker.",
      "Speaking after the victory against Bournemouth, Amorim explained that he was unsure whether Hojlund's future was at Old Trafford or not. \"I am really happy with Rasmus,\" the Portuguese head coach admitted.",

      "\"He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed.\"",

The Aston Villa centre-forward was seen as the preferred option due to his experience in the Premier League but there was an admission that he could cost outside of United's spending capacity.",
      "Leipzig are believed to be wanting between £69m and £78m for Sesko which would be a considerable outlay for a player having already spent big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With the speculation building, United fans have taken to social media to plead with the 22-year-old to join.",
      "Sesko has not posted since May but that has not stopped the Reds' fanbase trying to sell the striker the dream. One wrote: \"Sesko, Cunha, Mbeumo, Bruno [Fernandes], [Manuel] Ugarte, [Kobbie] Mainoo, [Mathijs] De Ligt, [Leny] Yoro. What a team this could be.\"",
      "Another added: \"Come to United bro. It's going to change your career.",

      "Manchester United are advancing with a potential move for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. Ruben Amorim's side are in the market for a new No.9 and Sesko, 22, has emerged as their preferred option.",
      "Ollie Watkins had been considered, but Aston Villa remain insistent that the England international is not for sale. Indeed, United have shifted their focus to Sesko, who scored 21 goals in 45 matches last season.",
      "Sesko signed a five-year contract at Leipzig last summer and his new deal came with the understanding that if an elite club - by his definition - offered in the region of £69million to £78m, the German side would allow him to leave.",
      "If United sign Sesko, he would complete a 'dream' front three and attacking line-up for Ruben Amorim next season. The former Red Bull Salzburg forward would come in and lead the line with Rasmus Hojlund acting as the back-up.",
      "Behind Sesko would be the two attacking midfielders in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. First, Matheus Cunha would slot into the left No.10 position following his £62.5m move from Wolves last month.",
      "Cunha, 26, netted 17 times and provided six assists in 36 appearances for Vitor Pereira's side in 2024/25 and is going to bring some more attacking flair and creative spark to United's front line.",
      "Alongside Cunha in the right No.10 position would be another new signing, this time Bryan Mbeumo after he completed a £65m plus add-ons move to Old Trafford earlier this month.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, found the net on 20 occasions and added nine assists in 42 matches for Brentford last season and would add some proven Premier League class, like Cunha, to United's attack.",
      "Bruno Fernandes therefore would drop back into central midfield alongside one of Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo. Patrick Dorgu and Amad Diallo would be used as the two wing-backs.",
      "With Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo as United's new-look dream front three, Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount would provide support from the bench and come in when required.",
      "That would leave Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho to be sold before the end of the summer transfer window. It was reported on Tuesday that United were willing to sell Garnacho for around £30m, while Antony and Sancho are expected to depart the Reds in the coming weeks.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed the appointment of two senior staff members.",
      "Mike Sansoni has joined the club as director of data, following 11 years with the Mercedes F1 team. He will report to Omar Berrada and will 'transform the club’s capabilities in data and artificial intelligence'.",
      "Sansoni was previously the senior performance engineer at Mercedes and contributed to eight world championship-winning seasons. United have announced that Sansoni will be tasked with establishing the club as a data-led organisation, embedding predictive and AI-driven decision-making.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand magazine in December, Sir Jim Ratcliffe slammed the data department at Old Trafford. “Until we are as good as anyone in the world, then it’s not good enough for Manchester United. We must have the best recruitment in the world,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"Data analysis comes alongside recruitment. It doesn’t really exist here. We’re still in the last century on data analysis here. There’s immense amount of useful data that we can get from data analysis and we’re in the 'very poor' bracket with data analysis here. These things don’t happen overnight.",
      "“You can’t just flick a light switch and sort out recruitment. It’s all about people and we need to find the right people.”",
      "Sansoni will be supported by further appointments, with United announcing further recruitment is planned into a number of data, software and platform engineering roles in the coming months.",
      "United have also confirmed the appointment of Kirstin Furberas as people director, a role in which Furberas will 'take the lead in developing and evolving the club’s workforce and people culture'.",
      "Furberas is set to join United in the autumn following five years in the same role at Channel 4. She had previous spells with BBC Worldwide and 20th Century Fox, and has experience in sport as a non-executive director of British Wheelchair Basketball and previously at the London Football Association.",

      "Slovenia head coach Matjaz Kek is likely to be delighted that Manchester United are advancing with a move for Benjamin Sesko after previously warning him against a transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Sesko is the priority for United this summer as they look to strengthen their attack. Aston Villa are adamant that Ollie Watkins is not for sale and at the risk of being drawn into another lengthy battle, they have decided to pivot to the Slovenian.",
      "The 22-year-old has previously been compared to Erling Haaland due to his profile and similar routes in professional football. With RB Leipzig having missed out on the Champions League, it seemed only a matter of time before Sesko was set to leave and a gentleman's agreement between the player, his agent and the club could allow him to depart for as little as £69m.",
      "Earlier in the window, Sesko was linked with a number of clubs including Arsenal and Al Hilal. But the forward was given a firm warning by his international manager not to move to the Middle East at this stage of his career.",
      "Speaking to the media in June, Kek said: \"Benjamin Sesko and Saudi Arabia? I would advise him to never go there.",
      "\"At least not at his age. This [the interest] is a great recognition, these are clubs that mean a lot.",
      "\"It's not that I underestimate the Saudi Arabia league, on the contrary, I worked there at Al Ittihad and the club is still a part of me. I also watch the league regularly but the time will come for Sesko for that.",
      "\"I am convinced that Benjamin himself and the people who care for him will be smart enough to find a solution. And that is for him to go somewhere where he can play football, because that is the only way he can be happy.\"",
      "Such a solution looks to be forthcoming in the form of United and if they pull this off, it will be seen as a major coup for the Reds.",

      "United beat West Ham 2-1 in their opening game of the Premier League Summer Series, but they could have easily been three up by half-time and should have won by a much bigger margin. Ruben Amorim will be pleased with his side's first outing of the tour and will be looking to build on that display against Bournemouth.",
      "Amorim could look to make changes against Bournemouth but Altay Bayindir is likely to start in goal with Andre Onana still recovering from injury. United's first-choice back three is still undecided, but there's every chance it could be Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven. The trio have never played as a back three but they could start against the Cherries.",
      "Diogo Dalot played 25 minutes against West Ham so could be given a start to help him build up his fitness, while Manuel Ugarte was excellent against the Hammers and deserves to start. Kobbie Mainoo could start alongside him after his excellent display last weekend, but a dilemma further up the pitch could mean Amorim drops Bruno Fernandes back into midfield to allow others a chance to stake their claim to be one of the two No.10s.",
      "Patrick Dorgu can start on the left, with Amad and Matheus Cunha playing as the No.10s. Amad started at right wing-back against West Ham and there's a chance that could be his settled position moving forward. With Bryan Mbeumo potentially set to feature against Everton, this could be Amad's chance to show why he should be starting behind the striker.",

      "But, according to former footballer and now journalist Jan Aage Fjortoft, Sesko has decided he 'wants' a move to Old Trafford. While he acknowledges that Newcastle would allow him to compete in the Champions League this season, his desire is to play for United.",
      "Meanwhile, the Daily Mail understands that there is a feeling in the Newcastle camp that Sesko is on his way to Ruben Amorim's team despite their best efforts to convince him to join the Reds. The Magpies are believed to be looking elsewhere now with Watkins thought to be on their radar.",

      "A new striker is a priority for Ruben Amorim, and although the club has opened ‘formal talks’ with Openda’s Leipzig teammate Benjamin Sesko, a report on Wednesday claimed the move for Sesko is being ‘driven’ by head of recruitment Christopher Vivell, with Amorim ‘preferring’ Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘Sesko is one of two active options for Manchester United along with Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins, though talkSPORT understands Ruben Amorim would prefer the latter.",
      "‘Villa don’t wish to sell the England striker, but United may still persist with talks and even test that resolve with a bid.",
      "‘They have not yet ruled out making a formal offer, albeit one below Villa’s £60m valuation.",
      "‘There remains internal debate at United as to whether to opt for proven Premier League experience or a younger No.9 with a high ceiling such as Sesko.’",
      "MORE ASTON VILLA COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Transfer rumour ranking: Man Utd eye Man City keeper while arguing over strikers\n👉 Man Utd tipped to sign ‘very good’ £80m Chelsea star with Aston Villa another possibility\n👉 Man Utd, Aston Villa, bad maths and Ollie Watkins ‘better than nothing’",
      "Should Amorim get his way and land Watkins, that opens the door for Newcastle to sign Sesko, who is their top target to replace Alexander Isak amid interest from Liverpool in the Sweden international.",
      "Sesko is said to be leaning towards a move to Old Trafford over St James’ Park, but is also thought to be open to joining Newcastle.",
      "And the Magpies signing Sesko would then ‘open doors’ that are at this stage firmly shut for Liverpool to sign Isak.",
      "Newcastle’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) owners have told Isak to ‘report back to training’ next week ‘and play in either the Espanyol game or clash with Atletico Madrid’ as they are ‘angry at the prospect of waiting around for Liverpool to drum up the funds to sign their star man’.",
      "That’s according to Chronicle Live, who claim ‘Isak knows the score’, with the Swede ‘expected to fulfil his duties as a Newcastle player as soon as this trip is done’.",

      "This is a summer which has really exposed the difference between the haves and have nots. Why should Newcastle bow to Liverpool and Isak?",
      "According to reports, there are four reasons behind Alexander Isak ‘doubting Newcastle United’s project’ as they are targeting three ‘top signings’."

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Stefan Ortega – Manchester City to Manchester United\nThe story goes that United have enquired about Ortega now he’s been relegated to third choice at City by James Trafford’s arrival. That’s as far as it has gone, and as far as it is ever likely to.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Juventus\nThe Old Lady are the latest to throw their hat in the ring for Nunez, who was previously a target for Napoli. Liverpool have been keen to sell the Uruguayan striker for a while, but they are even more eager now that Alexander Isak is available. It doesn’t alter the fact that neither Juve nor Milan can afford what Liverpool are hoping to get.",

      "18) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nFootball Insider’s Mick Brown is hearing things again, folks. Guehi to Liverpool could accelerate following Luis Diaz’s transfer to Bayern, apparently. The Crystal Palace captain’s “heart is set” on a move to Anfield, says the ex-Manchester United chief scout, who remains very well-connected within the game. FI’s words, not ours.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Borussia Dortmund\nThe Gunners man is on Dortmund’s list of winger targets, with Jadon Sancho also under consideration. Arsenal could reinvest some of the money into Rodrygo, which means their supporters are bang up for this.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Samu Aghehowa – Porto to Aston Villa\nThe Spain international has also been linked with Newcastle but it’s Villa being mentioned as a potential destination for Aghehowa. One problem: Porto are using the Viktor Gyokeres fee as a benchmark and they want £55million. Which is more a less one whole Ollie Watkins.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa \nUnited are said to have spoken to Chelsea and Villa in an effort to lump Garnacho in as part of a deal to sign a striker. Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins. Regardless, there is a deal to be done here.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "11) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim?",
      "F365 SAYS: Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again",
      "",
      "6) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters. The worst-case summer scenario for Newcastle could become a grim reality.",
      "",
      "5) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle and Liverpool are currently at a stand-off, with Isak in the middle. Newcastle have received no bid yet, and the Reds are holding fire, knowing that time only increases the pressure on the Magpies. They are still intent on digging in, even if it means convincing Isak to stay for one more season, and are unlikely to sanction a sale without having a replacement sorted first. Sesko is their top target, but Man United are also there.. Given Isak left it so late to declare his wishes and Liverpool have already signed a striker in his place, it is easy to imagine this being kicked down the road until next summer. For now we wait until Liverpool show their hand.",

      "3) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "2)  Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms and a fee agreed. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "1) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, Ramsdale is having a medical on Thursday before the Toon pay £4million to borrow him for the season with the option of a more permanent arrangement.",

      "Liverpool are in the process of what many believe to be the transfer window of all transfer windows in the Premier League era to bolster a title-winning squad. But how does it rank among other excellent summer offerings?",
      "A whimsical, some would say pointless, question that absolutely cannot be answered now before those new Liverpool players have kicked a ball for Liverpool, but that’s not stopped the Premier League website from setting a poll for biased fans of major clubs to torpedo and render almost entirely uninteresting, nor us from reordering said list of windows into the unimpeachable top 11 (why 11? don’t know).",
      "We’ve included the percentages from the poll, which has predictably seen the 2025/2026 windows of two clubs voted for more than the other eight options combined…",
      "",
      "11) Arsenal: 2025/2026 (14%)\nNotable signings: Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard",
      "We wonder whether any of what we assume was a huge majority of Arsenal fans voting for this to rank as the second-greatest Premier League transfer window of all-time also signed the #NOTOMADUEKE petition a few weeks ago, or were #KROENKEOUT before signing the striker reported to be their second choice in favour of a guy who looks like he might join actual Manchester United.",
      "",
      "10) Leicester: 2015/2016 (4%)\nNotable signings: Shinji Okazaki, N’Golo Kante, Gokhan Inler, Robert Huth, Christian Fuchs",
      "Funny this, because without Kante this window wouldn’t be in the top 50, and yet it’s absolutely deserving of a place here because they did sign him, for under £8m.",
      "Okazaki, Huth and Fuchs all deserve their flowers for the key parts they played in the wonderful title win, but without meaning to be too harsh on those individuals, these being the signings made to push them from 14th to 1st does lend weight to the claim that Kante has had the greatest impact of any Premier League signing ever.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea: 2014/2015 (2%)\nNotable signings: Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Filipe Luis, Loic Remy, Didier Drogba",
      "Both Costa and Fabregas were wonderful as Chelsea scampered to the title upon Jose Mourinho’s return, with Fabregas’ feeding of the menacing striker a particular avenue of success for a side with few weaknesses; graced by the return of a club legend in Drogba.",
      "",
      "8) Wolves: 2018/19 (3%)\n Notable signings: Raul Jimenez, Rui Patricio, Adama Traore, Joao Moutinho, Diogo Jota, Willy Boly, Max Kilman, Leander Dendoncker",
      "The Portuguese revolution began the year before, with super-agent Jorge Mendes’ mitts all over the the signing of Ruben Neves and appointment of Nuno Espírito Santo, who took Wolves to the Championship title having finished 15th the season before.",
      "And in an ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ but supercharge it sort of way, Mendes set about turning Molineux into the The Algarve of the West Midlands after promotion, somehow (by paying them lots of money) persuading Champions League-level footballers to join and push them to a quite extraordinary seventh-placed Premier League finish after six years away.",
      "",
      "7) Liverpool: 2018/2019 (3%)\n Notable signings: Alisson, Naby Keita, Fabinho, Xherdan Shaqiri",
      "We wonder if there’s been enough water under the bridge for Liverpool fans to accept that £53m Keita was not a misunderstood genius as the vast majority of them insisted was the case despite the swathes of evidence suggesting he was in fact a massive waste of money, but we guess not.",
      "We reckon that has a lot to do with Michael Edwards getting nearly every other transfer right at this stage to set Liverpool up for success then and now, making it very difficult to accept any sort of failure on his part.",
      "Alisson was deemed by many to be the missing cog which led Liverpool to their long-awaited title a year later, but the signing of Fabinho was also a stroke of genius.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester City: 2015/2016 (4%)\nNotable signings: Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling, Nicolas Otamendi, Fabian Delph",
      "We might just have plumped for City’s 2017/2018 over this one, when Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva, Ederson and Aymeric Laporte all arrived, but this was the summer when many a fan baulked at them paying a club-record £54m for a Chelsea flop who went on to become the greatest midfielder the Premier League has ever seen, as well as a mercurial Liverpool winger who then claimed 131 goals and 86 assists in 339 appearances.",
      "",
      "5) Southampton: 2014/2015 (2%)\n Notable signings: Sadio Mane, Shane Long, Dusan Tadic, Fraser Forster, Graziano Pelle, Toby Alderweireld, Ryan Bertrand",
      "This might just have come out on top had Virgil van Dijk been signed this summer rather than a year later, but there’s still a brilliant mix of talent and risk here, most of which paid off handsomely, not to mention one of the ultimate ‘streets won’t forget’ footballers in Pelle.",
      "He got 16 goals in his debut season as the Saints finished seventh under Ronald Koeman, then sixth in 2015/2016 to qualify for the Europa League. All of Mane, Alderweireld and Tadic became Champions League stalwarts after leaving St Mary’s, while Bertrand and Forster made 240 and 162 Saints appearances respectively.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United: 2007/2008 (7%)\nNotable signings: Anderson, Nani, Owen Hargreaves, Carlos Tevez, Tomasz Kuszczak",
      "They joined the champions to create what many consider to be the greatest Manchester United squad – possibly the greatest squad of any team – in the Premier League era, with absurd quality and depth in almost all areas.",
      "Kuszczak, Anderson and Nani were on the bench with Ryan Giggs, Mikael Silvestre, John O’Shea and Darren Fletcher as John Terry’s slip in Moscow handed them their second Champions League trophy, to go with the Premier League title they also pipped Chelsea to that season.",

      "3) Manchester City: 2010/2011 (4%)\nNotable signings: Yaya Toure, Mario Balotelli, David Silva, Aleksandar Kolarov, Jerome Boateng, James Milner",
      "The signings which secured the first trophy of the Abu Dhabi era when Yaya Toure scored the only goal of the FA Cup final victory over Stoke City in 2011, before all of them – with the exception of Boateng – played a major role in their first and most dramatic Premier League title win a year later. You may just remember the trophy-clinching goal.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool: 2025/2026 (39%)\nNotable signings: Jeremie Frimpong, Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Hugo Ekitike, Giorgi Mamardashvili",
      "Again, we’re well aware how fatuous this is given they’re yet to play for Liverpool, but assuming they sign Marc Guehi or another top centre-back, we’re pretty confident this has indeed been an excellent transfer window for them; they would each have to perform quite significantly below expectations for it to not at least be a very good one.",
      "Arne Slot, Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards have come up with the ingenious plan of identifying the spots in need of strengthening and signing their top targets in each of those positions – it will never catch on. And if Liverpool can break Newcastle and PIF’s resolve to sign Alexander Isak we fully expect them to run away with the league which they look destined to win again in any case.",

      "",
      "1) Chelsea: 2004/2005 (13%)\nNotable signings: Didier Drogba, Ricardo Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira, Arjen Robben, Tiago, Petr Cech, Mateja Kezman",
      "They spent more money the summer before but their first opportunity to use the Roman Abramovich money was all a bit scattergun; they got their transfer eye in once their first big signing, arguably their most important signing ever – Jose Mourinho – got his feet under the table.",
      "Carvalho and Ferreira were part of the most miserly back four in Premier League history, helping Cech to concede just 15 goals – a record unlikely to ever be beaten – with the goalkeeper consistently one of the best, if not the best, around for the next decade. Robben was close to unplayable in his all-too brief time at Stamford Bridge. And then there’s Drogba.",
      "164 goals in 381 appearances may not put him in the top, top echelons of strikers, but his extraordinary record of nine goals in 10 cup finals more than makes up for that, with his 88th-minute header and winning penalty in the 2021 Champions League final his pièce de résistance."

      "Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City each have two players in our ranking of the top 10 Premier League signings of the summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "10) Milos Kerkez (Liverpool)\nWe said ages ago that Liverpool needed a left-back. They listened, and here is Milos Kerkez for £40million – a decent price in this inflated market. While Andy Robertson will always be a cult hero and (at least) a two-time Premier League champion, he was a weak link in an otherwise slick Slot machine.",
      "Kerkez is quicker, younger (22 in November), and frankly better. The Hungarian is an upgrade, and crucially, Premier League-proven. He and Jeremie Frimpong are both strong additions, but Kerkez edges it, partly because Frimpong might fall over if you breathe on him too hard.",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nThis one shot up the rankings after Pedro tore it up in the Club World Cup. He wouldn’t have made the cut otherwise, but those performances were outrageous. The brace against his boyhood club Fluminense left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed £55million, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "",
      "8) Granit Xhaka (Sunderland)\nThis shouldn’t be happening, but it is. Sunderland, fresh off promotion, have convinced Granit Xhaka to swap Champions League football with Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap. And we love it.",
      "For just £13million, they’ve signed a player far too good for the bottom half. Sure, he’s had his critics – many of them loud and correct – but the Swiss international has matured, added composure, and now walks into this team as captain-in-waiting. Sunderland have watched Burnley, Ipswich and others make transfer mistakes and get relegated. They’re doing things a bit differently and we rate it highly.",
      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United)\nThere’s one glaring issue with this transfer: This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. They have a habit of botching signings, no matter how brilliant the player was before taking the graveyard shift at Old Trafford.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Ruben Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal.",
      "",
      "6) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Will Liverpool signings Ekitike and Wirtz fall victim to the dreaded Bundesliga tax?\n👉 Sesko, Watkins or Messi to Newcastle? One Alexander Isak replacement per top 10 league\n👉 Chelsea and Liverpool dominate top 10 genius Premier League player sales this summer",
      "",
      "5) Matheus Cunha (Manchester United)\nAnother great player that Manchester United might destroy. Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season and now finds himself slotted perfectly into Amorim’s system as a left-sided ‘wide 10’.",
      "He and Mbeumo offer something United have been lacking: actual output. Now they just need an elite centre-forward. If they get that piece, top-half football might actually be on the cards. High hopes, we know.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling. He’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, it’s Man United.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "4) Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford)\nAnother intra-Premier League move, Kelleher has finally left Liverpool to spread his wings as a top-flight No.1. As his ranking shows, this looks like an outstanding pick-up for Brentford, who replaced Mark Flekken superbly and sorted the goalkeeper spot early this summer.",
      "Kelleher had to leave, especially with Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving, and considering how brilliant Liverpool are at flogging fringe players, we’re honestly stunned his initial fee is only £12.5million. It could rise to £18m, which is still a steal.",
      "Selling him for half what Jarell Quansah cost Bayer Leverkusen probably sums up Liverpool’s weak stance in transfer talks. Kelleher wanted out, keeping him made little sense, and they weren’t d*cks about it. Brentford will be bloody chuffed.",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nFinally. Arsenal have signed a striker who isn’t terrified of the 18-yard box. Viktor Gyokeres has been smashing in goals for fun over the last three seasons – 22 in 50 for Coventry, 43 in 49 for Sporting, and then an obscene 54 in 52 last term.",
      "Yes, it’s ‘only the Portuguese league’ and no, he’s not the next Bas Dost. Gyokeres has the strength, speed, work rate, and most importantly, finishing ability, to succeed in Our League. Arsenal now have a proper No.9. It’s about bloody time.",
      "MORE: Gyokeres to Arsenal: Bruno Fernandes second as Liga Portugal to Premier League signings ranked",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nNico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. Because that’s what really matters – not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone who’s world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summer…so far.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "Chelsea and Liverpool have both found value in the transfer market by underpaying for a couple of players each, while Arsenal have a bargain of their own.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal are in ‘do or die’ seasons for very different reasons as Mikel Arteta faces becoming ‘the new Brendan Rodgers’…",
      "Florian Wirtz’s father has revealed why the player snubbed interest from Bayern Munich to join Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool breaking the British transfer record twice to sign an elite striker and creator is ‘unthinkable’ but means they should be judged by the Quadruple.",
      "A Liverpool fan does not think the Reds are firm favourites for the Premier League title due to four concerns, with Florian Wirtz the ‘new Kai Havertz’.",
      "Sure, you’ll know your Pogbas and your Rices, but what about your Amdounis and your Igor Tiagos?"

      "The Manchester United push to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle is not being ‘driven’ by Ruben Amorim, who ‘prefers’ an alternative.",
      "United completed the signings of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon early in the window before dragging their feet to get a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line.",
      "A new striker is now their priority, with RB Leipzig’s Sesko emerging as their top target, though Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are still of interest to the Red Devils.",
      "Newcastle have made the early running in the race to sign Sesko but now Man Utd have made their move to ‘open formal talks’ today in order to get a deal done.",
      "Transfer expert Ben Jacobs wrote on X: ‘#MUFC open formal talks for Benjamin Sesko after sending a secret delegation to Germany. Christopher Vivell driving. Ruben Amorim put forward Ollie Watkins. #NUFC remain in the race. Both hoping price drops to €70m.’",
      "Before The Athletic’s David Ornstein revealed that Man Utd are now ‘prioritising a move’ for Sesko with the journalist adding that ‘Alexander Isak wanting to leave St James’ Park’ has ‘accelerated the actions’ of the Red Devils to get a deal done.",
      "Ornstein added: ‘Watkins has admirers at Old Trafford but Villa told United early in the window that the 29-year-old is not for sale and are adamant he is staying. The United hierarchy are reluctant to pay what they thought it may have taken for Villa to consider doing business.’",
      "A report on Wednesday claimed that ‘the feeling inside Newcastle is that Sesko is likely to go to Manchester United’.",
      "‘Newcastle are continuing to pursue deals for RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Brentford’s Yoane Wissa. However, the feeling inside the club is that Sesko is likely to go to Manchester United, which would be a huge frustration given they are so keen on the Slovenian.",
      "‘That, though, could potentially pave the way for a move for Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, who is on Newcastle’s shortlist. So is Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson, but several others are ahead of him at present.’",
      "Transfer expert Ben Jacobs confirmed in a talkSPORT report that United have indeed ‘opened talks for Sesko’ and have ‘sent a delegation to Germany to meet RB Leipzig officials’, with the 22-year-old ‘favouring a move to Old Trafford’.",
      "Chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves ‘arrived a few days ago’ as United are ‘aware they have to move fast’ to beat Newcastle to the Slovenian, with both Premier League clubs ‘believing they can get a deal done for €70m [£60m].",
      "It’s claimed the move for Sesko is being ‘driven’ by head of recruitment Christopher Vivell, with Amorim ‘preferring’ Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Sesko is one of two active options for Manchester United along with Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins, though talkSPORT understands Ruben Amorim would prefer the latter.",
      "‘Villa don’t wish to sell the England striker, but United may still persist with talks and even test that resolve with a bid.",
      "‘They have not yet ruled out making a formal offer, albeit one below Villa’s £60m valuation.",
      "‘There remains internal debate at United as to whether to opt for proven Premier League experience or a younger No.9 with a high ceiling such as Sesko.’",
      "Man Utd fans may have to settle for another year of Rasmus Hojlund up top after Ruben Amorim suggested he was happy with the Dane leading the line.",
      "Romano has explained why he thinks players are “scared” to sign for Newcastle as top target Benjamin Sesko makes his ‘final transfer decision’.",
      "Man Utd and Newcastle have both submitted ‘offers’ for Sesko, as a report reveals when the striker will ‘decide’ his future with a third option an ‘unlikely’ possibility.",
      "Man Utd’s ‘next three signings’ have been ‘revealed’ as Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive” the remaining four members of the bomb squad.",
      "Man Utd have begun ‘formal talks’ to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig after sending ‘a secret delegation to Germany’, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a ‘deal is on’ for Man Utd to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle this summer."

      "“Whoever comes in next, they have to hit the ground running. Emi is an interesting character, and you’d need to be that to take on a challenge like United right now.",
      "“He’s probably the closest goalkeeper in attitude to Fabien Barthez, and you need that. It’s a huge club, absolutely massive. He’s won the World Cup, he’s played with Lionel Messi, so he’s well suited as far as we can tell.",
      "“We won’t know for sure until and unless he moves, because we’ve seen goalkeepers crumble in minutes, like Massimo Taibi, with the pressure of United. They make a few mistakes and then you never see them again.",
      "“The only reason that’s not happened to Onana yet is because their other keepers are no better than him. If you can’t look to your number two at all to take the pressure off, then there’s a huge issue there.”",

      "“Hazard was a similar player that could slide past opponents with a first touch and find the space as well as go past players and score and assist.",

Newcastle are going very big with a contract proposal ready for the player and they are also ready to approach RB Leipzig.

      "We know these days that players are on the wrong side of the hill once they leave school, but some oldies have shown there’s still life (and goals) in the old dogs once they sign for Manchester United later in their careers.",
      "Watkins is 29, he is said to be the preferred choice of the two names on their shortlist, and he would certainly be an upgrade on what the Red Devils currently have up front. Even though he is pushing 30, that didn’t stop these permanent striker signings from making a big impact at Old Trafford…",
      "",
      "Edinson Cavani\nFew United fans cared that Cavani was 33 when he joined United amid the madness of Covid times. For free, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer signed PSG’s then record goalscorer with a tally of 200 in 301 games. It was a much-needed boost a few days after being humped 6-1 at Old Trafford by Tottenham.",
      "Cavani took on the No.7 shirt and made a better fist of living up to its iconic billing than anyone else since the first coming of Ronaldo. Helping United to a runners-up finish in the Premier League – an achievement only recognised in hindsight – the Uruguayan scored 10 league goals and 17 in all competitions, despite having to come off the bench almost as often as he started.",
      "Signing a new one-year contract, Cavani could be forgiven for thinking he had done enough to be trusted to lead United’s line. But then, the second coming. Not only did Ronaldo take the starting spot Cavani wanted; he took the shirt of his back too.",
      "Now 34, Cavani seemed to take it all rather personally. For Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, his appearances were sporadic and his goals even more so. He was hardly alone in going through the motions for Rangnick, but the desire to get out of Old Trafford was more thinly disguised than most.",
      "",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo\nYes, it all came to a rather unsavoury end, but Ronaldo’s return didn’t seem such a bad idea when he finished the 2021/22 season as the club’s top scorer with 24 goals in 38 appearances, including some big moments in a generally wretched campaign.",
      "Granted, it wasn’t hard to shine in a team that got Solskjaer sacked and barely bothered to tune in to Rangnick, the interim replacement. He didn’t do much in the way of pressing, but what did anyone expect? Especially while he was surrounded by younger pretend pressers, who made Rangnick rip up his philosophy after approximately 45 minutes of his first match in charge.",
      "Top scorer and Player of the Season in his first year back at Old Trafford, Erik ten Hag’s appointment got Ronaldo’s back up. He was picked to start just once in the new manager’s first eight Premier League games, a role never compatible with Ronaldo’s ego.",
      "Rather than keep things in-house to preserve his legacy, Ronaldo took a scorched earth approach to manufacturing an exit. He sat down with Piers Morgan to criticise, well, everything. He wasn’t wrong about many things, but the inevitable mutual consent was reached to allow Ronaldo to move into semi-retirement in Saudi.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nIbra may have been 34 when he strutted into Old Trafford for a reunion with Jose Mourinho, but there were few signs of the veteran slowing down. He joined United on the back of his most prolific season ever in which he bagged 50 goals in 51 appearances for PSG.",
      "Zlatan was… Zlatan. He was United’s top scorer with 27 goals, netting at crucial times during Jose’s Aldi Treble. He would have scored more had his season not been brought to a premature end by a serious knee injury with a month still to go.",
      "The injury delayed the signing of another one-year contract, but by the time Ibrahimovic was fit, United had signed Romelu Lukaku, who took his starting place and his No.9 shirt. Hardly suited to a stand-in role, Zlatan was allowed to leave Old Trafford in March to join LA Galaxy. But his first season in red is one of pitifully few fond memories for United fans in recent years.",
      "",
      "Robin van Persie\nThere’s a theme among these veteran strikers: brilliant in their first season; far less so after that.",
      "None of the above, though, were as inspiring as Van Persie in his maiden campaign at Old Trafford. He did have the advantage of playing for Sir Alex Ferguson, but even accounting for that, the Netherlands striker’s impact was almost Cantona-esque.",
      "In the wake of losing the title to Manchester City, signing Van Persie from Arsenal was a statement in itself, with City also interested in the Gunners skipper once he identified Arsene Wenger’s side were going nowhere fast. ‘The little boy inside was screaming for United’, as Van Persie put it, so Fergie made sure he got there ahead of his noisy neighbours.",
      "It was decisive in United wrestling back control of Manchester and the Premier League, albeit briefly. Van Persie, evidently born to play at Old Trafford, scored 26 league goals to claim the Golden Boot as well as his first title.",
      "Then, to Van Persie’s horror as much as anyone else’s, Ferguson retired. He still hit double figures for David Moyes and Louis van Gaal in the following two seasons, but the onset of the post-Fergie funk was as a swift as it is stubborn to shift. “Moyes was not to blame – anyone who came in after Ferguson, good luck to you,” said Van Persie after he retired. “It was not only him to blame, it was us as well. The standards were so high but they dropped.”",
      "",
      "Teddy Sheringham\nBucking the trend somewhat, Sheringham struggled badly in his first season at Old Trafford. But it all worked out rather well in the end…",
      "Sheringham signed up for the impossible job: replacing Eric Cantona. At 31, the England striker was a year older than the retiring United skipper who left impossibly big boots to fill.",
      "It probably didn’t help that he barely spoke to his new strike partner Andy Cole. He failed to hit double figures in the league, which was relinquished to Arsenal. So when Ferguson signed Cole’s best mate at the start of the following season, the writing looked to be on the wall.",
      "Sheringham played in fewer than half of the Premier League games as United regained their title, scoring only twice, but the veteran scored career-defining goals off the bench in the FA Cup final and Champions League final to make himself a hero of the Treble.",
      "Even his third season at Old Trafford was a personal struggle – he scored six goals in all competitions. It was only at the fourth attempt, aged 35, that he bagged double figures in the league (15) while breaking the 20-goal barrier in all competitions for the first time, winning the PFA Player of the Year along the way.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘exploring’ an ‘innovative solution’ to offload Alejandro Garnacho as they eye three key signings.",
      "This summer transfer window has been frustrating for the Red Devils as they have only made three summer signings and are struggling to offload unwanted assets.",
      "Most of United’s summer budget has been spent on signing Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon, so they need to sell to buy before this window closes.",
      "Unfortunately for Ruben Amorim and INEOS, Marcus Rashford is the only member of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ to leave as Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are yet to leave.",
      "Garnacho is not part of Amorim’s plans after the pair fell out at the end of the 2024/25 campaign. The winger was told by the head coach to ‘find a new club’ after the player hit out at Man Utd following their Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour ranking: Man Utd’s striker preference amid Donnarumma talk",
      "The Argentina international struggled to adapt to the No.10 role in Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation and he has also been criticised over his poor attitude over the past 12 months.",
      "Man Utd opened the door to Garnacho’s exit during this year’s winter transfer window as they looked to sanction pure profit sales and he attracted interest from Chelsea and Napoli.",
      "However, Man Utd’s reported asking price of £60m put interested clubs off and a report from The Independent claims they have been forced to turn to an ‘innovative solution’ to seal his exit this summer.",
      "It is claimed that they are ‘exploring swap deals’ with Chelsea and Aston Villa involving Nicolas Jackson and Ollie Watkins as ‘they are investigating deals where players go both ways’.",
      "Antony and/or Sancho could be involved in similar deals as INEOS are taking drastic action to raise funds for three more signings, with their priority to sign ‘a striker, an athletic number-six and a goalkeeper’.",
      "Regarding Garnacho to Chelsea, ‘there is one main obstacle as regards any potential trade as the Stamford Bridge hierarchy value Jackson at £80m’, while ‘they don’t want to pay more than £30m’ for the United outcast.",
      "This is while there are issues with Man Utd’s moves for Watkins and Sesko, with the report also naming two midfield options.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘There is strong interest in Watkins given his status as a proven Premier League goalscorer, which would solve one of Amorim’s main issues last season, but much will depend on Villa’s willingness to do business, with the club’s current stance being that he is not for sale.",
      "‘United have also been looking at Benjamin Sesko, who is no longer being pursued by Arsenal after their purchase of Viktor Gyokeres. Leipzig’s €80m asking price would definitely require considerable sales, however.",
      "‘At number-six, United have been looking at Sporting’s Morten Hjulmand and Bayern Munich’s Joao Palhinha.’",
      "Chelsea legend Roberto di Matteo reckons Man Utd could buy Blues centre-forward Nicolas Jackson this summer to solve their striker problem.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is “not really worried” about the Red Devils being linked to Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins this summer.",
      "Some have scoffed at Man Utd for chasing soon-to-be-30 Ollie Watkins. But they have good form for signing veteran goalscorers…",
      "Manchester United have come up with a sensible price for Ollie Watkins but that does not please one Villa journalist, who has form.",
      "Manchester United star Luke Shaw has given his backing to head coach Ruben Amorim and hit out at four Red Devils “stragglers”.",
      "Newcastle are set to use the money from Alexander Isak’s potential sale to Liverpool to buy two new strikers, according to reports."

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, but Liverpool and maybe even Arsenal want a word.",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Juventus – £102.54m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £113.43m\nSeven first-team signings have come in and the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

The second thing to note is that he is a Football News Correspondent for a reason; he should never have been allowed (physically restrain him if necessary) to write another opinion piece ever again after this monstrosity.",
      "It’s worth taking a minute to look again at that column – in the Sunday Mirror – from 2012. In no particular order of our three favourite passages in Law’s raging against the scourge of reverse xenophobia we bring you…",
      "The way he juggles selling star players with bringing through youth and picking up bargains makes Moyes the perfect eventual successor to Arsene Wenger at Arsenal.",
      "United too should look at Moyes when Sir Alex Ferguson calls it a day, but no doubt the likes of Mourinho, Guardiola and Klopp will be at the top of the hit lists.",
      "That’s nothing less than beautiful, even without the knowledge of what happened a literal year later. Next…",
      "Tell a the supporter of a big club that they could do worse than get Grant Holt and they will turn their nose up. But tell a fan that Olivier Giroud might be on his way and they will be seriously excited – even if they only saw the Frenchman for five minutes at Euro 2012.",

      "Not a ‘fact’ when your maths are wrong, fella. But also it will be ‘argued that his age limits his value’ because his age limits his value.",
      "The biggest fee paid for any 29-year-old this summer is less than £12m; Villa would be very lucky to get anywhere near £50m for Watkins, and we would argue that the pragmatic decision would be to sell at that price.",
      "The most any club has ever paid for a 29-year-old is £57m and that was Diego Costa. He is foreign, though.",
      "That should sound alarm bells ringing in the head of Watkins if it has been turned in the direction of Old Trafford at all. Just as in the case of City and Kane, there is no conviction to United’s supposed interest. It must be assumed that the club are either trying to please Amorim or simply view Watkins as being better than nothing.",
      "Or it could be assumed that Manchester United have looked at the market for 29-year-olds, calculated that Watkins will have diminishing sell-on value, and decided on a value of £45m.",

      "",
      "So awkward!\n‘Ollie Watkins faces awkward Man Utd question if £45m transfer goes ahead’ says the Express. Because of course Watkins is the only footballer in history to join a club other than the one he supports (Arsenal). Presumably he also ‘faced awkward Aston Villa question’ too.",
      "Thankfully he already knows Bryan Mbeumo from his Brentford days and the Mirror are keen to mine that particular cleft, declaring ‘Ollie Watkins’ comments on Bryan Mbeumo speaks volumes ahead of potential Man Utd reunion’.",

      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United \"look like a different team\" after they earned their second victory in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United followed up their 2-1 win over West Ham by beating Bournemouth 4-1 on Thursday morning, even without new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "There are indications that the same players who struggled last season in the Premier League are now more comfortable in Amorim's shape.",
      "\"It was a good game. We played with intensity. We were aggressive and that is something that we need to improve from last season,\" said Amorim. \"We had better possession compared to the last game, so they are listening.",
      "\"Of course, scoring first in the beginning of the games can change the confidence of the team. We changed some positions and you feel that they know what to do in different positions.",
      "\"It was a good test. We controlled quite well the runs of Evanilson and Semenyo one against one. Luke Shaw was also really strong. So it was a good day.",
      "\"It was just a pre-season game but the feeling with the same players, even being a pre-season game, if you look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team and that is a good sign.\"",
      "Amorim also indicated that United's improvement has come from a better culture as the club looks to offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, having sent Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.",
      "Amorim said: \"More than the results is the way they are playing. They are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other, not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.",
      "\"They are stronger. They are faster in this moment. Of course, it's pre-season, but you can see the intensity is completely different. I can see that the data from the minutes are completely different.",
      "\"We are improving, but again, it's a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season, but it's important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring for Man Utd amid the club's move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim believes United have improved because of the improvement in Hojlund's performances.",
      "\"People focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,\" said Amorim. \"I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long]. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in support is helping us a lot to play better and we are playing better because he's playing better.",
      "\"I'm really happy with Rasmus. I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola was also full of praise for United.",
      "\"We are very far right now from United,\" he said. \"They are a hell of a team. They have signed very well and today they showed they are above us in this moment.\"",
      "Amorim had insisted all along that perhaps the changes that he wanted to make at Old Trafford would be easier to implement during a summer and there were encouraging signs in Chicago that the worst of his time at United could now be behind him.",
      "There were plenty of positives in this performance against Bournemouth that went deeper than the result. In difficult conditions, United moved the ball impressively and played with real intensity and no little cohesion. In other words, it was different.",
      "There were interchanges between Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, the latter adding weight to the theory that Amorim's system will suit him in the long term. Patrick Dorgu, having shown himself to be a useful outlet last season, suggested he can build on that promise.",
      "This is pre-season and there are dangers in reading too much into it - particularly given that new signings Cunha and Mbeumo did not feature. But perhaps that is also a good sign. The same players looked a lot better. Light at the end of a long tunnel for Amorim.",

      "RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is Man Utd's top striker target along with Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and others; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Wednesday 30 July 2025 17:11, UK",
      "Manchester United have made Benjamin Sesko their top transfer target - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "The 22-year-old was wanted by Arsenal earlier in the transfer window but Manchester United are now interested after the Gunners moved for Viktor Gyokeres - who used to be managed by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford?",
      "And with a release clause between £68m and £86m, could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "By targeting Sesko, Manchester United are continuing a theme of trying to add pace to their attack this summer having already signed Bryan Mbeumo, who recorded a top speed of 36.63 km/h last term, making him the fourth-fastest player in the Premier League.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "Like Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, Sesko could help add counter-attacking threat to a Manchester United side that only scored four fast-break goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness might be part of his appeal to Manchester United.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "It is likely another part of his appeal to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to Old Trafford would bring considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United."

      "The new season provides fresh opportunity for United to avenge what Amorim himself labelled a disaster season as United recorded a record low Premier League finish of 15th, while also suffering defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",
      "Despite the 1-0 defeat in Bilbao, Shaw was quick to defend manager Amorim after the game, explaining that the Portuguese is the right man to lead the club forward. Asked to further explain his comments during United's training camp in Chicago, Shaw doubled down on his stance.",
      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",
      "\"I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",

      "\"I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.",

      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",

He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
