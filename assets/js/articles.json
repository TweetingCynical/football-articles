      "There was a time when Viktor Gyokeres could not get a kick for Brighton and Hove Albion - now the Sporting Lisbon colossus is being chased by Arsenal and Manchester United.",
      "Gyokeres, 26, has established himself as one of the best strikers in world football over the last two years. At Brighton and while on loan at Swansea City, Gyokeres' opportunities were few and far between, particularly when he was at the Amex Stadium.",
      "After finding his goal-scoring range at Coventry City, Sporting took a chance on the Swede by signing him from the Sky Blues for £20million. Two-years later, he could soon be on his way to Arsenal, as the North Londoners have reportedly offered him a contract worth £7million a year after tax.",
      "Now he is in the headlines, several of his former team-mates and opponents spoke to French outlet RMC Sport to offer their thoughts on Gyokeres at the time, as well as what they make of him now. Ex-Huddersfield and Reading defender Naby Sarr, who faced him on multiple occasions, said: \"I dealt with two Gyokeres'. The first was already tough and strong, despite a lot of shortcomings.",
      "\"It was easy to stop him, his game was very readable. In the end, it was no longer the same story. He became ultra-complete, one of the best players I've faced. Speed, power, efficiency, technical accuracy... he worked on all these aspects.\"",
      "He added: \"What sets him apart from the others is that he's not lazy. His mindset has always been to tell himself that no ball is unplayable. Even if he seems unexploitable and is five meters behind, he'll go for it. He's poison.\"",
      "Other players who shared a dressing room with the Scandinavian recall a player who was friendly, humble, and hard-working, but often limited by his capabilities. One of those stars was Gaetan Bong, who played alongside Gyokeres at Brighton, when the striker was struggling to find the net.",
      "Bong, who retired in 2022, admitted he has been baffled by Gyokeres' ascent, saying: \"I remember seeing this unassuming guy arrive in the dressing room. It was surprising to see him there because Brighton were used to recruiting players in his position who were quick and easy on the ball.",
      "\"He already had an imposing physique, but how can I put it... Technically and in his finishing, it was... mediocre. He was far from the level of Glenn Murray, for example, who was our starting No.9.",
      "\"That day, we were working on free kicks and I saw the discreet Viktor coming into my zone. I was often given the strongest guys to mark me, so at the time I was calm and I told myself that I was going to try to intimidate him, just to welcome him.",
      "\"I grabbed his arm, I tried to move it, and there... wow! I saw that he was resisting. A wall! He had a lot of strength. I said to myself: 'OK, he's going to have to work hard, but at least he has a response, he's not there to be walked all over, and in duels he has what it takes.' It was a first good point.\"",
      "The same concerns were echoed by former Coventry colleague Maxime Biamou, who pointed out similar flaws in Gyokeres' game. Taking those into account, the Frenchman added: \"There was no indication that he was going to explode one day.\"",
      "Ironically, Gyokeres' biggest weakness in his development years was, in the opinion of ex-Coventry midfielder Wesley Jobello, his shooting and goal-scoring instincts, the very things he is a master off today. Jobello said: \"In matches, he had this way of charging head first, without asking any questions.",
      "\"He tried a lot and didn't care if he made a mistake. Right foot, left foot, he sent some serious concrete blocks, but it wasn't often on target.\"",
      "This season alone, Gyokeres has hammered 52 goals and 13 assists in just 50 appearances in all competitions. Arsenal, who are desperate for a striker, have been heavily linked with a move, while a reunion with Ruben Amorim at United has also been mentioned.",
      "What is for certain is that Gyokeres has terrified defences this season and intends on continuing to do so, whatever club he is at."

      "Arsenal are set to make a move for a new striker in the summer transfer window, but could face a tough decision over which of their top targets to pursue. RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has been one of the leading names mentioned to solve the club's problem position.",
      "The Gunners have not lived up to expectations in the Premier League. Mikel Arteta's squad are 15 points adrift of champions Liverpool and are battling to maintain second place ahead of their match against Newcastle United this weekend.",
      "Much of the criticism has been directed at Arsenal's inability to sign a striker, either last summer or in the January window. The issue was made worse by injuries to Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus. RB Leipzig star Sesko is one of the main names being linked with filling the number nine spot, but two obstacles could stop him from making a move to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "The Independent has reported that Arsenal are still weighing up whether to go for Sesko or Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres. The latter has maintained his impressive form in Portugal, scoring 52 goals in 50 appearances, while Sesko has scored 21 times for a struggling Leipzig team.",
      "Sesko, 21, is five years younger than Gyokeres and could offer better value for Arsenal's money in the long-term. However, Sporting striker Gyokeres is seen as more of a finished product and is reportedly available for around £60million.",
      "The arrival of Andrea Berta as Arsenal's sporting director has reignited speculation over the club's pursuit of former Coventry City star Gyokeres. This is despite the Independent reporting that the majority of necessary groundwork has already been completed to secure Sesko's services.",
      "Arsenal expressed interest in Sesko last summer but opted not to proceed until the transfer of Eddie Nketiah to Crystal Palace was confirmed. By then, Sesko had agreed to an extension with RB Leipzig, who are facing the possibility of a season without European competition.",
      "Sesko's agent Elvis Basanovic previously justified his client's decision to stay at Leipzig. When asked earlier in the season if Sesko was the solution to Arsenal's striker issue, Basanovic replied: \"I think you should ask Mr. Arteta about that. But I think Sesko could suit many clubs because he has different football skills,\" he told Slovenian TV channel Arena Sport.",
      "Basanovic shared the reasoning behind Sesko's new deal: \"We can see that our decision was correct. Six months later, he is already a better striker than he was last season,\" he said.",
      "\"What he lacks is experience. We must not forget that he is only 21 years old, so we did not want him to go to the Premier League in the summer. There were concrete options, but we consciously decided to stay in the Bundesliga to give him time to progress and develop into a better striker.\"",
      "Arsenal's focus on signing a centre-forward could inadvertently benefit Manchester United's summer transfer plans. Both United and the Gunners have been linked with Wolves star Matheus Cunha in recent months.",
      "While Arsenal remain interested in the Brazil international, it is Ruben Amorim's side who are widely reported to be winning the race for his signature. Cunha has scored 15 goals in 31 league games for Wolves this season.",
      "United will be eager to freshen up their attacking options as their forwards have struggled to score goals consistently. Bruno Fernandes is the club's top scorer in the Premier League with eight.",
      "Meanwhile, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike are still on Arsenal's watchlist, albeit further down than Sesko and Gyokeres. However, despite the club's fondness for the striker, a potential transfer for Newcastle's Alexander Isak seems improbable."

      "No other job in football carries the stress and anxiety of a manager. From Ruben Amorim to Nathan Jones, we’ve seen that pressure bubble to the surface this week, and the business end of the season does strange things to the psyche and demeanour of bosses feeling the heat.",
      "Amorim’s admission that Manchester United’s Premier League results on his watch have been “embarrassing” and questioning whether they are ready for Champions League football next season if they win the Europa League may have been honest. But some things in football are best left unsaid, or kept behind closed doors.",
      "Whether you are a head coach answerable to a director of football, or a manager in charge of the whole football operation, you are the face of a club, the man who carries the hopes of your fans and conveys them to the players.",
      "When things are going well, you take the plaudits. When they go badly, you take the responsibility - but you are the one empowered to do something about it.",
      "If you blame others before you have looked in the mirror, whether you operate in the Northern Premier League or the Champions League, maybe self-awareness is not your strongest suit.",
      "Amorim’s public statements were no doubt fuelled by raw emotion, but it’s reached the stage now where the only language United fans really want to hear is the vocabulary of a winner. If he lifts the Europa League trophy in Bilbao on Wednesday night, more than anything it will be a release of pressure.",
      "That pressure valve also best explains Jones’ behaviour on the touchline after Charlton’s tense League One play-off semi-final win against Wycombe on Thursday night.",
      "Kneeling in prayer before the final whistle, and then bursting into tears on all fours, was the portrait of a manager overwhelmed by relief and euphoria.",
      "But it makes you wonder how Jones will manage to contain his emotions if Charlton beat Leyton Orient in the final at Wembley!",
      "And it’s a reminder that this is the time of year when managers stand or fall on nine months of hard graft. For some, the season will end in triumph - but for others, like Ruben Selles at Hull, it ends harshly.",
      "I have no idea why Hull sacked Selles after he kept them in the Championship on the final day. What was his remit if it wasn’t to save them from relegation?",
      "This is the club who sacked Liam Rosenior last year - and he is on the brink of leading French club Strasbourg, Arsene Wenger’s former team, into Europe. Being a football manager is just about the only profession where people openly debate whether you should be fired.",
      "It’s the only profession where ‘experts’ on the outside pontificate on the job you’ve done when they don’t know half of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.",
      "Some pundits who have never been a manager have all the answers when they have never set foot inside a technical area. Others might have dipped their toe in the water for a few games, been unsuccessful and returned to the sofa because possibly it’s harder than it looks and maybe it’s not for them.",
      "Unless you have been at the sharp end, even if I only lasted five minutes, it’s a job like no other. But above all, to be a football manager you need personality, you need to communicate - even lower down the pyramid.",
      "Would you rather manage at my level, where you won’t go any higher if you keep making mistakes, or work at an EFL club where you might be thrust into a job and get another two or three opportunities even if you fail in the first one?",
      "At Macclesfield, we have enjoyed a record-breaking season and I have agreed a two-year contract nine months after putting my neck on the block by admitting my job would be untenable if we didn’t win promotion.",
      "But my first season as a manager has been an eye-opener like no other experience after almost 35 years in the game. Even at a non-League level, I can identify with the pressure Amorim, Jones and others have felt this week. And we wouldn’t swap it for the comfort zone in a million years."

However, with Amorim at the helm, United's league victories have been meagre, totalling just six in 26 matches with the most recent coming against since relegated Leicester City in March.",

It's unbelievable.\" On his own podcast, Rio Ferdinand Presents, the former defender theorised that Amroim could be looking to execute a significant shakeup of the squad.",
      "\"I think he looks around the dressing room and thinks, 'If I could wave a magic wand, in the next five years at least 50 per cent of this team wouldn't be here.' Because they're not good enough and they're not right for the way he wants to play,\" Ferdinand argued.",
      "\"I look at him and think that he needs, minimum, two good windows of getting rid of the ones he doesn't require, but also getting in players that he really needs. There has to be a lot of things to go right for us to make a dramatic turn on this.",

      "Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, Neville said: “You’re talking about eight to 10 players have to go. They’re going to have to pay to get them out.\"",
      "United face Chelsea on Friday evening before wrapping up their domestic season against Aston Villa at Old Trafford a week on Sunday. They're yet to reach 40 points and could even finish just outside the relegation places in 17th.",

The Manchester United legend is fronting a nationwide campaign to help Sunday league teams who play on lunar landscapes with barely-distinguishable line markings, or surfaces pockmarked by dogs ’ mess and broken glass, to enjoy smarter, safer pitches.",
      "Neville, 50, said: “Anyone who has played football at one point or another has played on a dodgy pitch. Grassroots football is the foundation of our sport and it’s great to be a part of the Best Worst Pitch initiative supporting the communities and volunteers who make it possible.”",
      "This weekend’s FA Cup final and the all-English Europa League final in Bilbao will be played on pristine surfaces. But on the bottom rungs of the ladder, hard-up councils are stretched for financial resources to provide professional line-painting equipment, GPS mapping, pitch maintenance equipment and ground staff training.",
      "Responsibility for maintaining pitches in public spaces often falls on volunteers - including pre-match ‘sweeps’ of the playing area to clear it of debris or canine calling cards.",
      "Specsavers are long-standing investors in the grassroots community with their annual search to find Britain’s ‘best worst team’. Their current ‘champions’ are Somerset League strugglers Tunley Athletic, whose chairman Craig Doughty admitted: “It’s a real slog sometimes - every week, rain or shine, I’m out there doing two full laps of the pitch just to get the lines marked.",
      "\"The equipment we’ve got is ancient—it clogs, it leaks, and it takes twice as long as it should. On dark evenings or when the wind’s howling, it feels like it takes forever. But I do it because I love this club—it means everything to the community.”",
      "Where professional football was once played on pitches resembling Amazon swamps, or sandy beaches after the tide has gone out, most clubs in all four divisions enjoy billiard-table surfaces.",
      "But further down the scale, obscure markings and uneven grass pitches are a major problem or even a health hazard. And clubs on the lowest steps of the pyramid cannot afford to install all-weather, low-maintenance 3G pitches."

      "The decision to cancel the ceremony did receive some negative responses, considering the women's side secured a top-four finish and reached the FA Cup final, which will be played this weekend. It also prevented the club's youngsters from going on stage to pick up their honours, with Harry Amass named Young Player of the Year.",
      "De Gea enjoyed a purple patch where he continued to be voted on top. He won it four times in five years with his first coming in 2014. Cristiano Ronaldo also won it four times, doing so in 2004, 2007 and 2008 before adding another during his second stint in Manchester.",
      "Fernandes' wins came in 2020, 2021 and 2024 and he dominated the voting this time round with Amad in second and Harry Maguire in third. Eric Cantona, Roy Keane, Brian McClair, Wayne Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy are the only other men with multiple Player of the Year victories since it was first awarded in 1988, bearing the name of their iconic manager.",
      "Fernandes' quality has led to talk of interest from Saudi Arabia. Al-Hilal are ready to lodge a hefty offer, but the Premier League side have no plans to their talisman. The Saudi Pro League club have the funds for a mega signing after Mohamed Salah decided to stay at Liverpool, with talks being held about pursuing the Portugal star.",
      "It is understood there was initial contact between the two parties last year before Fernandes signed a new contract to keep him in Manchester until 2027.",
      "Only last month Ruben Amorim rejected the possibility of his talisman leaving for - underlining his importance as the club's captain and leading light. He said: \"No, it's not going to happen. He's not going anywhere because I've already told him!\""

      "Chelsea's preparations for their Premier League match against Manchester United have been dealt a blow with the news that Christopher Nkunku won't be fit to return. The Blues were already without the suspended Nicolas Jackson, and both they and their opponents are well below full-strength for Friday's game.",
      "Jackson was sent off last weekend as Chelsea lost to Newcastle to leave their Champions League qualification hopes in jeopardy. Anything less than two wins from the final two games will leave the door open for Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest, with the latter hosting Enzo Maresca's team on the final day.",
      "Jackson and Nkunku are two of 16 players missing from across the two squads. The latter was already expected to sit the game out, having also missed the victory over Liverpool, but Maresca confirmed as much in his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"Christo is close to coming back and training with us,\" Maresca told reporters. \"I said two weeks ago it was a very small problem, ten days, two weeks. Probably next week he can start already with us.\"",
      "Nkunku and Jackson are among several Chelsea players missing for the game, but Reece James is available to play a part. Maresca confirmed the club captain has recovered from illness, but others will have to wait to make their returns.",
      "Chelsea striker Marc Guiu has been out injured since February. He's now back in training but Maresca confirmed he isn't fit to start on Friday - and he might not be ready to feature at all.",
      "Wesley Fofana and Omari Kellyman are out for the season through injury, while Mykhailo Mudryk remains provisionally suspended and Jadon Sancho is unable to face his parent club. Young defender Aaron Anselmino is another injury doubt while James' recent illness means that - while he could feature - Chelsea may decide not to risk him.",
      "As for Manchester United, Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are unavailable due to season-ending injuries. Leny Yoro is also unlikely to be back in time after being forced off in last week's defeat to West Ham, while there are question marks over Diogo Dalot and Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "With a Europa League final coming up against Tottenham on Wednesday, United boss Ruben Amorim may opt against risking others who have only recently returned to training. That means Toby Collyer and Jonny Evans could get another game to recover if not required at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Amorim was also asked about Luke Shaw, having withdrawn the defender at the same time as Yoro last weekend, but indicated he was keen to protect the defender amid a tough time for injuries around the club this term. \"It’s not what it’s going to be, it’s the history,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We have to manage the minutes, like Mason Mount. Mason Mount is ready, but we are trying to build these guys a little bit longer for them to cope. Then, in the future, they will be okay.”"

      "The 27-year-old moved to Villa Park in February in a loan deal that included a £40m option-to-buy clause. That however does not prevent any other club signing the forward, whose time in the Midlands will come to an end on 30 June.",
      "Rashford has rediscovered his form whilst playing under Unai Emery and that may have put him back in the shop window. He struggled to strike up a relationship with Ruben Amorim and the Manchester outfit may decide to cut their losses.",
      "If they do their timing could cost them huge sums. Only last summer Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co slapped a £100m price tag on the forward. That figure was enough to see PSG back out of potentially signing the player, who could now leave for well below his previous market value.",
      "United have struggled over the years to time their business right with a number of players leaving once their values had plummeted - some of them recouping no fee whatsoever.",
      "Paul Pogba endured a mixed time at the club but interest in him often remained and he flirted with the exit door. The Red Devils often stuck to their stance that he wasn't for sale, but he later left in the summer of 2022 for nothing when his contract expired.",
      "Jesse Lingard was once linked with a £25m move to West Ham, but the Hammers chose not to pay the fee and the player later left for nothing. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson was once valued at £40m - as per the Daily Star - but later joined Crystal Palace for half of that.",
      "Rashford could be the latest star to leave and ultimately cost United big sums. He is unlikely to have much of a future at his boyhood club whilst Amorim is in charge with the Portuguese boss casting him out soon after arriving in Manchester.",
      "\"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it,\" said the United boss after his exit. \"Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different. I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\""

      "The Canadian striker has been linked with United alongside a host of European giants for many years, having impressed for Lille ever since his move from Gent in 2020. David lifted the Ligue 1 title in his first season and has scored 109 goals in 231 games for Les Dogues, putting him third in the club's all-time goalscorer charts.",
      "That kind of output would be ideal for United, who've prioritised signing a striker in the summer transfer window. The Red Devils want an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, who've scored a combined 17 goals this season compared to David's 25.",
      "The 25-year-old has also chipped in with 12 assists, as Lille head into the final day on Saturday battling for fourth place which would earn them a spot in the Europa League. But if they qualify, David won't be a part of it.",
      "\"I wanted to tell you myself that after so many years at the club, it's time for me to say goodbye,\" he said in a video posted on Instagram. \"I've spent five wonderful seasons here, I know it hasn't always been easy, but I hope that with my goals and celebrations, I've managed to bring you some joy, especially with the French championship title and the Champions Trophy.\"",
      "Thanking his team-mates, David added: \"I know I didn't have the easiest start, but you've always been behind me, you've supported me through the tough times, and for that, I'll keep you in my heart.\"",
      "The Canada international has most recently been linked with Napoli as well as Barcelona and Newcastle. David isn't the only striker on United's radar either, with Liam Delap understood to be their No.1 target and available for £30million following Ipswich's relegation.",
      "But the fact that United wouldn't have to pay a fee for David could sway them. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made it clear the Red Devils are in a precarious financial position which makes winning the Europa League final against Tottenham next Wednesday even more important, as it'd guarantee them a place in next season's Champions League which is worth roughly £100m."

      "Those making it onto this year list needed to scrape by on at least £350million. At the top is Indian-born British businessman Gopi Hinduja and his family, with a wealth put at £35.billion, though down from £37billion last year.",
      "The list took in both inherited wealth and self-made tycoons. The latter includes ex-market trader Tom Morris, who is behind booming discount chain Home Bargains, and is known as Liverpool’s richest man. The publicity-shy businessman is in 26th place on the list, with his fortune growing from £6.67billion to almost £7billion.",
      "Talking of Liverpool, new entrants this year include Tom and Phil Beahon, the brothers who launched Castore, the sporting brand worn by England’s rugby and cricket teams. They started the business from their parents’ Liverpool home, and have hit the big leagues at £350million, despite still being aged in their 30s.",
      "Interviewed by the Mirror in 2023, former Tranmere Rovers footballer Tom Beahon said he still drove his old VW Polo. “I am still the proud owner of a white VW Polo that must be seven, eight years old. I still drive that,” he said. “I’ve not been on holiday for a while. Neither my brother nor I are massively materialistic people.”",
      "King Charles could only make it to 238rd on the list, though his estimated fortune has risen from £610million to £640million. That put him on level pegging with former Tory PM Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty.",
      "Meanwhile, the godfather to both Prince George and Prince Archie has lost a whopping £243million in the last 12 months. But the Duke of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, was still ranked as the 14th wealthiest man in Britain with an overall family wealth of £9.8billion.",
      "The Rich List also includes a host of celebrities, including Rolling Stones’ legends Sir Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, each with a wealth of £440million - up from £415million in 2024 - and putting them in joint 295th place. Above them is Sir Elton John, with the Rocket Man in 283rd, having amassed a cool £475million of wealth.",
      "Notable entries from the world of sport include FI ace Sir Lewis Hamilton, whose estimated wealth has accelerated from £350million to £385million in the past year. And after just celebrating his 50th birthday in lavish style, David Beckham - along with wife Victoria - are said to be worth half a billion, and up from £455million in 2024. That said, it comes amid reports of ongoing tensions within the Beckham family.",
      "manchester-united-fc>Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's fortunes match the team's performance on the pitch, as it emerged his wealth had plunged by an estimated £6.5billion in the past year. The chemicals magnate, whose Ineos Group bought a near 28% stake in United in February 2024, was the biggest faller on this year’s The Sunday Times Rich List.",
      "The 72-year-old is still worth an eye-watering £17billion, but has slipped to seventh place - having led the rankings of Britain’s mega-wealthy in 2018. The slump was fuelled by losses at his Ineos empire, where debts have grown. The group has also been impacted by US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs.",
      "It emerged as his struggling United team take on fellow under-performers Tottenham in the Europa League final on Wednesday. However, he is far from alone when it comes to a drop among the super-rich.",
      "Finally, Barbara Broccoli and half brother Michael G Wilson are said be worth £450million after relinquishing creative control of the 007 James Bond movies to Amazon.",
      "Luke Hildyard, executive director of think tank the High Pay Centre, said: “The Rich List is a useful annual reminder of the inefficiency of the UK economy. It shows a small fall in the value of oligarch assets this year, but over a longer period it illustrates how a tiny handful of very rich people have captured an increasing share of the country’s wealth.",
      "If the super-rich and the companies they own were taxed more effectively and paid the people that work for them a better wage, living standards in Britain would be much higher. Meanwhile the Rich List entrants would still be extremely rich by any reasonable person’s definition and well rewarded for whatever success they have achieved.”",
      "This year’s list of 350 individuals and families together hold combined wealth of £772.8billion - 3% down on last year.",
      "Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, said: “Our billionaire count is down and the combined wealth of those who feature in our research is falling. We are also finding fewer of the world’s super-rich are coming to live in the UK.”",
      "He warned there was growing anger among the mega-rich about the expected abolition of non-dom status and tax changes. That is despite millions of ordinary families struggling to make ends mean and Chancellor Rachel Reeves forced to slash spending, and unleash welfare cuts, to plug a blackhole in the government’s finances left by the Tories."

      "Incoming Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso was asked about Florian Wirtz, who currently plays under him at Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Madrid have been linked with the German playmaker, who has also been mentioned in connection with Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Liverpool with an asking price north of £100million.",
      "\"Whatever he does, I am really close to Flo and I will be happy for him,\" Alonso said, per the ECHO. \"Let's wait a little bit. It's normal in football that there are rumours, especially with such a special player.",
      "\"There were rumours (in the past), there are rumours today and there will be rumours in the future. You need to deal with them and not take them too seriously.\"",
      "Leicester boss Ruud van Nistelrooy has confirmed this weekend's game against Ipswich will be Jamie Vardy's last for the club.",
      "The striker will leave at the end of the season, and will sit out the season finale against Bournemouth as he decides on his next move.",
      "\"It was clear in his announcement that he would leave Leicester and he would play his last game against Ipswich. That's what we respect,\" Van Nistelrooy told reporters.",
      "Bayern Munich chief Max Eberl has claimed Florian Wirtz is \"free to visit Liverpool, Manchester and Madrid\" after reports emerged of the Bayer Leverkusen sensation heading to England as he weighs up his future.",
      "Wirtz is one of the hottest properties in Germany and is reviewing his option as talk of his Leverkusen exit ramps up. Bayern have long been the home of Germany's major stars and have, for years, raided their rivals for their top talent. Wirtz is very much on their radar but the 22-year-old has several admirers in the Premier League and reportedly flew to English soil this week.",
      "Eberl has addressed the situation and said: \"If Florian Wirtz and his family made this trip, they'll have their reasons. It's not our place to comment on that. Florian Wirtz is free to visit Liverpool, Manchester, Madrid or whatever with his family and friends.\"",
      "He then added on the club's transfer plans this summer: \"There's a lot of speculation in Munich, and everyone has their own opinion. Of course, that doesn't make things easy. With the Club World Cup, this summer is obviously special. I try to ignore it as much as possible.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta has been told that keeping William Saliba amid interest from Real Madrid will stop them from regressing to the Arsenal of old. Saliba, 24, has impressed again this season to give the Gunners, statistically, the best defence in the Premier League.",
      "The France international has two years left on his contract and Arsenal are keen to tie him down on a new long-term deal. Talks over a new contract have begun and Saliba, who remains happy at the club, is seeking an increase on his £190,000-a-week wages.",
      "Former Gunner Emmanuel Petit told Casinozonderlimiet: \"If Arsenal were to lose William Saliba, it would remind me of the days they needed money after moving to the Emirates, they don't need to do that anymore. Arsenal have the cash to spend and they need to build on their current team and add strikers and wingers while keeping hold of their defenders.\"",
      "Sometimes it is nothing, often it is something. RB Leipzig have just released their kit for next season with Xavi Simons among those showing it off, but they've not included star man Benjamin Sesko is another snaps.",

      "Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca admits he \"100 percent\" wants a new frontman to provide competition for Nicolas Jackson. The Senegal international has been relied upon to lead the line since arriving at the Blues, but there is a lack of depth beyond him.",
      "The Blues head into the final two games of the Premier League season without the suspended Jackson, who was red carded at Newcastle last weekend. Youngster Marc Guiu is the only other recognised No9 in Maresca’s squad, but he has been injured since the start of February.",
      "The Chelsea boss was non-committal when quizzed over whether Jackson has struggled without anyone to apply pressure on him, almost guaranteeing him starting role, but was adamant he wanted reinforcements bought in.",
      "He said: “I'm not able to answer now because I don't know the other part, if a No 9 was here. For sure, with us, in my personal opinion, he has grown and improved a lot. Now if another No9 was here is it better for him? I don't know.” When asked whether he wanted someone to provide competition going forward Maresca then added: “100 per cent”.",
      "Man United have the chance to sign Jonathan David on a free transfer this summer after he confirmed that he's leaving Lille. David, 25, won't sign a new contract with the French club and move on to pastures new when his current deal expires on June 30.",
      "The Canadian striker has been linked with United alongside a host of European giants for many years, having impressed for Lille ever since his move from Gent in 2020. David lifted the Ligue 1 title in his first season and has scored 109 goals in 231 games for Les Dogues, putting him third in the club's all-time goalscorer charts.",
      "Fabio Vieira is set to return to Arsenal this summer, with Porto unlikely to bring him back to Portugal. Vieira joined the Gunners in the summer of 2022 but was unable to live up to expectations.",
      "He was sent out on loan to Porto ahead of this season, but struggled to cement a place with the Portugese giants. While he has eventually found a regular spot in the team, Record claim that Porto are unlikely to pursue a permanent deal for him.",
      "Dean Huijsen is poised to snub his array of Premier League suitors in order to sign for Real Madrid after the Spanish giants officially approached Bournemouth for their talented centre-half.",
      "Huijsen, 20, has admirers at Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea amongst others after a stellar maiden season in the Premier League. But BBC Sport have confirmed that Real Madrid have agreed to pay the defender's £50m release clause with a deal now close to being agreed.",
      "Los Blancos want the youngster to feature for them in the Club World Cup next month alongside Trent Alexander-Arnold, though they have yet to agree terms with Liverpool for the right-back's early release.",
      "Rayan Cherki, who was a star when Lyon came to Manchester in the last eight of the Europa League, and his representatives are working hard to find their client a new club, according to Caught Offside. The attacking midfielder has been offered to United and Liverpool ahead of the summer transfer window opening.",
      "United are thought to be keen on Cherki given that he has a low price tag of around £19m. His influence in the final third would be a huge plus for Amorim and the club are actively seeking to bolster their attacking resources.",
      "Federico Chiesa is in talks with Napoli over a potential loan move with negotiations at an advanced stage, according to Gazzetta dello Sport. The Italian outlet claims that Chiesa, 27, is keen on a return to Italy after a hugely frustrating 12 months on Merseyside.",
      "The report outlines that the two sides are currently locked in a disagreement over the structure of the deal, with Liverpool pushing for an obligation so the Serie A outfit must sign Chiesa permanently while Napoli would prefer an option.",
      "Wrexham frontman Steven Fletcher admits he is leaving Wrexham \"and not by choice\" as the Championship new boys make some ruthless calls with their recruitment and retention this summer. The Welsh outfit have completed the incredible feat of three successive promotion.",
      "The former Scottish international was a huge coup when he originally arrived at the Racecourse Ground, but the club have now decided to part ways, much to the player's frustration as he confessed he was departing \"with a heavy heart\".",
      "Fletcher has eight goals this past season as Wrexham achieved automatic promotion from League One, but will now be on the lookout for a new club as Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney look to prep the squad for the second tier. Goalkeeper Mark Howard – who had figured in all three of Wrexham's successive promotions – also revealed he would not be staying once his current deal expired.",
      "Man United are looking to land Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo this summer - and have been told that the Cherries will let him go for £60m, reports the Independent. The Red Devils have made contact over a summer deal, but do face competition.",
      "Arsenal, who themselves need to add more firepower, are thought to be closely monitoring the situation. Bournemouth are in a strong position when it comes to negotiations over Semenyo and won't be pressurised into his exit.",
      "Doubts are starting to emerge that Arsenal can wrap up a deal for Martin Zubimendi. It appeared earlier this week that the midfielder was on the verge of completing a move to the Gunners.",
      "But according to AS, Zubimendi is yet to officially sign a contract with Mikel Arteta's men. That has opened the door to Real Madrid, who are now looking to steal in under Arsenal's noses. Madrid hope the impending arrival of new boss Xabi Alonso can convince Zubimendi to move to the Bernabeu instead.",
      "Liverpool will trigger Jeremie Frimpong's £30m release clause to make the former Manchester City youngster their first summer signing with the Anfield hierarchy poised to approach Bayer Leverkusen imminently.",
      "Frimpong, 24, has emerged as the standout candidate to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold next season with the Reds right-back poised to complete a free transfer to Real Madrid.",
      "The opportunity to move to the Premier League is understood to appeal to Frimpong, whose camp have already held talks over personal terms with Liverpool.",
      "Marcus Rashford believes Man United would be willing to sell him for £40m to anyone this summer - not just Aston Villa.",
      "The 27-year-old moved to Villa Park several months ago in a loan deal that included a £40m option-to-buy clause, but that figure could be enough to tempt those at Old Trafford, regardless of who pays it.",
      "The clause does not prevent another outfit signing the forward, who has got closer to his best form since leaving Manchester.",
      "Arsenal's extensive search for a new striker for the 2025-26 campaign will see them make a move for either Viktor Gyokeres or Benjamin Sesko during the upcoming summer transfer window.",
      "The Gunners were hit by injuries to Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus during the second half of the season as their Premier League title bid wilted and, after opting to keep their powder dry in January, they are now prepared to spend big on a new No.9 to bolster Mikel Arteta's options in attack.",
      "A host of names have been linked with a move to The Emirates in recent months - and it now seems as though Arsenal's striker search has been narrowed down to two possible options.",

      "Manchester United's summer business will likely be determined by whether or not they win next week's Europa League final - which will either see them in the Champions League next year or without European football entirely.",
      "Ruben Amorim will be eyeing success, which will then allow him to invest in his squad. The current situation in Manchester doesn't make for good reading but the Portuguese manager is yet to get in the players that will properly compliment his philosophy.",
      "United are heavily linked with Matheus Cunha, who has thrived at Wolves. Liam Delap is also very much on their radar after an impressive season at Ipswich and scoring goals has been a major issue in Manchester - especially with their frontmen underdelivering.",
      "With that in mind attacking reinforcements are high up on the shortlist - as are wing-backs. The 3-4-3 system means that players with specific skillsets are needed and we take a look at who Amorim and co are eyeing up this summer.",

      "The frontman, who is also on Newcastle's radar, only signed a new contract last year and the Cherries will be looking to avoid a mass exodus this summer with a number of their leading lights linked with the exit door.",
      "United chief Jason Wilcox is on the lookout for a new academy coach with Adam Lawrence leaving to pursue opportunities as first-team boss. The 39-year-old has had several offers and is now weighing up his options - but that has left a void at Carrington.",
      "Lawrence's exit had been likely and he's looking to work in a first-team environment but is equally open to a fresh academy challenge. Wilcox and Nick Cox are now eyeing someone to replace the outgoing coach with talks already underway, reports the MEN.",
      "Wilcox is among those bought to Manchester under the Sir Jim Ratcliffe reign and serves as technical director, but did step in as sporting director. Earlier in his career Wilcox himself was the academy director at Manchester City and has proven himself in that capacity.",

      "And with under fire head coach Ruben Amorim still looking to guide the club to Europa League final glory against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao next week with the prize of a spot in next season’s Champions League on the line, there is a pressing need for improvements in attack.",
      "But Bent reckons an experienced figure should be the priority to help develop Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish youngster has scored just four goals this season - compared to a dozen for Delap at relegated Ipswich - and Bent feels having two relatively inexperienced men up top would be a mistake.",
      "“You’re talking about 16 Premier League goals between them: four for Rasmus and 12 for Liam,” Bent told talkSPORT.",
      "“Listen, I’m a big fan of his [Delap]. Watching him week in, week out, of course he’s improved so much and the confidence that he’s got in his own ability, the confidence he’s got to go up against anybody. He doesn’t care who it is, he won’t get overawed by anyone.",
      "“What you don’t want is to have two young centre-forwards. This is his first full season in the Premier League.",
      "“To go from Ipswich, who were in the Championship last season, to Manchester United and be expected to lead the line and score the goals…",
      "“It might work. I think he’s got the confidence within himself to do it but there’s going to be dips in his form, goal droughts, and that’s where you need maybe that elder statesman to learn from.”",
      "Delap, who joined Ipswich from Manchester City last summer, has plenty of admirers with Chelsea among the other Premier League clubs maintaining a keen interest.",
      "He is expected to depart Portman Road because of a relegation clause of £30m built into his contract. That fee will still see The Tractor Boys double their initial investment of £15m in the all action centre forward."

      "Real Madrid are keen on a move for the Benfica left back Alvaro Carreras but Manchester United could still have a significant say over whether a deal is completed, according to reports.",

      "But now Real, who are set to welcome in Xabi Alonso as their new head coach next month following confirmation that Carlo Ancelotti will depart when La Liga concludes next week, are keen on a deal in addition to bringing in Trent Alexander-Arnold as a free agent when his Liverpool contract expires.",
      "Benfica will allow Carreras to leave for a fee of €50m but Spanish outlet Marca have suggested that Real are weighing up whether to liaise with United in very strange circumstances.",

      "The majority who do not play tonight can effectively be discounted as a starter against Spurs. The only allowance Amorim could make is for Leny Yoro, given how recent his foot injury was.",

      "Last week marked the first time United have gone seven league games without a win since November 1992. Weeks after that winless run, Eric Cantona was paraded at Old Trafford.",
      "It is too late for a signing to save this league season for United and more records could still tumble before next week's finale against Aston Villa. Fail to beat Chelsea tonight and it is the first eight-game winless streak in the league since January 1990, the last season that United finished in the bottom half.

      "The Moroccan played in a back three against West Ham, with Amad on the right. That seemed to be a dress rehearsal for their possible roles against Spurs and the injury to Yoro should not necessarily have a bearing on that.",
      "Yet if Yoro is out, Amorim will have to consider Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof. Shaw was taken off at the same time as Yoro against West Ham to protect him amid the spate of injuries at centre back. Lindelof lined up in both semi-final legs against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Ayden Heaven has travelled with the squad for tonight's game but he hasn't played since the 3-0 win over Leicester two months ago.",
      "Where does Amad start?",
      "Whatever United's best team is, Amad has to be in it. Amorim has played Amad on the wing and as one of the two No.10s since his return from an ankle injury two weeks ago.",

      "The switch of the away end at Stamford Bridge from the east stand to the Shed End in 2005 has seen the ground host some raucous United atmospheres over the past 20 years. The ridiculous 7pm Sunday night kick-off United had at Leicester in March made no difference to United's supporters, who were in their finest voice all season.",
      "A similar atmosphere is probable this evening. United are five days out from a European final and their matchgoers will sing about it incessantly. Some will doubtless remain in London and fly to Bilbao from Heathrow or Gatwick."

      "The Reds have endured a torrid campaign that could be rescued by victory over Tottenham in the Europa League final next week. But even success there, and the Champions League place on offer, won't change the need United have for new recruits.",
      "The squad has been found wanting time and again this term and Amorim will be keen to stamp his mark on the side in his first summer transfer window in charge. The Portuguese has jettisoned the likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony and several other players will be released or sold at the end of the campaign.",
      "It means new faces are inevitable and Amorim mooted the possibility of signing another centre back this summer after Leny Yoro picked up an injury that could rule him out for the rest of the campaign and beyond.",
      "Yet striking such a deal will not be straightforward. United are sailing close to the wind on Profit and Sustainability rules and have several areas of the squad in need of surgery.",
      "Centre back isn't really one. Amorim has Lisandro Martinez, Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as senior options in a back three, while young prospect Ayden Heaven has shown his potential this season and Noussair Mazrouri has slotted in.",
      "Even with Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans set to depart this summer and the injury record of some of those defensive options, moving for another central back feels a risk when United will have to box clever with their signings.",
      "The priority is in attack given United's struggles in front of goal. The Reds have failed to score in 14 games this season. Striker Rasmus Hojlund has struggled to find the net with any regularity while Joshua Zirkee looks more at home in one of the number 10 roles.",
      "Wolves playmaker Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap are leading targets and both players have release clauses. The latter will be available for £30million while Cunha could move to Old Trafford for £62.5million with the player keen on a deal.",
      "A new midfielder is also on the wish list with Christian Eriksen set to leave when his contract ends while Casemiro's future remains uncertain and Kobbie Mainoo has yet to agree terms on a new deal.",
      "Those two areas of the squad are the most pressing while there is an argument to say United need a goalkeeper and a wing-back before another centre half.",
      "The Reds will also need to raise funds if they are to sign several players this summer and hope to offload at least 10 players. Jadon Sancho, Antony, Marcus Rashford and Tyrell Malacia are already out on loan."

      "The sight of Leny Yoro limping his way down the touchline during the second half of Manchester United's 2-0 defeat to West Ham United last weekend was the last thing Ruben Amorim needed.",
      "United were already without Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez. Yoro was forced off less than ten minutes into the second half after going down clutching his left foot. His absence, along with De Ligt's, from Wednesday morning's open training session at Carrington sparked fears he could be in danger of missing next week's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",
      "Those fears were confirmed later in the day when Amorim said: \"I don't know if they're going to be available, we'll try to push, it's a final, all the players want to play really bad. I don't think they will not go to Chelsea but we'll have some of them for the final.\"",
      "The prospect of De Ligt and Yoro both missing the final will leave United light on options at centre-back. Martinez will not play again this season and Heaven, despite being back in the squad for the trip to Chelsea, will need time to build up his sharpness after two months without playing.",
      "It means Amorim could find himself boarding the plane to Bilbao next week with a senior centre-back pool of Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and Heaven.",
      "Maguire, regardless of what happens with De Ligt and Yoro between now and the middle of next week, should start against Spurs. He has continued his renaissance this season and has played a starring role in United's Europa League campaign.",
      "However, Lindelof, despite starting both legs of the semi-final triumph against Athletic Bilbao, and Evans, have not been front and centre of United's defence this season. The pair of them are also highly likely to be released this summer.",
      "Amorim may find himself having to ask Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw to tuck into the back-three and operate as the wide centre-backs either side of Maguire.",
      "Mazraoui, who was originally signed last summer to challenge Diogo Dalot at right-back in a back-four, has often played at centre-back under Amorim. The prospect of him starting at right-sided centre-back would open the door for Amad to start at right wing-back, or possibly Dalot, who is also fighting to be fit in time for the final.",
      "On the other side of Maguire, Shaw is realistic option to start. Since making his long-awaited return from injury in April, the former Southampton man has made seven appearances, with practically all of his game time coming as a left-sided centre-back.",
      "His left-footed profile offers United balance and he lacks the athleticism to operate as a wing-back in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. Heaven, too, is left-footed and is in contention to feature in the capital, but it feels unlikely that he will be thrown straight in after a spell on the sidelines.",
      "It means Amorim could set out his blueprint for the Europa League final by selecting a back-three of Mazraoui, Maguire and Shaw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge this evening, which would mark the first time they have started alongside each other as the three centre-backs..",
      "Amorim has hinted that he plans to name a strong XI for the trip to the capital, meaning he must strike the right balance between ensuring his players maintain their match sharpness and not taking any unnecessary risks on key players ahead of the tussle with Spurs.",
      "Tyler Fredricson has had a few opportunities in the Premier League of late, but he is very unlikely to start against Spurs, meaning Amorim may overlook him against Chelsea and instead experiment with a back-three that could easily end up starting in Spain."

      "Monday, December 30, appeared to be the night that Joshua Zirkzee would never recover from at Manchester United.",
      "With just two days remaining before the January transfer window opened, Zirkzee was jeered off the pitch by United supporters as he was replaced before half-time by Ruben Amorim against Newcastle. To be clear, no individual player covered themselves in glory that night but Zirkzee was not the worst player on that pitch.",
      "His reaction to the response from the crowd looked to have broken him. Visibly upset, he headed for the tunnel before re-emerging and watching the remainder of the game from the bench.",
      "It was hard to see how any player would recover from that never mind a player who had struggled so much until that point. Fast forward to the end of the season and while Zirkzee has been missing since April with an injury, you have to feel that United would be foolish to accept a £35m offer for him this summer.",
      "Corriere dello Sport understands that Inter Milan believe Zirkzee is a target for the summer to bolster their attack and would be willing to pay £35m plus bonuses for him. However, the catch is the first reason why United should reject the offer.",
      "It is understood they would like to loan him for the entirety of next season and then pay for the forward at the end of next season. Looking solely at the money, while £35m is a good offer for Zirkzee, there is very little to be gained from allowing the forward to play next season out on loan when the cash is needed now.",
      "There is no secret that United are in the midst of financial trouble and need to sell in order to fund a rebuild which is desperately needed. But the only benefit of agreeing to a loan with option to buy deal is that it would take Zirkzee's wage off the bill - that's it.",
      "There would be no added funds to the transfer budget and that seems foolish. Secondly, there is no great rush to let Zirkzee leave the club this summer.",
      "After the Newcastle incident, Zirkzee was used more and more as a No.10 in the Amorim 3-4-2-1 system. Suddenly, in a deeper role, he looked more comfortable and that could hugely benefit United moving forward.",
      "If £35m was put to United in the January transfer window, it may have been too tempting to turn down. However, as we head into the summer transfer window it feels like Zirkzee should be given a fresh slate next season, in the No.10 role on rotation to see how he does."

      "Manchester United's pursuit of Liam Delap won't be worthwhile unless they sign an experienced forward for the England under-21 international to learn from, too.",
      "That is the frank verdict of United legend Paul Scholes, who is a fan of Delap but isn't sure the Ipswich Town forward will be able to solve United's goalscoring woes alone next season.",
      "United are keen to sign the 22-year-old this summer and he has a £30million release clause in his contract at Portman Road. Alongside Wolves' Matheus Cunha, Delap has been identified as one of United's top targets this summer.",
      "Despite Ipswich's relegation from the Premier League, Delap has scored 12 goals this season and he has been linked with a move to the likes of Newcastle, Tottenham and Chelsea, too.",
      "By contrast, United's two current forwards Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have only managed seven Premier League goals between them this term.",
      "Hojlund, 22, and Zirkzee, 23, have struggled to flourish under the weight of expectation that is placed on a United forward and Scholes fears Delap, who is of a similar age profile to the pair, may also suffer similar woes at Old Trafford.",
      "\"But he still needs one or two more strikers with him who have got some experience. We’ve been down this road with Rasmus Hojlund coming in as a young striker, and it hasn’t quite worked out so far.",
      "\"Again, Delap could be another young striker going to a big club, and you just don’t know what to expect with the club not in a great place at the minute.",
      "\"I always say that Manchester United should have three or four top strikers. Right now, they’ve got one who hasn’t really done it, so to sign Delap would be great, but he has to be part of two or three proper centre-forwards.\""

      "Amroim will pick his team to face Chelsea with the Europa League final at the forefront of his thinking, and it would be sensible not to pick any players who will start against Tottenham.",
      "The only problem with that is Amorim might be forced to pick some players who he intends to start at the Estadio de San Mames. United have a handful of injuries in the squad, which means even a second-string team at Stamford Bridge may require the presence of two starters for Bilbao.",
      "Those players could be Andre Onana and Alejandro Garnacho. Amorim rested Onana from the squad against West Ham last weekend, but goalkeepers have minimal injury risk and he should be recalled.",
      "Onana is prone to making errors and he feels like the kind of goalkeeper who needs to play before a final, so it might be asking for trouble to parachute him back into the team at the Estadio de San Mames.",
      "Amorim shouldn't lose too much sleep over the prospect of starting Onana because his injury risk is low, although he's probably got a slight headache over the remainder of the team.",
      "When you pick a reserve team to face Chelsea, the options are limited and picking an academy player to start in one of the No.10 roles would be the answer to give Garnacho a rest.",
      "But which youngster could fill in? Jack Moorhouse has been named in a handful of matchday squads and would be perfect for the role, however, he was absent from the Under-21s' final games of the season and wasn't in first-team training on Wednesday.",

      "It's possible that Amorim doesn't believe there is a youngster from the academy who is ready to start in the left No.10 position against Chelsea, though. And in that case, he would have to take a risk with Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho has made 56 appearances in all competitions this season, working his socks off for United again. Garnacho's finishing can leave a lot to be desired at times, but the winger has actually had an underrated season and everyone seems to forget that he's still only 20.",
      "United must have Garnacho in their starting team in Bilbao, so resting him at Stamford Bridge is the best option, but it does feel like he could be given another start in London on Friday.",
      "Garnacho deserves huge credit for his robustness. He has only picked up an ankle injury since he broke into the first-team in 2022 and he's almost always been available for selection.",

They are well structured defensively and their set pieces is one of the best in the Premier League. It’s a final. If we play against Palace or Aston Villa it would be the same. It’s a final, we cannot expect anything different.”"

      "The Red Devils allowed the Brazil international to leave Old Trafford and move to Real Betis on loan until the end of the season in the winter transfer window.",
      "Man Utd spent around £87m on Antony in the summer of 2022 but he made very little impact in his two-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony contributed just five Premier League goals and three assists in 62 appearances with the 25-year-old making no league starts this season before the Red Devils offloaded him to Betis.",
      "But the Brazilian has been impressing in La Liga with the winger contributing eight goals and two assists in 23 matches in all competitions for the Spanish outfit.",

      "READ: ‘Arrogant’ Arsenal star, five Man Utd flops, only one Spurs man in ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of 2024/25",
      "But now reports in Spain claim that his continuation at Real Betis beyond this season has been ‘seriously complicated’ and the ‘main obstacle is qualifying for the Champions League’.",
      "It now looks almost certain that Real Betis will finish outside the top five in La Liga and that ‘directly affects the club’s financial aspirations, which would be unable to afford either a loan with advantageous terms or a permanent signing of the player.’",
      "Man Utd have told Antony that he is ‘not in their plans for next season’ with the Red Devils ‘looking for a way out for him, preferably through another loan, in the hope that he will maintain his form and increase his market value’.",
      "And now Villarreal, who look likely to pip Betis to fifth place and a Champions League spot, ‘enters the scene’ and the prospect of moving to El Submarino Amarillo ‘has enticed Antony’s entourage, who are keen to remain in Spain, but with a team with greater international exposure’.",
      "The Brazilian would ‘would fit perfectly into the manager’s plans’ at Villarreal with the Spanish club having the ‘upper hand’ over rivals Real Betis.",
      "It is understood that ‘what is clear’ is that Antony ‘will leave Manchester United again, and his destiny will be determined by the most ambitious project he faces.’",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen recently advised Antony to stay at Real Betis as he “has no future” at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "According to reports, one ‘beleaguered’ Manchester United star ‘faces’ being offloaded this summer, while three potential replacements have been mooted.",
      "Former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs has named four current Red Devils stars with no “way back” under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "These six could all move this summer – three are basically confirmed, and Kevin De Bruyne is certain to leave City. We reckon Arsenal should take a look.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could scupper Tottenham Hotspur’s hopes of signing England international Angel Gomes on a free transfer.",
      "Spurs in Norway on an artificial pitch? Nothing to worry about, lads. Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta must inspire an Arsenal comeback against PSG.",

      "Manchester City and Chelsea somehow escape unscathed, while Liverpool – predictably – have no representatives in the ‘Big Eight’ Premier League Worst XI of the season; Manchester United have five.",
      "To keep things fair, this team only includes players who’ve made at least 20 appearances and 10 starts in the Premier League this season. Match ratings come via WhoScored, so don’t blame us — blame the algorithm.",
      "",
      "GK: Andre Onana (Manchester United) – 6.52\nEvery goalkeeper has a clanger in them – it comes with the territory when you’re playing in the most high-risk position on the pitch. But this is a particularly erratic bunch. Robert Sanchez, Guglielmo Vicario and Onana have all been walking VAR checks at times, while Emiliano Martinez, Ederson and Nick Pope aren’t exactly bastions of reliability either. Even David Raya and Alisson have had wobbles, though they’re clearly less error-prone than the rest.",
      "The algorithm has Onana rock bottom of the lot, and it’s hard to argue. Four errors leading to a shot and three leading directly to goals in the Premier League – plus a bizarre knack for making himself look smaller in his goal – make him a prime candidate to be replaced. If United had a bigger budget, Ruben Amorim would surely axe him.",
      "",
      "RB: Archie Gray (Spurs) – 6.17\nWe do feel for young Archie Gray. He’s filled in at right-back, centre-back and left-back in an injury-ravaged Spurs side, with the occasional reward of a cameo in midfield – his actual position.",
      "It’s been a turbulent season for Ange Postecoglou and his squad, and the algorithm has picked out Gray as the scapegoat, somehow making him the only Spurs player in the ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of the season.",
      "Clocking up 1,563 Premier League minutes is no small feat, but playing here, there and everywhere, rarely in his natural role, probably isn’t doing wonders for his development.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.33\nAnother teenager enduring a bruising introduction to Premier League life. Leny Yoro’s debut season has been littered with injury setbacks, and limping off against West Ham on Sunday now puts his Europa League final place in doubt.",
      "That would be a fitting end to a stop-start campaign. United were warned about his fitness record before splashing £52million on him from Lille last summer. A metatarsal injury in just his second appearance ruled him out for months, and he didn’t make his Premier League debut until December 4.",
      "There’s clearly loads of potential – no-one’s disputing that – and it’s been a brutal year for just about everyone at Old Trafford. But this has been far from the ideal start for the 19-year-old in particular.",
      "",
      "CB: Pau Torres (Aston Villa) – 6.41\nA bit of experience at the back, but not quite the calming influence Aston Villa hoped for. Pau Torres looked a smart signing after arriving from Villarreal in July 2023, settling quickly into Unai Emery’s system. But things have unravelled somewhat in 2024/25.",
      "Villa’s January-February wobble – one win in seven with Torres injured – seemed to underline his importance. But since returning to fitness, he’s played in just four of their last eight games, all wins, and isn’t looking quite as undroppable as he once did.",
      "With calls for Tyrone Mings to get the nod over him, Torres suddenly feels more like a rotation option than a defensive cornerstone.",
      "",
      "LB: Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal) – 6.41\nJamie Carragher compared him to Wayne Rooney and Jude Bellingham, praising his “football arrogance” – and it’s been a pretty spectacular breakthrough season for Myles Lewis-Skelly. But two red cards have dragged down his average rating enough to sneak him into this back four.",

      "With Joelinton ruled out for the season, Willock looked like the natural alternative. But after starts against Ipswich and Brighton, he didn’t feature at all in the win over Chelsea, with Anthony Gordon preferred in a reshuffled XI.",
      "The lack of consistent starts has dragged down his average rating, and Willock ends up with the second-lowest score in this XI – only Gray has fared statistically worse.",

      "It’s been a miserable season all round, but United could still salvage something by beating Eriksen’s former club, Spurs, in next Wednesday’s Europa League final. He’s unlikely to start that one, which means he’ll probably get run-outs against Chelsea and Aston Villa in the final two league games – in a last-gasp attempt to bump his average rating and escape this team. Because obviously, that’s what he really cares about.",
      "",
      "RW: Leon Bailey (Aston Villa) – 6.42\nIn 23 Premier League appearances this season, Leon Bailey has managed a meagre one goal and two assists – and picked up more yellow cards (three) than either.",
      "Injuries continue to hamper the Jamaican, who took a step forward last term but hasn’t kicked on this time around. Villa have coped well without him, and with Marcus Rashford likely to leave, Donyell Malen looks set to leapfrog Bailey in Unai Emery’s pecking order – alongside Jacob Ramsey and Morgan Rogers.",

      "AM: Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United) – 6.32\nSigned from Bologna last summer to ease the burden on Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee looked an instant hit when he scored the winner on his debut against Fulham – but that was the high point for the Dutchman.",
      "The big question remains: where is his best position? It could be attacking midfield, up front, or maybe he’s destined for a Joelinton-style reinvention as a box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Rather than seeing this as a problem, Amorim might do well to view Zirkzee’s versatility as a genuine opportunity.",
      "",
      "LW: Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa) – 6.43\nVilla might feel hard done by having three players in this worst XI, but hey, life isn’t fair, and the algorithm doesn’t lie.",
      "Ramsey’s red card against Bournemouth last weekend didn’t do his average rating any favours, helping land him a spot in this unfortunate XI after making the worst team of the weekend.",
      "With one goal and five assists from 28 Premier League games in 2024/25, it’s a disappointing return for a player with top talent. Still, at 23, he’s one of the brightest young talents in Emery’s squad.",
      "",
      "ST: Rasmus Hojlund (Manchester United) – 6.27\nIt’s hard to say anything about Hojlund that hasn’t already been said – the young Dane frustrates United fans every week, doing everything possible to make his £70m price tag feel like yet another colossal transfer disaster at Old Trafford.",
      "In 30 Premier League appearances this season, he’s managed a miserable four goals. Whatever excuses you want to make for United’s struggles or his age, that return is nowhere near good enough for a striker who cost so much.",

      "Only including available players and those with meaningful minutes this season, here is a Chelsea and Manchester United combined XI based on WhoScored match ratings in the 2024/25 Premier League.",
      "",
      "GK: Robert Sanchez (Chelsea) – 6.58\nDebates like Sanchez vs Andre Onana are exactly why we copped out with the WhoScored rating process. Both are error-prone but capable of world-class acrobatics. Unfortunately, the errors feel more frequent these days.",
      "What Onana does have over Sanchez is continuity: he’s United’s undisputed No.1, thanks in no small part to Altay Bayindir being extremely dodgy. Sanchez has rotated with Filip Jorgensen but has been Chelsea’s first choice for most of the league season. He should start on Friday, but a Europa Conference League final starting berth is up for grabs.",
      "",
      "RB: Noussair Mazraoui (Manchester United) – 6.79\nA rare bit of solid recruitment from United, Mazraoui has been quietly reliable since arriving from Bayern Munich for a measly £15m. He’s featured at right-back, left-back and as a wide centre-back in Ruben Amorim’s three-man defence, as well as in attacking midfielder under Erik ten Hag.",
      "He looked more comfortable in a back four for Ten Hag but has still been one of Amorim’s most consistent players. He gets in ahead of Reece James, who’s mostly been used off the bench as Enzo Maresca carefully manages his fitness.",
      "",
      "CB: Tosin Adarabioyo (Chelsea) – 6.67\nAnnoyingly, Tosin’s rating is 0.02 better than Trevoh Chalobah’s, who has formed a solid and settled partnership with Levi Colwill in the latter half of the season. If this was opinion-based, Chalobah would be in.",
      "Still, Tosin – signed on a free from Fulham – has started 13 league games and been a regular in the cups, including 10 of Chelsea’s 12 Conference League fixtures. A shrewd bit of business.",
      "",
      "CB: Levi Colwill (Chelsea) – 6.70\nThe highest-rated options were actually Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez, but the former has only played two league games and the latter’s been out since February with an ACL injury.",
      "Colwill, meanwhile, has been a mainstay for Chelsea, starting 33 of their 36 league matches.",
      "",
      "LB: Diogo Dalot (Manchester United) – 6.84\nDalot has been hit-and-miss under Amorim but the algorithm hasn’t minded too much. He just edges out Marc Cucurella (6.63). Often shuffled around, he’s spent some time at left-back and just about gets the nod here.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Chelsea) – 7.02\nCaicedo has recently been filling in at right-back while Romeo Lavia partners Enzo Fernandez in midfield, but we’re picking players in their natural positions for this XI.",
      "The Ecuadorian has quietly been Chelsea’s most consistent performer this season, and the £105m price tag has stopped being a stick to beat him with — which is always a good sign. He also scored a belter at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture.",
      "",
      "CM: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – 7.20\nUnited’s best player by an absurd distance. Fernandes has been excellent despite the circus around him. Without him, United might have exited Europe months earlier and ended up scrapping with the bottom three.",
      "",
      "RW: Amad Diallo (Manchester United) – 7.17\nFully fit and finding form at the right time. A shame Ten Hag didn’t trust him — might still have a job if he had.",
      "Amorim has recognised Amad’s talent immediately, and the former Sunderland and Rangers loanee has flourished in the 3-4-3 as one of the two wide No.10s.",
      "",
      "AM: Cole Palmer (Chelsea) – 7.35\nThe chippy chips connoisseur ended a ludicrous 18-game goal drought recently, but still has 15 goals and eight assists in 35 league appearances, which tells you how ridiculous his first half of the season was.",
      "He bagged a hat-trick against United at Stamford Bridge last season and will hope to torment them again as Chelsea chase a top-five finish.",
      "",
      "LW: Pedro Neto (Chelsea) – 6.78\nPlenty of wide options, all underwhelming.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s ineligible and wouldn’t start anyway, Mykhaylo Mudryk is still suspended after that failed drugs test, and Alejandro Garnacho is wildly inconsistent. Neto might not be setting the world alight, but he’s probably the best of an unconvincing bunch.",
      "",
      "ST: Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea) – 6.41\nNicolas Jackson would’ve made this XI, but he decided to smash Sven Botman’s jaw and is suspended. So it’s Nkunku by default.",
      "He only has three Premier League goals but remains Chelsea’s second-top scorer across all competitions with 14. A summer move is likely — Liverpool are reportedly sniffing.",

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "What’s the point?\nIn the mailbox, Moses mentioned United don’t have parades for anything but Premier league and Champions league triumphs. What is the point of this self-imposed misery? The europa league is hardly a minor achievement if they do win, why not have a parade? Because you’re above that?",
      "If you can’t enjoy the journey to the top of football there really is no point. If the prem/champions league is the minimum why even have parades then? You should be winning trebles etc.. Treating football like a business where you can only celebrate hitting these benchmarks is just sad. Supporting a football club is not something you must do, why volunteer yourself for this and then treat victories like they’re actually not a good thing.",
      "Maybe I’d understand if it’s below expectations, like if City won the europa league, but United have now been utterly wank (by their lofty standards) for half of the current millenium. I hate United but still think their fans should enjoy a win, also hate Leeds but the parade they had for promotion looked great. I recently was at a Panachaiki (Patras) game where they managed to secure survival in the Greek second tier, hardly the zenith of football but all the locals who’ve watched their team continuously worsen over the past 20 years were having a great time (They’ve since been relegated for financial reasons but oh well). I’ve seen others point out they would be mocked for having a parade, who cares? Maybe this has only really risen with social media, but I cannot think of anything more insecure than not celebrating in case Ty from AFTV calls you a loser.",
      "Also agree totally with Lee (LFC) about Ratcliffe’s self made nonsense and what he forgot to include is when these massive corporations buyout struggling companies, they typically take out big loans, the debt from which is then saddled onto the struggling company they now own so said struggling company also has to pay off the loan used to buy them, as well as a variety of fees from their new owners (Which they avoid tax on!).

The utter joy in Sunderland was a sight to behold. Of course for Coventry fans — or Stockport for that matter, it’s agony, but the point I wanna make is that the playoffs are pure sporting drama — agony and ecstasy.",
      "There’s a lot of talk about how boring the PL season has been — with some truth, to be fair – and it made me wonder whether they’ve considered a playoff for the final CL spot (s)? so Top 4 get into the CL and then 5-8 play off? It would certainly liven things up. One of the joys of the playoffs is that a team can be way off it and still nip in to the final place.Stockport were 10 points better off than us (and it showed, quite often) and yet we’re the ones going to wembley.

      "Late offsides and how to fix them\nI was fortunate enough to have an e-mail published in March’s mailbox about pet peeves, one of which was offside flags being given late for VAR to have the final say.  At the time, I wrote:",
      "Who’s going to admit culpability when a player inevitably gets injured in a “phase of play” that should never have been allowed to continue because an offside wasn’t given in time?",
      "And now, here we are with Taiwo Awoniyi (who I wish a speedy recovery, and I’m sure everyone else does as well).  I sit by a fellow season ticket holder in the Holte End who loses his shit every match when the assistant referee puts the flag up for offside about 2 minutes too late and I remind him every time that “it’s not his/her fault, they’re just doing what they’ve been told to do”.",
      "No amount of evidence or argument will convince me that this rule is a good one – it’s absolutely pointless and basically says VAR has the final say.  If that’s the case, we might as well do away with assistant referees altogether because the only other thing they have to do is flag for fouls or direct which way a throw in is given, with most of those decisions resulting in said assistant referee either not giving it at all or looking blankly at the actual referee waiting for them to give it! (Obviously not a serious suggestion.)",
      "The fix for this is really very, very simple.  If the player is blatantly offside by a considerable visual distance then let the assistant referee put their flag up as they will 99.99% be correct (if they’re not, demote them).  If the player is “close” to being offside to the point where it’s not visually easy to spot, THEN delay the raising of the flag so that VAR can check and confirm afterwards.  Yes, players may still get injured this way but it will be a hell of a lot less than the decisions where they are miles ahead of the last defender.  This makes perfect sense to me and I’d be interested to hear what other readers/commenters think?\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (And whilst we’re at it, keep VAR checks to 30 seconds otherwise the ref’s original call stands as it’s not “clear and obvious”.  You could even pipe the Countdown music out in the stadiums whilst the check is taking place.)",

      "The England international was also linked with Barcelona and other European giants, but his huge salary and poor form proved huge stumbling blocks.",
      "Despite this, Aston Villa decided to take a chance on Rashford after they offloaded Jhon Duran to Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr and he has returned to form away from Man Utd.",

      "His improved form could spark interest from elsewhere and a report from The Boot Room claims his preference is to join Barcelona, who are his ‘priority’.",

      "Aston Villa are currently out of the Champions League spots with two games remaining, but they are level on points with fifth-placed Chelsea and only two behind fourth-placed Manchester City.",
      "Aston Villa have hurdles to overcome to sign Rashford, though. A report from The Telegraph claims he ‘will be able to leave for £40m’, but the Villans ‘do not have first refusal’.",
      "The report explains:",

      "‘Rashford, 27, is one of a host of players that United are believed to be open to selling this summer. He has three years left on his contract at Old Trafford and, at present, is planning to return to Carrington for the start of pre-season training in early July.",
      "‘Nonetheless, it seems unlikely he will play for United again while Amorim remains as head coach and there appears to be a growing acceptance that a move away from his boyhood club would be in the best interests of all parties.",

      "The 21-year-old already has the backing of Liverpool‘s boo boys and has immense potential as a more rounded full-back than Alexander-Arnold with his strength in defensive duels, but it’s a huge ask to step up to being Arne Slot’s preferred right-back after only making 28 Premier League appearances.",
      "FSG appear to be conceding this as they want quality competition for Bradley with ‘advanced talks’ ongoing over signing Frimpong, who comes with similar defensive flaws to Alexander-Arnold but a huge attacking upside.",

      "Man Utd and their owners dominate the Mailbox as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his vulture capitalism are more than a match for the Glazers.",
      "Come on, let’s have some different subjects; mail us at theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Good news\nDelighted to see that Reading have been taken over by a guy that seems, at least from the outside, interested in running a football club and that club being good at football. No community should go through losing a club, and it seemed all too possible.\nDan, Plastic LFC",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe is like Gordon Gekko\nSo Lee wrote in to support Ratcliffe. Just to be clear it’s a different Lee because this Lee would only ever be caught saying Chuck Feeney is a decent billionaire (Google him, it’s a good story ) the rest are just self serving vultures.",
      "There’s a couple of things I’d like to challenge in Lee’s mail",
      "1. We don’t know if Ratcliffe will turn the club around?",
      "2. He’s a self-made billionaire",
      "Answering question 2 will actually answer question 1 so we’ll start there.",
      "There is no such thing as a self made billionaire. Every billionaire starts from a position of middle-class safety in which they have a family which funds their living costs while they build their dream, Jobs, Gates, Musk, all had it. Ratcliffe had two working class parents who had become middle class thanks to their work which gave Ratcliffe the middle class base he needed.",
      "He also got his start in petrochemicals after convincing Esso to pay for his MBA, so that’s three different people who have helped him already but like I said there is no such thing as a self made billionaire.",
      "But this doesn’t mean a billionaire doesn’t work hard, most work long hours and rarely take holidays. So did Jim. But Jim didn’t get where he is by being a brilliant engineer and inventing something amazing or even being a chemical engineer and inventing something. His wealth comes almost entirely from raising private capital which he would then use to buy struggling companies, asset stripping them and moving their headquarters to tax havens.",
      "His chemical businesses in Middlesbrough also regularly just ignore environmental warnings about air and water pollution so if the air and water is terrible – his company is a big reason why.",
      "But his general MO in every case is as follows – identify struggling business with assets which can be sold. Buy very cheap. Immediately cut staff, sell assets, change HQ to tax haven and then pocket the money while publicly claiming the business is struggling and needs to cut costs.\nSound familiar?",
      "Jim is a proud Manc and English man. So proud that he campaigned for Brexit to give Britain back to the British and then once the vote had been taken immediately moved his personal residence to Monaco so he didn’t have to pay UK taxes and support UK services and economy.",
      "Jim is not Lou Gertsner or Warren Buffet who invest in businesses to make them succeed. He’s closer to Gordon Gekko, a vulture capitalist who bends rules (or ignores them) to benefit himself while putting thousands of people out of work.",
      "Will he turn around United? Why don’t we ask the fans of OGC Nice – the other team Ratcliffe owns…",
      "He bought Nice for 100m when they were struggling financially, he immediately came in promising greatness while making massive cuts to staff. Managers last on average 14 months before being fired.",
      "In the six years before Ratcliffe bought the club nice finished in the top 4 three times. Since he bought it? 0 times. At first fans liked Jim as they saw him attending games regularly, this changed within two years especially when Jim was caught saying ‘Nice games just aren’t very interesting to him’.",
      "Today the Nice supporters often protest Jim’s ownership stating he promised a lot and never delivered anything but constant change and chaos.",
      "So my guess….is Jim probably won’t save United. But he will be en excellent bullet shield for the Glazers for a few years.\nLee (the LFC one)",
      "",
      "BBQ fine though\nIt’s simple, United don’t do parades for anything but Premier League and Champions League. Haven’t had a parade since Fergie’s last season.",
      "Kind of of a ‘nothing to see here’ situation this BBQ thing but alas that wouldn’t be clickbaity or allow for DISGRACE and EMBARRASMENT would it.",
      "In fact, United have NEVER held a parade for anything other than the Prem or Champions League… even in Fergie time…. MADNESS",
      "PATHETIC attempt at journalism lol…. AGAIN\nMoses",
      "READ: Why Manchester United must sack Amorim, sell Fernandes, appoint Moyes and raid French side",
      "",
      "Glazers have done a fine job\nHow can you say that the Glazers mismanaged their ownership of Man United? In over 20 years, with minimal input by themselves, they have made hundreds of millions of pounds in personal profit. That seems like brilliant management to me. They even managed to sell a debt ridden business with run down assets for more than they paid for it. Again astounding business.",
      "Hell, the shambles that is the football part of the business even managed to win a trophy every couple years. They can take pride in having won more in the last 20 years than the owners of all but 3 clubs in England (assuming City, ‘pool and Chelsea have actually won more).",
      "How dare you say the Glazers, who bought so much footballing pleasure to the ABU crowd over the last 2 decades are guilty of poor management. After all there are many more ABU’s than MU supporters. By any measure personal to the Glazers they have done a brilliant job of managing the club.\nMurray (life long member of the Anyone But United crowd who was saddened when the Glazers left)",
      "(Erm, they haven’t left; they still own more than 70% of the club – Ed)",
      "",
      "Pashun and wages\nFirstly, some people seem to have issues with Liverpool fans proclaiming themselves as special, or the best in the world, while also booing Trent. Whilst I’m not a fan of booing, it’s probably fair to say that far from being mutually exclusive, they probably go hand in hand.",
      "Typically, fans leave an impression not for their chat about ecumenical matters in the pre-Columbine era, but more for making a massive racket in the stadium and knowing a lot about their players. This might also be called passion and knowledge. It’s therefore no surprise when the outliers do then act like jilted lovers when a player leaves.",
      "On another matter, people often redefine their league failures by quoting where they are in the wages league table. Obviously some clubs pay more than others (I’m looking at the republic of Mancunia), but in the main, professional contracts at elite clubs can give up to 100% extra on top of base salary for hitting performance targets, so is that really any justification? It all sounds a bit chicken and egg to me. Or am I missing something?",
      "To put that sentiment more succinctly, Arsenal will be low wage payers this season because they underachieved in most metrics.\nAdam, LFC",
      "",
      "Trent and ‘family’\nFirst things first, I’m an Arsenal fan so I’m more than likely obnoxious. Just gonna say that up front so all the fans of other clubs can decide whether my opinion is worthy of reading. And yes it is about Trent.",
      "Obviously the Liverpool fans booing a man who has played an important role in winning them everything are stupid, classless, ungrateful, all that. And I also understand that fans are allowed to be stupid and classless. It’s not illegal, it doesn’t necessarily point to a problem with anybody’s character. It’s sport.",
      "You’re not a worse person for booing Trent Alexander-Arnold or for being bitter toward him. But you are stupid, classless, and ungrateful. And you probably don’t have anything in your life worth celebrating if you can’t even celebrate this wonderful footballer, and I mean that sincerely.",
      "What disturbs me about the whole thing is the justification that “he’s one of our own so it hurts more.” That if he’s part of the Liverpool “family” then it makes it even more of a betrayal. Honestly I have to wonder how you treat members of your own family if that’s how you think about it. You should want your family to leave home and spend time experiencing the world. Just because of where he’s born he has to compromise his career to make his family happy? “But we didn’t even get a fee!” Let the man have a life.",
      "I have to wonder how players like Van Dijk and Salah must feel when they see how some of these fans react to “one of our own” leaving his hometown to start a new chapter of his life. Some (often abusive) people are far more horrible to their families than the people they work with and see outside the home, so I have to wonder exactly what kind of person has this sentiment.",
      "Again, you can feel however you want. You’re not better or worse than anyone else for booing your own player (the best right back in the history of the Premier League besides Lauren of course). If you want to allow a thug and a bully like Jamie Carragher to dictate how you feel then be my guest. I’m sure plenty of people will be able to point to other clubs who have booed their own players, been horrible, etc. But I’m not talking about them.",
      "What we saw on Sunday was needlessly small and petty behavior directed toward a club legend, and I don’t think players forget things like that. You’ll never walk alone until you do.\nDeadbeat Cat Dad",
      "",
      "Ronaldo Jnr?\nAm I the only person who finds it completely mental that Cristiano Ronaldo has a 15 year old son playing for Portugal’s U15s? I guess Ronaldo still seems to be 25 in my head.",
      "No idea if the kid is good enough to make it to the men’s team, but it would be one to watch if they both played in the same match (would Sr lose his shit and dock his pocket money if Jr didn’t pass to him?)",
      "Has there ever been a father/son combo in an international match before?\nPhil, Manchester",
      "",
      "FA are actually blameless\nFurther from Paul’s mail earlier about officials not flagging offside at the time they see them, and how this could have prevented the nasty injury suffered by Awoniyi.",
      "I totally agree that the current rules/guidance isn’t necessarily correct but it had to be changed to accommodate VAR.",
      "What I don’t agree with is Paul blaming the FA. They don’t decide the rules which officials follow – it’s IFAB who do this.\nA, LFC, Montreal (stuck up for VAR recently, now the FA – something must be up with me!)",
      "",
      "Beckett is an Evertonian\nI just want to respond to Mick T, Liverpool from his comment on Evertonians and relegation. When I lived in Liverpool, I actually became good friends with a bunch of Evertonians (massive Liverpool fan here) and found them 20+ years ago to be better with the banter (Rafael Beneath Us) and all that. But I always looked at Everton as a kind of second team in my books…happy to support them 36 out of 38 games during the season, etc. But there has been a real shift in them (I blame Jordan Pickford), and they are a supremely bitter club…but also delusional (We won 2-2 at Goodison Park).",
      "And so, let Everton wish for relegation before Liverpool wins a title. I wish Everton a perpetual life of 17th place finishes, staying up on the last day forever, never getting relegated, but always that fear. A sporting equivalent of Waiting for Godot.\nJonathan, Toronto",
      "According to reports, Manchester United staff are ‘dreading even more savage cuts’ if Ruben Amorim’s side lose to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Man United boss Ruben Amorim is doing what Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cost-cutting INEOS crew won’t: paying for staff to attend the Europa League final.",
      "Arsenal are seemingly ‘lucky’ that they play in the Premier League and not in Portugal while Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a victim of Man Utd.",
      "Richard Keys has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has ‘ripped the heart out’ of Manchester United, who are now an ’embarrassing’ side that Ruben Amorim doesn’t want to be part ...",
      "We have some more Trent Alexander-Arnold reaction, but the real anger should be directed towards the old, rich, white men.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has set a bold target for Man Utd next season after Ruben Amorim admitted he was “embarrassed” by the club’s performance this season."

      "Manchester United might need to sack Ruben Amorim, sell Bruno Fernandes, replace Andre Onana and induce a global pandemic to meet their targets next season.",
      "Despite slugging it out with Europa League final opponents Spurs to see who can embarrass themselves the most domestically, 16th-placed Manchester United have set themselves the objective of a top-six finish in 2025/26.",
      "Every Premier League club has been set a target for next season but that seems like one of the more outlandish examples.",
      "Only five times in the history of 20-team Premier League campaigns has a side improved their league position by 10 places from one season to the next. Nottingham Forest will make that a half-dozen soon enough, but what lessons can Manchester United take from the past?",
      "",
      "Aston Villa (from 16th in 2002/03 to 6th in 2003/04) – changed managers\n“I had another year left on my contract and I was under no pressure to resign as Aston Villa manager,” said Graham Taylor. “But I have become increasingly unhappy at how the club as a whole was run,” he added, never naming infamous chairman Doug Ellis but leaving little doubt as to his reasoning either.",
      "Having broken his managerial retirement after nine months at the beck and call of a panicking Villa in February 2002, Taylor should perhaps have consulted predecessor John Gregory about the business practises of his new boss.",
      "But Taylor was lured back to the West Midlands in what he would later state he always knew was a “transitional” role. A record of 19 wins from 60 games saw Villa lurch from 8th one season to 16th in his first and only full campaign, before a jump back up to 6th under his replacement.",
      "David O’Leary had been out of work for a year after leaving trophyless Leeds, but an exciting crop of Villa academy graduates dovetailed wonderfully with the experience of Dion Dublin, Ronny Johnsen, Nolberto Solano and Juan Pablo Angel to turn relegation battlers into European qualification contenders.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Make Ruben Amorim quit; he genuinely doesn’t seem far off anyway.",
      "",
      "Everton (from 17th in 2003/04 to 4th in 2004/05) – sold best player\n“I sold Wayne Rooney and Everton got better,” was how David Moyes allayed any concerns West Ham might have had over losing prized asset Declan Rice. And frankly it was powerful logic: they avoided relegation by six points with him as their top scorer, Manchester United handed £27m over after Euro 2004 and Everton used those funds to help qualify for the Champions League.",
      "It does skip past a few key points, like the signing of Tim Cahill, the partnership between David Weir and Alan Stubbs and the form of Lee Carsley. But fundamentally Everton improved as a team when they cashed in on their star player.",
      "Only Norwich (3rd in 1992/93) have ever finished higher in the Premier League with a negative goal difference than the Toffees, who scored the same number of goals when finishing 4th as they did to come 17th, while only actually suffering four fewer defeats.",
      "Even when they chucked their new-found transfer weight around it backfired, but without Rooney at least Thomas Gravesen could finally spread his wings.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Sell Bruno Fernandes, and maybe sign Marcus Bent.",
      "",
      "Fulham (from 17th in 2007/08 to 7th in 2008/09) – signed competent keeper\nIt remains one of the more unlikely relegation escapes in Premier League history, perhaps a little lost in the mire of Derby selfishly and simultaneously recording their Apocalypse Season.",
      "Fulham were already 18th and in trouble when they appointed Roy Hodgson as Lawrie Sanchez’s successor in December 2007. But their struggle to build any momentum left them in this spot heading into the final straight:",
      "The Cottagers then trailed Manchester City 2-0 within 21 minutes of the first of those three must-win games. Yet they did precisely that, Diomansy Kamara capping a ludicrous comeback in stoppage time at the Etihad before Birmingham and Portsmouth were felled for no apparent reason.",
      "Fulham’s eagerness to avoid a similar scenario meant a substantial summer spend, with Andy Johnson, Bobby Zamora, John Paintsil and Zoltan Gera among those signed. But it was free agent Mark Schwarzer, released by Middlesbrough, who rejected Juventus and Bayern Munich to move to west London.",
      "Perhaps a full pre-season of Hodgson’s double training sessions of two banks of four was actually the decisive factor but Fulham went from conceding 60 goals in 2007/08 to letting in only 34 in 2008/09, fewer than Arsenal and indeed every team bar the top three, with Schwarzer equalling a record for most clean sheets in a Premier League season for the Cottagers which still stands.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? It’s not great news for Andre Onana.",
      "",
      "Leicester (from 14th in 2014/15 to 1st in 2015/16) – changed managers but also signed probably the league’s best player from France’s mid-table\nThere is little point in trying to dilute and replicate any element of Leicester’s title-winning season, but also Manchester United should probably sack Amorim after his son is embroiled in a racist sex tape scandal before appointing a likeable but ill-suited manager, being widely tipped for relegation and capitalising on the collective bed-soiling of the usual contenders.",
      "It might also be an idea to identify one of the most effective players in Premier League history, going entirely unnoticed in Ligue Un at a ludicrously low price. Leicester, unbeknownst to everyone including themselves, already had most of the pieces in place to win the title, but N’Golo Kante, a £5.6m signing from Caen, made director of football Steve Walsh perhaps the sport’s most coveted man.",
      "Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas? And does Nigel Pearson calling a journalist an ostrich trigger a series of events which culminates in Andrea Bocelli belting out Nessun Dorma at a disbelieving King Power Stadium?",

      "",
      "West Ham (from 16th in 2019/20 to 6th in 2020/21) – stopped playing in front of fans\nWhile the instinct is to wipe the entire sorry saga from memory, those months in which Jesse Lingard and Tomas Soucek were the single greatest footballers on earth were at least a novelty. A great many things would not have happened without lockdown and West Ham almost qualifying for the Champions League is chief among them.",
      "From the date of the first game without fans in June 2020 to May 2021, when heavy restrictions were still placed on attendance, only five teams accrued more points than West Ham, who trailed Arsenal on goal difference alone.",
      "Considering their plight beforehand it was a ludicrous turnaround. Moyes was again the architect of a huge leap in places but he struggled after replacing Manuel Pellegrini and things only started to click when Michail Antonio was free to chase long balls and run the channels without fear of being chastised by supporters.",

      "An \"embarrassed\" Ruben Amorim has claimed there is \"something wrong\" with the way his Manchester United side play football ahead of their meeting with Chelsea, live on Friday Night Football.",
      "United suffered their 13th league defeat since Amorim was appointed in November against West Ham on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford, to keep them just two places above the relegation zone. .",
      "They have now gone seven games without a win in the Premier League, matching their longest winless streak in the competition, and will now be tasked with addressing the poor run of form against Enzo Maresca's Champions League-chasing side away from home.",
      "At the time of Amorim taking over in November, United sat in 14th place but their struggles in front of goal and woeful defensive record, leading to just six wins in the league, have now seen them drop to 16th on 39 points.",
      "Regardless of how they perform in the final fixtures, United are guaranteed to finish with their worst Premier League season on record - and by some margin.",
      "\"Sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically, it is the way we face competition and suffer. When we get mad about losing.",
      "\"Everything we have been through, I have a clear picture and a clear feeling of what this team needs to be so much better.",
      "\"It is not just on the pitch, it is outside the pitch. We have all the conditions to be better.\"",
      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",
      "\"It is the way we face competition. We are Manchester United,\" he said, building on his explanation on what was missing from the squad.",
      "\"We are just okay about not performing and it is not about momentum, it is so much more profound than that.",
      "\"When I listen to people criticising the way we perform, I cannot say anything because it is so clear that people are right.",

      "Thursday 15 May 2025 23:44, UK",

      "Rashford is set to decide on his next steps after the season is over, with little certainty around where he will be playing once the summer transfer window has closed, aside from the expectation that it will be away from United, who have set their asking price at £40m.",
      "Being at Villa and working under Emery has rejuvenated Rashford, whose relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim broke down before he left in February. The forward, often overlooked for a place in United's struggling squad, displaced Ollie Watkins at Villa.",
      "Rashford, scorer of four goals and provider of six assists in 17 games on loan, began to repair his reputation at Villa after a concerning 18 months at Old Trafford in which his work-rate and desire were widely questioned.",

      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",

      "\"I see Chelsea winning on Friday Night Football. Then they have to beat Nottingham Forest.",
      "\"The problem is Man City, they could be sixth in the league by the time they play Bournemouth! I expect Chelsea and Villa both to win. City don't play because of the FA Cup final.",

      "Fresh from a 7/1 winning double, our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his Premier League insight and sees problems for Chelsea on Friday Night Football.",
      "Tottenham going off 7/1 with Sky Bet for the away win tells you all you need to know about their prospects in this fixture. It's the biggest price they've been by a long way vs a non-big six team in the last 10 years.",
      "Even if you added another zero to that 7/1, I'd be tempted to swerve it.",
      "Villa have a goal in sight and have been relentless in their pursuit of a top-five finish, winning seven of their last eight Premier League games. They've crashed the markets and the top five party and are now just 11/10 with Sky Bet to finish there.",
      "Pro-Villa angles are the only betting angles to consider across the props markets and with Jacob Ramsey (suspended) and Youri Tielemans (injured) out for this fixture, backing Boubacar Kamara's shots lines makes appeal based on he could be playing with attacking licence.",
      "He did last weekend in the win at Bournemouth, hitting two shots, which is way above his season per 90 average of 0.44. It's 4/1 with Sky Bet for him to repeat the feat and register two or more shots.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's suspension makes this fixture trickier for Chelsea than the 1/3 odds with Sky Bet imply. Jackson has played his last game of this season following that red card at Newcastle and it leaves Enzo Maresca with a huge issue at centre-forward.",
      "Jackson has missed seven Premier League matches for Chelsea this season, they've lost four of those matches against Arsenal, Brighton, Aston Villa and Ipswich, scoring just one goal along the way.

      "United have failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton, Everton (both 15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more. Since December 22 they have scored just 21 Premier League goals in their 20 games. The under 2.5 goals line is a big price at 13/8 with Sky Bet considering all the correct scores you get on your side.",
      "Opposing goals in matches at Wembley remains a sustainable long-term betting strategy.",
      "It might be the mecca of English football - to play there is every footballer's dream - but I'm convinced the place saps the momentum out of a game. Maybe the jeopardy of what is at stake plays a part which in turn leads to low-scoring football matches but I think games there rarely spark into life.",
      "The last 46 domestic and European matches played at Wembley, the average goals per 90 stands at 1.98 goals in normal time and if you backed the under 3.5 line in those 45 games, you'd have won 42 times. Yes, the prices on offer for under 3.5 goals are quite tight but a return at that strike rate means you'd be swimming in profit if backing that line blind.",
      "If you back Crystal Palace +1 handicap (double chance) and under 3.5 goals through the RequestABet function with Sky Bet you have a juicy 7/4 shot on your side with Sky Bet.",
      "The Grand Old Lady is set to belt out one final tune and if previous farewell games at stadiums are anything to go by, there should be two things on the menu: a home win and lots of goals.",
      "The final games at Upton Park, Highbury, The Dell, Griffin Park and White Hart Lane all ended with the home team signing off in style with a win and a total of 23 goals scored in those five matches.",
      "Meanwhile, only Sheffield Utd (97 in 23/24) and Swindon (85 in 93/94) have conceded more goals at this stage of a Premier League season than Southampton, so Everton couldn't have wished for a more welcoming visitor on goodbye Goodison day.",
      "Everton to win and over 2.5 goals at 11/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play.",
      "The market has got completely carried away with Nottingham Forest here. Just because they need to win, it doesn't always work out like that.",
      "Taking a price as short as 6/4 with Sky Bet on a Forest win makes little sense based on what Nuno Espirito Santo's team has been serving up for the past 12 Premier League games.",
      "Across those 12 games their expected goals against process is working at 1.68 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process. They allowed Leicester to create 1.29 worth of expected goals and score twice, so West Ham with Jarrod Bowen and Mohamed Kudus bringing top quality final third to the table, should be confident of scoring multiple goals.",
      "Bowen has five goals or assists in his last four starts and looks overpriced to grab another one at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Brentford don't want the season to end. They've lost just two of their last 12 Premier League games, winning the last four for the first time in the top-flight since 1939.",
      "Only Liverpool, Newcastle, Man City and Arsenal have scored more goals in the league this season (63) with the Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa combination so exciting to watch.",
      "The Bees can sting you from all angles though, including set pieces where the addition of Michael Kayode and his excellent long-throw has given them an extra attacking dimension. Sepp van den Berg is the beneficiary of these clever set pieces and he's had eight shots from his last 10 starts when playing centre-back. He is 8/11 with Sky Bet for another shot.",
      "Sometimes the narrative is just too powerful to ignore.",
      "Jamie Vardy will make his 500th and final appearance for Leicester here and will not feature in the season finale at Liverpool next Sunday to allow him a King Power Stadium farewell.",
      "He will be celebrated before and after kick-off as the club finish their home campaign in a battle between two already relegated clubs.",
      "With nothing on the line this could turn into a bit of Vardy sideshow and he is no stranger to grabbing the limelight. He is searching for his 200th goal for Leicester too. His 5/4 anytime goalscorer price is an obvious starting point but boosting it up by taking the 4/1 with Sky Bet on him scoring the last goal of the game makes sense.",
      "Some things are just meant to be.",
      "The draw at 5/2 with Sky Bet must be of interest based on it suiting both teams. If this rolls past 70 minutes with the scores level we could get a drifty end that peters out.",
      "Newcastle know a point will be just fine for their prospects as they'd have Champions League qualification firmly in their hands heading into the final day knowing a win over Everton at home would secure a top-five finish.",
      "Meanwhile, you get the feeling Mikel Arteta and his boys just want the season to end now. Arsenal have dropped 18 points in their last 11 Premier League games, winning just three times and have been beaten by the Toon on three occasions already this season. A draw is fine for them in terms of finishing second with only Southampton to come for them.",
      "Taking a view on player cards in end-of-season games isn't an ideal punting strategy but we've got a full-back here who is in an aggressive mood.",
      "Conor Bradley is a man looking to take his chance following Trent Alexander-Arnold's decision to move on and his ability to play calm and composed isn't going to be helped by the transfer move for Jeremie Frimpong. Bradley does still look quite reckless and raw at times, making five fouls and being carded on both in his last two starts. He's 5/2 with Sky Bet to pick up another booking.",

      "Ruben Amorim strikes a different tone about his Manchester United future ahead of Europa League final against Tottenham and insists he has \"clear plan\" about how to turn the club around a few days after saying he could resign next season if dreadful Premier League performances continue",
      "Thursday 15 May 2025 11:51, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has said he is far from quitting as Manchester United boss after warning he could walk away if results do not improve next season.",
      "Amorim was \"embarrassed\" after West Ham came to Old Trafford and won for the first time in nine matches to move above United, whose dreadful Premier League campaign has left them 16th in the table after losing 17 games.",
      "The United boss warned that everyone at the club must \"seriously think about a lot of things\" before saying they should \"give space to other people\" if the poor form continues after the summer.",
      "But Amorim insisted in his press conference ahead of next Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham that he has no plans to step down.",
      "Asked if he would seriously resign, Amorim said: \"I am far from quitting.\"",
      "\"What I am saying is that since I arrived here I am always talking about the standards. I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League, and not say something and take responsibility,\" he added.",
      "\"I have a clear plan of what to do. I understand the problems of the team.\"",
      "But the United boss, far more upbeat than in the aftermath of the defeat to West Ham, warned \"we need to perform or else they will change us\".",
      "Amorim also confirmed he had agreed to pay for his backroom staff to go to next week's Europa League final after reports claimed the club would not be covering the cost of their tickets.",
      "This is just the latest cost-cutting measure implemented under United's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has overseen more than 400 redundancies since taking control of football operations from the Glazer family.",
      "Amorim, who acknowledged it is \"hard to manage things\" at United, said the cut-backs made it difficult for the club to pay for those staff still in a job.",
      "\"We have had a lot of people leaving and a lot of changes in our staff,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"In our club at the moment it is sometimes hard to understand when to take and when to give and to respect the people when we have taken their jobs to survive and rebuild.",
      "\"It is complicated for the club to give to other members of staff, so it is a really hard position.",
      "\"That situation was explained and my reaction was to help because - I am not a good guy - it is not going to change my life. The players had the same reaction.",
      "\"Everybody wants the staff and the families there.\"",
      "Amorim says injured United defenders Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven and Diogo Dalot are pushing to feature in next week's Europa League final.",
      "Yoro joined fellow centre-backs De Ligt and Heaven on the sidelines after limping off in Sunday's 2-0 loss to West Ham with a foot injury.",
      "The trio were absent from training just a week out from facing Spurs and head coach Amorim said: \"I don't know if they are going to be available.",
      "\"We are going to try to push because it's the final matches and this is a final, you know that. All the players want to play that really bad, so I don't know.",
      "\"I think they will not go to Chelsea [on Friday], but we will have a possibility to have some of them in the final.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are ruled out of the match against Tottenham next Wednesday.",
      "Jonny Evans and Toby Collyer were in training a week out from the final, while full-back Dalot did an individual session before the main group trained as he seeks to make it to Spain.",
      "The 26-year-old has made 51 appearances for United this term in all competitions but last month suffered a potentially season-ending calf injury.",
      "\"Dalot is trying really bad,\" Amorim said. \"I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, second injury [follows] and then it's a big thing.",
      "\"We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad, so we will see but he's working really hard to get in the final.\"",
      "\"I am working really hard, you can imagine how much I want to be back as soon as possible,\" he said."

      "\"For me, it's a bit of arrogance.",
      "\"Winning trophies was the past, so enjoy the present. Who says they win another one for 15 years?",
      "\"Now they're going to have a BBQ, think of the fans! They'll let you know when the parade is on whether it was right to do. Do not leave the fans out because it is about the fans.",
      "\"I would want a parade. They could win a trophy and if they win it, they have won more than Arsenal. Arsenal would love to have a parade. It is hard to win trophies, so do not underestimate winning one. It is difficult.\"",
      "Man Utd suffered their 17th top-flight defeat against West Ham in their last outing, with nine of these losses arriving at Old Trafford, and Ruben Amorim will now be tasked with picking his side up in a bid to salvage the campaign with silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim believes he knows \"what the team needs to be so much better\" as he looks to address the \"unacceptable\" position the club finds itself in next season.",
      "\"I'm really embarrassed that in 25 games, we've won six. Something is wrong in the way we are playing football, and sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically and technically.",
      "\"It's the way we face competition and the way we suffer and the way we get mad because we are losing, and the way we protect the goal.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if we can change our position in the league or not - that feeling is nothing about confidence. It's about the belief and the understanding that we are Manchester United, and we don't want to be the worst in the league.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable and, for me, that is not a lack of confidence, that is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "In the build-up to Friday's penultimate league game against Chelsea and the final against Tottenham, United centre-backs Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven have all sat out training.",
      "Amorim could be dealing with a depleted backline against Spurs, judging by United's open training session at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "Yoro limped off during Sunday's 2-0 home defeat to West Ham with a foot problem and was conspicuous by his absence at training, as was De Ligt after picking up an issue at Brentford the previous weekend.",
      "Heaven did individual work ahead of last week's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao but was not seen at Wednesday's session, in which Jonny Evans took part along with Toby Collyer.",
      "Diogo Dalot did an individual session before the main group trained as he seeks to make the final, but Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are out for the remainder of the season.",
      "Former United defender Patrice Evra has called the Europa League final a \"crucial moment in the history of the club\" to salvage a disastrous campaign.",
      "\"I love his honesty. I want him to succeed but of course, the results are really bad this season.",
      "\"It's a process. It's his first year, I see a lot of improvement. Even when I arrived, I had six months to adapt.",
      "\"It would be good to play Champions League due to the player we can attract. It's [Europa League final] a crucial moment for the history of the club.",
      "\"Bruno Fernandes is the most important player in the team. If he wasn't there we wouldn't be in the final and it could have been possible [relegation].",
      "\"We have to forget this season. I am confident but it will be tough. Good luck to both teams but come on Man Utd!\""
