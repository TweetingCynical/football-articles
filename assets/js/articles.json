      "Bruno Fernandes says that Manchester United made it clear they did not have to sell him in the wake of interest from Al-Hilal and that the midfielder would have the final say over any potential move.",
      "Fernandes, 30, has rejected a lucrative proposal to swap the Premier League for Saudi Arabia after being sounded out. Their offer, said to be worth £100million, coincided with the end of a disastrous season for Manchester United, who finished in 15th.",
      "United are eager to rebuild their squad this summer but there will not extensive transfer funds available due to the club's failure to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "As such, the club are expected to consider serious offers for all players as they bid to give Ruben Amorim scope to shake up the team - but Fernandes insists United told him they did not have to sell him as he weighed up his decision.",
      "Speaking in a press conference ahead of Portugal's UEFA Nations League semi-final tie with Germany, Fernandes revealed: \"The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask me about [a move].",
      "\"There was a waiting period for me to think about the future. As I have always said, I would be willing to do it if Manchester United thought so.",
      "\"I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, was very annoying to me not to go! The club said they would not be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave, that it was not a financial issue.\"",
      "Speculation over Fernandes' future has grown in recent weeks, particularly in the wake of reports that the Saudi Pro League outfit had set him a deadline to decide on a move.",
      "But he decided to turn the proposal down after speaking with his wife, adding that he wants to keep playing at an elite level.",
      "\"It was a very ambitious proposal,\" Fernandes added. \"The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course. Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "\"It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship.",
      "\"But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, and I feel capable of it.\"",

      "Steven Gerrard has warned Liverpool that Manchester City will be their biggest rivals for the Premier League title next season – but he doesn’t expect Manchester United to be anywhere near the top. The Reds will aim to defend their 20th league title in 2025/26 following Arne Slot’s successful debut campaign and Gerrard has named the sides to worry about.",
      "Liverpool finished 10 points clear of Arsenal this season, securing their first title since 2020 with a thumping win over Tottenham on April 27. They boasted the league’s best attack – thanks largely to top-scorer Mohamed Salah, who managed 29 goals himself – and the second-best defence.",
      "The club are keen to reinforce their squad in the summer transfer window and have already signed Jeremie Frimpong and are chasing the signature of his former Bayer Leverkusen team-mate Florian Wirtz. Slot will have the summer to build a new squad, but former Liverpool captain Gerrard is expecting tougher opposition next season.",
      "\"Liverpool will be well aware that they're going to be the ones that are hunted now. But evidence suggests that Liverpool are going to be strong in the transfer market, so Liverpool are the team to catch for sure.\"",
      "City rallied to finish third in the Premier League, just three points behind Arsenal – who finished second for the third straight year – but saw their title chances evaporate early in the season. However, Pep Guardiola has signed a new contract and City will have key Ballon d’Or-winning midfielder Rodri back available for the start of the next campaign.",
      "Gerrard added: \"I think you've got to be wary of City and Guardiola. The best manager in the world. They've done it four years on the spin, they lost Rodri, which was a big blow to them.",
      "\"I think with a fully fit squad, and they're going to recruit as well, the team that finishes above City will win it again and hopefully, that’s Liverpool.\"",
      "United finished 15th in Ruben Amorim’s debut season and their defeat in the Europa League final against Tottenham means they won’t play any European football next season. They will undergo the biggest squad overhaul of all Premier League clubs this summer, with Matheus Cunha expected to be the first of many arrivals once his £62.5million deal goes through.",
      "But United will clearly need more time to improve under Amorim before they can compete for the title once again. \"We are not ready to play in the Premier League, be competitive, and to be in the Champions League,\" he admitted last month.",

      "The agent of Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has confirmed that he's in talks to sign a new contract, pouring cold water on links of a shock move to Manchester United. Donnarumma, 26, helped PSG win the Champions League final on Saturday, although he had little to do as they hammered Inter Milan 5-0 in Munich.",
      "It's the second time that the former AC Milan star has been a champion of a Europe, having been the hero for Italy at Euro 2020 with two penalty saves in the final against England. PSG signed him that summer on a five-year deal, having left Milan in acrimonious circumferences.",
      "That contract expires in June 2026 and it was reported this week that United are among the clubs monitoring his situation. Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim would like to sign a new goalkeeper amid concerns over Andre Onana but Old Trafford chiefs aren't planning to spend big unless their current first-choice shot-stopper decides to leave.",
      "Napoli were also claimed to be interested in Donnarumma but his agent, Enzo Raiola - cousin of the late super agent, Mino - says that talk a move to the Serie A winners is 'pure fantasy'. Instead, they're in talks with PSG over extending his stay in Paris.",
      "\"It's pure fantasy. I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola told Radio CRC via Calciomercato.",
      "\"It's an obvious question; many would like him, but only a few can afford him. He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal [with PSG].\"",
      "Raiola hasn't ruled out a move to Napoli in the future, though, as Donnarumma is from Castellammare, a town in the Metropolitan City of Naples. \"His mother is a huge Napoli fan, and she gets anxious watching their games. Gigio is connected to that,\" his representative continued.",
      "Which goalkeeper should Manchester United sign instead? Let us know your choice in the comments section.",
      "\"He grew up as a Milan supporter, watching his older brothers in a Rossoneri shirt, but he never denied his roots. In fact, his first stop during the holidays is always Castellammare.\"",
      "Donnarumma's performances dipped in the early part of the season before he and his team-mates clicked into gear after the winter break, going on to win the treble. His saves against Premier League trio Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal during the Champions League knockout phase were vital to Luis Enrique's all-conquering side."

The Italian side’s sporting director Giovanni Manna is reportedly a big fan and does not have much concern for Martinez’s fitness issues.",

Speaking in United’s matchday programme, he said: \"It's the way I like to play, the way of playing football; the passion, the energy. You know, if you have that with me, it's like you connect quickly.",

      "Negotiations between United and Brentford are expected to kick off soon, with Mbeumo's impressive tally of 20 goals and seven assists in 38 league matches this season putting his value at about £60million.",
      "United legend Ferdinand has expressed his backing for the potential acquisition, praising Mbeumo's consistent impact and athleticism, while also highlighting that the club have listened to his own transfer demands as they look to build on a dismal campaign.",
      "\"What a season he's had. Not only has he been ever-present – he's always there consistently – the guy's impacting games. Big moments,\" said Ferdinand on his Rio Presents podcast.",

The winger's keen eye for finding the net and his pace along the frontline are much needed at United, and were instrumental in Brentford securing their 10th place standing this season.",
      "The prospect of adding him to United's squad would notably enhance Amorim's options after the Reds missed out on securing Liam Delap after he chose Chelsea as his future club with his imminent £30m transfer from Ipswich on the horizon.",
      "United aren't wasting any time when it comes to summer signings, though, already sealing a deal for Wolves' Matheus Cunha. With a £62.5m buy-out clause in his previous contract, they didn't hesitate to meet the figure.",
      "In the meantime, Bruno Fernandes has turned down an offer from the Saudi Pro League, which suggests he’ll be playing for United again next season.",
      "Between them, Mbeumo and Cunha have scored a striking total of 35 league goals this season; the previous term, they netted 21. Their proven ability is clear as day, especially contrasted with United's less successful strike force.",

      "A number of potential other suitors have emerged for Rashford’s services and it appears that there is now interest from Italy. According to The Sun, Inter Milan have added the United forward to their summer shortlist as they aim to recover from their dismal Champions League final appearance.",
      "The Serie A giants were thumped 5-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in Munich. Club chiefs apparently believe that Rashford could be a perfect addition as they aim to rebuild the squad in the wake of that defeat.",
      "It is also said his signing would go a long way to getting fans back onside. Inter are apparently exploring a long-term loan move, albeit United would prefer a permanent deal.",
      "A source as quoted by The Sun said: “Marcus is open-minded to a move abroad, and a fresh start. Lots of players have made the move from the Premier League to Serie A in recent years and performed very well. That’s why the idea of such a switch excites both the player and Inter.”",
      "Away from Inter, Barcelona have also been credited with an interest in Rashford. Sporting director Deco was recently asked about a potential move but claimed work needed to be done behind the scenes before the Catalan side could consider adding new signings to their squad.",
      "“We have been focusing on renewing contracts, after that, we'll discuss players to come,\" Deco said to BBC Sport. \"Of course, these two players [Rashford and Luis Diaz], like you mentioned, they are good but have contracts in their clubs, so we won't speak because it's not fair.",
      "“But when you decide to go to the market, for sure, we find some names. In my opinion, we don't need to bring many players. When I speak with the agents of the players, everyone wants to come or stay.",
      "“So this is important. The image of the club is still good. We are proud because Barcelona is still such a big club, and the way we are playing football makes players want to come.\"",

      "United would have collected a £100m transfer fee, with Bruno Fernandes being handed an eye-watering contract worth around £200m in a move that would see him join up with countrymen Joao Cancelo and Ruben Neves.",

      "Speaking after their post-season tour in Asia, he said: \"I think he wants to stay. He is saying no to a lot of things but he chose that he wants to win. I think he's really good and he needs to be on the best league in the world.\"",

Speaking on his Rio Presents podcast, the 46-year-old said: \"I've got to be honest, the biggest news for me today.",
      "\"I woke up, I've been fretting the last three days, because I'm seeing Fabrizio [Romano], [David] Ornstein – the lot of them... 'Bruno's going Saudi. They've offered him £200m over four years.'",

In a team that's on its knees confidence-wise at the moment, that needs a big lift in this summer and this recruitment window, and needs the manager to get on his horse and start riding it.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was left stunned by Marcus Rashford’s talent when he first arrived at Manchester United. As Rashford's time with his boyhood club seemingly draws to a close this summer, his captain's comments show just how tragic his departure from Old Trafford will be.",
      "The 27-year-old forward had a falling out with Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim in December of last year, resulting in him being frozen out of the team. He managed to secure a loan move to Aston Villa in January, where he made a positive contribution in the season's final months until a hamstring injury prematurely ended his campaign.",
      "It is understood that Villa have the option to sign the England international permanently for £40million, with his relationship with Amorim thought to be irreparable. However, it remains uncertain whether Unai Emery will risk upsetting Villa’s wage structure to match Rashford's reported weekly wage of £325,000 at United.",
      "According to The Sun, Serie A club Inter Milan have now emerged as a possible destination for Rashford as they aim to bounce back from their Champions League final heartbreak last weekend.",
      "Inter were thrashed 5-0 by Paris Saint-Germain, a defeat that followed their late-season collapse in the race to win the Scudetto. Club chiefs reportedly believe Rashford could be a crucial signing and would excite supporters.",
      "Their view of Rashford was once echoed by current United skipper Fernandes. The Portuguese, merely months after signing for the club in 2020, made it clear both how good Rashford was and how good he could become in the future.",
      "Fernandes was asked to assemble his 'perfect player' and selected Rashford's 'pace', indicating just how highly he rated the forward. That's something which will no doubt be frustrating for United fans to hear, as it is a blow that the player will fail to truly reach his lofty potential at Old Trafford.",
      "He said in an interview with BT Sport at the time: \"I will choose Rashford because I think what Rashford has is pace, amazing pace, but with amazing quality. It's difficult sometimes going at that velocity to have the quality to do the right things, you know. To choose the right time to shoot, to pass, to skill. I will choose Rashy for sure.\"",
      "Fernandes went on to admit: \"He surprised me a lot. Of course I already knew his qualities, because he is one of the best young players in the world for me. I think I will choose Rashy because for me this [pace] is one of the best qualities he has.\"",
      "Rashford, who joined the club as a seven-year-old, showed flashes of world class ability in his 10 seasons in the United first team but far too inconsistently. He only managed to score 20 goals or more across all competitions in three seasons, with those often being followed by mediocre or poor campaigns.",
      "During his loan spell at Villa, he scored four goals and provided six assists in 17 matches, having managed to secure a regular starting spot over Ollie Watkins since the Champions League quarter-final ties against PSG.",
      "Sadly for Villa, a contentious refereeing decision on the season's final day against United resulted in them missing out on a Champions League spot for the upcoming season.",
      "Whether that will influence Rashford's decision on his future club remains to be seen, as it was previously reported that he favoured a move to Barcelona.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United could miss out on a major windfall for ex-player Alvaro Carreras, with Real Madrid reportedly struggling to agree a deal for the Benfica star. Carreras joined United as a teenager in 2020 but moved to the Portuguese side last year.",
      "And after a stellar year in the Primeira Liga, Carreras is now generating huge interest from Europe's elite and United were hoping to profit from a transfer.",
      "When United sold the left-back to Benfica last summer for around £5m, club officials are said to have negotiated a sell-on clause of between 40 and 50 percent.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy could have been looking at a £20m windfall after reports Madrid were considering paying his £42m release clause.",
      "United desperately need extra cash this summer amid their perilous financial situation. Ratcliffe previously revealed the club was on course to run out of money by Christmas and been undertaking a ruthless cost-cutting regime.",
      "Ticket prices have already been increased, with concessions slashed and free lunches in the canteen axed - and a number of exit are expected this summer as United look to get expensive players off the wage bill.",
      "But a boost of cash injection from the Carreras deal now looks unlikely after Marca claimed Real Madrid are willing to risk losing out on him because they don't believe he's worth his release clause.",
      "Benfica are reportedly refusing to budge on their £42m price for the 22-year-old but Madrid have told them they are prepared to walk away from the deal - despite previous claim that Xabi Alonso's men had already agreed a deal.",
      "The report adds that Benfica want as much money as possible because they know United are due for a big chunk of the transfer fee.",
      "Madrid are eager to sign a new left-back for Alonso, with Ferland Mendy and Fran Garcia their only recognised options in the position. Instead Alonso could move for his ex-Leverkusen star Alex Grimaldo.",
      "Carreras started 30 games for Benfica in the Portuguese top flight, scoring four and assisting three in all competitions.",
      "Any money United can receive for his signature will massively help them bolster their own squad. Ruben Amorim's side have already signed Wolves star Matheus Cunha while a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo appears to be close.",

      "Inter Milan are considering making a move for Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund this summer as the beaten Champions League finalists seek to accelerate a rebuild of their squad.",
      "Hojlund spent the season as United's first-choice No. 9 but he had an underwhelming campaign, scoring just four goals in 32 Premier League appearances. His record across two seasons at Old Trafford in all competitions stands at 26 goals in 95 appearances.",
      "With Ruben Amorim keen to add attacking reinforcements this summer, Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee could depart to make room in the squad and free up vital funds.",
      "Hojlund's performances at United have attracted criticism since his £64million move from Atalanta, with the fee rising to a potential £72million, but there has been interest from Serie A clubs in taking him back to Italy.",
      "Inter have now joined the race and could make a move for the 22-year-old this summer, although they are beginning a busy summer overhaul without manager Simone Inzaghi, who has left the club and is set to takeover at Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.",
      "The Serie A runners-up were beaten 5-0 by Paris St-Germain in the Champions League final on Saturday and the seismic defeat is likely to lead to an overhaul of what is an ageing squad.",
      "United's attacking rebuild has already begun this window, with Matheus Cunha signing from Wolves in a £62.5million deal, while there is also strong interest in Bryan Mbeumo. The 25-year-old wants to join the club but negotiations with Brentford are only just underway.",
      "Cunha is expected to play as a No. 10, having operated in that position in the same system as Amorim plays at Wolves, and while Mbeumo can also operate as a No. 10 and bring a left-footed option, he could also fill the centre-forward role. United could also look to sign another striker, especially if Hojlund or Zirkzee depart.",

      "When Manchester United officials walk past supporters in their club suits, the key figures are easy to spot. Fans will be aware of high-profile chief executive Omar Berrada and football director Jason Wilcox. They will instantly recognise some of the Ineos figures, such as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford.",
      "But Matt Hargreaves could stroll past without any recognition. Despite that, the former Adidas market director is a key figure in the corridors of power at Old Trafford and when it comes to the wheeler-dealer nature of the transfer window, arguably the most important person.",
      "This summer, Wilcox will work closely with Ruben Amorim to identify what the head coach requires, both in terms of incomings and outgoings. Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell plays an important role in identifying targets and dealing with agents. Then, director of football negotiations Hargreaves seeks to strike deals with clubs for players United want to sign and for those potentially on their way out.",
      "Negotiating with Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha was a relatively straightforward start to the window, given the Brazilian's release clause. It was simply a case of agreeing on a payment structure. However, Brentford have already made it clear they will drive a hard bargain for Bryan Mbeumo, despite the 25-year-old having only a maximum of two years left on his contract and having made his preference for a move to Old Trafford clear.",
      "But Hargreaves' skills might be tested most acutely when it comes to departures. Sales will make this window go round for United, and they need to extract maximum value for players leaving the club.",
      "In the case of Alejandro Garnacho, that might not be too difficult, given his age, talent and the level of performances he has already produced. Working against that will be the fact that Amorim has already made it clear he is finished at Old Trafford, giving buyers a pretty substantial edge in the market.",
      "Finding buyers for Marcus Rashford, Antony, and now Jadon Sancho might be more difficult. There will be pressure on Hargreaves as well, with Ratcliffe having made it clear he doesn't want the club to pay the wages of players who perform elsewhere. He wants the club to start bringing in more money and getting wages down, so sales rather than another loan will be the priority.",
      "One United source had previously declared the possibility of Chelsea deciding against signing Sancho permanently, and thereby paying a £5million penalty clause, as a \"win-win\" situation. You wonder if Hargreaves would have the same view.",
      "Chelsea taking the £25million option to sign Sancho would be the easiest course of action. Now, United must put the player back out to market and hope a club comes calling. The failure of the 25-year-old to agree personal terms with Chelsea suggests finding a club that can afford a fee and a salary package for the former England winger will be a challenge, although Hargreaves' ability to strike a fruitful deal with Borussia Dortmund to loan Sancho in January 2024 went down well at Old Trafford.",
      "The picture has changed since then, with Sancho about to head into the final year of his contract at the club and his future clearly lying away from United. A departure is required, which is also the case for Antony and Rashford. The former has at least enjoyed a productive loan spell with Real Betis, which United will hope to lead from interest elsewhere, as a permanent switch to Betis seems unlikely.",
      "Rashford's future also looks likely to lie away from Aston Villa. His spell in the Midlands was an encouraging return to form if not an outright success, but he once again has set his sights on Barcelona, despite the financial difficulties they are experiencing. Again, buyers have an upper hand in any potential deal for Rashford, with Amorim having made it clear he has no future under him.",
      "There had been an expectation that United could bank as much as £90million for Sancho, Antony and Rashford, but those sums are already beginning to look ambitious. Getting close to that figure will help supplement the transfer budget ahead of a season without European football, and all eyes will be on the least high-profile, but most important, executives in place at United."

      "It's unprecedented for a club to pay £5m to break their obligation agreement and the ordeal is embarrassing for Sancho, whose career has sadly nosedived over the last few years.",
      "Sancho was an England international and one of the most exciting players in Europe when he arrived at Old Trafford. His decline began after signing for Manchester United and he failed to arrest his slump at Chelsea.",
      "The London-born lad scored in 4-1 victory against Real Betis in the Conference League final and will argue his loan was a success. Sancho will point to scoring in that game and his winner's medal. It's also important to note the move has collapsed due to Chelsea not being willing to meet his wage demands.",
      "That doesn't necessarily mean Chelsea don't want Sancho, but it does mean they don't believe he is worth the salary, and maybe that wouldn't have been an issue if he'd performed better.",
      "Sancho's contribution of five goals and 10 assists has been deemed not good enough for the wages he wants and Chelsea are set to move on to Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Chelsea want to sign Gittens in a £50million deal before the Club World Cup and Sancho should probably feel further embarrassment over that transfer for two different reasons.",
      "The first reason is that Gittens has leapfrogged Sancho, despite having been years behind him.",
      "Dortmund visited Leigh Sports Village to play United Under-19s in March 2022 and won on penalties, but a 16-year-old Gittens scored a brace in normal time and was the star of the show.",
      "At that time, Sancho had already spent eight months in Manchester after signing from Dortmund in a £72.9m transfer. He was regarded among the world's finest players, while Gittens was a teenager playing in front of a sparse crowd.",
      "The second reason is that Gittens is represented by the same agency - Elite Project Group - as Sancho. They know each other well and their career pathways have been similar.",
      "Sancho and Gittens both played in Manchester City's academy before joining Dortmund. There have been comparisons made between the pair and Gittens has given the impression of being a miniature Sancho.",
      "However, 'little brother' could surpass 'big brother' if he joins Chelsea this summer.",
      "Sancho will probably be happy for his agency stablemate Gittens and he might even advise him about what to expect at Cobham, although the optics of the move are not great for him.",
      "Gittens was just 16 and hadn't had a sniff of senior football when Sancho signed for United, so far apart were they in their careers, but that is clearly no longer the case.",
      "It must be said, Gittens always seemed destined to become a top player, but Sancho hasn't maintained his top player status and looks set to be surpassed by Gittens."

      "The most surprising aspect of Manchester United's early transfer business this summer is that it is coming in the area of the pitch where they are arguably strongest.",
      "If they get a deal over the line to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford following the acquisition of Matheus Cunha to Wolves, it will add more No. 10s to Ruben Amorim's squad. Given the money spent on the proven Premier League performers, they will surely be starters next season.",
      "They join a growing list of options for those positions, which for now includes Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Amad, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. Garnacho's expected departure will create some leeway for transfers, and Mainoo's future is hardly secure just yet.",
      "Mount enjoyed his best spell of football for United towards the end of last season and is an Amorim favourite, but he hasn't done enough to warrant being a first-choice in that position. Fernandes certainly has, and his decision to turn down Al-Hilal's advances should mean another year of consistent performances at Old Trafford, but his future could lie more often in a deeper midfield role. He played that position regularly last season without any real impact on his contribution in the final third.",
      "Cunha is clearly an ideal fit for the position, having excelled there in the same system under Vitor Pereira at Wolves. He brings an understanding of the role and more creativity and goal threat than someone like Mount.",
      "Mbeumo spent last season playing on the wing for Brentford, but could slot in as a No. 10. He has played centrally previously and, like Cunha, would significantly add to the attacking threat in a United squad that has struggled for goals.",
      "The 25-year-old could operate as a striker as well, although he might not be an ideal fit for what Amorim wants from a No. 9. Instead, his close control and dribbling ability could make him a better option between the lines. He also brings balance, something Amorim reflected on in December when he first moved Amad into a No. 10 role, after initially using him as a wing-back.",
      "\"He can be a good player in that position,\" Amorim said. \"We need left-footed players in this team to play that role. In the first half, he was coming for the ball too much. He needed to play near the opposition defence more. He will improve in the future for sure.”",
      "That comment came after United's win against Viktoria Plzen and signalled an almost permanent shift to Amad operating as a No. 10, but the interest in Mbeumo could yet signal a change of plan there.",
      "Given his impact last season, Amad is almost a guaranteed starter in 2025/26, which either means Mbeumo plays centre-forward or Amad drops into right wing-back.",
      "He has proven he can play the role under Amorim, and his dribbling is an asset there. He can come inside to link play and offer an overload centrally or go down the outside on his right foot. That is the type of attacking threat Amorim wants from players in those positions.",
      "This summer is clearly going to be transformative for United. Adding goals and creativity to the team is vital for Amorim, and bringing Mbeumo in as an attacker and shifting Amad to wing-back fulfils that brief.",
      "It will also offer the head coach versatility. Mbeumo could play as a No. 9 and a No. 10, and Amad could play wing-back and No. 10. There are options there, for Amorim has also prioritised players who can operate in a couple of different roles for his system. A move for Mbeumo would deliver just that."

      "The back three of Leny Yoro (19), Matthijs de Ligt (25) and Lisandro Martinez (27) could be United's back three for years to come and the experience of Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw in reserve, and the promise of youngsters Ayden Heaven and Tyler Fredricson, means they are well stocked at the back.",
      "Other than Fernandes, Amad was United's best player this season and he excelled in both attacking midfield and as a wing-back. The Ivorian international offers much more to United's attack in that role than Diogo Dalot or Noussair Mazraoui and that could become his new home in Amorim's side.",
      "Patrick Dorgu was signed in the January transfer window and has proven his worth on the left-hand side.",

      "Manchester United have been handed a major boost over their hopes of keeping captain Bruno Fernandes beyond the summer transfer window. And the decision could also benefit the club in the transfer window too.",
      "Reports claim that Fernandes had been offered a huge financial package to join Al-Hilal from United. The Daily Mail claim that he was offered quadruple his current salary at United, meaning he would earn £700,000 per week tax-free. That would mean a three-year deal would be worth around £200 million, including bonuses.",
      "However, the fact that Fernandes has now turned down that opportunity to stay at Old Trafford will send a message to potential transfer targets. The club captain has set an example to current and potential new players.",
      "United could find themselves competing against Saudi sides for transfer targets this summer and won’t be able to compete in terms of wages. However, the fact that Fernandes has turned down the opportunity shows other players that they can do the same and opt to play in the Premier League - what many call the best league in the world, instead of opting to take big money with a move to the Middle East.",
      "United’s aim in the new season will be to return to European football after what was a disappointing 2024/25 campaign. Fernandes will be a big part of that.",
      "At times in the season just gone, he single-handedly dragged them through games. Opting to stay at Old Trafford is now a big boost to Ruben Amorim, and also shows a belief in the future of the club.",
      "If Fernandes didn’t believe that the side could compete towards the top of the Premier League again, he would surely have taken the money and completed the move. But the fact he didn’t also shows the ambitions under Amorim.",
      "Keeping hold of Fernandes is also likely to go down well with potential transfer targets. With the club captain in place, United are far more likely to return to where they want to be quicker than they would without him, something that targets will take into account when making their decision."

      "Manchester United should sign Jamie Vardy. Stop laughing, I’m serious.",
      "Those, including my F365 colleagues, with whom I’ve already shared this most scalding of takes have reacted with a mixture of hilarity and concern for my wellbeing. So I’ve given it further consideration and I’m doubling down; United absolutely should sign Vardy.",
      "Here for free – important, that – is a proven goalscorer, a fox in the box, a nasty b*stard (meant entirely as a compliment) and a title winner who could take the number of Premier League champions in the Old Trafford dressing room to… one. Vardy would be an asset to Ruben Amorim, putting him in a very select group of Manchester United footballers.",
      "I’m not ignoring the obvious point of contention: Vardy is old. Thirty-eight. Which in footballer years is ancient.",
      "But he hasn’t got as many miles on the clock as veterans of a similar age. Vardy’s professional career started at 24; his Football League career at 25. Most of his contemporaries reach 14 years as a senior pro between 32 and 34.",
      "And United absolutely don’t need Vardy for the future. Their outlay on wages will not be recouped and there will be no resale value. Not every signing can be viewed in such terms. But signing the ex-England striker could be seen as an investment in the younger forwards who so clearly need the spark and guidance Vardy could offer.",
      "But more than a mentor, Vardy can still show how it’s done. In a genuinely awful Leicester side, he scored more Premier League goals than any United player last season, and in 35 appearances, he played more minutes than all but two of Amorim’s outfielders.",
      "Right now, Amorim has one centre-forward he can call upon: Rasmus Hojlund. And they would sell him without hesitation if someone offered half the price they paid in 2023. The chances of that seem as low as the Dane’s goals record last season. And his confidence. But if they get him some help, in terms of service and a stand-in, it could yet work out if United are forced to make the best of him.",
      "That is especially true since Liam Delap thought Chelsea – Todd Boehly’s Chelsea – were better trusted with his development. Even if Delap had been convinced to join United, they would still have needed a more experienced striker given they currently have none.",
      "They might sign Bryan Mbeumo. And many would expect that to be a savvy addition. But what would they be signing in Mbeumo? Certainly not an out-and-out striker. Much of the appeal is the Cameroonian’s ability to play across the front line. He scored 20 goals last season, many of them while drifting in from the Brentford right, and it seems Amorim eyes Mbeumo more as a no.10.",
      "🔴⚪⚫ MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n👉 Every signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Sancho, Antony bottom five, Ronaldo 7th; Mbeumo next?\n👉 Mbeumo to Manchester United will be among the biggest steps down in transfer history\n👉 Mood rankings: United not the most miserable club in Manchester",
      "With Matheus Cunha already waiting to welcome Mbeumo if United stop irritating Brentford for long enough to get a deal done, United suddenly have creative options beyond Bruno Fernandes, who could be used in the deeper role Amorim liked for his skipper for much of last season.",
      "But what good is all that creativity without someone to apply the finishing touch? If United somehow muster the money to buy a proven no.9 – not another 9.5 – their centre-forward pool is still perilously shallow, even allowing for the lighter workload without European involvement.",
      "United haven’t been scared of recruiting veteran strikers. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was 35; Henrik Larsson was 34. Both were big hits at Old Trafford, for their influence in the dressing room as much as their impact in the box.",
      "Vardy could have a similar impact. He insists he is not looking to wind down after leaving Leicester, and Ruud van Nistelrooy offered a glowing reference: “He is one of the most open and honest people I have met…he isn’t hard to manage.”",
      "Like Zlatan for Jose Mourinho and Larsson for Fergie, Vardy would be a leader for Amorim, a manager with pitifully few such characters to lean on, and a goal threat where currently there is almost none.",
      "Not such a daft idea after all…",
      "Leeds United are weighing up whether to make an offer for Newcastle United striker Callum Wilson this summer, according to reports.",
      "A weekend of emotional farewells had us say goodbye to Goodison Park, Jamie Vardy, Emiliano Martinez, the old Arsenal and very possibly West Ham soon.",

      "Gary Neville once kindly explained the three facets which comprised the transfer philosophy of Sir Alex Ferguson, if indeed such a thing could exist for a manager whose career spanned almost four decades.",
      "“There were three categories to the policy,” the pundit said. “He wanted to promote youth wherever possible, that was number one before he even looked at the external market.”",
      "If “promote” is actually a synonym for “offload” – and in the dictionary of Big Sir Jim most things seem to be – then consider that box ticked by Man Utd in 2025.",
      "“Number two was to look at the best in the Premier League; those he could trust and still have growth and be with the club for a long time: Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Robin van Persie.”",
      "The signing of Matheus Cunha, pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo and potential targeting of more stars close to home suggests the dying art which underpinned so much of the club’s modern success has been resuscitated.",
      "“And then he always wanted emerging international talent that could come over to Manchester, that he could work with and develop into great players: Nemanja Vidic, Peter Schmeichel, Patrice Evra, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.”",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Manuel Ugarte, Antony, Andre Onana. The list goes on.",
      "The second point is the most pertinent to the current era and provides long-overdue proof of some joined-up thinking with recruitment at Carrington. Mbeumo and Cunha were the two biggest overperformers on xG in the Premier League last season, are 25 and 26 and feel like precisely the sort of signings Liverpool would make under Jurgen Klopp: players proven in the ever-improving middle of England’s top flight, but with an obvious scalability to develop and perform at a higher level.",

      "That comes with caveats: one season of xG overperformance presents obvious issues with sustainability and these are extortionate costs for a club publicly walking a PSR tightrope, who need to nail every aspect of their transfer business this summer. But if the argument was that sacrificing Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo would only be for the greater good if Man Utd could be trusted to spend the money properly, removing their erratic and unreliable recruitment from the equation to simply buy the closest things to guaranteed successes might make it work.",
      "Ferguson leaned on those intra-Premier League transfers to build the foundation for each of his great Man Utd squads. There were some David Bellions along the way but a ludicrous XI can be assembled from such signings: Van der Sar; Valencia, Smalling, Ferdinand, Young; Keane, Carrick, Smith; Tevez, Yorke, Rooney, with Robin van Persie, Dimitar Berbatov, Teddy Sheringham and Phil Jones on an absurdly attacking bench.",
      "But in the years since his retirement it was an ideology slowly phased out for style over substance, culminating in the ruinous summer of 2021. Man Utd were at a crossroads, Premier League and Europa League runners-up with fairly deep runs in the domestic cups behind them, but with a strong sense that while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had built a solid base, he had reached a point where someone else was required to push on and capitalise on his work.",
      "Man Utd avoided answering that awkward question and signed players from Real Madrid, Juventus and Borussia Dortmund instead, because they wanted the honour and esteem of being seen to deal with such clubs without a second thought as to whether Raphael Varane, Cristiano Ronaldo or Jadon Sancho actually added more to the squad than they took away, and Solskjaer was sacked within a matter of months.",
      "The club chose the wrong path then, in their last true position of strength in summer 2023 when they hedged one too many bets on Onana, Mason Mount and Hojlund, and the following year when instead of sacking Erik ten Hag, they doubled down by spending £200m on players not only specifically for him, but categorically incompatible with the replacement they inevitably had to appoint.",
      "The hope is that hitting rock bottom can prompt better decisions at this latest seasonal junction; the early signs are promising. Neville once said “if you had the best player in the Premier League, Man Utd had to buy that player”. Times have changed and those signings have long been unattainable, but buying the best Premier League players actually available to them seems like a sensible alternative Man Utd have long ignored.",

      "“I always tell players if, when you are 35 or 36, you look back on your career and think about the one year you didn’t play Champions League, then you are really a poor boy. There are so many things you can do and reach if you go together with the team. You can qualify for the Champions League, play Champions League, maybe win it or whatever. That is a much more satisfying thing than all the rest. That is what I would say to players: ‘It is about pushing the train, not jumping on a running train.’ That is what we need here. If somebody says: ‘But you don’t play Champions League next year’, then goodbye and thank you, have fun next year wherever you will be. We will find players or we have players already that will go our way. That is not my way, that is the normal way for a club not playing in the Champions League.”",

      "Not only were the Reds out of Europe altogether in summer 2016, but they had finished two places below the Southampton side they were buying from.

      "But players tend not to glance at the most recent league table before making career calls. Caicedo took the most expensive step down in Premier League history and has played a considerable part in pulling Chelsea back up since.",
      "",
      "6) Leny Yoro\nReal Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool were among those linked but it was Manchester United who completed a genuine transfer coup in signing a player former sporting director Dan Ashworth described as “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”.",
      "Some will put that down to money, or more specifically the pressure selling club Lille reportedly applied on Yoro to take the more lucrative Manchester United offer.",
      "But for a Europa League club to capture such a coveted teenager was yet more proof of that unique allure Manchester United still possess. Yoro was seven when they had last won the title and still in nappies for their most recent Champions League crowning, yet Old Trafford still called.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Suarez\nWhile he would win the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, Suarez had only graced the competition proper in one season, scoring a solitary goal during the 2010/11 campaign in which Ajax exited at the group stage.",
      "He joined Liverpool later that season and by the time he had finally dragged them to European Cup qualification for the first time in half a decade in 2014, the Uruguayan forewent the fruits of his labour to rock up in Spain.",
      "Liverpool had finished seventh before Suarez joined, then sixth, eighth and seventh with him. But the forward was not tainted by those years of stagnation, scoring more than 50 goals. Among them were his efforts in the Europa League as Suarez netted four times in seven appearances in the 2012/13 season, which ended with him imploring Liverpool “to honour our agreement”, namely:",
      "“Last year I had the opportunity to move to a big European club and I stayed on the understanding that if we failed to qualify for the Champions League the following season I’d be allowed to go.”",
      "The Emirates was smoking to the tune of £1 but Suarez caught fire in 2013/14, rocketing Liverpool to a Premier League title tilt that faded in spectacular fashion for a runners-up medal. He left for Barcelona instead of sticking around long enough for Brendan Rodgers to put him on the bench at the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "4) Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nFrom his humble beginnings at Ajax in 2002/03 to the understated modesty that helped steer Paris Saint-Germain in 2015/16, Ibrahimovic did not miss a single Champions League campaign. He played at least six games in every season including and between those two quarter-final appearances, failing to score only when Igor Biscan belittled him in 2004/05.",
      "But it was neither injury nor under-performance that snapped that remarkable streak. Ibrahimovic instead vacated his seat at the European top table entirely of his own accord – by joining Manchester United.",
      "Louis van Gaal had sidestepped the first sign of the Pardpocalypse by quelling any Wembley dad dancing in the FA Cup final. The Dutchman also took Manchester United to within goal difference of the Champions League places but that was not enough and so Jose Mourinho was appointed. One of his first moves was to orchestrate the arrival of Ibrahimovic, who proceeded to talk the considerable talk while actually walking the quite brilliant walk.",
      "But the significant knee knack he suffered in the Europa League quarter-final meant he would play only one Champions League game for Manchester United. He holds the record of most different clubs represented in the European Cup at seven, even if his solitary match in the competition for the Red Devils was as a second-half substitute in defeat to Basel.",
      "",
      "3) N’Golo Kante\nA peculiar set of circumstances meant the £30m departure of the midfielder most vital to a Premier League title win for a team that had finished 10th passed by without much consternation or controversy.",
      "Leicester resigned themselves to the idea that Kante would be the first noteworthy cab off the King Power rank and Chelsea duly obliged after Arsenal pulled out of the running over seemingly extortionate agent fees.",
      "Kante thus had to wait until September 2017 for his first taste of the Champions League, missing out on Leicester’s journey to the quarter-final the previous year and instead busying himself winning a consecutive Premier League title. The Frenchman would claim his European Cup by 2021 as man of the match in the final, cementing a legacy of making up for lost time and receiving the ultimate award for what was quite the leap of faith five years previous.",
      "Chelsea were out of European competition completely but still signed the epitome of a Champions League calibre player as Kante called “the opportunity to work with Antonio Conte, a brilliant coach… simply too good to turn down”.",
      "It is unknown if he felt the same way about Frank Lampard.",
      "",
      "2) Angel di Maria\nHe was an ill fit, a ‘complete fanny’, the polar opposite to what his manager sought and emblematic of a period during which the club favoured style over substance in the transfer market. Manchester United made a loss on Di Maria less than a year after his purchase for good reason.",
      "But it was a monumental capture at the time, albeit a flexing of superficial muscles to stroke an ego bruised by one failed post-Sir Alex Ferguson season. Manchester United finished the 2013/14 campaign in seventh and under the caretaker guidance of Ryan Giggs; Di Maria ended it as man of the match in the Champions League final and leading assist provider in La Liga with 18, having scored in a Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona.",
      "The closest he ever got to playing European football for the Red Devils was the trip to lose 2-1 to Swansea in February 2015 before departing for Paris Saint-Germain that August.",
      "",
      "1) Paul Pogba\nThe world-record fee was used as a stick with which critics could relentlessly beat the haircut out of Pogba. His reign as the most expensive footballer ever lasted a solitary year before Neymar made the £89.3m Manchester United paid Juventus look like a Willian Prunier clean sheet bonus. Yet often forgotten is one of the many wrinkles in that deal: the pull of home, Mourinho or infuriating Graeme Souness on a weekly basis persuaded one of the best young players around to abandon a recent Champions League finalist and serial Serie A title winner for whatever state Van Gaal left Old Trafford in.",
      "It was believed at the time that Real Madrid were the favourites – proving one immutable transfer truth – but when Los Blancos withdrew from the race over money, it was time to dust off Stormzy for the unveiling.",
      "From December 2015 to September 2017, Manchester United’s last chapter in their estimable European Cup history was to bring on Nick Powell against Wolfsburg. In between, they spent more on a player than any team ever before. Pogba remains the last player to open the scoring in a winning continental final for the club, putting Ajax to the Europa League sword to ensure Champions League qualification for a club that finished seven points off fourth in his first season.",
      "Pogba had his pick of clubs as a precocious and prodigious 23-year-old; both he and Manchester United might choose differently if given the option again.",
      "READ NEXT: Manchester United above Newcastle, Spurs, Atletico in ranking of transfer allure to new signings",
      "Man Utd should make move to re-sign former Red Devils midfielder Paul Pogba as they can’t “afford not to consider a move”, according to Dwight Yorke.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "With Trent Alexander-Arnold confirming his exit from Liverpool this summer, we look at the most valuable of all free transfers.",
      "Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold is off to Real Madrid. Naturally, we have picked the biggest free transfer departure for each Premier League club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘advancing’ to secure their first summer signing ahead of a major squad overhaul.",
      "Paul Pogba could play in the United States before making a ‘big jump’ to a European club in the summer, according to reports in France."

The number in brackets next to each player is where they ranked when this list was first compiled in April 2022, which included 45 signings at the time. Any players signed since then have the number from when they were added. Enjoy the drivel.",
      "",
      "65) Alexis Sanchez (swap) (45)\nThe Red Devils signed one of the best players in the Premier League on astronomical wages and he seemed to become an incompetent footballer overnight.",
      "",
      "64) Jadon Sancho (£76.5m) (5)\nTime is up for Sancho at Man Utd. And Chelsea. They’ve paid £5million so they don’t have to sign him permanently. Back to square one, it is.",

      "63) Andy Kellett (loan) (44)\nWho? Exactly.",
      "",
      "62) Radamel Falcao (£6.8m loan fee) (42)\nAnother player who joined with a huge reputation; Falcao failed to rediscover his FC Porto and Atletico Madrid form during his spell with Man Utd and then Chelsea.",

      "61) Antony (£80m) (16)\nThe Brazilian has been a catastrophic signing and Man Utd will be lucky to get £15m for him if he is put up for sale…is what we did say before an amazing loan spell at Real Betis. They might get £30m now. Still a huge loss but damage limitation and all that.",
      "",
      "60) Angel Di Maria (£67.5m) (43)\nJoining off the back of a man-of-the-match performance in a Champions League final, Di Maria flopped at Old Trafford. The only saving grace from his stint in Manchester is that the club recouped £56.7m when he was sold to PSG less than a year after arriving.",

      "",
      "60) Martin Dubravka (£2m loan fee) (41)\nWhen Dubravka joined from Newcastle United, many expected him to feature in the Europa League group stage, but Dubravka only played three cup games before having his loan terminated in January. What a pointless transfer.",
      "",
      "59) Jack Butland (loan) (39)\nBrought in for the rest of the season in January 2022 after Dubravka’s loan ended. Butland did not make a single appearance for the club.",
      "",
      "58) Odion Ighalo (£10.8m loan fee) (34)\n£10m is a lot of money for a loan deal, especially when the player doesn’t improve the squad.",

      "49) Dan James (£16m) (24)\nJames was never good enough for Man Utd and was probably only signed as he was seen as Young And Hungry. The best thing to come from his move is that they turned a rare profit when they sold him to Leeds United.",

He didn’t get much of a chance and was sold to Birmingham City for £1.5m after a successful year on loan before getting his chance in the Premier League with Luton Town, who he did quite well for.",

      "",
      "44) Timothy Fosu-Mensah (£342k) (28)\nFosu-Mensah was pretty cheap and the club turned a profit in the end. He made 30 first-team appearances and was quite useful due to his versatility.",

      "41) Wout Weghorst (£2.6m loan fee) (23)\nWeghorst came in to fill a gap between January and June 2023 and was signed for peanuts, unlike Ighalo. Even still, it was a weird spell for everyone involved.",
      "",
      "40) Henrikh Mkhitaryan (£37.8m) (21)\nThe other half of the worst deal on this list, Mkhitaryan joined with lofty expectations having provided 90 goal contributions in 140 games for Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He scored in a Europa League final victory for United. He also scored a scorpion kick (that would not have counted in the VAR era). Anything good he did for the club was eclipsed by the woeful swap deal which saw him go to Arsenal.",
      "",
      "39) Hannibal Mejbri (£9m) (18)\nBought from Monaco in 2019, Mejbri spent the 22/23 campaign on loan at Birmingham and wasted the second half of last season on loan at Sevilla. He is now at Burnley in the Championship.",
      "",
      "38) Nemanja Matic (£40m) (23)\nMan Utd signed Matic four years too late.",
      "",
      "37) Facundo Pellistri (£7.6m) (20)\nThere was plenty of faith in Pellistri to come good at Old Trafford but not enough apparently. He joined Panathinaikos for around £5m in the summer.",
      "",
      "36) Rasmus Hojlund (£64.7m) (17)\nIt’s make or break for Hojlund next season…if he’s still at the club.",
      "",
      "35) Tyrell Malacia (£13m) (15)\nMalacia quickly shifted Luke Shaw out of the starting XI before generously giving his spot back to the England international. Not a good signing, even for the price.",
      "",
      "34) Joshua Zirkzee (£36.5m) (26)\nZirkzee has had a horrible time of it since moving to Old Trafford from Bologna last summer. Ruben Amorim hung him out to dry with his first-half substitution against Newcastle. He actually bounced back pretty well but it would be very generous to say he looks like he belongs.",
      "",
      "33) Daley Blind (£15.7m) (16)\nBlind was a handy player to have. Versatile, consistent, rarely outstanding. He played over 140 times in four years at Old Trafford and is currently thriving at Girona.",
      "",
      "32) Alex Telles (£13.5m) (14)\nTelles was decent when called upon but Erik ten Hag sent him out on loan to Sevilla in his first summer at Old Trafford. He joined Al Nassr permanently last July and is now playing for Botafogo.",
      "",
      "31) Marouane Fellaini (£29m) (26)\nFellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "30) Anthony Martial (£54m) (12)\nMartial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He joined AEK Athens on a free transfer in September.",
      "",
      "29) Sofyan Amrabat (£8.5m loan fee) (24)\nIf Amrabat played like he did in his last month at Old Trafford all season, he would be a lot higher.",
      "",
      "28) Victor Lindelof (£31.5m) (11)\nAnother expensive centre-half, Lindelof has not been a bad signing. But ‘not bad’ doesn’t really cut the mustard for Manchester United. After all, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. Leaving on a free transfer this summer. He’s so Turkish Super Lig, isn’t he?",

      "25) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£49.5m) (40)\nWan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "24) Matthijs de Ligt (£38.4m) (24)\nAjax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another.",
      "",
      "23) Raphael Varane (£36m) (7)\nVarane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como in the summer and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",
      "",
      "22) Sergio Romero (free) (8)\nAs far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",
      "",
      "21) Andre Onana (£45.2m) (11)\nUpgrading on David de Gea should have been Ten Hag’s top priority when he took over and it took him a year to realise the Spaniard needed to be replaced. Do not be blinded by his 2022/23 Golden Glove.",
      "We thought Onana would be a big upgrade on De Gea but that’s not been the case. He makes far too many errors and his distribution is shaky, despite that being a compelling reason for ditching DDG for him.",
      "",
      "20) Jonny Evans (free) (38)\nIt is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",
      "",
      "19) Leny Yoro (£52m) (12)\nYoro’s potential is astronomical but that was a debut season to forget.",
      "",
      "18) Marcel Sabitzer (loan) (21)\nAs far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",
      "",
      "17) Ayden Heaven (£1.5m) (NE)\nHe might already be United’s best centre-half.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Cunha (£62.5m) (NE)\nSurely…surely this can’t go wrong.",
      "",
      "15) Juan Mata (£40m) (15)\nDavid Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "14) Fred (£53m) (10)\nA few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club.",
      "£53m is still pretty bloody steep, mind.",
      "",
      "13) Christian Eriksen (free) (4)\nA lot of us fancied Eriksen to be the bargain of the 2022/23 campaign and his transfer fee – or lack of – is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Will leave for nothing this summer.",
      "",
      "12) Edinson Cavani (free) (9)\nSeventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "11) Amad Diallo (£19m) (19)\nAfter a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was being written off by many (myself included). However, his time with Sunderland was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which is beginning to look like decent value for money…finally.",
      "",
      "10) Lisandro Martinez (£50m) (5)\nMartinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. The Argentine World Cup winner attracted interest from Arsenal before joining the Red Devils and it is clear to see why. His return from injury at the end of 2023/24 helped Ten Hag win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (£32m) (6)\nHerrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "8) Noussair Mazraoui (£12.8m) (17)\nHe is comfortably the best signing Man Utd made last summer.",
      "",
      "7) Cristiano Ronaldo (£13.5m) (4)\nThere’s not a lot to say that has not already been said. £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "6) Casemiro (£61.5m) (3)\nAfter spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was sitting right there willing to slot straight into their midfield.",
      "This is such a weird one now. In his debut season, Casemiro was outstanding and the main reason Ten Hag was able to end the club’s trophy drought and finish third in the Premier League, which is why he is so high here.",
      "In his second season, the Brazilian was awful. He looked remarkably off the pace and Man Utd prayed a Saudi Arabian club would bail them out in the summer.",
      "And then in 2024/25, he was one of Amorim’s better players. Funny ol’ game, innit?",
      "At this stage, the Red Devils shouldn’t be too bothered about what transfer fee they get; it’s all about getting Casemiro’s monstrous contract off the books. We’re not sure Saudi Arabia are even that stupid.",
      "",
      "5) Luke Shaw (£33.7m) (3)\nFitness issues and injuries have been the bane of Shaw’s Manchester United career.",
      "",
      "4) Diogo Dalot (£19.8m) (13)\nDalot’s time at the club looked up in the summer of 2021 with Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma circling, however, he has since established himself as the club’s first-choice right-back ahead of Wan-Bissaka, before it became the flip of a coin for Ten Hag.",
      "",
      "3) Alejandro Garnacho (£400k) (10)\nWhat a bargain and Man Utd intend to make some lovely profit in the summer.",
      "",
      "2) Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free) (2)\nThis is arguably the first signing on this list which was/has been a huge, unqualified success at Old Trafford. It only took 63 players to get here but at least we did.",
      "Zlatan scored 28 goals and provided 10 assists in his only full season, helped the Red Devils win the Europa League and scored a brace in the final of the League Cup as they beat Southampton 3-2 at Wembley. In 17/18, he struggled for fitness and left for LA Galaxy, for whom he scored 22 goals in 27 games in the same campaign.",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Fernandes (£56.7m) (1)\nAlthough his performances are not as good as they were during the behind-closed-doors days, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation at Old Trafford. In his first season and a half, Fernandes provided 65 goal contributions in 80 games and was the best player in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side by a country mile.",
      "He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and a rare bit of great business by the Red Devils. It will take a lot to bump him off top spot – especially after he proved his loyalty by snubbing silly Saudi Arabian money to stay.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Mikael Silvestre has given his verdict on what needs to happen next with Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Jadon Sancho will return to Man Utd this summer after Chelsea paid the £5m penalty to cancel their obligation to buy the winger, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has decided to ‘reject’ Al-Hilal and stay at Old Trafford ahead of next season, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes may leave Manchester United but it will not be because he attended a birthday dinner with his friend…"

      "Three of those players subsequently had their contracts terminated early, while Lacazette was at least allowed to see out his Arsenal deal before leaving on a free transfer when it expired. Presumably that’s why they have not signed a decent striker since.",

      "Add-ons make things a little murky – Watkins has surely achieved his while Buendia has not – but the total value of the package to bring in Diaby was in a different market to where Villa usually deal. They then somehow sold the Frenchman for a profit, which allowed them to break their transfer record for the Everton and Belgium midfielder.",

      "The previous two record signings bumped off this Brentford list by more recent deals were Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney; the hope is that Igor Thiago can have anything close to their success.

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",

That initial £64m fee paid to Benfica can rise as high as £85m, but not any time soon. That Van Dijk figure is likely to be blown out of the window by the £100m it will likely take to sign Florian Wirtz.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Fernandes was one of the only standout performers in the United side last season. He was the top scorer in the Premier League, where the Red Devils finished 15th, and in all competitions, he was directly involved in 38 goals.",
      "He recently reiterated his commitment to United, but that was put to the test by interest from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, who were willing to pay him a big sum of money to join.",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed on June 3 that Fernandes had decided against the move, as he wanted to continue playing at the top level in Europe.",
      "Now, Fernandes has revealed manager Amorim had a big say in his decision.",
      "“There was an opportunity. The [Al Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there,” Fernandes said.",
      "“They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach Amorim. He asked me not to go.",
      "“Manchester United didn’t want to sell me. They don’t need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.",
      "“Al Hilal were very kind. They spoke to my agent. Then I spoke to my wife. She asked: ‘What do you want to do?’ She always supports my decisions.",
      "“It would have been easy to move there. I know the Portuguese players there very well. But I want to play at the highest level and compete for major titles.",
      "“I can do that, and I still want to. I’m very passionate about football.”",
      "Amorim was adamant about Fernandes’ position at United in March, when there was a suggestion that Real Madrid could look to sign him.",
      "He said: “No, it’s not going to happen. He’s not going anywhere because I’ve already told him.”",
      "Indeed, it looks as though Amorim has got his way, with the huge riches at Al Hilal failing. Whether a big European side approaching for Fernandes would have an impact is a different story, but Amorim would clearly be against that.",
      "The midfielder was clearly happy to listen to his boss on this occasion, so United will hope any other approaches are met with the same mindset.",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",

Former Sporting CP boss Amorim hasn’t had a pre-season or a summer transfer window yet but United’s results do have to speak for themselves to some degree and finishing in the bottom six of the Premier League isn’t going to be anywhere near good enough next season.",

      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",
      "Chelsea provided that platform and their sole regret will be that Palmer’s contract only runs for another eight years.",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Tottenham (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker will leave the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo – £115m in August 2023",
      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Noni Madueke and Robert Sanchez are on a list of 14 players put up for sale by Chelsea this summer, and Cole Palmer has been tipped for a shock exit.",
      "Cole Palmer has spoken of his excitement to play in Chelsea’s Europa Conference League final amid heading praise on Enzo Maresca.",
      "It’s the final weekend of the season and that means permutations time as the European places are settled while Liverpool host a giant party.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester City want to sign a Newcastle star to replace one of their stalwarts for the Club World Cup and beyond.",
      "Mason Mount’s big night in Europe could spark a renaissance, with the Man Utd star and seven more Big Six strugglers set for an upturn next season…"

      "It’s high time for an update of the all-important F365 Premier League Mood Rankings, the deeply scientific and highly rigorous ordering of the 20 top-flight clubs based entirely on feels and vibes.",
      "Fun fact: Google’s AI overview once claimed this utter nonsense was compiled by a supercomputer, when it is in fact the work of a prick.",
      "Anyway, we were right about one thing last time: Spurs could only end the season in first or last. We’ll be honest, though, we are a bit surprised about which one it’s turned out to be. The good news is that Spurs are still Spurs, and thus are about to split their fanbase into two warring, furious tribes based on whether they make the absurd, unthinkable decision to keep Ange Postecoglou or the absurd, unthinkable decision to sack him.",
      "Either way, we’re extremely confident they’ll be 16th by August and 20th by October. Possibly in the actual league too.",
      "",
      "20) West Ham (10)\nA slight late rally – built entirely on taking handfuls of points off entirely distracted Europa League finalists and relegated flotsam – has done little to lift the general mood of despair around the London Stadium, but if you squint hard enough it’s possible to imagine brighter times ahead.",
      "Graham Potter strikes us as a ‘needs a full pre-season’ kind of a manager. He’s the sort of manager they should have chosen in the first place when trying to draw a line under the David Moyes Era, rather than just getting someone who was very like David Moyes only more foreign and more emotional.",
      "Julen Lopetegui never looked like working out and West Ham p*ssed a season away because of it, and that was a shame because they did do some eye-catching transfer work last summer. It is still possible that it wasn’t a complete waste of time and we are not yet sure it’s right to rush to judgement on Potter. It’s still possible Brighton Potter is in there somewhere.",
      "But for now, it’s all guesswork and speculation after a miserable season that was supposed to signal the start of a new era. And there’s no point pretending that Tottenham winning a trophy isn’t a very annoying crowning turd in the Hammers’ overflowing bowl.",
      "",
      "19) Manchester City (17)\nNot winning the league is one thing, but not winning anything? That’s a problem. Dig deeper and it’s even worse, because they didn’t even really compete for anything other than the FA Cup.",
      "They were never in a title race, they stunk the Champions League out and lost to Spurs – what is it with City and Spurs? – in the early rounds of the Carabao. Only in the FA Cup did they even halfway resemble their old selves, staying upright as the other big beasts tumbled all around them, only to then lose to an inspired Crystal Palace in the final.",
      "Undoubtedly their worst and most difficult season since Pep Guardiola turned them into a trophy-gobbling machine, and the problem for City now is that doubt exists where no doubt existed before.",
      "Maybe they come back next season and win the league again. Maybe. But there’s no certainty anymore. You can’t even say with great conviction they’ll be in the title race.",
      "That itself is a wild situation to be in when you’re talking about a team that had won six of the last seven league titles before this season.",
      "They really were worse in just every way as well this year. Their fewest wins since 2015/16, most defeats, and fewest goals scored. The 44 goals they conceded was their worst since 2009/10 and the world was a very different place for City back then, right at the start of their journey to world domination.",
      "The team that won the lot is breaking up. Kyle Walker is gone, Kevin De Bruyne is gone. There are huge doubts over whether Guardiola himself has the drive or inclination or will to push through with the regeneration and build another great side. And if he doesn’t, what then?",
      "It’s all doubt and guesswork where previously there existed absolute certainty. And they’ve got to play in the Club World Cup.",
      "‘Oh no we didn’t win any trophies and only finished third and have to play in a Club World Cup’ are among the more first-world footballing problems imaginable, sure, but these things are all relative and this is a situation that City simply haven’t faced for several years now.",
      "",
      "18) Manchester United (15)\nAn absolute basket-case of a club who’ve just suffered the twin indignities of finishing an unthinkable 15th in the Premier League and losing an actual cup final to actual Spurs, but there’s no denying that their early summer transfer business is at the eye-catching end with Prem-proven arrivals confirmed (Cunha) and imminent (Mbeumo) from the sort of teams that have, uncomfortably, now become United’s direct rivals.",
      "Those are important moves not because they are good players who dramatically and necessarily improve United – although they are that – but because they serve as proof that for the time being at least this remains Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "United – or at the very least United wages – still have a pull that transcends their current status. And that offers meaningful hope that this absurd beast of a football club can still be brought to heel despite itself.",
      "The clock is ticking, though. We’re not entirely sure just how long United will remain a name that resonates so with players, but we do know that time is finite.",
      "We’ve already seen the United Will Get The Job Done In A Final myth utterly busted in Bilbao, but there’s no denying this swift summer foray into the transfer market is providing some repair to a deeply damaged brand.",
      "",
      "17) Arsenal (9)\nMust reluctantly accept the mantle of Banter Club and also acknowledge that they have largely brought it upon themselves.",
      "Finishing second again need not be disastrous, but there was definite regression and losing out to Liverpool rather than Man City makes life far harder for that particular breed of fan who refers to the club as ‘The Arsenal’ and believes they represent some bastion of class and heritage and history rather than just being another very rich football club that spends lots of money.",
      "The big problem for Arsenal is that they didn’t win anything. Again. The bigger problem is that somehow – ludicrous and ridiculous a freaky fluke as it may be – Spurs did. And that has shifted the dynamic of the north London scene, for now at least.",
      "It’s not fair, it’s not big and it’s certainly not clever but Arsenal have no choice but to swallow at least a year of ‘Worra trophy’ every time they start mouthing off about beating PSG on xG and such. They really are just going to have to take it, and while we are always reluctant to judge any fanbase by its most conspicuous online gobshites, it would massively help if they stop being very sniffy indeed about Spurs winning a competition – for a third time no less – that Arsenal themselves have never managed to win.",
      "The whole ‘who’s had a better season?’ debate is facetious and largely in bad faith. There’s a very coherent argument to make that neither Spurs nor Arsenal should want to swap with the other. After 17 years, a trophy moved the needle for Spurs in a way that no amount of process-trusting second-place finishes ever could, while there remains still the sense that Arsenal are building towards something big in a way that Spurs shithousing a European pot in their worst domestic season for over 40 years absolutely does not.",
      "But until and unless Arsenal arrive at their destination – and there are never any guarantees you’ll get there until you do – then they live in Banter Town. Only one road out of there, lads.",
      "READ: Man Utd, Man City and Arsenal fell so far short of every single target",
      "",
      "16) Brentford (12)\nDid some madly entertaining things this season, with the whole ‘winning all our home games but losing all our away games and then switching that around for no real reason’ bit one of our very favourites from this season.",
      "The run of home games late last year that produced five straight wins by scores of 5-3, 4-3, 3-2, 4-1 and 4-2 was sensational, as really was the fact that 4-2 win (over Newcastle no less) was in fact Brentford’s last home win for four months.",
      "All those lads from about eighth to 12th were good value this season, and the only real criticism of Brentford is that they so rigidly confined their sense of fun to league matters when they looked every inch the sort of side that could and should have put together some kind of run at at least one of the cups. Especially the way this season panned out for rogue winners of cups.",
      "Overall, though, an excellent season with good vibes. But while Brentford’s business model is one that doesn’t just cope with the loss of key assets but positively thrives on it, the idea of losing both Bryan Mbeumo and Thomas Frank in one summer would appear to be something that might stretch that beyond its elastic limit. The very real possibility of this coming to pass has to harsh the buzz a bit.",
      "",
      "15) Burnley (-)\nPerhaps the most interesting of the promoted teams. Think we all kind of know what to expect, to some degree, from the other two. Leeds should give it a proper go as one of few teams outside the now Settled Seventeen with the requisite heft to muscle their way into the closed shop. Sunderland should go down and suffer frequent heavy punishment for their Icarus-like ‘promoted a season too early’ folly.",
      "But what of Burnley? They are so different to the last Burnley team to come up, who did it playing glorious football that simply didn’t survive contact with the rarefied Barclays air. Now, though, they are a team led by Scott Parker, a man so haunted by a 9-0 humiliation at Liverpool when in charge of Bournemouth that he has simply vowed to never concede another goal ever again, even if that means – and last season it very often did – not scoring any either.",
      "Now the last couple of years have been filled with chat about the hubris of promoted teams, about their failure to be sufficiently humble to take their medicine and accept that what got them here can’t keep them here. That the way teams like Brentford or Brighton adapted to survive the transition to the far, far higher level is apparently now too much to ask of teams like Southampton, and especially Vincent Kompany’s Burnley.",
      "But what about this Burnley? They’ve sufferballed their way in, so could they now sufferball their way to 15th? It does feel more likely than trying to Temu Man City their way there like Kompany or Russell Martin.",
      "Yet at the same time it does also feel like they might just end up like Homer Simpson when he gets in the ring with Drederick Tatum. Premier League teams might not get tired. That cactus is right!",
      "",
      "14) Sunderland (-)\nAnother thrilling Championship play-off final, another big club with a proud history getting itself foolishly promoted when it is visibly and palpably unready.",
      "But those are concerns for far later in the summer. Let us not sully their celebratory moment with talk of it being another great chance for Derby to get their names out of the record books at long last.",
      "That kind of chat is for August, or perhaps late July. For now, the best advice for Sunderland would appear to be go Full Forest and sign a bunch of players and worry about the rules later. The alternative paths for a team that finished 24 points behind the other promoted teams are simply too ghastly to think about for long.",
      "",
      "13) Fulham (11)\nWe love Fulham. They have carved out a niche as the Premier League’s most reliable ‘can beat anybody, can lose to anybody’ team and it’s a tremendous way to go about 50-odd point-securing mid-table comfort.",
      "They are a team that often manages to get themselves on the edge of European talk around February or March only to be nowhere near it by May without anyone really noticing or complaining about how they fell off. Seems a nice way to live.",
      "Even the way this season ended was perfectly on brand, their European hopes fading away in accordance with the prophecy as they lost six of their last nine league games after a heavy FA Cup defeat to Palace.",
      "Obviously one of the nine games they didn’t lose was a 3-2 win over the champions – and this was at the start of April, weeks before Liverpool had officially wrapped up the title and gone full beach/flip-flop/cigars.",
      "Fulham this season managed to lose to Wolves, West Ham, Everton, and Manchester United, draw with Tottenham, Southampton and Ipswich (twice) and beat Newcastle (twice), Nottingham Forest (twice), Chelsea and Liverpool.",
      "Never change, lads. Never change.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth (8)\nUltimately finished second in the tremendously fun eighth-twelfth mini-league of enormously entertaining mid-table teams as Brighton pulled clear in the closing weeks to claim first place. Well, eighth place. But you know what we mean.",
      "Bournemouth, though, remain our favourite of this gaggle of teams that also contains Brentford, Fulham and Palace. There’s something similar going on at all these clubs, who have become the Premier League’s affluent and aspirational middle-class over the last couple of years as the league’s wealth has grown and their own status within it solidified.",
      "All of them are doing fine work in the crucial field of making mid-table life fun by being capable of going on wild runs of startling form at both ends of the spectrum, but Bournemouth are the ones for us who most conspicuously pass the eye test.",
      "There are two versions of this Bournemouth team under Andoni Iraola. The one that goes on 11-match unbeaten runs that includes smashing top-seven teams to absolute pieces in back-to-back games, and the team that wins one match in nine trying to remember what they were doing in the first bit.",
      "Bournemouth’s best football this season has been alarmingly close to the best football played by anyone this season, and that’s a wonderful thing. We’re not sure Iraola and this team will ever crack the code entirely and be able to turn those spells of seemingly effortless flow-state brilliance into an entire season but imagine if they did. Wouldn’t that be something, eh?",
      "",
      "11) Everton (7)\nNot as giddy now as in those early days of David Moyes’ return, but still far happier with their on-field lot than could possibly have been predicted halfway through the season.",
      "What makes Everton so hard to place now is how to weigh up the emotional wrench of leaving Goodison Park after over a century of memories and history versus the excitement of moving into their new ground and all the potential that brings.",
      "So what we’re going to do at this point is simply avoid that kind of complicated brain-melter altogether and simply put them right there in the middle. And there’s nothing you can do about it.",
      "",
      "10) Brighton\nFinished the season like an absolute train to finish one place and in the end just four points behind a stumbling Nottingham Forest. Always bittersweet when you end a season like that.",
      "Sure, it’s never a bad thing to end on a high note and approach the summer with confidence for the next but at the same time Brighton ended the campaign sufficiently clear of their fellow entertaining mid-table chums (your Bournemouths, your Brentfords, the Fulhams of this world) and sufficiently close to the European spots that you can’t help but look wistfully at things like drawing six (and losing the other two) in an eight-game run around Christmas last year or even April’s failure to secure more than a single point from three games against Palace, Leicester and Brentford.",
      "Overall, though, eighth place in the Premier League and genuine reason to believe Fabian Hurzeler’s second season can be even better than his first with that vital year’s worth of experience means the vibes on the south coast are very good indeed.",
      "",
      "9) Nottingham Forest (2)\nAh, the cruelty of shifting expectations. Let’s be real here, it’s still been an extraordinary season for Forest, who went from relegation battlers last season to spending much of this campaign on the fringes of the title race before falling away on the finishing straight to end ‘only’ seventh.",
      "It’s just human nature that doing it that way doesn’t feel quite as good as surging up to pinch seventh and a European spot after spending most of the season in 12th.",
      "But while there will be some fans for whom only being in the Europa Conference represents the sky falling in, the vast majority of fans will, we suspect, see the bigger picture here. Not least the fact they now find themselves in a competition that offers a huge chance of adding a new chapter to a storied European history at the City Ground.",
      "",
      "8) Wolves (13)\nWere briefly and giddily the best team in the land for a while there, winning six straight games between mid-March and the end of April, at which point a far loftier mood position appeared on the cards with Vitor Pereira getting an absolute tune out of what turned out to be a far more talented squad than Gary O’Neil had made us all think,",
      "But one point from their last four games is a familiar damp squib of a season end for a team that has history for allowing the way one season ends to bleed into how the next begins.",
      "Another slow start and more managerial uncertainty in the early months of next season really would be annoying when it looked like they really might hit the summer with proper momentum.",
      "Losing Matheus Cunha is no shock to anyone, but a massive blow nonetheless. Especially with him making such a sideways move to Man United.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa (5)\nSimmering resentment over the manner of missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day should ultimately give way to acknowledgement that sixth probably represents a fair enough reflection of their overall league season and is a decent enough effort when combined with a fine run on their return to European football’s top table.",
      "They have got their feet back under the table now as a big deal in the Premier League and there is an obvious silver lining for any good Premier League team that finds itself narrowly missing out on the Champions League and finding itself instead in the Europa: that is now an enormously winnable trophy, and one that needn’t be a massive drain on the first half of your season given the fact even Spurs and United were largely able to coast into cosy top-eight finishes.",
      "A quick glance at the current confirmed qualifiers suggests precious little to fear for a team coming off an impressive Champions League run, let’s put it that way.",
      "We understand why, obviously, clubs want to be in the Champions League for the money and the prestige and did we mention money, but if you’re a fan of a club like Aston Villa then the idea of a proper run at winning the Europa has to appeal.",
      "",
      "6) Chelsea (14)\nCompleting the new full set of European trophies and becoming the first team to do so is a neat result for completionists everywhere.",
      "Being the first to do something is always a buzz because while others can eventually match the achievement, nobody else can ever be first. And probably nobody will match it for ages anyway; who knows how long it might be before Man United can lift themselves back to the level of qualifying for the Conference League to have a crack themselves?",
      "If winning the third-tier European comp was a bit of a penalty kick and in fact the only way to avoid embarrassment in that competition, getting themselves back in the top four after some difficult Premier League campaigns was something with a bit more bite, even if the title challenge promised in the early months of the season faded away to nothing in the end.",
      "We are still in the realm of bare-minimum achievement for a club that has spent such hilarious amounts on compiling their squad, but it’s also a bare minimum that has not been met for a while now.",
      "We remain powerfully unconvinced by Enzo Maresca, but it’s hard to view the season just gone as anything other than one that has demonstrably placed Chelsea closer to where they ought to be and for his first year that was enough. It wouldn’t be enough next season, though, and having to actually deploy first-team players throughout a European campaign obviously represents a fresh challenge.",
      "",
      "5) Leeds (-)\nPromoted in often scintillating style and, whether anyone else likes it or not, are one of vanishingly few Championship clubs for whom a meaningful stab at breaking open the Premier League’s Settled Seventeen represents a realistic ambition and not just a hopeful pipe dream.",
      "Still need a big and busy summer to have anything like a squad ready to cope with what the Premier League has become even since their last crack at it, but a real sense that Leeds are ready to give it a go.",
      "Very much still in the celebratory partying stage of the Premier League promotion cycle and while The Fear will kick in for them as it does for everyone at some point, how Leeds go next season does feel like it’s an important barometer of the wider health of the upper levels of the English football pyramid; if Leeds disappear without a trace then the question becomes who, if anyone, won’t do that?",
      "And if the only viable answers there become Birmingham, or Wrexham, then you’re really just raising further uncomfortable questions.",
      "Tits to all that for now, though, yeah? Leeds are back. They’re pretty chuffed about it, and don’t really care whether anyone else is.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool (6)\nSome fans deciding to be a bit weird about Trent Alexander-Arnold is so not rainbow rhythms and the fact Liverpool didn’t win another game after confirming the league title is all at the same time a) funny b) largely irrelevant but also c) slightly annoying.",
      "We’re all of us bedevilled by recency bias and while of course Liverpool fans are mainly still celebrating their first league title in front of fans since 1990, there’s a part of all of us that knows were we in their position we’d still be slightly narked about the four-game winless run to end the season even though logically we shouldn’t give a sh*t.",
      "This is very small beer, though, especially with the club already making statement moves in what is going to be a huge summer that will reveal whether Arne Slot can be as successful with his own side as he was with Jurgen Klopp’s.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong and especially the seemingly imminent Florian Wirtz are hugely exciting moves. Wirtz in particular is a massive statement of intent and indicator of how big Liverpool’s pull now is. If you’re not getting giddy about that one, you’re in the wrong game.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle (1)\nNewcastle absolutely should not, will not and do not care one jot, but it’s very funny to us that the English football media collectively wanked themselves so entirely dry at Newcastle finally winning a trophy only for two other conspicuous pot-dodgers to collect two even bigger prizes before the season was out.",
      "Like we say, though: amusing to us, irrelevant to Newcastle. The cathartic release of all those long-awaited trophy wins was magical for those involved, and there really is no need for anything so gauche as comparisons or guff about who it meant more for.",
      "Newcastle backing up that emotional Carabao success by claiming fifth place and with it Champions League football next season places this at the summit of Newcastle seasons in the modern era and there really is no obvious reason why it shouldn’t now be just the start of something even greater.",
      "The mood is good, is what we’re saying here. Or it was until they realised they still couldn’t beat Manchester United to transfers.",
      "",
      "2) Crystal Palace (4)\nFifty points and an FA Cup win? They really are glad all over. We know we’re probably the only ones on earth who would put those achievements in that order, but we’ve been very invested in the Palace 50 points story for the last couple of years and are absolutely delighted to see them do it.",
      "But even we can acknowledge that getting 50 Premier League points in a season for the first time is not quite as good as winning major silverware for the very first time.",
      "In a season of remarkable drought-ending trophy success, nothing was greater than Palace’s. These were supporters with powerful reason to think this was a day that might never come, at least not in their lifetimes.",
      "The appointment of Oliver Glasner already merits discussion among the most astute managerial appointments any Premier League club has ever made. He came to a club with some compelling raw materials but has had a transformative effect few could have predicted.",
      "Are we still talking about FA Cup wins or are we back banging on about getting 50 points? We prefer not to speak.",
      "",
      "1) Tottenham (20)\nThey really are That Club, ending the trophy drought but absolutely not their banter era in the single most Spurs way imaginable.",
      "It is ridiculous to even imagine a team that finishes 17th qualifying for the Champions League, but when you do give it any kind of attention it immediately becomes clear only one club could possibly do it and that’s the one that didn’t qualify for the Champions League when they finished fourth.",
      "Only Spurs could achieve something like that after a decade of agony and then get about 10 days to fully enjoy and revel in no longer being the butt of everyone’s jokes – a mantle which, to make things even better, passed immediately to Arsenal – before going ‘Hang on, what do we actually do about a manager who won a trophy but also finished 17th?’",
      "Other clubs just aren’t like this.",
      "The genius of this Spurs season is just how long it’s been so clear that it had only two possible end-points. The miracle is which one has actually happened. We said this in March and apart from failing to mention Palace in the FA Cup it still captures the essence of the absurdity that is Tottenham’s 24/25 season:",
      "There remains, somehow, the small but decidedly non-zero chance that Postecoglou pulls an absolute Homer and wins the Europa League. It’s impossible to overstate just how much that transforms everything about this season.",
      "It might not be the most important thing about it, but we do think there are only two places Spurs can end the season in these rankings, and those two places are first and last.",
      "This is a season that for Spurs really does appear to have crystallised and distilled down to two possible outcomes. First, and most likely, their worst season since before the Premier League And The Invention Of Football. When you consider just how utterly crap Spurs were for much of the nineties and early noughties, that’s a staggering achievement.",
      "But not as staggering as the only alternative which is an end to their own trophy drought and with it qualification for the Champions League, which would genuinely make this Spurs’ best season for at least 40 years.",
      "Spurs’ existential despair over that albatross of a trophy drought has already been exacerbated by Newcastle exorcising their own demons, and with every chance of Villa, Bournemouth, Forest, Brighton or somesuch also joining the ever-growing list of clubs to win a trophy more recently than Tottenham there is a profound sense that while it’s always true that whatever happens in football the joke is always on Spurs it may never have been more true, the joke never more entirely on them, than it has been this season.",

      "Mikael Silvestre has admitted Manchester United will need ‘more than two or three years’ to emerge from their slump, as he gave his verdict on what needs to happen next with manager Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The United boss is under huge pressure after failing to make a positive impact since succeeding Erik ten Hag as United boss last November, with defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final providing a miserable footnote to the club’s worst season in a generation.",
      "United appear to have gone backwards since Amorim’s arrival and the Portuguese tactician has given public hints that he is willing to walk away from the club if the owners have lost faith in his abilities.",
      "Yet Silvestre, who won the Premier League title four times and also the Champions League during his time as a United player, has insisted Amorim should not be the fall guy for United’s demise.",
      "“These questions about Amorim’s future are complete nonsense because he took over in November and this is not his team,” Silvestre told Football365 with Esports Insider.",
      "“He has not had any time to influence his philosophy and how he wants to play and these are not the players he wants.",
      "READ: Man Utd signing £365m Premier League sextet now inevitable after Cunha, Mbeumo transfers",
      "“They are not his players. The only player they signed in January was Patrick Dorgu and now Amorim has to be given the time and the financial backing to strengthen the squad.",
      "“After that, we can judge what he doing. It will always be the results that decide what happens to a manager, but you cannot decide after half a season when he has not had a transfer window to fix it. We can only stick with him for the future.”",
      "Silvestre went on to express his hope that rumours linking United captain Bruno Fernandes with a move to the Saudi Pro League will evaporate, as the Frenchman insists the club need to hang on to their best player.",
      "Fernandes’ body language on the field has been criticised by former United players like Roy Keane, but Silvestre offers up a different verdict on the impact of the Portuguese playmaker.",
      "“There is no argument about Bruno’s commitment and level,” stated Silvestre. “The amount of football he has played this season shows a level of dedication and he has been their best player, for sure.",
      "“I hope Bruno stays because it is important that the top players are there to maintain the level and allow others to grow.",
      "“You look at someone like Kobi Mainoo and who is he going to look up to? It’s Bruno. He will learn from his movement and his passing. So it is really important that Bruno stays.”",
      "Silvestre went on to suggest United’s dramatic fall from grace has been hard to watch, as he admits last season’s FA Cup final win against Manchester United papered over cracks at the club, as he hinted they will many years to find a solution.",
      "“It’s shocking to see United where they are,” said Silvestre. “You do not expect a club of that stature to finish in this position in the league, but this has been coming. It has been mismanaged for many years and eventually it catches up with you.",
      "“When you ask how long they need to put it right, I’m going to say many years. I’m going to say more than two or three years. United have been standing still for too long and everyone else has been getting stronger.",
      "“Let’s see what Amorim can do. He needs at least three transfer windows in the summer to see if he can build a team, but it is a long time before they start to move up the ladder again.",
      "“The FA Cup final result (beating Manchester City) last season disguised the real position, but I still feel this team had more in the tank to finish a lot higher than they did this season.”",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",
      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Football pundit Martin Keown has questioned the viability of head coach Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and come up with an absolutely bananas suggestion for a replacement.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has decided to ‘reject’ Al-Hilal and stay at Old Trafford ahead of next season, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes may leave Manchester United but it will not be because he attended a birthday dinner with his friend…"

      "“I think Garnacho will leave purely because of that, I think they’ve had enough. Garnacho can play in the Premier League, no doubt, but I think he’ll love it in Spain, he’ll thrive over there, he’ll score goals.",
      "“He’ll probably be someone next season that we’re all looking back on thinking, ‘Why didn’t Manchester United keep him?’, that type of thing will probably happen, there’s an element of that, but I think he has to go.",
      "“That’s not me throwing my toys out the pram and saying, ‘Get him out the club!’… no, for him and the club, I think it’s right that he goes.",
      "“Those four players should leave, not just because Manchester United should let them go, but because they should go and find themselves a place in their lives where they can go and play football because it’s not at Old Trafford.”",
      "Neville does not want Kobbie Mainoo to leave, though, the Man Utd legend went on: “Mainoo, no. That’s a step too far.",
      "“If we can’t give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield… I look at Mainoo and the way he plays football and I think a top club would want him.",
      "“Why can’t we make him a top player? If he’s one of ours and he’s shown talent.",
      "“I don’t know what’s gone on there in the last few months. He’s obviously had some injuries which has caused him a problem so he needs to stay fit, but I’d like to think he could be one of that two in midfield that Ruben Amorim plays.",
      "“It’s probably not Casemiro as his partner and it’s probably not Ugarte as his partner, it’s probably someone else in there who is better than those two, if I’m being honest.",
      "“But we should be building around Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield and not because he’s come through the ranks.”",
      "Gary Neville has “doubled down” on his previous Premier League title predictions and once again forecast Arsenal as next year’s winners.",

      "That would have boosted their transfer budget ahead of the summer but now they could be forced to sell a number of players to give Amorim the players he needs to implement his style of play.",

      "",
      "25) Leicester (2015/16)\nNampalys Mendy (Nice, £13m), Ron-Robert Zieler (Hannover 96, £2.6m), Luis Hernandez (Sporting Gijon, free), Raul Uche Rubio (Rayo Vallecano, undisclosed), Ahmed Musa (CSKA Moscow, £16m), Bartosz Kapustka (Cracovia, £7.5m), Islam Slimani (Sporting, £29.7m).",
      "It’s fair to say Mendy didn’t quite rise to the unreasonable challenge of replacing N’Golo Kante and actually, none of this bunch of misfits really rose to the challenge of playing Premier League football.",
      "",
      "24) Chelsea (2009/10)\nYossi Benayoun (Liverpool, £5m), Matej Delac (Inter Zapresic, £2.7m), Tomas Kalac (Sigma Olomouc, £5m).",
      "This sorry trio makes the decision to sack Carlo Ancelotti at the end of the 2010/11 season after finishing second, a year on from the double, all the more absurd.",
      "",
      "23) Manchester City (2011/12)\nJack Rodwell (Everton, £12m), Scott Sinclair (Swansea, £8m), Maicon (Inter Milan, undisclosed), Richard Wright (Preston North End, free), Matija Nastasic (Fiorentina, undisclosed), Javi Garcia (Benfica, £16m).",
      "City were really quite sh*t at transfers before Pep Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain arrived.",
      "",
      "22) Manchester City (2013/14)\nFernando (Porto, £12m), Bacary Sagna (Arsenal, free), Willy Caballero (Malaga, £6m), Eliaquim Mangala (Porto, £32m), Frank Lampard (New York City, loan), Bruno Zuculini (Racing Club, £1.5m).",
      "See, terrible.",
      "",
      "21) Manchester United (2012/13)\nGuillermo Varela (Penarol, £1m), Marouane Fellaini (Everton, £27.5m).",
      "David Moyes was on a hiding to nothing.",
      "",
      "20) Manchester United (1999/00)\nFabien Barthez (Monaco, £7.8m)",
      "He was essentially proof of United being so good that even a liability for a goalkeeper couldn’t knock them off course.",
      "",
      "19) Chelsea (2016/17)\nDanny Drinkwater (Leicester, £35m), Davide Zappacosta (Torino, £23m), Alvaro Morata (Real Madrid, £60m), Willy Caballero (Manchester City, free), Antonio Rudiger (Roma, £34m), Tiemoue Bakayoko (Monaco, £40m), Ethan Ampadu (Exeter, free)",
      "Rudiger is a big reason why Chelsea won a second Champions League, but Drinkwater and Bakayoko have got to be up there with pound-for-pound the worst midfield signings in Premier League history and Alvaro Morata’s Premier League goals cost Chelsea just shy of £4m each.",
      "",
      "18) Chelsea (2014/15)\nPedro (Barcelona, £21.4m), Baba Rahman (FC Augsburg, £17.7m), Asmir Begovic (Stoke, £8m), Kenedy (Fluminense, £6.3m), Nathan (Atletico Paranaense, £4.5m), Papy Djilobodji (Nantes, £2.7m), Danilo Pantic (Partizan Belgrade, £1.25m), Michael Hector (Reading, Undisclosed), Radamel Falcao (AS Monaco, Loan).",
      "We would suggest the excellent addition of Pedro from Barcelona was counteracted somewhat by them signing Baba Rahman for nearly as much money, putting him on £90,000 per week and then inexplicably extending his contract after three years, meaning his seven-year stay at Chelsea cost them nearly £33m. He made 23 appearances.",
      "",
      "17) Manchester City (2023/24)\nSavinho (Troyes, £21m), Ilkay Gundogan (Barcelona, free).",
      "Signing a £50m player from themselves for £21m hasn’t worked out as well as many hoped/feared and Gundogan hasn’t been the Gundogan which left for Barcelona, and crucially, not a Rodri.",
      "",
      "16) Manchester City (2022/23)\nMateo Kovacic (£25m, Chelsea), Josko Gvardiol (£77m, RB Leipzig), Jeremy Doku (£55.5m, Rennes), Matheus Nunes (£53m, Wolves).",
      "Kovacic has been fine and Gvardiol’s probably been the best left-back in the Premier League across his two seasons at the club, but Doku hasn’t lived up to his early promise and there’s been no promise of a positive sort from Nunes.",
      "",
      "15) Manchester City (2020/21)\nJack Grealish (£100m, Aston Villa), Karky (£9m, Fluminense).",
      "We’re guessing the majority would say Grealish has not been a success as Manchester City, but surely a treble is worth far more than £100m and we don’t think they would have done it without him.",
      "",
      "14) Manchester United (2007/08)\nDimitar Berbatov (Tottenham, £31m), Zoran Tosic (Partizan, £5m), Ritchie De Laet (Stoke City, £200k).",
      "Adding Berbatov to a striker canon of Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Danny Welbeck was just plain greedy and speaks to a squad built to the point of not needing to sign anyone.",

      "A window saved by Valencia, who was an inspired addition.",
      "",
      "12) Arsenal (2001/02)\nGilberto Silva (Atletico Mineiro, £4.5m), Pascal Cygan (Lille, £2m).",
      "Gilberto was a lovely footballer; Cygan less so.",
      "",
      "11) Liverpool (2019/20)\nKostas Tsimikas (£11.7m, Olympiakos), Thiago (£20m, Bayern Munich), Diogo Jota (£41m, Wolves).",
      "Jota has largely been excellent when fit but Liverpool surely wouldn’t have signed him had they known he would miss 99 games though injury in five years at the club. The definitely wouldn’t have signed Thiago, who missed over 100 games in four years.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester City (2017/18)\nRiyad Mahrez (£60m, Leicester), Philippe Sandler (£2.25m, PEC Zwolle), Daniel Arzani (undisclosed, Melbourne City).",
      "We love Mahrez so, so much and will continue to bat for him being named among the Premier League’s greatest ever wingers. He makes our greatest 10 signings made by Premier League champions list.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea (2004/05)\nMichael Essien (Lyon, £24.5m), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City, £21m), Asier Del Horno (Athletic Club, £9m), Lassana Diarra (Le Havre, £3m).",
      "Essien proved himself well worth what was seen as a massive transfer fee for a midfielder. Wright-Phillips never quite made the grade and Del Horno is best only remembered for charging at a 19-year-old Lionel Messi and being sent off while both of them rolled around on the floor.",
      "",
      "8) Manchester United (2010/11)\nDavid De Gea (Atletico Madrid, £17.8m), Phil Jones (Blackburn, £16.5m), Ashley Young (Aston Villa, £16m).",
      "Four Player of the Year awards makes De Gea arguably one of the best indicators of United’s demise – you don’t want a goalkeeper to be your best player – but it also obviously means he was a successful signing, as was Young, and Jones too, despite a career of wholly unfair p*ss-taking.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea (2005/06)\nAndriy Shevchenko (AC Milan, £31m), John Obi Mikel (Lyn, £16m), Khalid Boulahrouz (Hamburg, £9m), Ashley Cole (Arsenal, £5m), Salomon Kalou (Feyenoord, £1.5m), Michael Ballack (Bayern Munich, free), Hilario (Nacional, free).",
      "Cole and Ballack for a combined £5m is very good going and Kalou was a snip too. Plus we had the whole Mikel in a Manchester United shirt before signing for Chelsea story arc, which was a joy.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal (2003/04)\nManuel Almunia (Celta Vigo, £3.5m), Robin van Persie (Feyenoord, £2.75m), Mathieu Flamini (Marseille, £400k), Arturo Lupoli (Parma, £200k).",
      "Incredible that Almunia cost more than Van Persie. Flamini for less than half a million isn’t bad going either.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United (2000/01)\nJuan Sebastian Veron (Lazio, £28m), Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV, £19m), Roy Carroll, (Wigan, £1.5m), Luke Steele (Peterborough, £400k), Laurent Blanc (Inter, free), Kieran Richardson (West Ham, free).",
      "Veron was the British record transfer at the time and didn’t work out, but they recouped a decent wedge of that fee by duping Chelsea into signing him two years later. Van Nistelrooy entirely made up for that misstep and then some.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United (2002/03)\nCristiano Ronaldo (Sporting, £12m), Kleberson (Atletico Paranaense, £6.5m), Eric Djemba Djemba (Nantes, £3.5m), Tim Howard (MetroStars, £2.5m), David Bellion (Sunderland, £2m).",
      "Quite possibly the worst transfer window of any club ever without the 936-goal elephant in the room.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City (2018/19)\nZach Steffen (£7.2m, Columbus Crew), Angelino (£5.3m, PSV), Rodri (£62.8m, Atletico Madrid), Joao Cancelo (£60m, Juventus), Scott Carson (loan, Derby), Pedro Porro (£11m, Girona), Ryotaro Meshino (£900,000, Gama Osaka).",
      "A middling window without the signing of the current best footballer on the planet as they made a tidy profit on Angelino and, before the Guardiola fallout, Cancelo was arguably the best full-back in the Premier League. But Rodri makes it brilliant, particularly given all the doubts as to how they would ever replace Fernandinho.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United (2006/07)\nAnderson (Porto, £27m), Nani (Sporting, £25m), Owen Hargeaves (Bayern Munich, £17m), Carlos Tevez (West Ham, loan), Tomasz Kuszczak (West Brom, £4m).",
      "Not at all surprising that United won the Premier League three times in four years after this window.",
      "",
      "1) Manchester City (2021/22)\nErling Haaland (£51m, Borussia Dortmund), Stefan Ortega (free, Arminia Bielefeld), Kalvin Phillips (£45m, Leeds), Sergio Gomez (£11m, Anderlecht), Manuel Akanji (£16.7m, Borussia Dortmund).",
      "They could have signed a team of Phillips’ and this still would have been one of the best. Haaland and Akanji from Dortmund is surely among the best double transfer window swoops in history."

      "Liverpool will hope Florian Wirtz can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging.",
      "And no, we don’t mean that time they signed Michael Owen.",
      "",
      "10) Erling Haaland\n“We cannot replace him, we cannot,” said Pep Guardiola through tears induced by Sergio Aguero’s farewell match, in which the Argentinean inevitably scored twice from the bench.",
      "The Manchester City manager had lied equally absurdly a month or so before, stating that “because of the economic situation in the world right now, we are not going to sign a striker next season”.",
      "Haaland arrived in a £200m package soon after and is now within five places of Aguero on the club’s all-time top scorer list after just three seasons. Although it somehow remains unclear whether Manchester City are better without a Proper Striker or not.",
      "READ: Liverpool can easily make top five first transfer windows for Premier League champions this century",
      "",
      "9) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nNot even a mess of medicals could prevent Manchester United from eventually pushing through the British record capture of Van Nistelrooy, the player Sir Alex Ferguson believed would help translate domestic dominance into consistency on the European front.",
      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",
      "Yet Van Nistelrooy left with just one Premier League title, an FA Cup and a League Cup, matched with the solitary Golden Boot he managed to snatch away from arch-nemesis Thierry Henry.",
      "",
      "8) Freddie Ljungberg\nArsene Wenger felt compelled to make an exception for Ljungberg, a player he had never seen in person before sanctioning his purchase from Halmstad in 1998.",
      "“I saw Freddie Ljungberg giving a hell of a lot of problems to Martin Keown while watching him on television as he played for Sweden against England. I decided to buy him then,” the legendary Arsenal manager once said of a Euro 2000 qualifier in which Keown categorically did not feature.",
      "Whoever was tormented by a prodigious Ljungberg, it was to Arsenal’s ultimate benefit. The forward became an Invincible, the club’s second-highest Champions League appearance maker, a winner of five trophies and a wearer of lovely pants.",
      "",
      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",
      "An inability to replace his productivity and knack for stepping up in the biggest games has played a significant role in Manchester City’s recent plight. Jeremy Doku wishes he was as good as peak gloves Mahrez.",
      "",
      "6) Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOne Irish newspaper at the time of a transformative summer for Manchester United wrote that ‘along with Karel Poborsky and Jordi Cruyff, Scandinavian duo Ronny Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Sloksjar signed for a combined fee of £2.7 million’ to ‘make up Fergie’s team of flash continentals’.",
      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",
      "",
      "5) Ashley Cole\nBy the time Cole left Chelsea for Roma after winning seven trophies in eight years, the pawn in the controversial move which saw him swap a fading force for one just establishing itself was retiring from the game completely.",
      "Arsenal wanted £25m for their starting left-back at the start of summer 2006; they eventually relented and settled for £5m plus William Gallas.",
      "It was preposterously good business for Chelsea, who had been routinely rinsed in the market as selling clubs formed an ordinarily queue to see their exploitable riches coming a mile off. They certainly benefited from a situation of their own making with Cole, whose bridges back to Arsenal had been summarily torched, but still.",

      "",
      "4) David de Gea\nIt might not be entirely accurate but it does feel as though De Gea single-handedly prevented Manchester United from enduring as catastrophic a season as their most recent on multiple occasions over a 12-year tenure.",
      "He was the original Bruno Fernandes, a tangibly better player than most if not all his teammates yet bizarrely keen to sacrifice the best years of his career to a failing institution. Once that fax machine faltered in 2015 it seemed as though De Gea just accepted his fate as a Manchester United lifer.",
      "The club never was going to show that same loyalty as soon as the Spaniard became dispensable and their handling of his exit was amateurish. But there was a time – after a rough initiation period – when Manchester United almost accidentally possessed the finest keeper in the world.",
      "",
      "3) Rodri\nWith all things being even, it remains the case that a fit, available and peak Rodri guarantees a title win for Manchester City.",
      "The hope is that theory can be properly tested next season, but four Premier League trophies in a row have been sandwiched by a chastening first year spent learning how to foul, and a campaign entirely ruined by a knee injury.",
      "Manchester City collapsed without Rodri in 2024/25 and ongoing negotiations over a substantial pay rise suggest they know precisely how important a role he plays.",
      "",
      "2) Roy Keane\nIt takes a certain type of character to jump from Brian Clough to Alex Ferguson while infuriating Kenny Dalglish in between, but as Keane himself would say, he was just doing his job as the most sought-after midfielder of a generation.",
      "If Blackburn had filed their paperwork properly and Dalglish not taken a sunny July weekend off in 1993, the first Premier League crown under Ferguson might have been marked by no Manchester United incomings whatsoever. But it opened the door to a record-breaking hijack which shaped the club’s future and heralded a glittering and often contemptuous spell.",
      "Keane won a dozen trophies and two Player of the Year awards at Old Trafford, committing to history one of the most iconic individual performances the sport has seen, inspiring the introduction of the prawn sandwich brigade to the game’s lexicon and forlornly challenging the ego of Rio Ferdinand.",
      "",
      "1) Cristiano Ronaldo\nArsene Wenger basically refused to do business with Jorge Mendes again over a perceived betrayal. Liverpool management duo Gerard Houllier and Phil Thompson “almost choked on our food” when the £4m deal they had put in place was obliterated by the announcement of a £12.2m hijack by a bitter rival.",
      "They had finished second and fifth respectively to champions Manchester United, who swooped in late but decisively for the next big thing.",
      "Ronaldo was likely destined for greatness wherever he landed but only a fool could claim his biggest development period would have been better served elsewhere. Ferguson and Old Trafford was the perfect post for the Portuguese to learn; within six stunning years he became the sport’s best and most expensive player.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 08:01, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"

      "Man Utd have confirmed a deal to sign Wolves' Matheus Cunha and are expected to open talks with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo with the player keen to move to Old Trafford; Gary Neville shared his thoughts on players Man Utd should focus on offloading this summer",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 08:02, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered a four-player shortlist of players Manchester United must let go this summer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim's first summer transfer window as United boss is a crucial one as he tries to assemble a squad capable of bouncing back from an all-time Premier League low finish of 15th place.",
      "United also finished the campaign trophyless, having suffered defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, denying the club a return to the Champions League.",
      "However, Neville believes there will be an emphasis on outgoings with an inevitability surrounding some members of the squad. The former United captain believes Marcus Rashford is among the players who must leave this window.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has to leave Manchester United. That ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club,\" said Neville on The Overlap show, It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"I would worry that Villa haven't announced they're keeping him already, because that would be an easy deal to do with United if they were planning on keeping him.",
      "\"It sounds to me that Villa aren't going to keep him and he's going to end up back at United, but I hope for the club and Marcus' sake, it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",
      "\"With Jadon Sancho, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him,\" Neville said.",
      "\"From Jadon's point of view, he has to make sure he parts ways with Manchester United.\"",
      "Neville also namedropped Alejandro Garnacho and Antony as two names who should also be shown the door after both players have recently publicly expressed that their respective futures at Old Trafford are uncertain. Last month, Antony said he is \"smiling and happy\" since joining Real Betis on loan.",
      "On Antony, Neville said: \"His interview was absolutely spot on. I would imagine he was absolutely going under while at United. He's gone to Spain and is absolutely suited down to the ground with Spanish football.",
      "\"Over there, there is a different tactical awareness, technical ability, which is better suited to him. There were players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan; it just didn't quite happen for them, but they had very good careers, by the way. Forlan was sensational in Spain, there are players who aren't suited to a league.",
      "\"Antony is perfect for Spain, and United should facilitate him leaving. Best for United, best for the club.\"",
      "After United's defeat to Spurs, Garnacho spoke to the media after the game to express his discontent at not starting the game. \"We'll see what happens,\" said Garnacho regarding his future after a scathing review of his side's performances.",
      "\"If players are taking on the manager, and if players are questioning the manager in public, through social media, the manager has to win, or the manager has to leave,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before, so I think Garnacho will leave just purely because of that.",
      "\"They've had enough. Garnacho can do it in the Premier League, but I think he'll thrive in Spain, he'll score goals and he'll be someone we'll be looking back at next season and asking: 'Why did Manchester United not keep him?'",
      "\"That type of thing will happen with him, but he'll have to go. That's not me throwing my toys out the pram, saying he has to go, but for the club and for him it's right that he goes.\"",
      "However, Neville took a different view in regards Kobbie Mainoo, with the 20-year-old's future reportedly also in doubt.",
      "\"Mainoo is a step too far,\" Neville said.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield, a top club will want him. Why can't we make him a top player, if he's one of ours and is showing talent? I don't know what's going on there in the last few months, he's had some injuries that have caused him problems, so he needs to stay fit. But I'd like to feel he could be one of the two in midfield that United play.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro or [Manuel] Ugarte, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two. We should be building around Mainoo in that midfield, not because he's come through the ranks. I'm alright for getting rid of players coming through the ranks, but not getting rid of players who come through the ranks and have shown what they can do.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 08:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is reportedly open to the project too.",
      "There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "Nobody at Wolves wanted a long drawn out saga involving the player during the summer. They will receive the full release clause in the terms set out in the contract - in three instalments payable by the summer of 2027. United were initially offering to pay in five instalments.",
      "Wolves expect to be busy this summer to build on the progress made under Vitor Pereira last season. They proved they were not a one-man team with their results and performances when Cunha was suspended.",
      "United have been keeping an eye on Cunha's development since his impressive display for Wolves at Old Trafford in the opening match of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Despite interest from other teams, Cunha wanted to play for United. He thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and was not deterred by them missing out on Champions League football following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United are understood to have been impressed with Cunha's desire to join, whether they had European football or not.",
      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among those who held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "\"Day one of this mini transfer window and Manchester United have confirmed their first signing.",
      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",
      "\"So Manchester United will have to pay a third of that transfer fee now and then the other two will come at the end of the next two seasons.",
      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I'm sure that United will hope that now they've got someone like Cunha coming to the club, it might pave the way for way for other players.",
      "\"United still have that pulling power and the Cunha signing demonstrates that.",
      "\"This summer transfer window is going to be really important for United, particularly because it is Amorim's first summer transfer window.",
      "\"There are so many issues he has to deal with, so many player futures up in the air at the moment.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."

      "Following the news Wolves' Matheus Cunha has completed his move to Manchester United, Adam Bate analyses what the Brazilian forward could bring to Old Trafford, reflecting on conversations with the man himself as well as Cunha's team-mates at Molineux...",
      "Monday 2 June 2025 12:20, UK",
      "Speaking to Matheus Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off-the-cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about April's Manchester derby being \"boring\", and the confirmation of the forward's move to Man Utd, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer stories of the summer window.",

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."
