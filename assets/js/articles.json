      "Bruno Fernandes insists he is happy at Manchester United after snubbing a £300million move to Saudi Arabia after talks with his wife. Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal were prepared to offer the Portugal star a £750,000-a-week deal - in a package worth £200m to the player - to join them ahead of this summer’s Club World Cup.",
      "They were ready to pay over £100m to convince United to sell. But United captain Fernandes informed them he would not make the move after discussing it with his family.",
      "The 30-year-old midfielder is now expected to stay at United where he earns £250,000-a-week. “There was an opportunity,\" said the Portugal international.",
      "\"The [Al-Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there. Manchester United didn’t want to sell me. They don’t need the money.",
      "“There was a waiting period on my part to think about what the future would hold. I would be open to it, if Manchester United felt it was my time. I spoke with Mister Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it.",
      "“I spoke with the club, which wasn’t willing to sell, only if I truly wanted to leave. We never talked about money; that was all handled by my agent, not me.”",
      "Fernandes’ wife, Ana Pinho, was crucial in the decision to stay despite the chance to link up with international team-mates in the Middle East and earn huge money.",
      "“I spoke with my family to understand if that was what I wanted for my future,” Fernandes said ahead of Portugal’s Nations League semi-final against Germany.",
      "“It was actually my wife who asked me — I never said yes or no. She put my professional priorities ahead of everything else. It would have been an easy move. I had Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo there, two people I have a great friendship with.",
      "“But I want to stay at the highest level, play in big competitions, because I still feel capable. I want to keep being happy, I’m still very passionate about this sport, and I’m happy with my decision.”",
      "Fernandes is eager to remain playing at the top level in Europe and will remain part of Ruben Amorim’s rebuild at Old Trafford following a horror campaign which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "Former United captain Gary Neville said: “I don’t think anyone has doubted his commitment to Manchester United. He’s consistent, his chances created, goals, assists have been sensational.",
      "“The fact that he wants to stay, the fact that he wants to go through this and come out the other side, because it would have been easy for him at the end of this season to say, 'Look, I'm done here,' will endear him towards Manchester United fans even more.",
      "\"To turn that money down at a point where Manchester United are at their lowest ebb and say, 'No, I want to fight through this, I want to see it through the other side, I want to come out and achieve things,' I think it says a lot about him as a person, as a character. The club needs people who are going to run through a brick wall for them.\"",

      "Manchester United star Bruno Fernandes has broken his silence on his decision to reject Al-Hilal, insisting he wanted to remain \"at the highest level\" despite receiving an \"ambitious\" proposal from the Saudi outfit. Fernandes looked certain to leave United amid reports Al-Hilal were ready to pay a £300million package - £100m for United and a £200m contract for the Portuguese playmaker.",
      "But after United's club captain opted to reject the move, he has now spoken out to clarify his decision.",
      "\"I will answer and I asked that you not ask me any more about it,' Fernandes said. \"There was that possibility, the president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask me about it. There was a waiting period for me to think about the future.",
      "\"As I have always said, I would be willing to do it if Manchester United thought so. I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, was very annoying to me not to go. The club said they would not be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.\"",
      "Fernandes went on to admit the Al-Hilal offer was \"very ambitious\" and said it would have been an \"easy\" move given his friendship with countryman Joao Cancelo, who is already at the club.",
      "But he said he still feels he can make an impact in Europe by playing in the biggest competitions at the top level.",
      "\"It was a very ambitious proposal,\" he added. \"The president was a fantastic person, we never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent of course. Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career.",
      "\"It was an easy move, even at a family level... I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team. We have a great friendship. But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions. and I feel capable of it.\"",
      "Fernandes' claim that he wants to play at the top level could mean that Fernandes still wants to leave the club for another side in Europe, after the team finished 15th in what was their worst ever season in the Premier League.",
      "The playmaker featured for United in their post-season tour in Asia but boss Ruben Amorim - who has maintained he does not want to lose his skipper - does not think he has played his last game for the club.",
      "\"I don't think so,\" he said. \"I don't know for sure. I think he wants to stay. He is saying no to a lot of things. The club can find other ways to make money. The feeling I get is that he wants to continue for sure with Man United, you never know.\"",
      "United will hope to entice Fernandes to stay by doing their talking in the transfer window. They have already announced the arrival of Wolves star Matheus Cunha and look likely to bring in Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford next.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has revealed that he messaged Bruno Fernandes right away after hearing that he had rejected a move to the Saudi Pro League. The Portuguese midfielder saw his future at Old Trafford thrown into question as Manchester United's post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong came to a close.",
      "Al-Hilal were offering £100million for the 30-year-old club captain, tabling him an outrageous £700k per-week salary over three years. The move may have proven incredibly costly for the United top brass, given Fernandes has been a standout in an otherwise dysfunctional Red Devils team under Ruben Amorim's stewardship.",
      "The Portuguese mastermind will seemingly be elated at being able to keep his talisman for the time being, as it seems Amorim will have the opportunity to build around Fernandes with a full transfer window and pre-season at his disposal.",
      "United hero Ferdinand – who has remained a fan of the club he became a legend at between 2002 and 2014 – was also delighted that Fernandes has made the decision to snub the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia to stay in the north west of England. Speaking on his Rio Presents podcast, the 46-year-old said: \"I've got to be honest, the biggest news for me today.",
      "\"I woke up, I've been fretting the last three days, because I'm seeing Fabrizio [Romano], [David] Ornstein – the lot of them... 'Bruno's going Saudi. They've offered him £200m over four years.'",
      "\"Now listen, I've got to be honest with you. I don't know if I could have said no – 30 years old, at a club that's struggling. He's obviously had the conversation and listened, I definitely would have done that as well.",
      "\"He's staying, you know? Bruno's staying. Our most potent goalscorer, our biggest goal threat, our biggest provider, our biggest chance-maker. He does the lot.",
      "\"And our captain. He's just lost in the Europa League final, has just finished in our worst position that we've ever seen in recent years in the Premier League. In a team that's on its knees confidence-wise at the moment, that needs a big lift in this summer and this recruitment window, and needs the manager to get on his horse and start riding it.",
      "\"And our biggest player, our talisman, our captain has said no to Saudi where many others would have said yes, and I couldn't have woke up this morning happier.\"",
      "Ferdinand, who hinted he had shown his huge appreciation and approval of the decision to Fernandes directly, revealed: \"I did message him. I mean, I won't go into the details of that, but what a man.\"",
      "Not only did Fernandes turn down the opportunity to make a hefty payday in Saudi Arabia, but he also snubbed the chance to link up with Portugal team-mates, Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo. It comes as Amorim has already got the ball rolling in terms of big money arrivals this summer, agreeing a deal for Matheus Cunha from Wolves on Sunday in a £62.5m move.",
      "The Red Devils struggled in terms of a goalscoring presence this season, with Rasmus Hojlund finding the back of the net just four times in 33 appearances, while last summer's marquee signing, Joshua Zirkzee, registered just three Premier League goals.",
      "United are also now looking at adding to their ranks 25-year-old Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals for the Bees in the Premier League this season. It is thought that Old Trafford is his preferred destination this summer, and the Red Devils are expected to open talks with him in the coming days.",
      "The chance to link up with the likes of Cunha and Fernandes appears to be appealing to Mbuemo, despite the club's struggles on the field that saw them fail to qualify for Europe for the first time in over a decade.",
      "Should United manage to fend off any interest from top clubs around Europe for Fernandes before the window slams shut at the end of the summer, they'll believe they stand a better chance of causing more teams trouble in the 2025/26 campaign.",

      "The 27-year-old forward had a falling out with Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim in December of last year, resulting in him being frozen out of the team. He managed to secure a loan move to Aston Villa in January, where he made a positive contribution in the season's final months until a hamstring injury prematurely ended his campaign.",
      "It is understood that Villa have the option to sign the England international permanently for £40million, with his relationship with Amorim thought to be irreparable. However, it remains uncertain whether Unai Emery will risk upsetting Villa’s wage structure to match Rashford's reported weekly wage of £325,000 at United.",
      "According to The Sun, Serie A club Inter Milan have now emerged as a possible destination for Rashford as they aim to bounce back from their Champions League final heartbreak last weekend.",
      "Inter were thrashed 5-0 by Paris Saint-Germain, a defeat that followed their late-season collapse in the race to win the Scudetto. Club chiefs reportedly believe Rashford could be a crucial signing and would excite supporters.",
      "Their view of Rashford was once echoed by current United skipper Fernandes. The Portuguese, merely months after signing for the club in 2020, made it clear both how good Rashford was and how good he could become in the future.",
      "Fernandes was asked to assemble his 'perfect player' and selected Rashford's 'pace', indicating just how highly he rated the forward. That's something which will no doubt be frustrating for United fans to hear, as it is a blow that the player will fail to truly reach his lofty potential at Old Trafford.",
      "He said in an interview with BT Sport at the time: \"I will choose Rashford because I think what Rashford has is pace, amazing pace, but with amazing quality. It's difficult sometimes going at that velocity to have the quality to do the right things, you know. To choose the right time to shoot, to pass, to skill. I will choose Rashy for sure.\"",
      "Fernandes went on to admit: \"He surprised me a lot. Of course I already knew his qualities, because he is one of the best young players in the world for me. I think I will choose Rashy because for me this [pace] is one of the best qualities he has.\"",
      "Rashford, who joined the club as a seven-year-old, showed flashes of world class ability in his 10 seasons in the United first team but far too inconsistently. He only managed to score 20 goals or more across all competitions in three seasons, with those often being followed by mediocre or poor campaigns.",
      "During his loan spell at Villa, he scored four goals and provided six assists in 17 matches, having managed to secure a regular starting spot over Ollie Watkins since the Champions League quarter-final ties against PSG.",
      "Sadly for Villa, a contentious refereeing decision on the season's final day against United resulted in them missing out on a Champions League spot for the upcoming season.",
      "Whether that will influence Rashford's decision on his future club remains to be seen, as it was previously reported that he favoured a move to Barcelona.",

      "Boss Ruben Amorim has no intention of reintegrating the player into his squad as they push ahead for a deal for Bryan Mbeumo after securing Matheus Cunha.",
      "United are looking to sell to raise further funds for their summer rebuild and are banking on getting some money from Sancho. They would hope a Saudi bid could at least match the £25m they were due from Chelsea.",
      "But the £5m penalty fee they have received gives them wiggle room on their budgeting. That could be used to supplement the players’ wages at another club if they don’t strike a deal with a Saudi big hitter.",
      "United don’t want to have to loan Sancho out for the final year of his contract and see him walk away for nothing next summer - although the player is not against that idea as he would have the pick of his clubs next summer.",

Despite Ipswich's relegation to the Championship, Delap made a significant impact in his first full Premier League season, scoring 12 times in 37 league appearances while wearing the number 19 shirt.",

However, the prospect of wearing the same number he wore while making his mark in the Premier League and for England may be too enticing to resist, reports Football London.",

      "It has been an awful season for Man United fans but they could soon light at the end of the tunnel with the news that captain Bruno Fernandes has reportedly rejecting an approach by Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal. The Portuguese international was heavily linked to joining the the Saudi club but has turned down the club despite being offered a huge £700,000 per weekly wage - which is around double what he is earning at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes, 30, has been by far one of United's very few standout players this season after the Red Devil's experienced a tumultuous season which saw their manager sacked, a woeful defence of their FA Cup title and finishing just three places above the relegation zone - their worst ever finish in the Premier League era to date.",
      "Amorim, who joined from Sporting Lisbon in November, admitted he originally wanted to join in the summer to make his impact but was persuaded by the board to move to Old Trafford when the job was made available after Ten Hag's sacking. Since then he has only achieved a 38% win record at United with 16 wins from 42 matches in all competitions last season which included the Europa League final defeat last month.",
      "Securing Champions League football would have propelled United back up to the elite platform in Europe once again but were denied by Tottenham in Bilbao meaning the three-time European champions go into next season with no European football for the first time in 11 years.",
      "United's head coach is tasked to show huge improvements in the first-team squad next season with only Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup the three competitions they will be in for next season but even then, they remain one of the most popular bets placed to be relegated from the top tier of English football for the first time since 1974.",
      "After their Europa League defeat, United's odds were slashed to 16/1 to be relegated but some bookies have reacted to the news of Fernandes staying as a positive one and is now trading best price at 20/1 at the moment with Betfred. Many bookies remain the same at the moment with bet365, William Hill, Sky Bet and Paddy Power all trading at 16/1 for the Red Devils to drop down to the Championship.",

      "Less than 12 months after being offered a career lifeline by Chelsea, Jadon Sancho is almost back to square one. But if the Manchester United outcast is poised for another summer of upheaval, he has, at least, made inroads into restoring his reputation.",
      "After failing to reach an agreement on personal terms with Chelsea, Sancho is once again on the market and available to the highest bidder.",
      "He ends the 2024-25 campaign with 15 goal contributions across all competitions, including a stunning strike in the Blues' recent Europa Conference League final triumph.",
      "While those returns may not have Europe's elite watering at the mouth, they do represent a significant upturn for a player who has looked a shadow of the swashbuckling forward that terrorised defences in Germany just a few years ago.",
      "But the big question is what - or who - comes next for Sancho with the transfer window now open and teams preparing for next season.",
      "Yes, the return has already been done. But with Dortmund said to be in talks with - ironically - Chelsea over a deal to sell Jamie Gittens, could chapter three be on the cards?",
      "Sancho became a superstar in his first spell in black and yellow and Signal Iduna Park provided him with a sanctuary during the second half of the 2023-24 campaign when he was frozen out at Old Trafford.",
      "With United's demands likely to be more reasonable than ever, Dortmund could yet make a play to bring Sancho back for good.",
      "If Sancho is determined to make another go of things in the Premier League then Newcastle could be an option.",
      "The Magpies wanted Bryan Mbeumo to bolster their forward ranks but he has his heart set on a move to Manchester United. Could Sancho be a realistic Plan B?",
      "He would certainly command a far lower transfer fee than some of Newcastle's other transfer targets, such as Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo. Newcastle would be able to offer him Champions League football and the chance to play for one of England's biggest clubs, so from Sancho's point of view, a move would tick a lot of boxes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Mohamed Salah may have said no but maybe - just maybe - Al-Hilal will be third time lucky if they were to target Sancho.",
      "Signing a big-name Premier League player would be just the ticket for the Saudi Pro League after some high-profile snubs. And while Sancho may have failed to come to an agreement with Chelsea over personal terms, there should be no such in issues with a prospective move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Whether he would fancy a move to Saudi at this stage of his career remains to be seen.",
      "Erik ten Hag's arrival at Bayer Leverkusen is all but a guarantee Sancho won't end up there, but could Bayern Munich make a play for the former Dortmund favourite?",
      "It's not like the German champions are afraid of poaching players who have been popular with their rivals. And after conceding to Liverpool in the race for Florian Wirtz, there is seemingly a No.10 vacancy in Munich.",
      "Listen, we all know the score. There's no way back for Sancho at Manchester United, that's been made crystal clear. But at the same time, never say never in football.",
      "Erik ten Hag was the one who froze Sancho out and he's long gone. Would Ruben Amorim fancy him playing in one of the two No.10 roles in his favoured set-up? Maybe, maybe not.",
      "But if United fail to raise adequate funds this summer then their spending power will be massively limited. And if that turns out to be the case then maybe both United and Sancho will have to backtrack. Stranger things have happened.",

      "Bruno Fernandes’ decision to turn down a mega-money move to Al-Hilal could be a reflection of the waning power of the Saudi Pro League. Fernandes has decided to reject the offer of a £100million transfer this summer and a contract worth £700,000 a week in favour of staying with a club who have, frankly, hit rock bottom.",
      "Manchester United finished 15th in the Premier League and won’t play any European football next season after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham. And yet it appears they have managed to hold onto their star player and captain - despite suggestions that some club officials (not head coach Ruben Amorim, it should be said) haven't exactly been beating down his door trying to persuade him to stay.",
      "That should ring alarm bells in Saudi Arabia, where the master plan is built around luring the world’s best players to the country. The Kingdom has now been snubbed by two of the Premier League’s biggest stars, earmarked as being marquee arrivals, in very quick succession.",
      "Mohamed Salah has been targeted by the Saudi Pro League ever since it announced itself on the world stage by splashing the cash to land Cristiano Ronaldo in January 2023. As undeniably one of the world’s best players, and the highest profile Arab Muslim athlete in the world, Salah is considered the golden goose in Saudi.",
      "Yet he too has decided – for now, at least – that he would rather remain in the Premier League with Liverpool than accept a deal worth an estimated £500m. Salah is 32 years old, the kind of age when a lucrative deal in the Middle East might tempt the most, yet he signed a new two-year contract with the Reds in April.",
      "Asked about the decision to snub Saudi Arabia, Salah said at Liverpool’s title-winning parade: \"I thought it was a good opportunity. My contract was up at Liverpool, and I would have gone to Saudi, but we finalised the deal with Liverpool.",
      "\"And I still have a good relationship with them and I always stay in contact with them. Yes, we were talking to each other. I don't know what is going to happen, but I am happy here in Liverpool and I am staying here for the next two years. Then I will see what I will do next.\"",
      "The inference appears to be that Salah will still consider a move to Saudi Arabia, but not until he has made the most of his best years in a more competitive environment. Fernandes is two years younger than Salah and has made a similar call. Although he had reservations about uprooting his family, the biggest reason for Fernandes' decision to stay put was that he didn't want to leave the world's biggest leave for one that, for all its financial backing, remains second rate in the eyes of the vast majority.",
      "For all that the Saudi Pro League has attracted plenty of young talented players from major European leagues, its star player remains 40-year-old Ronaldo. His deal with Al-Nassr expires at the end of June and he has hinted that he could leave by writing on social media: “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”",
      "The Saudi business model is reliant on capturing and retaining stars like Ronaldo, who has undoubtedly been a major factor in others arriving. If the Portugal star packs his bags this summer there won’t be an obvious name to step into the void now Salah and Fernandes have said 'thanks, but no thanks.'",
      "But is that still true? In the same interview, Emenalo dismissed the suggestion that Saudi Arabia could follow in the footsteps of the Chinese Super League as a short-lived gold rush, yet that appears to be an increasingly distinct possibility.",
      "Emenalo also admitted that the kingdom's plan is reliant on star quality: “It shouldn't be a surprise that when you put your plan in place you ask: how do you offer the best quality entertainment to our audience? That included bringing in the best quality players in the world.\"",
      "But other than Ronaldo, which world-leading lights have actually gone to Saudi? How many in their peak are upping sticks? Not many.",
      "Sure there's plenty of talent who have made the move. But the majority have been players who either took deals far beyond what they could expect to earn in the Premier League relevant to their talent level - Ivan Toney, Jhon Duran, Aleksandar Mitrovic - or who have made the move for that final pay day.",
      "“Fortunately, the players have looked at the plan, strategy and ambition and they expressed values of wanting to make this league one of the best in the world,\" said Emenalo. \"They decided to join and we are grateful for that.”",
      "But now players are looking not just at the 'plan', but what has happened in recent years, able to reference the quality of football on display and the struggling attendances and weigh up whether the money alone is enough.",
      "If Saudi Arabia’s billions can no longer buy those players then the whole plan attached to the 2034 World Cup could be at risk."

      "The Cameroon international soared to the top of United's wish-list after a 20-goal season in the Premier League with Brentford. Mbeumo enjoyed his most productive campaign to date, also registering eight assists.",
      "Now the forward is in the final 12 months of his contract, having spent the last six years with the Bees. Although Brentford have the option to extend his deal until 2026, they accept that he can leave and United are confident that a deal will be done.",
      "But Thomas Frank's side won't let him go on the cheap. The Times report that Brentford will demand at least £60m for his services, a club-record fee.",
      "Talks between United and the Brentford hierarchy are set to commence, with Newcastle no longer as big of threat after they deemed him too expensive - but not because of the fee. The Magpies were regularly linked with Mbeumo throughout the season, as Eddie Howe plans to recruit a winger.",
      "The Chronicle explain that Newcastle were willing to negotiate a fee north of £50m with Brentford but Mbuemo's wage demands, coupled with his desire to join United, have left Howe looking at alternative targets. The 25-year-old's representatives had told potential suitors, including Arsenal and Tottenham, that he wanted to more than quadruple his current £45,000-a-week wages.",
      "Those demands are said to have raised eyebrows at St James' Park, as Newcastle cooled their interest alongside the north London duo. The Magpies don't want to break their existing wage structure, despite having additional funds thanks to qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "United, on the other hand, were willing to bend to Mbeumo's wishes, with their efforts to sign him described as frantic. The French-born attacker is expected to earn upwards of £180,000 if he completes a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Brentford aren't standing in his way but they've got their own demands. Frank suggested as much after the Bees' last game of the season. \"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,\" the Brentford manager said.",
      "\"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. \"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\""

Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal have been fervently linked with the player's signature, not to mention they possess the funds to at least tempt United into a sale.",

      "Manchester United can’t lose amid the Bruno Fernandes transfer saga, according to Gary Neville. The Portuguese playmaker’s future has been up in the air since he conceded after the Europa League final defeat to Spurs that he could be offloaded this summer, despite being United's standout player during an abject campaign.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have been pushing to sign Fernandes ahead of the Club World Cup. The playmaker was reportedly seriously considering accepting a £700,000 per week deal. Al-Hilal were also said to be prepared to pay up to £100million for the 30-year-old, cash that could have been ploughed into the much-needed revamp of the squad.",
      "However, according to fresh reports, Fernandes has rejected Al-Hilal’s interest and looks set to remain at Old Trafford, having consulted with his family.",
      "Neville said: “I’m torn on this one because if the £100million fee is right and United get that, I don’t think it’s a bad fee. In fact, I think it’s a great fee for someone at that age. United have had great years out of him. But I also think, if he stays, [he’s saying] ‘No, I want fight this out and turn it around’. I also think that’s a great thing as well.",
      "“So I’m 50-50 in what I think about it. The £100million United need to rebuild the squad. On the other hand, they need players with personality and quality, and they haven’t got that many. In fact, he’s the only one they’ve got. For me, it's a no-lose situation.”",
      "Fernandes captained United as they rounded off their post-season trip to Asia with a 3-1 friendly win against Hong Kong. Asked whether that might have been Fernandes’ last appearance for the club, Amorim said: “I don’t think so.",
      "“I don’t know for sure, nobody knows, but I don’t think so. I think he is seeing us taking some actions to change all the things and I think that is all that he asked. I think he wants to stay.",
      "“He’s saying no to a lot of things, but it shows that he wants to win and I think he’s really young, he’s really good. He needs to be in the best league in the world.\"",
      "A fee of £100m would help fund this summer’s much-needed rebuild as United navigate PSR. Pushed on whether United could turn down such a figure, Amorim said: “Yes, yes. We can find another way to earn money.”"

      "Chelsea will have to pay Manchester United £5million after failing to reach an agreement to make Jadon Sancho’s loan move permanent. Sancho spent the season on loan from United in west London and the Blues had an option to make it permanent for £25m, but talks with the winger have been unsuccessful.",
      "The 25-year-old returned five goals and 10 assists in 42 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea in the 2024/25 season. He helped Enzo Maresca’s side finish fourth in the Premier League and win the Conference League and had been expected to join the club permanently.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear that Sancho is not in his plans for next season and United are desperate to offload their fringe players in the summer transfer window to fund a squad overhaul. Sancho has not enjoyed himself since signing for United from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for £73m and will now have to search for a different exit route.",
      "Chelsea entered talks with Sancho and his representatives following the 4-1 win over Real Betis on Wednesday, in which the winger scored. But negotiations have now been called off, according to The Athletic, with Sancho now set to leave the Blues when his loan deal expires on June 30.",
      "Despite his modest returns on the pitch, Sancho integrated well at Chelsea and Maresca spoke glowingly of his contribution after lifting the Conference League trophy in Poland. But he will now have to search for a new club this summer, with a return to parent club United not suiting either party. The report states that Sancho has options in England and elsewhere in Europe.",
      "He has been linked with a return to Germany, where he starred for Dortmund, with Bayer Leverkusen reportedly interested. Leverkusen will be flush with cash this summer, with Florian Wirtz in talks to follow Jeremie Frimpong to Liverpool, but there is a stumbling block to a move for Sancho.",
      "The German side have appointed Erik ten Hag to replace Xabi Alonso, who joined Real Madrid, and the Dutchman does not have a good relationship with Sancho from their time together at United. It was a falling out with Ten Hag that prompted a loan spell to Dortmund in January 2024.",
      "It appears as though Amorim has taken a similar approach to Sancho, having bluntly dismissed him when asked earlier in the season. “I’m just focused on my players and my problems,” he said. “Sancho is not my problem.”",
      "The £5m fee owed by Chelsea for backing out of the deal for Sancho will come as a timely boost for United. However, it does mean they now need to find a new buyer for the unwanted winger, who has just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for the club over four years – a stark contrast to the 40 goals and 47 assists in 118 appearances for Dortmund.",

      "The former AC Milan star's current terms expire next summer and talks over an extension have already taken place with the club, who have tabled a proposal.",
      "Foot Mercato, via GFFN, however, have revealed that Donnarumma has plenty of admirers among Europe's elite who are ready to pounce if the talented shot-stopper opts against signing a new deal.",

      "City, like their neighbours, are also likely to be in the market for a new goalkeeper this summer with Ederson attracting interest from clubs in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Donnarumma may have suitors elsewhere, but could yet to decide to extend his stay in the French capital, with the ball said to be in his court. That would involve a pay-cut, though, with the report adding that the offer on the table includes a 'lower variable portion' given Donnarumma's contract is the 'last of the old regime'.",

      "As the club's post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong ended, Ruben Amorim laid down the gauntlet to Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy, declaring simply: \"Find another way to earn money\".",
      "The United boss had been asked about Bruno Fernandes' future, as the Old Trafford talisman weighed up a £100million transfer to Saudi side Al-Hilal. For Amorim, despite the huge transfer fee and the fact Fernandes turns 31 later this year, the decision was a simple one for the club: Don't sell. Keep our captain. Build from there.",
      "Amorim's wish has been granted. Not by club chiefs, who, while publicly they'll insist they never wanted to sell, may have felt £100m was a figure they couldn't turn down, particularly given the £100m Champions League revenue lost in the Europa League final defeat to Spurs. But instead by Fernandes, who has decided that leaving the Premier League for the relative backwaters of the Saudi Pro League isn't for him just yet.",
      "That continues a pretty good start to June for the United boss, who saw No.1 transfer target Matheus Cunha complete his switch from Wolves on Sunday. The Brazil international has sealed a £62.5million move and taken a pay bump to £200k-a-week after United triggered his release clause at Molineux.",
      "That will not be the end of United's spending as they look to put their worst-ever Premier League season firmly behind them.",
      "Amorim has made clear his belief that there are players at the club who simply aren't fit for what he wants and has spent six months refusing to budge from his philosophy. He won't change, so the personnel at his disposal needs to. Now the hierarchy are pushing ahead with giving him what he wants.",
      "That means, next up, Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, fresh from a standout season in 2024-25. The South Africa international scored 20 Premier League goals last term and is precisely the kind of reliable finisher that United just don't have.",
      "Newcastle United have been pushing hard to land him, while Liverpool also hold long-standing interest. Crucially, the latter aren't interested in a move this summer, as they push for Florian Wirtz, while Newcastle's hopes of a £60m deal are all but over, after Mbeumo informed them he only wants to move to Old Trafford. Sources close to Newcastle insist he'll be getting paid above their pay scale by choosing not to join their Champions League fight next term, but they weren't interested in breaking their salary structure.",
      "The Fernandes decision means the pressure is on to sell others to pay for more incomings.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, told he has no future at the club, will go. Marcus Rashford and Antony too. The question on the trio is how much United can get for them?",
      "Jadon Sancho may be dumped back in United's lap too, with Chelsea gearing up to spend £5m to NOT turn their loan deal permanent. Amorim will need to decide what to do with a player that fell out with Erik ten Hag.",
      "Christian Eriksen, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof have already departed on free transfers, freeing up space when it comes to salaries, while Tyrell Malacia, who has been on loan at PSV, will be moved on.",
      "Then there is Kobbie Mainoo, the England international who broke through under Ten Hag and was seen as the future, but who Amorin doesn't see as a natural fit in his line up. Chelsea hold a big interest and there will be no shortage of suitors if United intimate he can go. He may just be the biggest sale of the summer.",
      "Then there are the strikers. Rasmus Hojlund looks set to return to Italy, with Champions League finalists Inter Milan pushing to take him to San Siro. Joshua Zirkzee showed fleeting moments of quality and is likely to stay albeit as back up to a new No.9.",
      "United missed out on Liam Delap but Victor Osimhen remains admired and is an option, particularly as Napoli eye Garnacho. But the question is whether the finances, both with Napoli and the player, can be made to work.",
      "The Nigeria international is wanted by clubs in Saudi too, and while he didn't want to go there last summer, a hugely successful year in Turkey could have worked to either embolden his view or changed his mind. Make no mistake, he would be ideal.",
      "And in midfield, with Fernandes due to drop into a deeper role next term for the most part, there is a spot to be filled, where both Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have been used.",
      "The Brazilian is 33, on big money, and while Amorim has been hugely impressed by him, club chiefs would like to get him off the wage bill if possible. As for Ugarte, he's had good moments and some that have been decidedly less stellar as he adapts to life in England.",
      "One player club scouts and bosses have watched extensively and are high on is all-action Atalanta midfielder Ederson. United are among a list of top European clubs to have held talks with the player's agent, Andre Cury, in the past few months and with Gian Piero Gasperini leaving Atalanta for Roma, Ederson too is ready to now leave the 2024 Europa League winners.",
      "At £50million, he could give United the kind of dynamism and physicality that Amorim is desperate to add to his midfield. There's Al Hilal interest too, but a switch to one of Europe's biggest clubs is understood to be at the forefront of the Brazilian's mind.",
      "Four signings, potentially 10 exits and one captain's decision. All in, that'd certainly give Amorim something he can work with next term to ensure he keeps to his post-season vow that \"better days are coming\".",
      "Potential Man United XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Dalot, Ederson, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Osimhen.",

      "The most surprising aspect of Manchester United's early transfer business this summer is that it is coming in the area of the pitch where they are arguably strongest.",
      "If they get a deal over the line to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford following the acquisition of Matheus Cunha to Wolves, it will add more No. 10s to Ruben Amorim's squad. Given the money spent on the proven Premier League performers, they will surely be starters next season.",
      "They join a growing list of options for those positions, which for now includes Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Amad, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. Garnacho's expected departure will create some leeway for transfers, and Mainoo's future is hardly secure just yet.",
      "Mount enjoyed his best spell of football for United towards the end of last season and is an Amorim favourite, but he hasn't done enough to warrant being a first-choice in that position. Fernandes certainly has, and his decision to turn down Al-Hilal's advances should mean another year of consistent performances at Old Trafford, but his future could lie more often in a deeper midfield role. He played that position regularly last season without any real impact on his contribution in the final third.",
      "Cunha is clearly an ideal fit for the position, having excelled there in the same system under Vitor Pereira at Wolves. He brings an understanding of the role and more creativity and goal threat than someone like Mount.",
      "Mbeumo spent last season playing on the wing for Brentford, but could slot in as a No. 10. He has played centrally previously and, like Cunha, would significantly add to the attacking threat in a United squad that has struggled for goals.",
      "The 25-year-old could operate as a striker as well, although he might not be an ideal fit for what Amorim wants from a No. 9. Instead, his close control and dribbling ability could make him a better option between the lines. He also brings balance, something Amorim reflected on in December when he first moved Amad into a No. 10 role, after initially using him as a wing-back.",
      "\"He can be a good player in that position,\" Amorim said. \"We need left-footed players in this team to play that role. In the first half, he was coming for the ball too much. He needed to play near the opposition defence more. He will improve in the future for sure.”",
      "That comment came after United's win against Viktoria Plzen and signalled an almost permanent shift to Amad operating as a No. 10, but the interest in Mbeumo could yet signal a change of plan there.",
      "Given his impact last season, Amad is almost a guaranteed starter in 2025/26, which either means Mbeumo plays centre-forward or Amad drops into right wing-back.",
      "He has proven he can play the role under Amorim, and his dribbling is an asset there. He can come inside to link play and offer an overload centrally or go down the outside on his right foot. That is the type of attacking threat Amorim wants from players in those positions.",
      "This summer is clearly going to be transformative for United. Adding goals and creativity to the team is vital for Amorim, and bringing Mbeumo in as an attacker and shifting Amad to wing-back fulfils that brief.",
      "It will also offer the head coach versatility. Mbeumo could play as a No. 9 and a No. 10, and Amad could play wing-back and No. 10. There are options there, for Amorim has also prioritised players who can operate in a couple of different roles for his system. A move for Mbeumo would deliver just that."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Tuesday, June 3.",

      "United are aiming to complete their transfer business early, having already reached an agreement with Wolves for Matheus Cunha. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim's side continue to be linked with additional attacking options to strengthen their current squad.",
      "Their hunt for a new striker has taken a setback with Liam Delap set to join Chelsea for £30million. The likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli's Victor Osimhen are two prime targets after scoring a combined 91 goals between them this season.",
      "There have even been reports that recruitment director Matt Hargreaves is in Naples attempting to negotiate a deal. Osimhen is expected to push for a swift resolution, especially after his high-profile move collapsed on deadline day last summer.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres has also been linked with United, largely due to his strong relationship with manager Rúben Amorim. However, the Reds appear to face stiff competition, with a growing queue of suitors that now reportedly includes Liverpool.",
      "However, further signings beyond a striker are unlikely to be pursued until funds are generated through player sales. Unfortunately, that could see Bruno Fernandes depart the club, amid continued links to a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Sporting’s Pedro Goncalves has been earmarked as a potential replacement for the Portuguese captain.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",

      "Following Wednesday night's UEFA Conference League final defeat to Chelsea, the La Liga side reportedly cannot meet United's £40million asking price. Antony's hefty weekly wage of £200,000 could also prove problematic, despite the Brazilian's enjoying his time in Seville.",
      "A report in Marca suggests that Betis may consider part-ownership of Antony in an unusual move that would see United retain some interest. Discussions between the clubs are set to take place over the next few days to explore potential agreements.",

At that time he was playing for Juventus in Italy when a failed doping test resulted in a four-year ban from the sport, seemingly ending his career, though this was later reduced to 18 months.",

      "Now, in recent video doing the rounds on TikTok, Gyokeres drops a hint about his next potential club speaking to team-mate Leo Ostigard on FaceTime.",
      "Ostigard said: “Viktor, great talking to you. Text me when everything is signed & sorted at Arsenal…” The Swede then responded: “Yeah, yeah, sure!”",
      "While some on social media have interpreted Gyokeres' words to mean he will let Ostigard know when he joins Arsenal, his response is likely to mean it was great talking to him rather than updating his friend on what comes next for him.",
      "Gyokeres has been strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford since the appointment of former head coach Amorim at M16 in November. The Reds are in dire need of a consistent goal scorer this summer, having only netted 42 times in the Premier League."

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand could not his delight over Bruno Fernandes' decision to reject a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia, admitting that he might not have been able to show the restraint the captain has.",
      "Fernandes, 30, is the focus of transfer interest from Al-Hilal, who want to make the United midfielder a marquee signing in time for the start of the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. A huge financial package was claimed to have been presented in a bid to tempt Fernandes as his agent was spotted in the Gulf state.",
      "\"Listen, I've got to be honest with you, I don't know if I could have said no. He's 30 years old, at a club that struggling,\" Ferdinand admitted, speaking on his YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand Presents",
      "The 46-year-old added that he had been in contact with Fernandes. \"Bruno's staying, our most potent goalscorer, our biggest provider, our biggest chance maker, he does a lot and our captain.",
      "\"Has just lost in the Europa League final, has just finished in our worst position we've seen for years in the Premier League, in a team that needs a big lift in this recruitment window and needs a manager to get on his horse and start riding it.",
      "\"And our biggest player, our captain, our talisman, has said no to Saudi where many other players would have said yes.",
      "\"I couldn't have woken up this morning happier and I did message him. I won't go into the details of that but what a man.\"",
      "United are open to player sales and Fernandes' exit could have fetched a handsome sum - especially from a Saudi buyer - but his decision is a boost for Amorim who knows the Portugal international will have a big role to play as the club look to improve on a terrible domestic campaign.",
      "Fernandes l won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for a fourth time this season, joining David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players who have won it on that many occasions.",
      "With a contract running through to 2027 with an option to extend until 2028, he remains settled in Manchester with his family. It is also the perfect message to new signing Matheus Cunha and other potential arrivals."

      "From the outside looking in the optics around Manchester United paying big money for new signings on the back of a dismal domestic season and no European football to look forward to look, at best, confusing.",
      "Matheus Cunha arrived this past week from Wolverhampton Wanderers in a £62.5million five-year deal. Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo is next on the hit list if reports are to be believed, with the Bees man valued at around £50m.",
      "The noise heading into the summer was that United would have a £100m transfer fund to put to work in the event of no Champions League. The deals for both Cunha and Mbeumo would wipe that out and then some, with £112.5m worth of fees.",
      "The deal for Cunha will be rubber-stamped at the end of this month when the Brazilian returns from international duty, and it will likely kick in from July 1, which is the start of a new financial year for United. The same will likely be the case for any Mbeumo deal, or indeed any other arrivals that the club has planned.",
      "And Dave Powell, chief business of football writer at Reach PLC, has explained how the Reds will look to avoid breaching the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) while still being able to strengthen their squad.",
      "“Manchester United made a pre-tax loss for the 2023/24 financial year of £130.7m,\" he said. \"In the three years up to and including 2023/24 they made combined losses of £313m, well above the £105m threshold when it comes to PSR. However, when taking into account allowable deductions, which include £35m of share sale costs related to the minority stake purchase by Sir Jim Ratcliffe in December 2023, the total comes to £170m, resulting in a net PSR position of minus £103m. That put United £2m under the PSR breach threshold for the 2024 period.",
      "“In the current financial year the club has made some moves to reduce the cost base, including heavy redundancies of more than 250 staff and sending high earners out of the club, such as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony out on loan with their wages covered to a large extent.",
      "“The loss of £150m from 2021/22 will also drop off this cycle, and with the allowance for the share sale cost deductions still accounted for within the current assessment that means that provided United can stem losses beneath that eye-watering £150m figure then they should be compliant as long as they player trade.",
      "“It is player trading that will be key. United will be looking to offload Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Casemiro and potential others, with around £170m in transfer fees likely from such sales, with more than £100m of that profit, with a reduction in amortisation costs to come by the sales of some of those who arrived with big price tags.\"",
      "Powell also explains how spreading the cost of signing players over several years is an effective way for United to pay some of the big fees needed to sign top talent.",
      "“Reports claimed that Wolves had been playing hardball over when they would receive the cash from United for Cunha, and the same will likely occur in any deal with Brentford for Mbeumo,\" he explained. \"But United has strong cash flow and that isn’t major issue, with the guaranteed transfer fees accounted for through amortisation over a maximum of five years. Cunha’s fee would be amortised at £12.5m per year, while Mbeumo’s, if done, would be £10m.",
      "“There won’t be much action after that until the needle moves with regards to player sales, and that will be the main point of focus for United’s recruitment team right now. They know they can afford to add players into the 2025/26 financial year, although with a stripped back budget due to a lack of European football, but they will only be doing more business as and when players leave.",
      "“They won’t be able to be opportunistic in the market place until they give themselves some ammunition in the form of profit-making sales, and the lack of a deal with Chelsea for Sancho will have come as a major disappointment, although the £5m penalty pays for almost have of one year’s amortised cost for Cunha on the books.",
      "“United still have the largest EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) in the Premier League, and revenues are the third highest in England’s top flight. The club also was recently valued as the second most valuable football club in the world by analysts at Football Benchmark. That keeps commercial partners and broadcasters interested, as does the global fan base.",
      "“There will be a hole in the finances from the loss of the £23m in Europa League prize money from 2024/25 and an additional £28m in matchday revenue from the home games played at Old Trafford during the competition.",
      "“But there will be confidence that player trading, like Chelsea have done in recent years, will solve the transfer issues for 2025/26, although it will still be a case of watching the margins when it comes to PSR. They have the assets to sell, though, they just need to find willing buyers.”"

      "Gary Neville reckons Manchester United quartet Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho should all leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "United have been quick off the mark in the transfer market since the window opened on Sunday, having wrapped up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves after activating his £62.5million release clause. The club's confidence is high regarding sealing a deal for Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo, with a bid of around £50m potentially beating interest from top-flight competitors Arsenal, Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "The arrivals of these two attackers are seen as pivotal to Ruben Amorim's ambitions of revamping the attack, which is why Neville foresees the departure of the aforementioned quartet from the club. Rashford, Sancho and Antony spent most of the campaign on loan, while Garnacho was linked with Chelsea and Napoli in January.",
      "However, Neville is adamant that homegrown talent Kobbie Mainoo shouldn't be sold by Manchester United, reports the Mirror. Speaking on the It's Called Soccer podcast, he said: \"On these five I'm pretty certain. Marcus Rashford has to leave for him and the club. I think that ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club.",
      "\"I would worry that Aston Villa haven't announced that they're keeping him already because I think that could have been an easy deal to do with United if they were going to keep him, so it sounds to me like Villa aren't going to keep him. I would say for Marcus' sake and for United's sake that it feels like that path has come to an end.",
      "\"I feel a little bit similarly with him as I do with Marcus. I'd be a bit concerned that Chelsea haven't made the noises that they're going to keep him. Again, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him and, from Jadon's point of view, he has to make sure that he parts ways with Manchester United.\"",
      "Neville feels that Antony's loan spell has been different, labelling Real Betis and La Liga the 'perfect' destination. \"I can imagine he was absolutely going under while he was at Old Trafford,\" he explained.",
      "\"He's gone to Spain and having seen a couple of players that I played with not do it Old Trafford but do it in Spain... I think he's suited down to the ground and it's been proven. Over there, there's a different tactical awareness, there's a different technical ability and there's a way of playing that's just more suited to players.",
      "\"The players I'm referring to are players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan. It just didn't quite happen for them but they had really good careers and I think there are players like that who just aren't suited to a league. I think Antony is perfect for Spain and, again, somebody who Manchester United should facilitate leaving. It's best for Antony and best for the club.\"",
      "Regarding Garnacho, whose future was thrust into the spotlight after being named on the bench for the Europa League final, Neville said: \"I think if players are taking on the manager and if players are questioning the manager in public through social media or through other means, the manager has to win.",
      "\"If the manager doesn't win, the manager has to leave and I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before. I think Garnacho will leave purely because of that, I think they've had enough.",
      "\"Garnacho can play in the Premier League, no doubt, but I think he'll love it in Spain, he'll thrive over there, he'll score goals. He'll probably be someone next season that we're all looking back on thinking, 'Why didn't Manchester United keep him?', that type of thing will probably happen, there's an element of that, but I think he has to go.",
      "\"That's not me throwing my toys out the pram and saying, 'Get him out the club'... no, for him and the club, I think it's right that he goes. Those four players should leave, not just because Manchester United should let them go, but because they should go and find themselves a place in their lives where they can go and play football because it's not at Old Trafford.\"",
      "But the idea of letting go of Mainoo - who has been with United since he was just six years old - seems too much for Neville, even after Amorim left him on the bench for last month’s 1-0 loss against Tottenham in Bilbao. \"Mainoo, no. That's a step too far,\" insisted Neville.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield... I look at Mainoo and the way he plays football and I think a top club would want him. Why can't we make him a top player? If he's one of ours and he's shown talent.",
      "\"I don't know what's gone on there in the last few months. He's obviously had some injuries which has caused him a problem so he needs to stay fit, but I'd like to think he could be one of that two in midfield that Ruben Amorim plays.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro as his partner and it's probably not [Manuel] Ugarte as his partner, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two, if I'm being honest. But we should be building around Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield and not because he's come through the ranks.\""

      "However, their regression over the past 12 years has meant that luxury has somewhat subsided. Much of their recruitment has been of a scattergun approach and their hit record in the transfer market has been low.",
      "Nevertheless, United made it their mission to make a statement on day one of this summer's transfer window, getting a deal over the line for Wolves ace Matheus Cunha on Sunday.",
      "Subject to a visa and registration being granted, he will join the club on a five-year deal, featuring the option of an additional year, after United triggered his £62.5million release clause. The fee will be paid in instalments.",
      "United identified Cunha as one of their top targets several months ago, meaning to have secured his signature less than 24 hours after the transfer window had opened must have been of great comfort to head coach Ruben Amorim, who will be keen to make fast progress this summer.",
      "Cunha is a specialist No.10, meaning he is tailor-made for the role Amorim wants him to fill at Old Trafford. The general expectation is that he will occupy the left-sided No.10 position in Amorim's first-choice XI.",
      "The Brazilian has joined United on the back of a highly successful season at Wolves that saw him score 17 goals and register six assists in 36 appearances across all competitions. Of his 17 goals, 15 were plundered in the Premier League.",
      "Taking his tally from 2023/24 into account, Cunha, 26, will arrive at Old Trafford having scored 27 goals in his last two Premier League campaigns, meaning he possesses a proven record in the division.",
      "In each of the last two summer transfer windows, United turned to Italy to strengthen their attacking options, signing Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta in August 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna in July 2024. Both players were recruited based on their potential.",
      "United signed five players from overseas last summer, with Zirkzee their only attacking signing. Just as they had needed to 12 months earlier, they needed to recruit an attacker with Premier League experience to beef up their attacking pool and they failed to do so.",
      "With the exception of Ayden Heaven arriving from Arsenal in February, Mason Mount being drafted in from Chelsea in July 2023 and Christian Eriksen being signed following a short-term stint at Brentford in July 2022, domestic signings on a permanent basis have not been as frequent as they once were in recent years, particularly in an attacking sense.",
      "Having signed Mount to play in the centre of midfield in a 4-3-3 formation, United, prior to confirming Cunha's arrival, had not signed an attacking player from a Premier League counterpart on a permanent deal since recruiting Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal in January 2018.",
      "Sanchez was one of two statement signings added to United's pool of forwards that season, with Romelu Lukaku arriving from Everton six months earlier.",
      "Sanchez had scored eight goals in the first half of the 2017/18 campaign for Arsenal, fresh from scoring 30 goals the previous season, and Lukaku arrived in M16 ahead of the 2017/18 season on the back of a 26-goal season for Everton.",
      "Although neither player managed to forge long careers for themselves at Old Trafford, with many suggesting they were the right players signed at the wrong time, they were signings of the right profile, with United hoping they would come in and hit the ground running.",
      "Lukaku scored 27 goals in his debut season at United, including 16 in 34 Premier League games. He made the immediate impact United need a new striker signing to make next season.",
      "Of course, there is absolutely no guarantee the signing of Cunha will work out in the way United hope it will. The same can be said of every managerial appointment every club makes. The one guarantee football can offer is that nothing is guaranteed.",
      "Nevertheless, the fact United have recruited a ready-made Premier League operator to bolster their attack is a step in the right direction. They frequently raided their Premier League counterparts for their best attackers during Sir Alex Ferguson's heyday, signing the likes of Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Dimitar Berbatov, Robin van Persie, who all made their mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Non-attacking signings plucked from Premier League counterparts included the likes of Edwin van der Sar Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick. That approach, albeit in a different era, rarely let United down."

      "The deal ticked almost every box and it was announced on Sunday, the opening day of the summer window. Cunha will officially seal his transfer when he returns from international duty and his visa is approved, but United will be relieved to get him through the door at the earliest possible opportunity.",
      "The reality is that most negotiations for transfers aren't as straightforward because a club could be reluctant to sell, a player might need to be persuaded, or personal demands could be an issue.",
      "There are plenty of moving parts. United walked away from signing Moises Caicedo before he signed for Brighton due to his agent's demands, for example.",
      "Now Cunha has been wrapped up, United will turn their attention to other targets and it's almost guaranteed their next signing will be more complicated than the first.",
      "Talks to sign Cunha from Wolves were plain sailing. Signing a striker won't be as simple.",
      "Liam Delap has already decided to join Chelsea, who will activate his £30m relegation clause, and United will now move on to other targets after missing out on the 22-year-old.",
      "Victor Omsihen ticks most boxes, just like Cunha did, although his wage demands caused his proposed transfer to Chelsea to collapse last summer and the indication is they could be a problem again.",
      "Ineos have lowered the United wage bill since gaining control of football operations and won't pay a huge salary to Osimhen. However, he might be a player worth compromising on.",
      "The new wage structure won't be completely ripped up to accommodate Osimhen, but United need a proven goalscorer and striker is arguably the most important position on the pitch. Ruben Amorim needs goals and Ineos chiefs must decide what price they are willing to pay to deliver them.",
      "United's identification of Delap as their prime target suggests they are taking a different approach. He is young with considerable upside and would have been attainable for a value fee.",
      "Osimhen feels like a signing that the previous decision-makers at Old Trafford would have approved, but the importance of signing a proven goalscorer cannot be understated.",

      "Osimhen and Gyökeres would be great additions, albeit challenging for United to get over the line for different reasons (Osimhen's wage demands and rival interest in Gyökeres).",
      "Furthermore, the elephant in the room is that United are not particularly attractive for new signings. They have just endured the worst campaign in the club's modern history, finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to qualify for European football, so there is not a huge amount of appeal.",
      "Napoli want to sell Osimhen because he's not in Antonio Conte's plans, but Gyökeres has just won the league with Sporting and they will compete in the Champions League again next season.",
      "Gyökeres may feel it's better for him to stick than twist. Are United the right club for his next move?",

      "Manchester United made the perfect start to the summer transfer window on Sunday, announcing the arrival of Wolves star Matheus Cunha on a long-term contract.",
      "Subject to a visa and registration being granted, the Brazilian has joined United on a five-year deal after the club agreed to pay his £62.5million release clause. He also has the option of an additional year.",
      "United had been tracking the former Atletico Madrid man for some time after identifying him as one of their top targets to strengthen the squad ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Cunha scored 17 goals across all competitions for Wolves this season, including 15 in the Premier League, and will sharpen a blunt United attack. The Reds have ended each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "However, to ensure they give themselves the best possible chance of increasing their attacking output next term, United want to add to the addition of Cunha by signing a striker.",
      "Like the Brazilian, United had long since identified Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap as a priority target, but he is now on the brink of finalising a move to Chelsea. Delap held talks with a handful of clubs and chose a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "It means United's search for a new goal-getter will head in an alternative direction, although it remains unclear who they plan to try and recruit instead. Napoli ace Victor Osimhen and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres are both continuing to be linked with moves to M16.",
      "United, at this juncture, need an experienced and proven striker that come in and hit the ground running. As tempting and as understandable a move for Delap, who was available via a £30m release clause, was, swooping for him would have signified a huge gamble after just one season as a regular Premier League starter.",
      "United gambled on potential in both 2023 and 2024, signing Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee respectively, but neither of them have done enough to justify leading United's attack, hence why the club is once again on the hunt for a striker.",
      "As well as bolstering their attack, United are also understood to be in the market for a new midfielder. Christian Eriksen will leave the club at the end of this month when his contract expires and neither Kobbie Mainoo or Casemiro are assured of a future at Old Trafford beyond the end of this summer.",
      "Casemiro is approaching the final year of his contract and Mainoo did not play as regularly as he would have liked this season. The club is also yet to reach an agreement with him over a new contract.",
      "The addition of a new right wing-back at Old Trafford cannot be dismissed this summer, either. Prior to it being confirmed in March that Geovany Quenda will join Chelsea next summer, United had expressed interest in the Sporting Lisbon youngster.",
      "The addition of a wing-back, at this juncture, is unlikely to rank as a top priority amid the overriding importance of strengthening the attack. Furthermore, United's intentions for the remainder of the summer are likely to rest on outgoings and raising funds via player sales."

      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Fernandes was one of the only standout performers in the United side last season. He was the top scorer in the Premier League, where the Red Devils finished 15th, and in all competitions, he was directly involved in 38 goals.",
      "He recently reiterated his commitment to United, but that was put to the test by interest from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, who were willing to pay him a big sum of money to join.",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed on June 3 that Fernandes had decided against the move, as he wanted to continue playing at the top level in Europe.",
      "Now, Fernandes has revealed manager Amorim had a big say in his decision.",
      "“There was an opportunity. The [Al Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there,” Fernandes said.",
      "“They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach Amorim. He asked me not to go.",
      "“Manchester United didn’t want to sell me. They don’t need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.",
      "“Al Hilal were very kind. They spoke to my agent. Then I spoke to my wife. She asked: ‘What do you want to do?’ She always supports my decisions.",
      "“It would have been easy to move there. I know the Portuguese players there very well. But I want to play at the highest level and compete for major titles.",
      "“I can do that, and I still want to. I’m very passionate about football.”",
      "Amorim was adamant about Fernandes’ position at United in March, when there was a suggestion that Real Madrid could look to sign him.",
      "He said: “No, it’s not going to happen. He’s not going anywhere because I’ve already told him.”",
      "Indeed, it looks as though Amorim has got his way, with the huge riches at Al Hilal failing. Whether a big European side approaching for Fernandes would have an impact is a different story, but Amorim would clearly be against that.",
      "The midfielder was clearly happy to listen to his boss on this occasion, so United will hope any other approaches are met with the same mindset.",
      "Football pundit Martin Keown has questioned the viability of head coach Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and come up with an absolutely bananas suggestion for a replacement.",
      "Mikael Silvestre has given his verdict on what needs to happen next with Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has decided to ‘reject’ Al-Hilal and stay at Old Trafford ahead of next season, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes may leave Manchester United but it will not be because he attended a birthday dinner with his friend…",

      "United are showing positive signs of being able to turn around an awful season in which they finished 15th in the Premier League this term. Though they lost to ASEAN All-Stars in their first post-season tour match, things are heading in the right direction elsewhere.",
      "They have already confirmed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves – the attacker was directly involved in 21 top-flight goals last term.",

      "It’s been stated the Bees could ask for a ‘higher fee’ from United, and what sort of fee that is has now been revealed.",
      "Indeed, The i Paper reports the London club wants to earn ‘in excess’ of £55million, and they have a basis for asking for north of that fee.",
      "It is felt that Mbeumo is a ‘more proven’ Premier League player than Cunha, so a similar fee to what was paid for him – £62.5million – is seen as ‘realistic’.",
      "Cunha has been directly involved in 42 goals in 82 Premier League games, while Mbeumo’s tally currently stands at 72 goals and assists in 136 games.",
      "At the moment, the report states no contact has been made between United and Brentford, which is in line with other outlets.",

      "Keane is the most decorated captain in United’s history, taking the armband in a golden era for the club. Harry Maguire was United captain not long ago, before the role was given to Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The attacking midfielder has led from the front with his performances – 19 goals and 19 assists this season – but there’s been speculation over him leaving the club, after which there may not be an obvious choice to take over from him.",

      "Ex-Arsenal defender Keown understandably isn’t convinced. Former Sporting CP boss Amorim hasn’t had a pre-season or a summer transfer window yet but United’s results do have to speak for themselves to some degree and finishing in the bottom six of the Premier League isn’t going to be anywhere near good enough next season.",
      "“I’m still concerned that maybe this isn’t the right manager for Manchester United,” Keown told talkSPORT. “Just look at the number of games they’ve lost.”",
      "The three-time Premier League champion has a point. United lost 18 times in the league in 2024-25, not to mention getting knocked out of two competitions by Tottenham Hotspur, who somehow conspired to finish below them in the table but qualified for the Champions League by seeing off Amorim’s men in the Europa League final.",
      "“It’s going to be a very interesting start to next season for them but they could do a lot worse than go and get Jurgen Klopp to manage their football club,” said 58-year-old former England international Keown.",
      "“I’m not trying to sensationalise. I believe he could do an incredible job there and I believe they need somebody with more experience than the current manager.",

      "The German was so attuned to the culture of the club and the city that some Liverpool supporters expressed their dismay that he took up a global strategy role with the Red Bull multi-ownership group at the start of this year.",
      "He’s been linked with a return to coaching with Real Madrid, Brazil and Germany since starting his new job in January and rumours have rumbled on that Klopp isn’t entirely thrilled with his role with the energy drinks giant. Yet he remains in-post, as yet untempted by some of the most attractive managerial jobs in world football.",
      "Ratcliffe would surely love to find a way to bring the former Borussia Dortmund boss in to replace Amorim but if Klopp is to be dragged back into the dugout, a hiding to nothing that comes with the added bonus of upsetting every Liverpool fan on earth probably isn’t the job that’ll do it.",

But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",

      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",

      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",

      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",

      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",

      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Noni Madueke and Robert Sanchez are on a list of 14 players put up for sale by Chelsea this summer, and Cole Palmer has been tipped for a shock exit.",
      "Cole Palmer has spoken of his excitement to play in Chelsea’s Europa Conference League final amid heading praise on Enzo Maresca.",
      "It’s the final weekend of the season and that means permutations time as the European places are settled while Liverpool host a giant party.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",

      "Fulham do like to use their regular Premier League promotions, or in the case of Mitroglou imminent relegations, to open new transfer doors. Though last summer they waited for the cash to arrive for Joao Palhinha before splashing out on Smith Rowe. The jury is out on whether he was worth the outlay.",

      "It took 20 months for Leeds to break their transfer record thrice from July 1999. It took 20 years for Leeds to break their transfer record once from November 2000. They took a chance on Rutter in 2023 that did not save them from relegation but did at least make a small profit when he became Brighton’s record signing.",

      "It is probably safe to suggest that Darwin Nunez has not activated enough add-ons to become Liverpool’s record signing just yet. That initial £64m fee paid to Benfica can rise as high as £85m, but not any time soon. That Van Dijk figure is likely to be blown out of the window by the £100m it will likely take to sign Florian Wirtz.",

      "It’s high time for an update of the all-important F365 Premier League Mood Rankings, the deeply scientific and highly rigorous ordering of the 20 top-flight clubs based entirely on feels and vibes.",
      "Fun fact: Google’s AI overview once claimed this utter nonsense was compiled by a supercomputer, when it is in fact the work of a prick.",
      "Anyway, we were right about one thing last time: Spurs could only end the season in first or last. We’ll be honest, though, we are a bit surprised about which one it’s turned out to be. The good news is that Spurs are still Spurs, and thus are about to split their fanbase into two warring, furious tribes based on whether they make the absurd, unthinkable decision to keep Ange Postecoglou or the absurd, unthinkable decision to sack him.",
      "Either way, we’re extremely confident they’ll be 16th by August and 20th by October. Possibly in the actual league too.",
      "",
      "20) West Ham (10)\nA slight late rally – built entirely on taking handfuls of points off entirely distracted Europa League finalists and relegated flotsam – has done little to lift the general mood of despair around the London Stadium, but if you squint hard enough it’s possible to imagine brighter times ahead.",
      "Graham Potter strikes us as a ‘needs a full pre-season’ kind of a manager. He’s the sort of manager they should have chosen in the first place when trying to draw a line under the David Moyes Era, rather than just getting someone who was very like David Moyes only more foreign and more emotional.",
      "Julen Lopetegui never looked like working out and West Ham p*ssed a season away because of it, and that was a shame because they did do some eye-catching transfer work last summer. It is still possible that it wasn’t a complete waste of time and we are not yet sure it’s right to rush to judgement on Potter. It’s still possible Brighton Potter is in there somewhere.",
      "But for now, it’s all guesswork and speculation after a miserable season that was supposed to signal the start of a new era. And there’s no point pretending that Tottenham winning a trophy isn’t a very annoying crowning turd in the Hammers’ overflowing bowl.",
      "",
      "19) Manchester City (17)\nNot winning the league is one thing, but not winning anything? That’s a problem. Dig deeper and it’s even worse, because they didn’t even really compete for anything other than the FA Cup.",
      "They were never in a title race, they stunk the Champions League out and lost to Spurs – what is it with City and Spurs? – in the early rounds of the Carabao. Only in the FA Cup did they even halfway resemble their old selves, staying upright as the other big beasts tumbled all around them, only to then lose to an inspired Crystal Palace in the final.",
      "Undoubtedly their worst and most difficult season since Pep Guardiola turned them into a trophy-gobbling machine, and the problem for City now is that doubt exists where no doubt existed before.",
      "Maybe they come back next season and win the league again. Maybe. But there’s no certainty anymore. You can’t even say with great conviction they’ll be in the title race.",
      "That itself is a wild situation to be in when you’re talking about a team that had won six of the last seven league titles before this season.",
      "They really were worse in just every way as well this year. Their fewest wins since 2015/16, most defeats, and fewest goals scored. The 44 goals they conceded was their worst since 2009/10 and the world was a very different place for City back then, right at the start of their journey to world domination.",
      "The team that won the lot is breaking up. Kyle Walker is gone, Kevin De Bruyne is gone. There are huge doubts over whether Guardiola himself has the drive or inclination or will to push through with the regeneration and build another great side. And if he doesn’t, what then?",
      "It’s all doubt and guesswork where previously there existed absolute certainty. And they’ve got to play in the Club World Cup.",
      "‘Oh no we didn’t win any trophies and only finished third and have to play in a Club World Cup’ are among the more first-world footballing problems imaginable, sure, but these things are all relative and this is a situation that City simply haven’t faced for several years now.",
      "",
      "18) Manchester United (15)\nAn absolute basket-case of a club who’ve just suffered the twin indignities of finishing an unthinkable 15th in the Premier League and losing an actual cup final to actual Spurs, but there’s no denying that their early summer transfer business is at the eye-catching end with Prem-proven arrivals confirmed (Cunha) and imminent (Mbeumo) from the sort of teams that have, uncomfortably, now become United’s direct rivals.",
      "Those are important moves not because they are good players who dramatically and necessarily improve United – although they are that – but because they serve as proof that for the time being at least this remains Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "United – or at the very least United wages – still have a pull that transcends their current status. And that offers meaningful hope that this absurd beast of a football club can still be brought to heel despite itself.",
      "The clock is ticking, though. We’re not entirely sure just how long United will remain a name that resonates so with players, but we do know that time is finite.",
      "We’ve already seen the United Will Get The Job Done In A Final myth utterly busted in Bilbao, but there’s no denying this swift summer foray into the transfer market is providing some repair to a deeply damaged brand.",
      "",
      "17) Arsenal (9)\nMust reluctantly accept the mantle of Banter Club and also acknowledge that they have largely brought it upon themselves.",
      "Finishing second again need not be disastrous, but there was definite regression and losing out to Liverpool rather than Man City makes life far harder for that particular breed of fan who refers to the club as ‘The Arsenal’ and believes they represent some bastion of class and heritage and history rather than just being another very rich football club that spends lots of money.",
      "The big problem for Arsenal is that they didn’t win anything. Again. The bigger problem is that somehow – ludicrous and ridiculous a freaky fluke as it may be – Spurs did. And that has shifted the dynamic of the north London scene, for now at least.",
      "It’s not fair, it’s not big and it’s certainly not clever but Arsenal have no choice but to swallow at least a year of ‘Worra trophy’ every time they start mouthing off about beating PSG on xG and such. They really are just going to have to take it, and while we are always reluctant to judge any fanbase by its most conspicuous online gobshites, it would massively help if they stop being very sniffy indeed about Spurs winning a competition – for a third time no less – that Arsenal themselves have never managed to win.",
      "The whole ‘who’s had a better season?’ debate is facetious and largely in bad faith. There’s a very coherent argument to make that neither Spurs nor Arsenal should want to swap with the other. After 17 years, a trophy moved the needle for Spurs in a way that no amount of process-trusting second-place finishes ever could, while there remains still the sense that Arsenal are building towards something big in a way that Spurs shithousing a European pot in their worst domestic season for over 40 years absolutely does not.",
      "But until and unless Arsenal arrive at their destination – and there are never any guarantees you’ll get there until you do – then they live in Banter Town. Only one road out of there, lads.",
      "READ: Man Utd, Man City and Arsenal fell so far short of every single target",
      "",
      "16) Brentford (12)\nDid some madly entertaining things this season, with the whole ‘winning all our home games but losing all our away games and then switching that around for no real reason’ bit one of our very favourites from this season.",
      "The run of home games late last year that produced five straight wins by scores of 5-3, 4-3, 3-2, 4-1 and 4-2 was sensational, as really was the fact that 4-2 win (over Newcastle no less) was in fact Brentford’s last home win for four months.",
      "All those lads from about eighth to 12th were good value this season, and the only real criticism of Brentford is that they so rigidly confined their sense of fun to league matters when they looked every inch the sort of side that could and should have put together some kind of run at at least one of the cups. Especially the way this season panned out for rogue winners of cups.",
      "Overall, though, an excellent season with good vibes. But while Brentford’s business model is one that doesn’t just cope with the loss of key assets but positively thrives on it, the idea of losing both Bryan Mbeumo and Thomas Frank in one summer would appear to be something that might stretch that beyond its elastic limit. The very real possibility of this coming to pass has to harsh the buzz a bit.",
      "",
      "15) Burnley (-)\nPerhaps the most interesting of the promoted teams. Think we all kind of know what to expect, to some degree, from the other two. Leeds should give it a proper go as one of few teams outside the now Settled Seventeen with the requisite heft to muscle their way into the closed shop. Sunderland should go down and suffer frequent heavy punishment for their Icarus-like ‘promoted a season too early’ folly.",
      "But what of Burnley? They are so different to the last Burnley team to come up, who did it playing glorious football that simply didn’t survive contact with the rarefied Barclays air. Now, though, they are a team led by Scott Parker, a man so haunted by a 9-0 humiliation at Liverpool when in charge of Bournemouth that he has simply vowed to never concede another goal ever again, even if that means – and last season it very often did – not scoring any either.",
      "Now the last couple of years have been filled with chat about the hubris of promoted teams, about their failure to be sufficiently humble to take their medicine and accept that what got them here can’t keep them here. That the way teams like Brentford or Brighton adapted to survive the transition to the far, far higher level is apparently now too much to ask of teams like Southampton, and especially Vincent Kompany’s Burnley.",
      "But what about this Burnley? They’ve sufferballed their way in, so could they now sufferball their way to 15th? It does feel more likely than trying to Temu Man City their way there like Kompany or Russell Martin.",
      "Yet at the same time it does also feel like they might just end up like Homer Simpson when he gets in the ring with Drederick Tatum. Premier League teams might not get tired. That cactus is right!",
      "",
      "14) Sunderland (-)\nAnother thrilling Championship play-off final, another big club with a proud history getting itself foolishly promoted when it is visibly and palpably unready.",
      "But those are concerns for far later in the summer. Let us not sully their celebratory moment with talk of it being another great chance for Derby to get their names out of the record books at long last.",
      "That kind of chat is for August, or perhaps late July. For now, the best advice for Sunderland would appear to be go Full Forest and sign a bunch of players and worry about the rules later. The alternative paths for a team that finished 24 points behind the other promoted teams are simply too ghastly to think about for long.",
      "",
      "13) Fulham (11)\nWe love Fulham. They have carved out a niche as the Premier League’s most reliable ‘can beat anybody, can lose to anybody’ team and it’s a tremendous way to go about 50-odd point-securing mid-table comfort.",
      "They are a team that often manages to get themselves on the edge of European talk around February or March only to be nowhere near it by May without anyone really noticing or complaining about how they fell off. Seems a nice way to live.",
      "Even the way this season ended was perfectly on brand, their European hopes fading away in accordance with the prophecy as they lost six of their last nine league games after a heavy FA Cup defeat to Palace.",
      "Obviously one of the nine games they didn’t lose was a 3-2 win over the champions – and this was at the start of April, weeks before Liverpool had officially wrapped up the title and gone full beach/flip-flop/cigars.",
      "Fulham this season managed to lose to Wolves, West Ham, Everton, and Manchester United, draw with Tottenham, Southampton and Ipswich (twice) and beat Newcastle (twice), Nottingham Forest (twice), Chelsea and Liverpool.",
      "Never change, lads. Never change.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth (8)\nUltimately finished second in the tremendously fun eighth-twelfth mini-league of enormously entertaining mid-table teams as Brighton pulled clear in the closing weeks to claim first place. Well, eighth place. But you know what we mean.",
      "Bournemouth, though, remain our favourite of this gaggle of teams that also contains Brentford, Fulham and Palace. There’s something similar going on at all these clubs, who have become the Premier League’s affluent and aspirational middle-class over the last couple of years as the league’s wealth has grown and their own status within it solidified.",
      "All of them are doing fine work in the crucial field of making mid-table life fun by being capable of going on wild runs of startling form at both ends of the spectrum, but Bournemouth are the ones for us who most conspicuously pass the eye test.",
      "There are two versions of this Bournemouth team under Andoni Iraola. The one that goes on 11-match unbeaten runs that includes smashing top-seven teams to absolute pieces in back-to-back games, and the team that wins one match in nine trying to remember what they were doing in the first bit.",
      "Bournemouth’s best football this season has been alarmingly close to the best football played by anyone this season, and that’s a wonderful thing. We’re not sure Iraola and this team will ever crack the code entirely and be able to turn those spells of seemingly effortless flow-state brilliance into an entire season but imagine if they did. Wouldn’t that be something, eh?",
      "",
      "11) Everton (7)\nNot as giddy now as in those early days of David Moyes’ return, but still far happier with their on-field lot than could possibly have been predicted halfway through the season.",
      "What makes Everton so hard to place now is how to weigh up the emotional wrench of leaving Goodison Park after over a century of memories and history versus the excitement of moving into their new ground and all the potential that brings.",
      "So what we’re going to do at this point is simply avoid that kind of complicated brain-melter altogether and simply put them right there in the middle. And there’s nothing you can do about it.",
      "",
      "10) Brighton\nFinished the season like an absolute train to finish one place and in the end just four points behind a stumbling Nottingham Forest. Always bittersweet when you end a season like that.",
      "Sure, it’s never a bad thing to end on a high note and approach the summer with confidence for the next but at the same time Brighton ended the campaign sufficiently clear of their fellow entertaining mid-table chums (your Bournemouths, your Brentfords, the Fulhams of this world) and sufficiently close to the European spots that you can’t help but look wistfully at things like drawing six (and losing the other two) in an eight-game run around Christmas last year or even April’s failure to secure more than a single point from three games against Palace, Leicester and Brentford.",
      "Overall, though, eighth place in the Premier League and genuine reason to believe Fabian Hurzeler’s second season can be even better than his first with that vital year’s worth of experience means the vibes on the south coast are very good indeed.",
      "",
      "9) Nottingham Forest (2)\nAh, the cruelty of shifting expectations. Let’s be real here, it’s still been an extraordinary season for Forest, who went from relegation battlers last season to spending much of this campaign on the fringes of the title race before falling away on the finishing straight to end ‘only’ seventh.",
      "It’s just human nature that doing it that way doesn’t feel quite as good as surging up to pinch seventh and a European spot after spending most of the season in 12th.",
      "But while there will be some fans for whom only being in the Europa Conference represents the sky falling in, the vast majority of fans will, we suspect, see the bigger picture here. Not least the fact they now find themselves in a competition that offers a huge chance of adding a new chapter to a storied European history at the City Ground.",
      "",
      "8) Wolves (13)\nWere briefly and giddily the best team in the land for a while there, winning six straight games between mid-March and the end of April, at which point a far loftier mood position appeared on the cards with Vitor Pereira getting an absolute tune out of what turned out to be a far more talented squad than Gary O’Neil had made us all think,",
      "But one point from their last four games is a familiar damp squib of a season end for a team that has history for allowing the way one season ends to bleed into how the next begins.",
      "Another slow start and more managerial uncertainty in the early months of next season really would be annoying when it looked like they really might hit the summer with proper momentum.",
      "Losing Matheus Cunha is no shock to anyone, but a massive blow nonetheless. Especially with him making such a sideways move to Man United.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa (5)\nSimmering resentment over the manner of missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day should ultimately give way to acknowledgement that sixth probably represents a fair enough reflection of their overall league season and is a decent enough effort when combined with a fine run on their return to European football’s top table.",
      "They have got their feet back under the table now as a big deal in the Premier League and there is an obvious silver lining for any good Premier League team that finds itself narrowly missing out on the Champions League and finding itself instead in the Europa: that is now an enormously winnable trophy, and one that needn’t be a massive drain on the first half of your season given the fact even Spurs and United were largely able to coast into cosy top-eight finishes.",
      "A quick glance at the current confirmed qualifiers suggests precious little to fear for a team coming off an impressive Champions League run, let’s put it that way.",
      "We understand why, obviously, clubs want to be in the Champions League for the money and the prestige and did we mention money, but if you’re a fan of a club like Aston Villa then the idea of a proper run at winning the Europa has to appeal.",
      "",
      "6) Chelsea (14)\nCompleting the new full set of European trophies and becoming the first team to do so is a neat result for completionists everywhere.",
      "Being the first to do something is always a buzz because while others can eventually match the achievement, nobody else can ever be first. And probably nobody will match it for ages anyway; who knows how long it might be before Man United can lift themselves back to the level of qualifying for the Conference League to have a crack themselves?",
      "If winning the third-tier European comp was a bit of a penalty kick and in fact the only way to avoid embarrassment in that competition, getting themselves back in the top four after some difficult Premier League campaigns was something with a bit more bite, even if the title challenge promised in the early months of the season faded away to nothing in the end.",
      "We are still in the realm of bare-minimum achievement for a club that has spent such hilarious amounts on compiling their squad, but it’s also a bare minimum that has not been met for a while now.",
      "We remain powerfully unconvinced by Enzo Maresca, but it’s hard to view the season just gone as anything other than one that has demonstrably placed Chelsea closer to where they ought to be and for his first year that was enough. It wouldn’t be enough next season, though, and having to actually deploy first-team players throughout a European campaign obviously represents a fresh challenge.",
      "",
      "5) Leeds (-)\nPromoted in often scintillating style and, whether anyone else likes it or not, are one of vanishingly few Championship clubs for whom a meaningful stab at breaking open the Premier League’s Settled Seventeen represents a realistic ambition and not just a hopeful pipe dream.",
      "Still need a big and busy summer to have anything like a squad ready to cope with what the Premier League has become even since their last crack at it, but a real sense that Leeds are ready to give it a go.",
      "Very much still in the celebratory partying stage of the Premier League promotion cycle and while The Fear will kick in for them as it does for everyone at some point, how Leeds go next season does feel like it’s an important barometer of the wider health of the upper levels of the English football pyramid; if Leeds disappear without a trace then the question becomes who, if anyone, won’t do that?",
      "And if the only viable answers there become Birmingham, or Wrexham, then you’re really just raising further uncomfortable questions.",
      "Tits to all that for now, though, yeah? Leeds are back. They’re pretty chuffed about it, and don’t really care whether anyone else is.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool (6)\nSome fans deciding to be a bit weird about Trent Alexander-Arnold is so not rainbow rhythms and the fact Liverpool didn’t win another game after confirming the league title is all at the same time a) funny b) largely irrelevant but also c) slightly annoying.",
      "We’re all of us bedevilled by recency bias and while of course Liverpool fans are mainly still celebrating their first league title in front of fans since 1990, there’s a part of all of us that knows were we in their position we’d still be slightly narked about the four-game winless run to end the season even though logically we shouldn’t give a sh*t.",
      "This is very small beer, though, especially with the club already making statement moves in what is going to be a huge summer that will reveal whether Arne Slot can be as successful with his own side as he was with Jurgen Klopp’s.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong and especially the seemingly imminent Florian Wirtz are hugely exciting moves. Wirtz in particular is a massive statement of intent and indicator of how big Liverpool’s pull now is. If you’re not getting giddy about that one, you’re in the wrong game.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle (1)\nNewcastle absolutely should not, will not and do not care one jot, but it’s very funny to us that the English football media collectively wanked themselves so entirely dry at Newcastle finally winning a trophy only for two other conspicuous pot-dodgers to collect two even bigger prizes before the season was out.",
      "Like we say, though: amusing to us, irrelevant to Newcastle. The cathartic release of all those long-awaited trophy wins was magical for those involved, and there really is no need for anything so gauche as comparisons or guff about who it meant more for.",
      "Newcastle backing up that emotional Carabao success by claiming fifth place and with it Champions League football next season places this at the summit of Newcastle seasons in the modern era and there really is no obvious reason why it shouldn’t now be just the start of something even greater.",
      "The mood is good, is what we’re saying here. Or it was until they realised they still couldn’t beat Manchester United to transfers.",
      "",
      "2) Crystal Palace (4)\nFifty points and an FA Cup win? They really are glad all over. We know we’re probably the only ones on earth who would put those achievements in that order, but we’ve been very invested in the Palace 50 points story for the last couple of years and are absolutely delighted to see them do it.",
      "But even we can acknowledge that getting 50 Premier League points in a season for the first time is not quite as good as winning major silverware for the very first time.",
      "In a season of remarkable drought-ending trophy success, nothing was greater than Palace’s. These were supporters with powerful reason to think this was a day that might never come, at least not in their lifetimes.",
      "The appointment of Oliver Glasner already merits discussion among the most astute managerial appointments any Premier League club has ever made. He came to a club with some compelling raw materials but has had a transformative effect few could have predicted.",
      "Are we still talking about FA Cup wins or are we back banging on about getting 50 points? We prefer not to speak.",
      "",
      "1) Tottenham (20)\nThey really are That Club, ending the trophy drought but absolutely not their banter era in the single most Spurs way imaginable.",
      "It is ridiculous to even imagine a team that finishes 17th qualifying for the Champions League, but when you do give it any kind of attention it immediately becomes clear only one club could possibly do it and that’s the one that didn’t qualify for the Champions League when they finished fourth.",
      "Only Spurs could achieve something like that after a decade of agony and then get about 10 days to fully enjoy and revel in no longer being the butt of everyone’s jokes – a mantle which, to make things even better, passed immediately to Arsenal – before going ‘Hang on, what do we actually do about a manager who won a trophy but also finished 17th?’",
      "Other clubs just aren’t like this.",
      "The genius of this Spurs season is just how long it’s been so clear that it had only two possible end-points. The miracle is which one has actually happened. We said this in March and apart from failing to mention Palace in the FA Cup it still captures the essence of the absurdity that is Tottenham’s 24/25 season:",
      "There remains, somehow, the small but decidedly non-zero chance that Postecoglou pulls an absolute Homer and wins the Europa League. It’s impossible to overstate just how much that transforms everything about this season.",
      "It might not be the most important thing about it, but we do think there are only two places Spurs can end the season in these rankings, and those two places are first and last.",
      "This is a season that for Spurs really does appear to have crystallised and distilled down to two possible outcomes. First, and most likely, their worst season since before the Premier League And The Invention Of Football. When you consider just how utterly crap Spurs were for much of the nineties and early noughties, that’s a staggering achievement.",
      "But not as staggering as the only alternative which is an end to their own trophy drought and with it qualification for the Champions League, which would genuinely make this Spurs’ best season for at least 40 years.",
      "Spurs’ existential despair over that albatross of a trophy drought has already been exacerbated by Newcastle exorcising their own demons, and with every chance of Villa, Bournemouth, Forest, Brighton or somesuch also joining the ever-growing list of clubs to win a trophy more recently than Tottenham there is a profound sense that while it’s always true that whatever happens in football the joke is always on Spurs it may never have been more true, the joke never more entirely on them, than it has been this season.",
      "Unless, of course, they can somehow defy history, logic and reason to land an unlikely punchline of their own. Mate.",
      "And lo, it came to pass. And now we have to get this out quick before Spurs make a confirmed final decision one way or the other on Big Ange and p*ss off half the fanbase either way."

      "Mikael Silvestre has admitted Manchester United will need ‘more than two or three years’ to emerge from their slump, as he gave his verdict on what needs to happen next with manager Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The United boss is under huge pressure after failing to make a positive impact since succeeding Erik ten Hag as United boss last November, with defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final providing a miserable footnote to the club’s worst season in a generation.",
      "United appear to have gone backwards since Amorim’s arrival and the Portuguese tactician has given public hints that he is willing to walk away from the club if the owners have lost faith in his abilities.",
      "Yet Silvestre, who won the Premier League title four times and also the Champions League during his time as a United player, has insisted Amorim should not be the fall guy for United’s demise.",
      "“These questions about Amorim’s future are complete nonsense because he took over in November and this is not his team,” Silvestre told Football365 with Esports Insider.",
      "“He has not had any time to influence his philosophy and how he wants to play and these are not the players he wants.",
      "READ: Man Utd signing £365m Premier League sextet now inevitable after Cunha, Mbeumo transfers",
      "“They are not his players. The only player they signed in January was Patrick Dorgu and now Amorim has to be given the time and the financial backing to strengthen the squad.",
      "“After that, we can judge what he doing. It will always be the results that decide what happens to a manager, but you cannot decide after half a season when he has not had a transfer window to fix it. We can only stick with him for the future.”",
      "Silvestre went on to express his hope that rumours linking United captain Bruno Fernandes with a move to the Saudi Pro League will evaporate, as the Frenchman insists the club need to hang on to their best player.",
      "Fernandes’ body language on the field has been criticised by former United players like Roy Keane, but Silvestre offers up a different verdict on the impact of the Portuguese playmaker.",
      "“There is no argument about Bruno’s commitment and level,” stated Silvestre. “The amount of football he has played this season shows a level of dedication and he has been their best player, for sure.",
      "“I hope Bruno stays because it is important that the top players are there to maintain the level and allow others to grow.",
      "“You look at someone like Kobi Mainoo and who is he going to look up to? It’s Bruno. He will learn from his movement and his passing. So it is really important that Bruno stays.”",
      "Silvestre went on to suggest United’s dramatic fall from grace has been hard to watch, as he admits last season’s FA Cup final win against Manchester United papered over cracks at the club, as he hinted they will many years to find a solution.",
      "“It’s shocking to see United where they are,” said Silvestre. “You do not expect a club of that stature to finish in this position in the league, but this has been coming. It has been mismanaged for many years and eventually it catches up with you.",
      "“When you ask how long they need to put it right, I’m going to say many years. I’m going to say more than two or three years. United have been standing still for too long and everyone else has been getting stronger.",
      "“Let’s see what Amorim can do. He needs at least three transfer windows in the summer to see if he can build a team, but it is a long time before they start to move up the ladder again.",
      "“The FA Cup final result (beating Manchester City) last season disguised the real position, but I still feel this team had more in the tank to finish a lot higher than they did this season.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",

      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has decided to ‘reject’ Al-Hilal and stay at Old Trafford ahead of next season, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes may leave Manchester United but it will not be because he attended a birthday dinner with his friend…",
      "Should Man Utd sell Bruno Fernandes? The fans are split. We also have views on the new Man Utd manager, Spurs and more."

      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "The Red Devils are looking to sell several of their players this summer in order to fund a recruitment drive in order to get Ruben Amorim the players he needs before next season.",
      "There have been claims that Man Utd have £100m to spend this summer, £62.5m of which has already been spent on the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "And now player sales will be crucial as they look to top up their transfer funds with Bruno Fernandes’ exit ruled out on Tuesday morning.",
      "Sancho, Rashford and Antony have all been out on loan for all or part of this season and now Man Utd are looking to get the best fee for the trio, while Garnacho reportedly wants to leave Old Trafford.",
      "And Man Utd legend Neville reckons all four of them will find new clubs, he said on It’s Called Soccer: “On these five I’m pretty certain. Marcus Rashford has to leave for him and the club. I think that ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club.",
      "READ: Wirtz next? Ten greatest signings by Premier League champions obviously dominated by Manchester United",
      "“I would worry that Aston Villa haven’t announced that they’re keeping him already because I think that could have been an easy deal to do with United if they were going to keep him, so it sounds to me like Villa aren’t going to keep him.",
      "“I would say for Marcus’ sake and for United’s sake that it feels like that path has come to an end.”",
      "Switching to Sancho, Neville added: “I feel a little bit similarly with him as I do with Marcus.",
      "“I’d be a bit concerned that Chelsea haven’t made the noises that they’re going to keep him.",
      "“Again, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him and, from Jadon’s point of view, he has to make sure that he parts ways with Manchester United.”",
      "Antony has been thriving on loan at Real Betis and Neville expects to see the Brazilian continue to impress in Spain next season, he continued: “I can imagine he was absolutely going under while he was at Old Trafford.",
      "“He’s gone to Spain and having seen a couple of players that I played with not do it Old Trafford but do it in Spain… I think he’s suited down to the ground and it’s been proven.",

      "“Over there, there’s a different tactical awareness, there’s a different technical ability and there’s a way of playing that’s just more suited to players.",
      "“The players I’m referring to are players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan. It just didn’t quite happen for them but they had really good careers and I think there are players like that who just aren’t suited to a league.",
      "“I think Antony is perfect for Spain and, again, somebody who Manchester United should facilitate leaving. It’s best for Antony and best for the club.”",
      "Assessing Garnacho’s situation at Man Utd, Neville said: “I think if players are taking on the manager and if players are questioning the manager in public through social media or through other means, the manager has to win.",
      "“If the manager doesn’t win, the manager has to leave and I don’t think that’s going to happen this time. That’s happened far too many times before.",
      "“I think Garnacho will leave purely because of that, I think they’ve had enough. Garnacho can play in the Premier League, no doubt, but I think he’ll love it in Spain, he’ll thrive over there, he’ll score goals.",
      "“He’ll probably be someone next season that we’re all looking back on thinking, ‘Why didn’t Manchester United keep him?’, that type of thing will probably happen, there’s an element of that, but I think he has to go.",
      "“That’s not me throwing my toys out the pram and saying, ‘Get him out the club!’… no, for him and the club, I think it’s right that he goes.",
      "“Those four players should leave, not just because Manchester United should let them go, but because they should go and find themselves a place in their lives where they can go and play football because it’s not at Old Trafford.”",
      "Neville does not want Kobbie Mainoo to leave, though, the Man Utd legend went on: “Mainoo, no. That’s a step too far.",
      "“If we can’t give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield… I look at Mainoo and the way he plays football and I think a top club would want him.",
      "“Why can’t we make him a top player? If he’s one of ours and he’s shown talent.",
      "“I don’t know what’s gone on there in the last few months. He’s obviously had some injuries which has caused him a problem so he needs to stay fit, but I’d like to think he could be one of that two in midfield that Ruben Amorim plays.",
      "“It’s probably not Casemiro as his partner and it’s probably not Ugarte as his partner, it’s probably someone else in there who is better than those two, if I’m being honest.",
      "“But we should be building around Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield and not because he’s come through the ranks.”",
      "Gary Neville has “doubled down” on his previous Premier League title predictions and once again forecast Arsenal as next year’s winners.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",

      "We have the top 10 signings by Premier League champions here as we warm to the theme…",
      "",
      "25) Leicester (2015/16)\nNampalys Mendy (Nice, £13m), Ron-Robert Zieler (Hannover 96, £2.6m), Luis Hernandez (Sporting Gijon, free), Raul Uche Rubio (Rayo Vallecano, undisclosed), Ahmed Musa (CSKA Moscow, £16m), Bartosz Kapustka (Cracovia, £7.5m), Islam Slimani (Sporting, £29.7m).",
      "It’s fair to say Mendy didn’t quite rise to the unreasonable challenge of replacing N’Golo Kante and actually, none of this bunch of misfits really rose to the challenge of playing Premier League football.",
      "",
      "24) Chelsea (2009/10)\nYossi Benayoun (Liverpool, £5m), Matej Delac (Inter Zapresic, £2.7m), Tomas Kalac (Sigma Olomouc, £5m).",
      "This sorry trio makes the decision to sack Carlo Ancelotti at the end of the 2010/11 season after finishing second, a year on from the double, all the more absurd.",
      "",
      "23) Manchester City (2011/12)\nJack Rodwell (Everton, £12m), Scott Sinclair (Swansea, £8m), Maicon (Inter Milan, undisclosed), Richard Wright (Preston North End, free), Matija Nastasic (Fiorentina, undisclosed), Javi Garcia (Benfica, £16m).",
      "City were really quite sh*t at transfers before Pep Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain arrived.",
      "",
      "22) Manchester City (2013/14)\nFernando (Porto, £12m), Bacary Sagna (Arsenal, free), Willy Caballero (Malaga, £6m), Eliaquim Mangala (Porto, £32m), Frank Lampard (New York City, loan), Bruno Zuculini (Racing Club, £1.5m).",
      "See, terrible.",
      "",
      "21) Manchester United (2012/13)\nGuillermo Varela (Penarol, £1m), Marouane Fellaini (Everton, £27.5m).",
      "David Moyes was on a hiding to nothing.",
      "",
      "20) Manchester United (1999/00)\nFabien Barthez (Monaco, £7.8m)",
      "He was essentially proof of United being so good that even a liability for a goalkeeper couldn’t knock them off course.",
      "",
      "19) Chelsea (2016/17)\nDanny Drinkwater (Leicester, £35m), Davide Zappacosta (Torino, £23m), Alvaro Morata (Real Madrid, £60m), Willy Caballero (Manchester City, free), Antonio Rudiger (Roma, £34m), Tiemoue Bakayoko (Monaco, £40m), Ethan Ampadu (Exeter, free)",
      "Rudiger is a big reason why Chelsea won a second Champions League, but Drinkwater and Bakayoko have got to be up there with pound-for-pound the worst midfield signings in Premier League history and Alvaro Morata’s Premier League goals cost Chelsea just shy of £4m each.",
      "",
      "18) Chelsea (2014/15)\nPedro (Barcelona, £21.4m), Baba Rahman (FC Augsburg, £17.7m), Asmir Begovic (Stoke, £8m), Kenedy (Fluminense, £6.3m), Nathan (Atletico Paranaense, £4.5m), Papy Djilobodji (Nantes, £2.7m), Danilo Pantic (Partizan Belgrade, £1.25m), Michael Hector (Reading, Undisclosed), Radamel Falcao (AS Monaco, Loan).",
      "We would suggest the excellent addition of Pedro from Barcelona was counteracted somewhat by them signing Baba Rahman for nearly as much money, putting him on £90,000 per week and then inexplicably extending his contract after three years, meaning his seven-year stay at Chelsea cost them nearly £33m. He made 23 appearances.",
      "",
      "17) Manchester City (2023/24)\nSavinho (Troyes, £21m), Ilkay Gundogan (Barcelona, free).",
      "Signing a £50m player from themselves for £21m hasn’t worked out as well as many hoped/feared and Gundogan hasn’t been the Gundogan which left for Barcelona, and crucially, not a Rodri.",
      "",
      "16) Manchester City (2022/23)\nMateo Kovacic (£25m, Chelsea), Josko Gvardiol (£77m, RB Leipzig), Jeremy Doku (£55.5m, Rennes), Matheus Nunes (£53m, Wolves).",
      "Kovacic has been fine and Gvardiol’s probably been the best left-back in the Premier League across his two seasons at the club, but Doku hasn’t lived up to his early promise and there’s been no promise of a positive sort from Nunes.",
      "",
      "15) Manchester City (2020/21)\nJack Grealish (£100m, Aston Villa), Karky (£9m, Fluminense).",
      "We’re guessing the majority would say Grealish has not been a success as Manchester City, but surely a treble is worth far more than £100m and we don’t think they would have done it without him.",
      "",
      "14) Manchester United (2007/08)\nDimitar Berbatov (Tottenham, £31m), Zoran Tosic (Partizan, £5m), Ritchie De Laet (Stoke City, £200k).",
      "Adding Berbatov to a striker canon of Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Danny Welbeck was just plain greedy and speaks to a squad built to the point of not needing to sign anyone.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester United (2008/09)\nAntonio Valencia (Wigan, £16m), Michael Owen (Newcastle, free), Gabriel Obertan (Bordeaux, £3m), Mame Biram Diouf (Molde, undisclosed).",
      "A window saved by Valencia, who was an inspired addition.",
      "",
      "12) Arsenal (2001/02)\nGilberto Silva (Atletico Mineiro, £4.5m), Pascal Cygan (Lille, £2m).",
      "Gilberto was a lovely footballer; Cygan less so.",
      "",
      "11) Liverpool (2019/20)\nKostas Tsimikas (£11.7m, Olympiakos), Thiago (£20m, Bayern Munich), Diogo Jota (£41m, Wolves).",
      "Jota has largely been excellent when fit but Liverpool surely wouldn’t have signed him had they known he would miss 99 games though injury in five years at the club. The definitely wouldn’t have signed Thiago, who missed over 100 games in four years.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester City (2017/18)\nRiyad Mahrez (£60m, Leicester), Philippe Sandler (£2.25m, PEC Zwolle), Daniel Arzani (undisclosed, Melbourne City).",
      "We love Mahrez so, so much and will continue to bat for him being named among the Premier League’s greatest ever wingers. He makes our greatest 10 signings made by Premier League champions list.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea (2004/05)\nMichael Essien (Lyon, £24.5m), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City, £21m), Asier Del Horno (Athletic Club, £9m), Lassana Diarra (Le Havre, £3m).",
      "Essien proved himself well worth what was seen as a massive transfer fee for a midfielder. Wright-Phillips never quite made the grade and Del Horno is best only remembered for charging at a 19-year-old Lionel Messi and being sent off while both of them rolled around on the floor.",
      "",
      "8) Manchester United (2010/11)\nDavid De Gea (Atletico Madrid, £17.8m), Phil Jones (Blackburn, £16.5m), Ashley Young (Aston Villa, £16m).",
      "Four Player of the Year awards makes De Gea arguably one of the best indicators of United’s demise – you don’t want a goalkeeper to be your best player – but it also obviously means he was a successful signing, as was Young, and Jones too, despite a career of wholly unfair p*ss-taking.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea (2005/06)\nAndriy Shevchenko (AC Milan, £31m), John Obi Mikel (Lyn, £16m), Khalid Boulahrouz (Hamburg, £9m), Ashley Cole (Arsenal, £5m), Salomon Kalou (Feyenoord, £1.5m), Michael Ballack (Bayern Munich, free), Hilario (Nacional, free).",
      "Cole and Ballack for a combined £5m is very good going and Kalou was a snip too. Plus we had the whole Mikel in a Manchester United shirt before signing for Chelsea story arc, which was a joy.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal (2003/04)\nManuel Almunia (Celta Vigo, £3.5m), Robin van Persie (Feyenoord, £2.75m), Mathieu Flamini (Marseille, £400k), Arturo Lupoli (Parma, £200k).",
      "Incredible that Almunia cost more than Van Persie. Flamini for less than half a million isn’t bad going either.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United (2000/01)\nJuan Sebastian Veron (Lazio, £28m), Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV, £19m), Roy Carroll, (Wigan, £1.5m), Luke Steele (Peterborough, £400k), Laurent Blanc (Inter, free), Kieran Richardson (West Ham, free).",
      "Veron was the British record transfer at the time and didn’t work out, but they recouped a decent wedge of that fee by duping Chelsea into signing him two years later. Van Nistelrooy entirely made up for that misstep and then some.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United (2002/03)\nCristiano Ronaldo (Sporting, £12m), Kleberson (Atletico Paranaense, £6.5m), Eric Djemba Djemba (Nantes, £3.5m), Tim Howard (MetroStars, £2.5m), David Bellion (Sunderland, £2m).",
      "Quite possibly the worst transfer window of any club ever without the 936-goal elephant in the room.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City (2018/19)\nZach Steffen (£7.2m, Columbus Crew), Angelino (£5.3m, PSV), Rodri (£62.8m, Atletico Madrid), Joao Cancelo (£60m, Juventus), Scott Carson (loan, Derby), Pedro Porro (£11m, Girona), Ryotaro Meshino (£900,000, Gama Osaka).",
      "A middling window without the signing of the current best footballer on the planet as they made a tidy profit on Angelino and, before the Guardiola fallout, Cancelo was arguably the best full-back in the Premier League. But Rodri makes it brilliant, particularly given all the doubts as to how they would ever replace Fernandinho.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United (2006/07)\nAnderson (Porto, £27m), Nani (Sporting, £25m), Owen Hargeaves (Bayern Munich, £17m), Carlos Tevez (West Ham, loan), Tomasz Kuszczak (West Brom, £4m).",
      "Not at all surprising that United won the Premier League three times in four years after this window.",
      "",
      "1) Manchester City (2021/22)\nErling Haaland (£51m, Borussia Dortmund), Stefan Ortega (free, Arminia Bielefeld), Kalvin Phillips (£45m, Leeds), Sergio Gomez (£11m, Anderlecht), Manuel Akanji (£16.7m, Borussia Dortmund).",
      "They could have signed a team of Phillips’ and this still would have been one of the best. Haaland and Akanji from Dortmund is surely among the best double transfer window swoops in history."

      "And no, we don’t mean that time they signed Michael Owen.",

      "10) Erling Haaland\n“We cannot replace him, we cannot,” said Pep Guardiola through tears induced by Sergio Aguero’s farewell match, in which the Argentinean inevitably scored twice from the bench.",
      "The Manchester City manager had lied equally absurdly a month or so before, stating that “because of the economic situation in the world right now, we are not going to sign a striker next season”.",
      "Haaland arrived in a £200m package soon after and is now within five places of Aguero on the club’s all-time top scorer list after just three seasons. Although it somehow remains unclear whether Manchester City are better without a Proper Striker or not.",
      "READ: Liverpool can easily make top five first transfer windows for Premier League champions this century",
      "",
      "9) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nNot even a mess of medicals could prevent Manchester United from eventually pushing through the British record capture of Van Nistelrooy, the player Sir Alex Ferguson believed would help translate domestic dominance into consistency on the European front.",
      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",
      "Yet Van Nistelrooy left with just one Premier League title, an FA Cup and a League Cup, matched with the solitary Golden Boot he managed to snatch away from arch-nemesis Thierry Henry.",
      "",
      "8) Freddie Ljungberg\nArsene Wenger felt compelled to make an exception for Ljungberg, a player he had never seen in person before sanctioning his purchase from Halmstad in 1998.",
      "“I saw Freddie Ljungberg giving a hell of a lot of problems to Martin Keown while watching him on television as he played for Sweden against England. I decided to buy him then,” the legendary Arsenal manager once said of a Euro 2000 qualifier in which Keown categorically did not feature.",
      "Whoever was tormented by a prodigious Ljungberg, it was to Arsenal’s ultimate benefit. The forward became an Invincible, the club’s second-highest Champions League appearance maker, a winner of five trophies and a wearer of lovely pants.",
      "",
      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",
      "An inability to replace his productivity and knack for stepping up in the biggest games has played a significant role in Manchester City’s recent plight. Jeremy Doku wishes he was as good as peak gloves Mahrez.",
      "",
      "6) Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOne Irish newspaper at the time of a transformative summer for Manchester United wrote that ‘along with Karel Poborsky and Jordi Cruyff, Scandinavian duo Ronny Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Sloksjar signed for a combined fee of £2.7 million’ to ‘make up Fergie’s team of flash continentals’.",
      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",
      "",
      "5) Ashley Cole\nBy the time Cole left Chelsea for Roma after winning seven trophies in eight years, the pawn in the controversial move which saw him swap a fading force for one just establishing itself was retiring from the game completely.",

      "It was claimed last month that United were planning to test the Premier League club’s resolve by putting in a £50m bid for the winger, who got 20 goals and eight assists this season, with Brentford “open” to selling the 25-year-old, who is entering the last 12 months of his contract.",

      "Is there a curse on Premier League transfers above £70million? Arsenal’s record signing Declan Rice has helped to buck the trend and the improvement of Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez has improved this list – but it’s still pretty grim.",
      "Including an alarming number of flops, we have ranked the 17 Premier League signings who cost £70million or more.",
      "",
      "17) Romelu Lukaku to Chelsea\nChelsea bought Romelu Lukaku for the second time in 2021, splashing out £97.5m on the Belgian, who was handed another chance to make his mark at Stamford Bridge. He had spent time on loan at West Brom and Everton during his first spell, playing the best football of his Premier League career for the latter.",
      "After a successful permanent move to the Toffees, Lukaku joined Manchester United for big money (more on that soon), before moving to Inter and then returning to Chelsea. Many – F365 included – expected him to be the signing of the season, but he flopped disastrously, digging his own grave by publicly begging Inter to re-sign him.",
      "An ill-advised interview with Sky Italia effectively ended his Chelsea career. He at least earned a loan back to Inter in 2022/23, spent 2023/24 at Roma, and finally departed for good last summer when he signed for Napoli for around £20m.",
      "",
      "16) Jadon Sancho to Manchester United\nManchester United have made some absolute howlers in the transfer market, and Sancho is among the worst. The Red Devils chased the England winger for over a year while he was at Borussia Dortmund before eventually landing him for £73m in 2021.",
      "Fast forward four years and Sancho is finished at Old Trafford. After a productive loan spell back at Dortmund, he joined Conference League winners Chelsea on loan for 2024/25. United stand to make around £25m from a sale.",
      "Arguably the most costly example of ‘Bundesliga tax’, Sancho never found his rhythm for United and any hope of revival disappeared after a public fallout with Erik ten Hag.",
      "MORE: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Alexis, Antony in bottom two, Solskjaer buy top",
      "",
      "15) Antony to Manchester United\nAntony cost a ridiculous £80m during Ten Hag’s first summer at United, with Ajax pocketing a huge fee after the Red Devilsleft it late in the 2022 window.",
      "Known for his flair and his wand of a left foot, Antony scored on his debut against Arsenal, but it was downhill from there. He has more yellow cards (14) than goals (12) or assists (5) in 96 appearances for the Red Devils. Even without the numbers, he’s looked nowhere near a £70m+ player.",
      "His value has crashed to £16.6m on Transfermarkt, and United would’ve been lucky to get even that before his successful loan at Real Betis. Nine goals and five assists in 26 games have raised his stock, but United will still make a massive loss when he inevitably moves on this summer.",
      "",
      "14) Darwin Nunez to Liverpool\nDarwin Nunez is definitely at the right club in terms of fanbase. Liverpool supporters embraced him from day one, making him one of their own. On the pitch, though, he has often looked lost.",
      "Roberto Firmino wasn’t a prolific scorer but made Jurgen Klopp’s side tick – something Darwin has not done. At 26, time is still on his side, but he remains frustratingly raw. Arne Slot appears to have run out of patience, and a summer exit beckons.",
      "",
      "13) Kepa Arrizabalaga to Chelsea\nStill the most expensive goalkeeper of all time, Kepa joined Chelsea for a staggering £72m in 2018.",
      "Since then, he’s lost his Spain place, been replaced by Edouard Mendy – who was signed for around £56m less – and briefly regained his spot, only to lose it again. At one point, it looked like his Chelsea career was over.",
      "Somehow, he found himself as Real Madrid’s No.1 for part of 2023/24 and then shone at Bournemouth this term. He’ll likely join the south coast club permanently. He never justified his fee, but he has at least salvaged his reputation.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe to Arsenal\nPepe cost Arsenal £72m in 2019. There was talk that Unai Emery preferred Wilfried Zaha, but was handed Pepe instead. This Arsenal fan was thrilled at the time. Poor, yet devilishly handsome, sod.",
      "Pepe is widely seen as a flop, but he did have moments. He was crucial in the 2020 FA Cup win, contributing in the semi-final and final. Eighteen goal contributions in his debut season wasn’t awful, just not what you’d want from a big-money signing.",
      "In 2020/21, he hit 21 goal involvements – including 10 league goals – and came second in Arsenal’s Player of the Year vote. But the Gunners finished eighth, so, yeah. He returned to France with Nice, and his contract was terminated in 2023 after no Saudi takers emerged.",
      "",
      "11) Harry Maguire to Manchester United\nSigned for £80m from Leicester in 2019, Maguire did well enough under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to be handed the captaincy – which only added to the pressure already weighing him down.",
      "That pressure might explain his struggles. His resurgence in 2023/24, after being stripped of the armband, suggests as much. £80m was clearly too much, but he hasn’t been that bad.",
      "",
      "10) Paul Pogba to Manchester United\nWhat a player on his day. Pogba returned to United in 2016 for a world-record £89m after being released by the club four years earlier.",
      "His first season was actually very good – nine goals, six assists, and two trophies under Jose Mourinho. He scored in the Europa League final win over Ajax. But that was as good as it got.",
      "He posted decent numbers in 17/18 and 18/19 but injuries and inconsistency plagued his second stint. He left again for free in 2022 and is currently a free agent due to a doping ban. A strange, often frustrating career.",
      "",
      "9) Wesley Fofana to Chelsea\nChelsea chased Fofana for a while before finally coughing up around £70m. There was even talk of him breaking Maguire’s record fee for a defender.",
      "He made just 17 Premier League appearances in 2022/23 and missed all of last season with yet another serious injury. After a promising start to 2024/25, he got injured and dropped down the pecking order behind Trevoh Chalobah and Levi Colwill.",
      "He hasn’t played since March and has only featured twice in 2025. Injuries are absolutely ruining his career.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United\nBetween Chelsea stints, Lukaku found himself at Old Trafford after United paid £75m following his prolific Everton spell (87 goals in 166 games).",
      "He never looked a good fit, but 55 goal contributions in 96 games isn’t terrible. And being sold for just £8m less than he cost keeps this spell off the disaster list.",
      "",
      "7) Kai Havertz to Chelsea\nChelsea paid £72m for Havertz and got a Champions League-winning goal out of it. That’s enough to secure his legacy, but the rest of his time in blue was underwhelming.",
      "They somehow sold him to Arsenal for £65m – a miracle, given his numbers. He’s found form again as a striker under Mikel Arteta, but in terms of Chelsea value for money, he just about breaks even.",
      "",
      "6) Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea\nBritish record signing Enzo Fernandez joined in January 2023 for a reported £107m. He didn’t do much wrong – but didn’t do much, full stop – until Enzo Maresca arrived.",
      "After starring at the 2022 World Cup, Fernandez struggled under multiple managers, but 2024/25 saw him thrive. He’s still not quite justified the fee, but he’s well on the way.",
      "READ: Top 10 Premier League transfer overpays of all time includes two Man Utd players",
      "",
      "5) Josko Gvardiol to Manchester City\nCity usually nail transfers, especially big ones. Josko Gvardiol arrived as one of the best young defenders in the world, though early struggles led some to believe Nathan Ake was still first choice.",
      "But the Croatian adapted quickly and was arguably the Premier League’s best defender in the second half of 2023/24. He dipped slightly after that, but so did all of City. No cause for concern.",
      "",
      "4) Jack Grealish to Manchester City\nCity paid £100m for Grealish, which is still eye-watering. He took time to adapt to Pep Guardiola’s system, and goal numbers remained modest – but he was vital in their Treble-winning season.",
      "Sixteen goal contributions in 2022/23 doesn’t tell the full story; he was key. However, after a disappointing 2024/25, a summer exit feels likely.",
      "",
      "3) Moises Caicedo to Chelsea\nCaicedo’s debut performance against West Ham could be described as catastrophic and it set the tone for an uncertain first few months.",
      "But slowly, Caicedo grew into the role. By the end of the 2023/24 season, he was a dependable, all-action midfield presence – and under Enzo Maresca, he’s been a revelation. His energy, tactical awareness and ball-winning ability make Chelsea tick, and while £115m still looks wild on paper, he’s been brilliant this season. Easily one of the best midfielders in the league.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice to Arsenal\nDeclan Rice has been sensational since joining Arsenal for £105m in the summer of 2023. Signed as a statement of intent, the England international has done more than justify the fee – he’s become the heartbeat of Arteta’s side.",
      "Whether deployed as a deep-lying six or a box-to-box eight, Rice has delivered elite performances. He reads the game superbly, breaks up play, leads by example and chips in with big goals – including a few belting free-kicks. His consistency and mentality have lifted Arsenal a level.",
      "This is the kind of transfer clubs dream of. No drama, no adaptation period, no regrets. Just class.",
      "",
      "1) Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool\nThis was never in doubt. Liverpool spent £76m on Virgil van Dijk in January 2018 and got one of the greatest defenders the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "His impact was instant. Liverpool went from leaky and flaky to serious contenders overnight. Within 18 months, they’d won the Champions League. Then came the Premier League title. Van Dijk became PFA Player of the Year, UEFA Men’s Player of the Year and finished second in the Ballon d’Or.",
      "More than the trophies or individual accolades, it’s the sheer authority he brought to Liverpool’s backline that stands out. Calm, dominant, and impossibly consistent – he remains the gold standard for defensive signings.",

      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 19:46, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered a four-player shortlist of players Manchester United must let go this summer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim's first summer transfer window as United boss is a crucial one as he tries to assemble a squad capable of bouncing back from an all-time Premier League low finish of 15th place.",
      "United also finished the campaign trophyless, having suffered defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, denying the club a return to the Champions League.",
      "However, Neville believes there will be an emphasis on outgoings with an inevitability surrounding some members of the squad. The former United captain believes Marcus Rashford is among the players who must leave this window.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has to leave Manchester United. That ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club,\" said Neville on The Overlap show, It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"I would worry that Villa haven't announced they're keeping him already, because that would be an easy deal to do with United if they were planning on keeping him.",
      "\"It sounds to me that Villa aren't going to keep him and he's going to end up back at United, but I hope for the club and Marcus' sake, it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",
      "\"With Jadon Sancho, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him,\" Neville said.",

Last month, Antony said he is \"smiling and happy\" since joining Real Betis on loan.",
      "On Antony, Neville said: \"His interview was absolutely spot on. I would imagine he was absolutely going under while at United. He's gone to Spain and is absolutely suited down to the ground with Spanish football.",
      "\"Over there, there is a different tactical awareness, technical ability, which is better suited to him. There were players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan; it just didn't quite happen for them, but they had very good careers, by the way. Forlan was sensational in Spain, there are players who aren't suited to a league.",

      "\"If players are taking on the manager, and if players are questioning the manager in public, through social media, the manager has to win, or the manager has to leave,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before, so I think Garnacho will leave just purely because of that.",
      "\"They've had enough. Garnacho can do it in the Premier League, but I think he'll thrive in Spain, he'll score goals and he'll be someone we'll be looking back at next season and asking: 'Why did Manchester United not keep him?'",
      "\"That type of thing will happen with him, but he'll have to go. That's not me throwing my toys out the pram, saying he has to go, but for the club and for him it's right that he goes.\"",
      "However, Neville took a different view in regards Kobbie Mainoo, with the 20-year-old's future reportedly also in doubt.",
      "\"Mainoo is a step too far,\" Neville said.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield, a top club will want him. Why can't we make him a top player, if he's one of ours and is showing talent? I don't know what's going on there in the last few months, he's had some injuries that have caused him problems, so he needs to stay fit. But I'd like to feel he could be one of the two in midfield that United play.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro or [Manuel] Ugarte, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two. We should be building around Mainoo in that midfield, not because he's come through the ranks. I'm alright for getting rid of players coming through the ranks, but not getting rid of players who come through the ranks and have shown what they can do.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",

      "It's understood they are getting encouragement that Mbeumo wants to come to Old Trafford.",
      "Brentford are willing to listen to offers for the forward they value in excess of £60m.",
      "The 25-year-old is a player United have admired for a while and he is seen as a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system.",
      "They will face competition for his signature with a number of Premier League clubs keen on the player.",
      "United are looking to act quickly in the market to give Amorim as much time with his players ahead of the new season.",
      "Mbeumo is about to enter the final year of his Brentford contract, though the club have the option to extend by a further year.",
      "Brentford will listen to offers for Mbeumo - and Yoane Wissa - but they are not under any pressure to sell any of their players.",
      "There is a feeling within the club that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "The feeling is he still has plenty to offer top level European football.",
      "United do not want to sell their captain, despite a potential lucrative offer from Al Hilal, which could be worth up to £100m. He has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year.",
      "Lines of communication between United and Real Betis remain open over forward Antony, whose loan is up.",
      "United are expecting offers for the Brazilian following an impressive showing at Betis where he scored nine goals in 24 starts.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 08:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is reportedly open to the project too.",
      "There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "Nobody at Wolves wanted a long drawn out saga involving the player during the summer. They will receive the full release clause in the terms set out in the contract - in three instalments payable by the summer of 2027. United were initially offering to pay in five instalments.",

      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",

      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "\"Day one of this mini transfer window and Manchester United have confirmed their first signing.",
      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",
      "\"So Manchester United will have to pay a third of that transfer fee now and then the other two will come at the end of the next two seasons.",
      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I'm sure that United will hope that now they've got someone like Cunha coming to the club, it might pave the way for way for other players.",
      "\"United still have that pulling power and the Cunha signing demonstrates that.",

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",

      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",

      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."
