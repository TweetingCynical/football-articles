      "Carlo Ancelotti managed to persuade Kalidou Koulibaly to stay at Napoli following a huge transfer offer from Manchester United. Koulibaly has opened up on how the legendary Italian manager torpedoed a potential blockbuster deal for him at Old Trafford back in 2018.",
      "Seven years ago, Jose Mourinho was desperate to sign a top-quality centre-back for United and ear-marked Koulibaly as targets, alongside Harry Maguire and Toby Alderweireld. Koulibaly was at the top of his game for Napoli and United therefore submitted an offer, which the Senegal international remembers being worth €100million (£88m today).",
      "He was ready to jump ship and join the Premier League side, who then had Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof as their first-choice pairing in central defence. But Napoli were unwilling to let him go – and it was Ancelotti’s intervention which made all the difference.",
      "“Napoli had received an offer worth €100m from Manchester United, but they rejected it,” Koulibaly recalled on the Zack en Roue Libre Podcast, as relayed by Tutto Mercato.",
      "“Ancelotti came to me and said: ‘I came here to win the Scudetto. What do you want to do?’ I replied: ‘I wanted to leave, why?'” He said he knew about the offer, but if I had left, he would have resigned the following day.”",
      "Koulibaly had joined Napoli from Genk in 2014 for around £6.5m and he felt the time was right to move on. But the experience and persuasive power of his manager ultimately saw him change his mind.",
      "“I thought my time at Napoli was over,” he added. “I had given my all. I had spent four seasons there, and I could have had the best contract of my career.",
      "“In the evening, Ancelotti called me and said: ‘Come to my room.’ He opened the door and said: ‘Ah, mon ami Kalidou!’ He spoke French, we were both wearing pyjamas. I was shocked. I explained to him that I wasn’t happy and that I thought the president had lacked respect towards me for the way he spoke.”",
      "The deal was scuppered and Koulibaly ended up staying with Napoli for a further four years before joining Chelsea in 2022. The centre-back lasted just one season with the Blues before leaving for Al-Hilal in 2023, where he remains to this day.",
      "United didn’t get their man with Koulibaly but did splash the cash the following summer, spending £80m to get Maguire from Leicester City. The England international remains at the club now and arrived in the 2019/20 season alongside Bruno Fernandes, who went on to take the captaincy off him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "AS Monaco manager Sebastien Pocognoli believes Paul Pogba still has the technique he has shown in the past for Manchester United, Juventus and France. However, he recognised the French international's situation is different to that of some of his team-mates.",
      "Pogba hasn't played any senior competitive football in over two years. He was handed a four year ban after testing positive for a banned substance during his second Juventus stint, though this was reduced on appeal after it was determined he didn't intentionally commit a doping offence.",
      "The 32-year-old midfielder was brought to Stade Louis II when Adi Hutter was manager, but the Austrian was dismissed in early October. Pocognoli has taken over in the dugout, and is close to being able to call upon Pogba in domestic competition and in the Champions League.",
      "\"Paul is closer to returning than Denis (fellow midfielder Denis Zakaria), even though his absence was much longer,\" Pocognoli said. \"I said this week would be used to answer some more questions, and every day is part of that process.",
      "\"For the moment, things are going well; I expect it to be a short time before he’s back with the group. When he returns, we’ll need to work together to assess him as a player.. The Paul of Manchester United or his first period at Juventus dates back several years now.\"",
      "Reflecting on the differences between Pogba and his team-mates, Pocognoli added: \"Every player develops according to their age and experience, so we’ll have to judge him based on his background and his age. From what I can see, he still possesses the technique we know he has. The rhythm of the matches will then give us some answers to all these questions.",
      "\"He can be the best version of himself at AS Monaco; in any case, it will be my role to try and guide him towards that level, to try and stimulate all his qualities and his potential. It’s the same for every player, but it’s different for him. I hope to get the most out of what he has to offer us.\"",
      "Pocognoli, who began the season with Belgian club Union SG, is unbeaten in three matches in Ligue 1. He also earned a point in his first Champions League game with his new employers, drawing 0-0 at home to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Most recently, they came out on top in a 5-3 thriller away to Nantes. The three points were enough to lift Pocognoli's team up to second in the Ligue 1 table, just a point adrift of leaders Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Next up for Monaco is another home match, with 12th place Paris FC heading to the principality. It's followed by a Champions League trip to Bodo/Glimt, with the new boss looking to pick up a first win in the competition.",

      "Ruben Amorim admits that Sean Dyche may've been right when he claimed Manchester United would 'win more games' if he was in charge. United boss Amorim has only recently won three Premier League games in a row for the first time, despite taking charge of the Red Devils nearly a year ago, symbolic of his struggles at Old Trafford.",
      "The Portuguese has been heavily criticised for sticking to his 3-4-2-1 formation which until now hasn't been getting results. Amorim used that shape to great success at Sporting Lisbon but he could only guide United to 15th in his first season, the club's lowest-ever Premier League finish.",
      "In May, as the Red Devils' dreadful campaign was coming to an end, Dyche - now in charge of Nottingham Forest, who play United on Saturday - appeared on a podcast. The former Watford, Burnley and Everton boss claimed that if he was given the job, he'd do a better job than Amorim at the time.",
      "At a press conference on Thursday, ahead of their meeting at the City Ground, Dyche's comments were put to Amorim. \"First of all, maybe it's true if we play 4-4-2 we win more, but I always said that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while,\" the United manager replied.",
      "\"Then I can look at Sean Dyche as a manager and then as a pundit. If you are a pundit and you don't say very strong things, I don't want to watch you! So I can understand that it's a different job. I know that Sean Dyche is really smart and he knows how to play the game.",
      "\"He also understands that one thing is when we are seeing the game and talking about the game, the other thing is to coach a team. So I understand that, I have nothing to say, I just want to win the next game.\"",
      "Dyche had accused Amorim of trying to 'over teach' his players when appearing on Stick to Football. \"He (Amorim) better win some games - pretty quick,\" the 54-year-old said.",
      "\"I reckon if I went there and played my way, we'd win more games. Just 4-4-2 - give them basic rules of principles. They have some good players. You don't have to over teach everyone.",
      "\"I'd be interested more in the longer run, if he can stick to his principals and then next season, we're all going, 'Fair play' - but, he's been there a while now so you better start bringing some wins soon.\"",
      "The pair will shake hands in the dugout before Saturday's 3pm kick-off, with their sides in very different situations. Amorim is looking for a fourth successive win while Dyche is aiming for his first league victory at Forest, having suffered a 2-0 loss away to high-flying Bournemouth last weekend.",

      "Ruben Amorim has revealed why he had to tell Lisandro Martinez 'no' as he spoke ahead of Manchester United's Premier League trip to Nottingham Forest on Saturday.",
      "The Reds travel to face Forest, looking to make it four straight wins in the top flight, after beating Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton. Amorim's side would move up to second in the table - for a matter of hours at least - if they win at The City Ground.",
      "In his press conference, Amorim was asked about the club's injury situation, including Martinez's fitness, Forest's start to life since Sean Dyche replaced Ange Postecoglou and how United are going to cope without Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo during AFCON. So, with that in mind, The Mirror has taken a look at the best from the Portuguese's chat with the media on Thursday.",
      "Amorim has reminded Martinez who calls the shots after revealing the defender had made it clear that he desperately wanted to play against Nottingham Forest. The Argentine, however, has been told he is going to have to wait for his return to action.",
      "Martinez has been sidelined since February after injuring his Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) against Crystal Palace, but was back in training with his United teammates earlier this week.",
      "Asked for an update on Martinez and whether he could make his return against Forest, Amorim said: \"He wants to go to this one [Forest], he isn't going to this one. He's going to need time.",
      "\"He has started training with us. Slowly, he is going to get better.",
      "\"It's really good. He gives use that edge in every training session, that is also really good for us. The rest of the guys we have one day. I don't know about Harry Maguire, the rest are fit.\"",
      "Amorim has praised three Nottingham Forest players ahead of Manchester United's trip to the East Midlands. The United head coach singled out England stars Morgan Gibbs-White, Elliot Anderson and Callum Hudson-Odoi as the main dangermen.",
      "The United boss also revealed that he has watched Forest closely since Dyche took over the reins. The ex-Burnley and Everton boss has won one and lost one game in charge of Forest since replacing Ange Postecoglou earlier this month, beating Porto in the Europa League and falling to a 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth.",
      "\"I watched against Porto, I watched against Bournemouth, the style of play is similar, with different characteristics,\" Amorim said. \"I watched one game that we didn't pre-season with Sporting, so to try to understand how he played in that game. It's similar, he can change some characteristics of the players with the talent that they have, especially with Gibbs-White, Anderson, Hudson-Odoi, very good players.",
      "\"So we need to be prepared for a different game against Brighton. We had space to play. We are not going to have that space. You need to understand that we are not being the same team away and at home, so we need to improve the way we control the environment. Every tackle is a big moment for the opponent's fans, so we need to play better away. We are prepared for a very tough match.\"",
      "Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo won't be involved for a period in December and January due to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) - and Amorim believes the Reds are going to \"struggle\" without them.",
      "The tournament is set to start on Sunday, December 21, before running through Christmas and the New Year, with the final taking place on Sunday, January 18.",
      "\"We will have time to suffer,\" Amorim said when asked about Amad and Mbeumo's expected absence. \"We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity.",
      "\"When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us.",
      "\"They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general.\"",

      "Manchester United have received a major boost after Lisandro Martinez returned to training almost nine months on from his serious knee injury. Martinez, 27, ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament during United's 2-0 loss to Crystal Palace in February and was forced to undergo surgery.",
      "The defender took part in outdoor training sessions towards the end of pre-season and Ruben Amorim added him to the Red Devils' new six-man leadership group, a sign that he remains a crucial member of the squad. But Martinez has had to be patient after being made to continue working individually for slightly longer than expected.",
      "Earlier this month, the Argentina international saw his return to first-team training delayed by a minor setback. Now Martinez has finally been given the all-clear and was spotted getting stuck in at Carrington on Thursday ahead of United's trip to face Nottingham Forest.",
      "Saturday's Premier League fixture could come too soon for Martinez, who'll be a topic of discussion in Amorim's pre-match press conference on Thursday afternoon. The Red Devils have one more game before the November international break, away to Tottenham next weekend.",
      "Quizzed on Martinez's progress last week, Amorim replied: \"He's feeling well. The knee is responding really well, so I don't want to say one specific day or one week.",
      "\"I don't know, but it's near to start the training with the team. Then it depends on the rhythm of Licha, if he wins the place or not, that will depend on him, but he's closer to return to training.\"",
      "Previously, the United manager made it clear how sorely missed the former Ajax star has been. \"We miss a lot Licha, especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him,\" Amorim admitted.",
      "But Martinez won't have an easy route back into the Red Devils' defence. Luke Shaw has been ever present in the Premier League this season, operating as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "Shaw, whose own injury troubles are well documented, assisted a goal in United's 4-2 win against Brighton on Saturday. Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt have also impressed this term, with Noussair Mazraoui and Ayden Heaven also featuring in the back three.",
      "Martinez won't have opportunities in cups before January either, as Amorim's side were dumped out of the Carabao Cup in August. The 27-year-old has been keen to stay involved in team affairs, regularly attending meetings and travelling to matches, despite not being able to play.",

      "Manchester United have a clear disadvantage in the race for Karl Etta Eyong, it has been claimed. Barcelona will reportedly be able to land the Levante star for considerably less than the Red Devils, with his current club putting in place different release clauses for different buyers.",
      "Barcelona are said to see Etta Eyong as a long-term successor to Robert Lewandowski, whose own future in Catalunya is far from secure. Interestingly, United themselves have been linked with Lewandowski only for owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to dash those hopes.",
      "Lewandowski, 37, is out of contract next summer and has been tipped to leave as Barca aim to trim their wage bill. United appear to be moving away from the approach of signing older players on big wages, though, following expensive gambles in years gone by.",
      "If he does move on, Barcelona will have a lot of goals to replace, with the former Bayern Munich star scoring 105 times in 156 appearances. Hansi Flick's side have been sharing the goals around this term, with United loanee Marcus Rashford helping boost the front-line, and Etta Eyong could add further goals next term.",
      "The 22-year-old only joined Levante over the summer, having scored his first La Liga goal for former club Villarreal last season. He has made a flying start, though, scoring five times in seven league outings for his new club.",
      "According to Mundo Deportivo (via Football Espana), it will cost Barcelona £26.4million to sign Etta Eyong. For Premier League clubs, though, the magic number sits at £35.2m.",
      "Manchester City, Arsenal and Real Madrid have also been linked with the 22-year-old, it has been claimed. However, Barca's interest comes with the club potentially looking at cheaper alternatives to Flick target and Borussia Dortmund hotshot Serhou Guirassy.",
      "Guirassy, 29, is expected to be available for just north of £57m. A relatively late bloomer, the Guinea international scored 28 Bundesliga goals in his final season with former club Stuttgart and 21 last term for current employers Dortmund - along with a tournament-leading 13 in the Champions League.",
      "United, meanwhile, may find themselves in the market for attacking reinforcements in 2026 despite a busy summer. Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko arrived at a combined cost of around £200m, but if United return to European competition they may feel the need for further additions.",
      "The funds for any new forwards may well come from selling Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund. Both men are spending the season out on loan, at Barcelona and Napoli respectively, and permanent exits could follow next summer.",

After a slow start to the season, United have turned a corner under Ruben Amorim of late, winning their last three matches in the Premier League to leap to sixth in the table.",

He said: “Yeah the guys have settled in really, really quickly. I think especially when you look at Matheus and Bryan, they have played in the Premier League and they have lived in England, so there is a quicker transition.",

      "\"I get slagged off for this,\" Scholes said while appearing as a guest on episode 100 of The Overlap's Stick to Football podcast. \"I did a top five the other week, and I didn't put people like [Moises] Caicedo and Declan Rice, because I like a different type of midfielder.",

      "\"I'm trying to think of a midfield player, but my mind's gone blank. I know there's Declan Rice, and people say, 'you didn't have Declan Rice in your top five,' because he's not my type of midfield player.\"",
      "Scholes made his preference for Tonali over Rice known during The Overlap Fan Debate earlier this month. \"I think he's better than Rice,\" Scholes said when asked about the Newcastle United midfielder.",
      "\"I really like Rice, don't get me wrong, I think he's got everything. Sometimes he takes a few too many touches of the ball and tries to look a bit more stylish than necessary.",
      "\"He can do everything, but I don't think he does it enough. I prefer Tonali, but they're both good players.\"",
      "On Stick to Football, Scholes said: \"I don't think we [England] have that type of controlling midfield player now that can do a bit of everything. We haven't got a Vitinha, we haven't got a Toni Kroos or a [Luka] Modric from them days, I just don't think we have that.",
      "\"A while ago, Jack Wilshere was probably the closest to being that type, but obviously, a load of injuries and stuff stopped him. I just don't think we've got that type, who has that game intelligence, of when to slow it down, when to fizz it into a centre-forward, I just don't think there's that intelligence around.\"",

      "Levante striker Karl Etta Eyong looks set to put Manchester United and Arsenal on a collision course for his signature. It's little wonder why the Cameroonian sensation has earned comparisons to Barcelona superstar Robert Lewandowski given his latest performances in La Liga.",
      "In truth, there may not be a major European power without their eyes on Etta Eyong at present in his current run of form. The 22-year-old has scored six goals in La Liga so far this season, with only Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe (11) having netted more.",
      "That's put a host of continental heavyweights on alert, with Real Madrid, Barca and Manchester City also said to be interested. And his star only looks set to shine more brightly after Mundo Deportivo reported he'd like to cement his future sooner rather than later.",
      "It's claimed Barca are ramping up interest in the youngster, whom they are believed to see as a replacement for Lewandowski. The Poland icon has been prolific in Catalonia but is now 37 and in the last year of his contract, though Barcelona do have the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months.",
      "Both United and Arsenal each bought new strikers in the summer. The Red Devils plumped to purchase Benjamin Sesko, while the Gunners finally moved for a new frontman and secured Sweden's Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "However, Etta Eyong could present an opportunity that's too good to pass up. Mundo Deportivo reported the player has a buyout clause in his contract that's worth roughly £26.5million for La Liga clubs, while Premier League sides would have to pay around £35m.",
      "Not a bad turnaround for Levante considering the Frogs only spent around £4m buying him from Villarreal in the summer. Around £2.5m of that went to the Yellow Submarine, while previous club Cadiz - who are due a percentage of his sell-on fee - received roughly £1.5m.",
      "Etta Eyong cannot play for a third club this season after already representing both Villarreal and Levante. He made a fast start to the campaign under Marcelino and made a direct goal contribution in each of Villarreal's first three league games before moving to the Valencia-based outfit.",
      "And his work has only continued to impress, bringing his total in La Liga this term to six goals and three assists overall. To put those figures into context, Mbappe is the only player in Spain's top flight with more direct goal contributions this season.",
      "According to Mundo Deportivo, the player would like to join a new club in January before being loaned back to Levante. Not only that, but it's understood his preference is to join Barcelona, whose colours he has been snapped sporting in the past.",
      "It's difficult to envision either United or Arsenal making a move for the player as soon as this winter. Each club spent mammoth amounts adding new forwards over the summer, so funds to spend so significantly in that area again may not be available.",
      "Their loss could prove to be the gain of any club with the initiative to move swiftly for a star quickly causing waves in La Liga, however. And Barcelona may already have an in-road to recruit Lewandowski's natural successor.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Due to Brexit regulations, United's academy is primarily focused on recruiting within the UK. At 16 years old, Filling would not have been able to join United in January, contrary to what some reports have suggested.",
      "Premier League and EFL clubs are prohibited from signing players from overseas until they reach 18, and all transfers from European countries necessitate a work permit, which is allocated using a points system. It's not uncommon for United to be named in transfer rumours as a tactic used by agents to gain leverage.",
      "Filling has made 10 appearances for AIK's first team this season. The promising youngster has netted three goals in all competitions and is viewed as a potential future star in Sweden.",
      "United continue to operate in the European market when opportunities present themselves and were quick to secure the signing of Enzo Kana-Biyik on a free transfer from Le Havre.",
      "Kana-Biyik turned 18 in January and was in the final year of his contract. United finalised his signing in July and promptly loaned the young forward to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne- Sport.",
      "Since Ineos' investment in the club, United have ramped up their activity in markets outside of Europe.",

      "The Dutch striker, who has spent much of the season warming the bench, is reportedly contemplating a winter move. Zirkzee has only made four appearances under manager Ruben Amorim this term and hasn't started a match yet.",
      "This season, Zirkzee has only clocked up 82 minutes on the pitch after being sidelined following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha - which set the club back £200million in the summer. Last week, The i Paper reported that West Ham are keeping tabs on Zirkzee's situation and are considering a loan offer.",
      "However, the Premier League side could face competition from Italy, with Napoli and Juventus previously linked to the Dutch striker.",
      "In a fresh update from Gazzetta dello Sport, Gian Piero Gasperini is said to 'wish' for Zirkzee to join his squad, with the striker still being monitored by director Ricky Massara.",
      "Roma are reportedly frustrated with current strikers Evan Ferguson and Artem Dovbyk. Dovbyk has only netted two goals so far, while Ferguson is still hunting for his first.",
      "The report suggests their futures 'remain uncertain' - Dovbyk is anticipated to be available in the summer transfer window and might even depart in January.",
      "Ferguson, who joined on loan from Brighton with a purchase option, has struggled to make an impression, leaving doubts over whether the club will exercise that clause to secure him permanently.",
      "Earlier in the campaign, United manager Amorim recognised the frustrations felt by players such as Zirkzee but has made his stance clear.",
      "\"I want to keep Josh because he gives everything and he's trying in training but we don't know,\" he said back in January.",
      "However, the Portuguese boss accepts that transfer rumours are simply an inevitable aspect of life at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I understand that but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season,\" he added. \"I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. Players are not playing.",
      "\"They want to play, and there's a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players, talking all the time.\"",

      "\"'He doesn't have enough money' or whatever. No, actually, every time I do a video and I'm not wearing the left shoes, I dedicate all my videos to my mum.",

      "\"I asked the manager and the next day I went to the hospital. When I arrived in the corridor, everyone was crying. I saw my brother and sister. I said, 'Wow, this is weird.'\"",

      "\"My mum was on the bed and I kissed her. Then I sat next to her. It was only when I pulled off the blanket, that's when I saw the left leg was missing.",

      "Evra enjoyed an illustrious trophy-laden career during his playing days, before retiring from football in 2019. The 44-year-old made his way through the youth ranks of CSF Bretigny in 1997, before signing for Marsala the following year.",
      "The Frenchman then enjoyed stints with Monza, Nice and Monaco before arriving at Manchester United in 2006. Under the tutelage of Sir Alex Ferguson, Evra won five Premier League titles, seven domestic cups and a Champions League, before moving on to Juventus in 2014.",

      "Aiden, who received an autism diagnosis as a youngster and is non-verbal, needs carefully structured care each day which has had a major impact on Scholes' work choices. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, he said: \"I made a decision this year because of Aiden, obviously due to his special needs you might know about. All the work I do now is just around his routines cos he has quite a strict routine every single day, so I just decided everything I'm going to do it is around Aiden.\"",

So, he doesn't know what day or time it is, but he knows from what we're doing what day it is. He'll be 21 in December.\", reports the Express.",
      "Discussing the severity of his son's condition, Scholes shared that Aiden communicates through sounds only understood by those closest to him. He also candidly spoke about how his child's condition impacted him throughout his football career.",

      "\"It was very tough in those days, feels like it was years ago. I don't think they [doctors] diagnosed it til they were two-and-a-half-years-old. But you knew early something was wrong but then you get the diagnosis, and I'd never heard of it.",
      "\"Then all of a sudden you start seeing everything, I don't know if it just consciously happens, I don't know. I remember the first time after we were playing Derby away and I just didn't want to be there.",
      "\"I remember the manager dropped me the week after actually, and I hadn't told anyone [about the diagnosis]. I ended up telling them a few weeks later, I think as it was quite hard.\"",
      "These days, Scholes has revealed that his entire life revolves around his son's needs, admitting he abandoned commentary duties because changes to routine left Aiden distressed. He explained: \"Everything I'm going to do now just works around him, I do studio work, but everything is built around his day.",
      "\"Last season on Thursday nights I'd do the Europa League for Man United, that's the night I'd usually have him, so he was getting all agitated, biting and scratching. He knows the pattern's not there straight away.",

      "Scholes is a hero at United, where he made over 700 appearances and won 25 trophies as a midfielder between 1993 and 2013. His exceptional playing career and one-club status with his boyhood team makes him an authoritative voice on United, yet he has decided to reduce the amount of work he does.",

He has sounds but it’s only people that are close to him that will know what he’s saying. He has autism, but it’s like a really severe autism – because you can have it and go to school normally and such.",
      "\"I did it [sharing on social media] one or two times and I only showed the good bits, there’s obviously some that aren’t great. And it was just the response he had from people, you know parents, the amount of people saying 'god that helps, we’ve got a kid that’s the same' or something like that. That’s why I carried on doing it.",
      "He added: \"I will reply to people on Instagram, because it’s hard, especially when they’re young because there’s the harm and attacking people and I only put the nice stuff on. I do think about putting the stuff on when he’s not too happy when he might try and bite or scratch. But then I think it’s probably not the right thing to do.”",
      "Scholes used to come into training with United with scratches and bite marks on him. Aiden was diagnosed with autism at the age of two and a half and the midfielder initially didn't tell his team-mates or manager Sir Alex Ferguson what was going on at home, despite it affecting his performances.",
      "“We didn’t know what was in store for us,\" he said of the diagnosis. \"There’s some kids who don’t speak at one and a half, two years of age, then at five or six, bang they’re speaking they call it a late development stage. But we just knew it was never going to be like that.",
      "\"I didn’t speak to anyone at the club about it. Even now I don’t want sympathy or anything. I just thought even if I did speak to someone about it, it’s not going to help Aiden. I don’t know what would help me.",
      "\"The big concern now is because you’re getting a bit older, what happens when you’re not here? That’s the thing that’s now on my mind all the time. There are times when it’s not in your head, it’s like anything, then there’s times like now when you do start speaking about it, it’s at the front of your mind.”",

      "After a poor start to the season, manager Amorim was tipped to leave Old Trafford, but United seem to have turned things around. They have won their last three matches, including a 2-1 triumph over rivals Liverpool and are starting to see the influence of new summer signings.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha both found the back of the net last time out against Brighton and will be aiming to keep up such momentum when they face Forest. But soon Amorim will be without star forward Mbeumo, who only arrived this summer from Brentford for an initial £65million.",
      "Mbeumo has found his feet under Amorim and already has four league goals to his name. But just as he starts to gel with his new team-mates, the club could be without him for an extended period.",
      "United are all set to be without Mbeumo for at least two matches in late December as he heads to the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon. Mbeumo's country play three group stage games from December 24 to December 31. This means he will almost certainly be absent for clashes with Newcastle and Wolves.",
      "However, if his team progresses further in the competition, he could be away for much longer. The Round of 16 takes place from January 3 to 6. The quarter-finals are on January 9 and 10. The semi-finals take place on January 14 and the final is on January 18. A third-place playoff is also scheduled for January 17.",
      "In this time, United play Leeds United, Burnley and a derby against Manchester City, which is currently scheduled for January 17 but is subject to change. They will also play an FA Cup third-round tie on the weekend beginning January 10. Mbeumo could miss all of these should his side reach the final.",
      "Another new signing who is still settling down in Manchester is Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old striker cost £74m from RB Leipzig this summer and has bagged just two goals so far. Given his mediocre start, ex-United marksman Dimitar Berbatov has issued some advice.",
      "\"Be confident in yourself,\" Berbatov said as he aimed a message at Sesko whilst speaking on the Rio Ferdinand presents YouTube channel. \"Be arrogant in a way that you demand the ball from your team-mates when you make the run.",
      "\"When you make a good run, if the ball doesn't come for you, say it or express it in a way that your team-mates will understand. That, 'I am here. I'm making the run for you. Respect my run. Not every time but try to see me and believe in what I can do with that run.'",
      "\"Sometimes be angry. Scream, swear at him, whatever. [It's] not personal. Half-time, before and after the game, speak. Sometimes I think the players need to be more aggressive and emotional, in a way like, 'Pass me the damn ball, man!'\"",
      "Amorim made it clear that Marcus Rashford wasn't in his plans at United almost immediately, and after being shipped out to Aston Villa in January, he joined Barcelona on another temporary deal this summer.",
      "In Spain, Rashford has been starting and performing well. There are no guarantees that he will return to Old Trafford, but if he does United legend Bryan Robson insists he will have to work on his attitude.",
      "\"Marcus is a great talent and everything, but I do think his attitude's got to change if he does come back to United,\" Robson told Grosvenor Casinos. \"Barcelona is different because we always know that Barcelona and Real Madrid are going to be dominant in their league.",
      "\"He will improve and he will start enjoying his football a little bit better if he were to come back to United. I can't believe that people say that he's enjoying the two clubs that he left us for and that you can't enjoy your football at Man United. That seems crazy to me.\"",

      "Each of these wins showcased different strengths, with their latest 4-2 triumph over Brighton highlighting the attacking prowess they've added to their ranks this summer. Bryan Mbeumo netted twice, with one goal set up by Benjamin Sesko, after Matheus Cunha had given them the lead.",
      "Casemiro was another standout performer for United, scoring a deflected goal that flew past Bart Verbruggen, while also providing an assist.",
      "The Brazilian international was also particularly impressive against reigning Premier League champions Liverpool, clearly thriving on playing just once a week.",
      "However, Amorim may soon have to plan for a United match without Casemiro, and not due to injury. The midfielder is already on three yellow cards, and two more before United's 20th league game will result in a one-match ban.",
      "Another potential suspension worry for what could have been as early as this weekend's clash against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground also emerged in the win over Brighton. For Danny Welbeck's superb free-kick to bring Brighton back into the game, Patrick Dorgu had fouled Yankuba Minteh as he was making a break for goal.",
      "The Denmark international was only shown a yellow card as it was deemed that Minteh's heavy touch meant it was not the denial of a clear and obvious goal-scoring opportunity.",
      "However, it was his third caution of the campaign already which puts him in the same suspension predicament as Casemiro.",
      "Amorim has favoured Diogo Dalot at left wing-back over Dorgu when deploying Amad on the opposite flank, but he has still been booked three times despite not starting any of United's last three league games.",
      "In terms of potential replacements for Casemiro, both Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo can be used alongside Bruno Fernandes, though Amorim would certainly prefer to have Casemiro available given his impact in recent weeks.",
      "If one of Dorgu or Casemiro picks up that fourth yellow card over the next few weeks, Amorim could be facing some big dilemmas.",
      "It is unlikely to come into his thinking but it is possible the United boss may not deploy Casemiro at home to Bournemouth in December on Monday evening as he would be suspended for the challenging trip to Aston Villa later that week.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha believes Ruben Amorim has adapted his football to cater for Benjamin Sesko's strengths. United snapped up Sesko from Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig for a fee that could reach £73.7million.",
      "The Red Devils pipped Newcastle United to Sesko's signature, with Arsenal also keen on the striker before choosing to land Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting instead. The Slovenian forward suffered a sluggish beginning to his Old Trafford career, failing to find the net in his opening six outings.",
      "However, Sesko, 22, went on to open his account against Brentford in September, before netting in the 2-0 home victory over Sunderland. He then registered his maiden assist for United during Saturday's thrilling 4-2 triumph over Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "That victory against Fabian Hurzeler's side marked a third consecutive win for the Red Devils, who now occupy a European qualification spot after nine matches. Sesko's Premier League arrival came at the cost of Rasmus Hojlund, who endured difficulties at United before departing to join Napoli shortly afterwards.",
      "Now, Saha, who netted 42 times in a Red Devils jersey, has voiced his opinion on how the club have altered their strategy with some of their stars following previous disappointments. Speaking to Betvictor, the Frenchman said: \"What I really like is that we're not making the same mistake we've made with Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "\"They were starting games with a certain status and had an immense responsibility to score. They need to be introduced game by game, understanding the principles, and if they don't perform, they'll be benched.",
      "\"Some of these moments are difficult to manage, while others are good. This will also apply to other players like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount.",
      "\"No player deserves anything, and Benjamin Sesko is starting to understand that he will have to fight for his place. Every opportunity he gets off the bench, he has to perform as he did on the weekend.",
      "\"I think he did really well, he didn't score, but he did his job confidence-wise. He was tracking back, and one day it will be rewarded.",
      "\"This is the type of introduction that hasn't been done for maybe the last seven to eight years, which was a big mistake.\"",
      "Sesko's upcoming opportunity to find the net will come in Saturday's encounter at Nottingham Forest (3pm kick-off). Success at the City Ground would mark United's fourth straight triumph - something they haven't accomplished since February 2024.",
      "They ended the weekend in sixth position, level on points with fifth placed rivals Manchester City. United are also only one point behind fourth placed Sunderland and Tottenham Hotspur in third.",
      "The Red Devils have not finished in the top four since the 2022-23 season, when Erik ten Hag steered them to third in his debut campaign.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been advised that Kobbie Mainoo could prove crucial in getting the best out of Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United. The skipper has been deployed in a deeper midfield position since Amorim's arrival, which has led to fewer direct goal contributions.",
      "The Portugal star still notched 19 goals and 19 assists last term, with those figures made even more remarkable given United's woeful campaign. Though Fernandes has managed just three goal contributions so far this season, United have enjoyed a productive spell with their recent form looking particularly encouraging.",
      "Successive victories against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have materialised with Fernandes excelling alongside Casemiro. A subtle adjustment - from Amorim - has allowed the former to drift into more attacking positions with one of the three centre-backs pushing out more boldly during the press.",
      "Nevertheless, United icon Bryan Robson is keen to see Fernandes returned to his forward role and thinks Mainoo should then take his place in a midfield partnership with Casemiro. \"I think Bruno Fernandes himself loves the club and I think Bruno would like to stay and will stay,\" he confessed to Grovesnor Casinos.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo can play in that position - at a push. But for me, if I was a coach within Man Utd, then I would be trying to develop him so then he can play alongside Casemiro and then Bruno can go off and do what Bruno does brilliantly.",
      "\"There's still improvement in Mainoo, but I could see him being in the role where he can be a midfield player who can do both and have a bit more responsibility in the defending side of the game.\"",
      "Mainoo has found it tough to secure regular game-time in 2025, with the academy graduate missing out on a loan move during the summer transfer window's deadline day. Robson has, since then, outlined what he needs to do to reclaim his spot in the starting line-up.",
      "The United legend stated: \"The first year Kobbie Mainoo came into the squad and into the team, he had probably half a season where he'd played well. In the second season, he was outstanding. He's actually shown the qualities he's got.",
      "\"So for me, if he stays away from injuries and gets in the team and gets a run of games, I think he's only going to improve and be a great talent for United.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley has been given the vote of confidence at Plymouth Argyle. Cleverley took the reins at League One Plymouth after being sacked by Watford in May, but results have been underwhelming so far.",
      "The Devon club fell just short of a great escape under Milon Muslic last season, finishing three points off safety. Muslic subsequently left for Schalke in the German second tier, and Cleverley is at risk of delivering a second successive relegation.",
      "The Pilgrims lost their first four games of the season before rallying under their new boss, but have picked up just one point from their last four games to sit 22nd of 24 teams in the third tier. However, chief executive Paul Berne insists Cleverley still has the backing of the higher-ups, though - as managers elsewhere have learned in the past - things can always change quickly in football.",
      "\"In the case of our Head Coach, let me be more explicit,\" Berne said after Tuesday's defeat at Mansfield, having argued recovery from \"an enormous period of instability\" will take time. \"We hired Tom as a young, bright, ambitious Head Coach who could come and be a big part of Argyle’s next phase.",
      "\"We are a quarter of the way into Tom’s first season with us. Whilst results have been disappointing, nothing has changed in terms of Tom being the right person for this club. We need to bring that stability throughout the club, and this comes from Head Coach downwards.\"",
      "Berne continued: \"We are confident that things will improve. We’ve had a number of circumstances which have hit us in recent weeks, resulting in key players being missing throughout the opening 14 league games. This was emphasised last night, with Tom unable to fill the substitutes bench, and nine players being unavailable for selection, with the vast majority considered first-team starters.",
      "\"These are not excuses, but facts, and are clearly not ideal circumstances for any Head Coach to deliver consistent, winning performances. But, we believe Tom has all the tools to still deliver this.",
      "\"Throughout all of this, the support of the Green Army has never wavered, with continued sell-out home crowds and incredible away backings. This support is never taken for granted by anyone at the football club, especially Tom, his staff and the players. We are One Argyle, and as history has proven, when we are united we can achieve special things. Let’s stick together. COYG.\"",
      "Plymouth named just six substitutes for their midweek trip to Mansfield, with goals from Will Evans and Jordan Bowery giving their opponents all three points. Ayman Benarous was the latest player to join the absentee list after picking up a freak injury in training, though team-mate Matthew Sorinola will be available to return for Saturday's FA Cup trip to Wycombe after serving a yellow card suspension.",
      "\"It's an action that he would have done tens of thousands of times opening his knee out a little bit to receive the ball and something's clicked in there which has caused a little bit of ligament damage,\" Cleverley said of Benarous. \"It's disappointing for him because after the last couple of performances and the way he's been training he would have featured a lot in a few games.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim conducted his pre-match press conference this afternoon ahead of Manchester United's clash with Nottingham Forest on Saturday.",
      "United can make it four wins in a row with a victory at the City Ground. Wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have lifted United up to sixth place in the table and ended the discussions over Ruben Amorim's future at the club.",
      "United have been beaten on their last two league trips to the City Ground, with former Red Anthony Elanga grabbing the winner in last season's meeting. Forest did the double over United in 2024/25 but they are struggling this season and United will fancy their chances of continuing their fine recent form this weekend.",
      "Check out our blog below for everything the United boss said:",
      "Thanks for following today's live blog.",
      "We'll be back with our blog of United's clash with Forest on Saturday.",
      "See you then.",
      "Amorim has admitted United will \"struggle\" when Mbeumo and Amad play at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "The AFCON will take place between December 21 and January 18. Mbeumo will represent Cameroon's national team at the tournament, while Amad is set to feature for the Ivory Coast.",
      "Read what he said here >>>",
      "Martinez is back in full training but won't be available for United this weekend.",
      "Martinez joined in with the main group this week and has entered the final stage of his recovery from a knee injury. Martinez's knee buckled when he fell to the ground against Crystal Palace at the beginning of February, and it was confirmed he had suffered an injury to his anterior cruciate ligament.",
      "Read here >>>",
      "Stick with us for a round-up of the best bits",
      "\"First of all, maybe it's true if we play 4-4-2. We won more games, but I always said that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while, but in the future it's going to be better. So we don't know that. Then I can look at Sean Dash as a manager and then as a pundit.",
      "\"If you are a pundit and you don't say very strong things, I don't want to watch you! I'm the same. So I can understand that it's a completely different job. I know that Sean Dyche is really smart and he knows how to play the game.",
      "\"And he also understands that one thing is when we are seeing the game and talking about the game, the other thing is to coach a team. So I understand that, I have nothing to say, I just want to win the next game.\"",
      "\"We will have time to suffer. We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity. When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us.",
      "\"They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general.\"",
      "\"More or less, I watched the last game, it was one of the first ones here that we won, we were so lucky in that game. I watched against Porto, I watched against Burnmouth, the style of play is similar, with different characteristics. I watched one game that we didn't pre-season with Sporting, so to try to understand how he played in that game. It's similar, he can change some characteristics of the players with the talent that they have, especially with Gibbs-White, Anderson, Hudson-Odoi, very good players.",
      "\"So we need to be prepared for a different game against Brighton. We had space to play. We are not going to have that space. You need to understand that we are not being the same team away and at home, so we need to improve the way we control the environment. Every tackle is a big moment for the opponent's fans, so we need to play better away.",
      "\"We are prepared for a very tough match.\"",
      "\"It was a journey, it was a big journey. It was tough, it was really tough. I learned a lot. Today the answer is different from three weeks ago so it's important to understand that, the biggest honour. It's only been two matches so far from that.\"",
      "\"He wants to go to this one [Forest], he isn't going to this. one. He's going to need time. He has started training with us. Slowly he is going to get better.",
      "\"It's really good. He gives use that edge in every training session, that is also really good for us. The rest of the guys we have one day. I don't know about Harry Maguire, the rest are fit.\"",
      "We will bring you every word from Amorim in just 15 minutes.",
      "The boss will no doubt be asked about Lisandro Martinez after the news he has stepped up his return from injury.",
      "Jason Wilcox has promised United will make further investment to challenge for major honours.",
      "United signed Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in the summer transfer window, committing to an outlay of £215million (excluding add-ons).",
      "Ruben Amorim was under pressure after a poor start to the campaign, but United have won three games on the bounce in the Premier League and the summer arrivals have been crucial.",
      "Read what he said here >>>",
      "Lisandro Martinez is back training with his United teammates as he continues his rehabilitation from an ACL injury picked up at the start of the year.",
      "Martinez picked up the injury against Crystal Palace back in February. Martinez's knee buckled against the Eagles and it was confirmed that he had suffered an injury to his anterior cruciate ligament.",
      "Read on here >>>",
      "Mason Mount and Harry Maguire were both doubts for the weekend win over Brighton but the former was named on the bench.",
      "Maguire was not fit in time and was not seen in training footage released by the club earlier this week.",
      "We'll get an update from the United boss today, but here's the latest on the injury front as we know it >>>",
      "Ruben Amorim believes Sir Jim Ratcliffe's public backing of him has \"helped\" Manchester United.",
      "Amorim has won three Premier League matches on the spin. United won against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton and have moved up to sixth position in the table.",
      "Following the Sunderland win, Ratcliffe told The Business podcast: \"He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "Read what Amorim said here >>>",
      "Amorim will be speaking to the media at 1pm today and we can bring you everything he has said at 1.30pm.",

      "Lisandro Martinez is currently the only other sidelined player and hopefully there will be some good news on his recovery from an ACL injury.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live blog of Amroim's pre-Forest press conference.",
      "United have been beaten on their last two league trips to the City Ground but this weekend's hosts are struggling this season and United will fancy their chances.",
      "Amorim will give team news and any injury updates this afternoon, so stick with us for updates throughout."

      "The Argentine winger, who secured a £40 million move to Stamford Bridge last summer, has battled to dispel doubts surrounding his mentality. His departure from Old Trafford was far from amicable, with Garnacho publicly hitting out after Ruben Amorim dropped him for the Europa League final, essentially burning bridges with the club.",
      "Tensions had been escalating for months. During United's 2-1 victory over Viktoria Plzen in December, Garnacho seemed to ignore his manager's directions, looking away before entering the field.",

      "Discussing the 21-year-old's temperament, which has seen him frozen out of Argentina's squad since last November, former international Oscar Ruggeri told ESPN: \"He's no better than anyone else, you're a football player, enjoy it, but you shouldn't be so full of yourself.",

Stiller is one of the names on the list, but not the only one as Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba and more players are also being followed, so we can’t consider Stiller as the only option available at all.",

In that case, negotiations could take place for a fee around €50m or €60m (£44m or £53m), but it is very difficult to imagine a transfer in January. It is way more likely in the summer.",

Last season, Bruno Fernandes was typically United's attacking set piece deliverer, with fellow right-footer Christian Eriksen also having his fair share in a more limited amount of minutes. Amad, a left-footer, took the third most in the United squad.",

      "Jason Wilcox has promised Manchester United will make further investment to challenge for major honours.",
      "United signed Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in the summer transfer window, committing to an outlay of £215million (excluding add-ons).",
      "Ruben Amorim was under pressure after a poor start to the campaign, but United have won three games on the bounce in the Premier League and the summer arrivals have been crucial.",
      "Cunha scored his first goal for the club against Brighton and Mbeumo scored a brace. Sesko is gradually finding his feet, scoring twice so far for the club, while Lammens has made a significant impact since his debut.",
      "The mood at Carrington has been boosted by United's impressive form throughout October.",
      "Director of football Wilcox spoke to MUTV about the season so far. Wilcox praised United's summer additions and promised further investment to secure major honours.",
      "He said: “The guys have settled in really, really quickly. I think especially when you look at Matheus [Cunha] and Bryan [Mbeumo], they have played in the Premier League and they have lived in England, so there is a quicker transition.",
      "\"I think for Benji [Sesko] and Senne [Lammens], you look at their transition and they have transitioned really well. We are really pleased. They are two young players, two for the future, but they have settled in amazingly well.",
      "\"They are all good guys, even from last summer's window, they are top professionals, top players and we are really optimistic we are going in the right direction. We have a clear plan.",
      "\"I am sure there are going to be bumps in the road but we have just got to make sure we stay calm irrespective of the noise outside. I see the intensity, I am at training every day, I see the way that they train, the way they apply themselves, the way they communicate and get on with each other. Like I say, when you lose football matches you are always going to be a little bit disappointed and especially at this club.”",
      "Wilcox continued: \"Obviously we have plugged in with some really talented players, you know, they create and score goals. But when you score goals it is not just about the front guys.",
      "\"It is the way that we build up, the idea, the way that Ruben works with the players every day on the idea and how to create chances. When we look at the amount of chances we are creating, we are now just starting to convert but we have got to keep it going.",
      "\"We've won three games in a row but we've got to make it four. The only way we are going to get this club back to the top is by driving standards. The players and Ruben are certainly doing that on a daily basis.”",
      "Wilcox outlined the plan for the future, adding: “We have got a clear plan. We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad. We have got to buy the right players.",
      "\"The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team. We are really happy with where we are.",
      "\"We know we have got to improve and, you know, the players, they will never be satisfied, Ruben will never be happy, I will never be happy, it is just how we are built.",
      "\"We are always looking to improve. Anybody who works at Manchester United should be thinking the same and they do, with the standards we are driving every day.”",
      "In September, Wilcox spoke at an event at Old Trafford for former players, discussing his challenging start to working at United. \"I didn't realise how big this club was, even though I've competed against this club as a player and as a coach. This club is a wonderful club,\" he said.",
      "“I just pray we get the opportunity to turn it around. I really feel it's not 'will we win again', I think it's 'when will we win again'. It's going to take time and it's not a quick fix, especially now with the regulations.",
      "\"We needed to change the playing squad. We've made some really good additions this summer. Sometimes taking players out of the squad is as important as the players you bring in.\"",

      "Levante's Karl Etta Eyong is reportedly set to spark a transfer battle between Manchester United and Manchester City. The Cameroonian striker has even been likened to Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski due to his impressive performances in La Liga.",
      "Indeed, it seems there isn't a major European club that isn't keeping tabs on Etta Eyong given his current form. The 22-year-old has already netted six goals in La Liga this season, second only to Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe on 11.",
      "This has put several top-tier clubs on high alert, with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Arsenal also rumoured to be interested. According to Mundo Deportivo, the young star is keen to secure his future sooner rather than later.",
      "Barcelona are reportedly increasing their interest in the youngster, viewing him as a potential replacement for Lewandowski themselves. The Polish legend has had a successful stint in Catalonia but is 37 and in the final year of his contract, with his future uncertain despite Barcelona having the option to extend his stay by another year.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United already bolstered their attacking options over the summer, while City don't have much need for a new striker themselves. United signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig in August, while Pep Guardiola looks likely to keep Erling Haaland, who has a contract until 2034, as his frontman for years to come.",
      "Etta Eyong could present an opportunity that's too good to pass up, however. Mundo Deportivo reports the player has a buyout clause in his contract worth roughly £26.5million for La Liga clubs, while Premier League teams would have to fork out around £35m.",
      "That's not a bad return for Levante considering they only spent around £4m purchasing him from Villarreal in the summer. Approximately £2.5m of that went to the Yellow Submarine, while previous club Cadiz - who are due a percentage of his sell-on fee - received about £1.5m.",
      "Etta Eyong cannot represent a third club this season after already playing for both Villarreal and Levante. He had a quick start to the campaign under Marcelino and made a direct goal contribution in each of Villarreal's first three league games before moving to the Valencia-based team.",
      "His performances have continued to impress, bringing his total in La Liga this term to six goals and three assists overall. To put those figures into perspective, Mbappe is the only player in Spain's top flight with more direct goal contributions this season.",
      "According to Mundo Deportivo, the player would like to transfer to a new club in January before being loaned back to Levante. Not only that, but it's understood his preference is to join Barcelona, whose colours he has been seen wearing in the past.",
      "It's hard to imagine either United or City swooping for the player this winter. As well as having Sesko on the books, United also need to resolve the future of Rasmus Hojlund, who is impressing on loan at Napoli but may return to Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "Their loss could be another club's gain if they act quickly to snap up a star who is making a big impact in Spain. And Barcelona might already have a head start in the race to sign Lewandowski's natural successor.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "On deadline day, Senne Lammens joined United and after the window closed, the Reds took advantage of Turkey's extended market to allow Onana to leave on loan. The deal with Trabzonspor is a straight loan switch with no option to buy, but the goalkeeper has impressed his new club.",
      "He has not lost a game since his debut against Fenerbahce and has kept two clean sheets in his last three appearances. In an interview with Sporx this week, Onana spoke confidentally about his style of play and attitude towards being a goalkeeper.",

      "Manchester United's preparations for the weekend game against Nottingham Forest are already underway.",
      "United made it three wins on the spin on Saturday as they beat Brighton and Hove Albion 4-2 at Old Trafford. The players who were unused substitutes against the Seagulls or played limited minutes at the weekend took part in Sunday's training session, as did a number of academy players who were called up to boost the numbers.",
      "The club have released a short video of the training session and MEN Sport picked out three key points from the workout.",
      "Before Brighton, Amorim confirmed that Mason Mount was a doubt for the fixture, which instantly caused concern given his track record with injuries.",
      "He managed to be fit enough for a place on the bench but was not risked against the Seagulls. He took part in Sunday's training session and looked to be moving freely as he aims to regain his place in the team on Saturday.",
      "As the current back-up goalkeeper, Altay Bayindir was involved in the session along with Tom Heaton. The Turkish goalkeeper took part in a small-sided game with the outfield players.",
      "While United have looked to be more direct with Senne Lammens in goal, being able to play out from the back is still a big part of modern-day football, and Bayindir is clearly keen to get the practice in with his feet.",
      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in the session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",
      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "Filling is reported to be valued at around €3million (£2.6million) and could leave AIK in the New Year if an agreement is reached with United.",
      "The teenager has already made 10 appearances for the AIK first-team this season, despite being 16 years old, and has three goals to his name as a centre forward, including two in the Allsvenskan in Sweden.",
      "It remains to be seen if United will be able to sign Filling when the January transfer window opens, and which clubs from the Bundesliga are also said to be interested.",
      "The next opportunity for Filling to feature for AIK will be on Sunday against Elfsborg in the Allsvenskan.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is enjoying a career revival at Barcelona.",
      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",
      "United and Rashford will always be linked but that chapter is now closed.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt urged his Manchester United teammates to cut out mistakes and take responsibility when he spoke after the disappointing Brentford defeat in September.",
      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo won’t be going to the World Cup with England if he stays stuck on the fringes under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The 20-year-old hasn’t started a single Premier League match this season and was an unused substitute in United’s opening two fixtures. As far as his World Cup prospects go, it’s not looking good.",
      "He’s far from alone. A number of Premier League players are in the same position — too good to be warming the bench, or too talented to be stuck at struggling clubs — with West Ham’s Lucas Paqueta among those who might need a change of scenery in January.",
      "Here’s our Premier League XI of World Cup hopefuls who could really use a move in the winter transfer window.",
      "The goalkeeping situation in the Turkish national team is uncertain, but one thing’s for sure: the only way Bayindir plays for Manchester United before January is if Senne Lammens gets injured or suspended.",
      "His last Turkey appearance — that disastrous afternoon against Portugal at Euro 2024 — did him no favours, but Vincenzo Montella continues to call him up. It’s now between Bayindir and Galatasaray’s Ugurcan Cakir for the gloves next summer, with Mert Gunok surely out of the picture after being dropped by Besiktas boss Sergen Yalcin.",
      "After a season spent rotting on the Old Trafford bench, there’s little chance Bayindir gets called up, and no chance he starts for Turkey at the World Cup.",
      "",
      "Malo Gusto’s chances of making Didier Deschamps’ World Cup squad look slim, but a January move could change that.",
      "Staying at Chelsea might work out given Reece James’ injury record, but Gusto has struggled when given minutes — poor against Nottingham Forest when pushed into midfield, before picking up a needless red card.",
      "He was in the most recent France squad and while Jules Kounde is nailed on, the back-up role behind the Barcelona right-back is there for the taking.",
      "",
      "It’s early days for Bornauw at Leeds, but zero Premier League minutes so far is hardly encouraging.",
      "The four-cap Belgian international hasn’t featured for his country in over a year, and there’s little chance he returns to the fold while sitting on the bench at Elland Road.",
      "",
      "Nathan Ake has just one Premier League start this season amid fierce competition for places in Pep Guardiola’s backline.",
      "There’s also fierce competition for spots in Ronald Koeman’s Netherlands squad, with Virgil van Dijk, Jurrien Timber, Jan Paul van Hecke, Micky van de Ven and Stefan de Vrij all in the mix.",
      "We’re not sure where Ake could go, but one start from nine games isn’t nearly enough for a player of his calibre.",
      "",
      "Morocco reached the semi-finals in 2022 and look ready to go deep again, having cruised through World Cup qualifying.",
      "In a squad boasting Noussair Mazraoui, Youssef En-Nesyri and Brahim Diaz, Aznou has been absent since November 2024, and with zero appearances for Everton this season, a recall looks unlikely.",
      "",
      "Napoli have been linked with Mainoo again, and his minutes under Ruben Amorim aren’t improving.",
      "The 10-cap England international was a breakout star under Gareth Southgate during the run to the Euro 2024 final, but his form dipped badly in United’s dire 2024/25 campaign. Now, his World Cup place under Thomas Tuchel is in jeopardy.",
      "If playing time doesn’t improve, Mainoo has no chance of going to North America. A move to Napoli could reignite his career. Scott McTominay’s success in Serie A should be all the proof he needs that Italy might just be the place to be.",
      "",
      "Not a playing-time issue this one, Paqueta reportedly wants out of West Ham, whose start to the season has been nothing short of dreadful. They are currently 19th in the league table with four points.",
      "He was linked with an exit in the summer, but nothing materialised, and his goal celebration in West Ham’s only league win at Nottingham Forest was supposed to end speculation. His next one, if it ever comes, should probably involve him searching for a phone to answer a call from elsewhere rather than throwing it away.",
      "Brazil’s squad depth means Paqueta needs to be playing, and thriving, to earn a spot. Unless West Ham dramatically improve or he moves, he’s not going to the World Cup.",
      "",
      "Gomes is in a similar situation to Paqueta — too good to be stuck in a relegation fight.",
      "He’s made 10 appearances for Brazil but only played 45 minutes for his country this year, and was an unused substitute in recent friendlies against South Korea and Japan. Wolves’ awful form hasn’t yet killed his chances, but if they finish bottom, which looks likely, Gomes can forget about the World Cup.",
      "",
      "Starts have been scarce for Malen since joining Villa from Borussia Dortmund, and even a match-winning brace against Burnley on October 5 didn’t earn him back-to-back league starts.",
      "Villa’s attacking depth isn’t especially strong, so selling him in January feels unlikely — but if Koeman makes it clear he’s out of the Netherlands picture, player power could come into play.",
      "",
      "Like Malen, Chiesa is part of a squad lacking attacking depth, which makes a January exit tricky. But also like Malen, he needs minutes to make the World Cup.",
      "After being left out of Arne Slot’s Champions League squad, he’s yet to start a Premier League game, though he did score on matchday one against Bournemouth and nearly rescued a point at Crystal Palace.",
      "A return to Italy makes perfect sense, for his club career and his international ambitions.",
      "",
      "For variety’s sake, Solanke edges out Joshua Zirkzee and Niclas Fullkrug here.",
      "Reports suggest Thomas Frank doesn’t rate Spurs’ former club-record signing, and his injury problems aren’t helping. Even when fit, he faces competition from Richarlison, Mathys Tel and Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "Where he could go is anyone’s guess — but if he wants even a remote chance of making England’s World Cup squad, Solanke needs to find somewhere new.",

      "For most of the window, Man Utd focused on overhauling their attack as they invested heavily as one of the biggest spenders in Europe to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also landed Senne Lammens to replace Andre Onana as the club’s No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "United reportedly had a limited budget at the start of the summer, though they raised funds through sanctioning several notable exits that were finalised on their terms. Permanent deals or future fees via loans with buy clauses were secured as they offloaded Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",

      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, leaving Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner and Nuno Espirito Santo in clear and present danger of losing his second job of the season, and title-winning Arne Slot a genuine contender as the Liverpool crisis deepens further.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",

He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",

But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",

Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",

      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",

      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland sees awkward questions resurfacing, though, ahead of what feels a particularly significant trip to Spurs at the weekend.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of last season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has just engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "With Forest and Spurs up next there is real scope for this to become a decent little run. That lad off the internet might even be able to get his hair cut in a couple of weeks. Amorim, meanwhile, knows ‘a couple of weeks’ is no longer the amount of time he possibly has left in the job. Everybody’s happy.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re approaching a quarter of the way through this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s trio managed.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth ahead of an upcoming run that includes a resurgent Manchester United, Liverpool and a six-pointer against Leeds means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eases the stress significantly.",
      "",
      "Fulham have hit a serious rough patch just as Silva was starting to be talked about for other jobs. Might be coincidence, might not, but the timing wasn’t great. A last-gasp defeat at Newcastle means it’s now four straight defeats, which is only keeping the Cottagers clear of the bottom three because those three teams are all currently just unspeakably awful.",
      "Still feels very much to us like Fulham and Silva are both better with each other than without, and would advise against anything hasty. Does need some points from somewhere soon, though. The good news? Wolves next.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis has reached full-blown levels, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "It’s now six defeats in the last seven games, and five straight losses in domestic competition. Slot and Liverpool simply have to pull out of this tailspin soon, or something truly extraordinary really could happen here to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season. And there is nothing obviously helpful on the immediate horizon with Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Man City to come before an interlull Slot genuinely yet ludicrously might not survive.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, we do already start to wonder whether he’s the answer to any of those problems. He absolutely could be sacked twice by Christmas, with defeat at Leeds leaving West Ham already four points adrift of safety.",
      "",
      "It is the history of the Wolves. They absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Brighton for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Purchase alcohol for some youths?",
      "But defeat to Burnley in a rollercoaster six-pointer leaves things looking bleak indeed for Pereira.",

      "Okay, someone asked for some considered opinions, and, as we’re a quarter of the way through*, here goes…",
      "*Quiet at the back!",
      "Arsenal – can’t criticise them for not winning it (note, not ‘bottling’) and then criticise them for trying to win it however they so desire. Will they even concede another goal?! I think they finally do win it, and people still complain. Hey Stewie!",
      "Bournemouth – selling that vast majority of their defence seems like a bold strategy that’s paying off. They’re pretty good at finding players, aren’t they?! Will fade a little, but I think a European spot may beckon.",
      "Spurs – Hang on!?! How are they 3rd? Fair play. Does the away from crack before the home form improves? They will finish 7th. Does Solanke have a chant to The Police’s ‘So Lonely’?",
      "Sunderland – Uh, have you not got the ‘please relegate yourself imposter’ memo? Xhaka the signing that’s made the biggest impact thus far. Will stay up comfortably. Possibly half way to the tally they need to do so. Hearing Isidor’s name always makes me want to watch Lord of the Rings. I know, I know, it’s Isildur.",
      "Man City – They’re just not quite them, are they. Their ‘title challenge’ will see them 4/5 points off all the way through.",
      "Man Utd – No jokes here. Definite strides being made. It just feels like that fragility (and an Amorim meltdown) could return at any time still. At the moment.",
      "Liverpool – Was a curious summer with some seemingly unnecessary signings. More bumps in the road to come (early CL exit) before steadying improvement post Jan. Won it last year, so it could be Wirtz.",
      "Aston Villa – The greasy breakfast seems to have finally allowed the hangover to be shaken off. Tielemans can’t come back soon enough. Win the Europa League and nothing else matters. Won’t do in Spurs style if they do, however.",
      "Chelsea – Champs League games (where they actually have to play a decent XI) taking a toll? I can see up and down season in store. Really though, I just don’t care either way. Which is a weird thing to say. Is Maresca the distinctly average one?",
      "Crystal Palace – Rightly lauded and yet somehow still sit 10th. It’s a skill really. Could see another cup win. Excellent fans.",
      "Brentford – Oh, Keith. Keith, Keith, Keith… Just stop it! Take your first management job from a fella who’d been there a while and was loved, lose your best forward players, and don’t give a shit. Excellent work you likeable so-and-so.",
      "Newcastle – It feels fine, and sort of is. But is it? Will report back later.",
      "Brighton – Same as it ever was. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Cause the big boys trouble, look average elsewhere.",
      "Everton – A shiny stadium and a fun Jack Grealish. Just enjoy it all. No danger whatsoever.",
      "Leeds – Home form will dictate everything, and they will need 25+ points from their home games.",
      "Burnley – See above. Winning at Wolves doesn’t count.",
      "Fulham – Maybe try going to back to the mid table obscurity thing. This doesn’t look great. Will beat Arsenal at the Emirates just to get everyone jittery.",
      "Forest – The admiration and good graces of fans of other teams thrown away in the space of a few months. Almost impressive. I don’t like saying it, but I don’t think I’d be upset to see them relegated.**",
      "West Ham – ‘I’m addicted to you, don’t you know that I’m Toxic’. It looks bleak. Very bleak. Get out Jarrod. Get out! Villa Park is nice.",
      "Wolves – Not sure the ‘be crap to start with, sack the manager, and improve no end’ bit is going to work this season. They finish in 20th despite an excellent challenge from above.",

      "",
      "It is the responsibility of both teams to try and win a match. If one club goes to another, and sits all its men behind the ball, has no ambition to do anything other than defend and hope to get a counter, I would say the poor quality of the match and the football itself, is not the fault of the team trying to win the match, but the one trying desperately hard not to lose it.",
      "In this tortuous analogy, Arsenal are the team who actually want to win their matches, and their opponents are the ones desperate not to lose.",
      "So you can be upset that Arsenal score goals from set pieces and that might be ruining the ‘quality’ of the league, but at least we want to try and win. Considering our opponents average an xG against us of 0.8 per game, it tells me they aren’t even trying to score, whereas ours is 1.6 in comparison.",
      "Your craven clubs, with the hundreds of millions spent by them, are still too scared and lack the ambition to even want to try and win. So get mad at your own clubs and players for ruining the league. As an Arsenal fan, I love 1-nil results. I was raised on them. Bould at the near post flick on to someone in the middle. It was beautiful that George Graham was at the ground to witness our 1-nil against Palace (who are an excellent team).",

      "Suddenly, corners and set pieces are a widespread problem. I wonder why? The Arsenal freaks on Twitter are thankfully doing the Lord’s Work and pulling up tweets from official accounts of United or Liverpool or whoever, who are actually ‘bragging’ about their set piece specialists from once upon a time, while genuinely intelligent people such as Jon MacKenzie are asking if we should implement rule changes!! Wtf are we doing here honestly?",
      "Someone has also found a video of Jamie Carragher praising Chelsea’s ability to turn set pieces into goals about six years ago, while he and Freddie Ljungberg laugh together about how Arsene Wenger neglected the coaching of these scenarios in training, and that was probably a bit of a mistake. Quite funny, in hindsight.",
      "Honestly, you couldn’t make up what you’re seeing right now on the cesspit platform. All of this is the TLDR way of saying: Jamo, we are not bragging about anything. We are not yet in November and we’ve been burnt thrice in a row by one thing or another (our fault or otherwise), so you are clearly either looking in the wrong place or completely making it up.",

      "In an attempt to move on from the hyperbolic headlines, here is my attempt at diagnosing the problems and potential solutions to the poor run of form at Liverpool.",
      "Problems:",
      "Evolution from 433: Clearly this years’ signings marked an evolutionary move from Liverpool’s long serving 433 formation. Slot admitted that the signings were intended to give us more flexibility in the way we lined up against teams. Wirtz a clear number 10 means we were at times moving away from Klopp’s 6 and two 8s and Slot’s two 6s and an 8. It is also a clear move away from a team which gets its running and physicality from 3 midfielders with creativity provided by the full backs and the attackers. MacAllister and Wirtz are a long way from Hendo and Gini. Wirtz is most like Coutinho who didn’t fit within the 433 and had to leave. Buying Wirtz for 9 figures means we are moving away from 433 which will naturally unsettle some players who have played it for years. I see the logic in having someone like Wirtz to unlock the low block which Liverpool often face.",
      "The combined signing of Isak and Wirtz suggest a possible move away from 3 up front or certainly configuring the 3 differently. Is Slot’s ultimate long term vision 2 upfront, Wirtz at the tip of a diamond midfield behind, with Frimpong and Kerkez providing the width and legs?",
      "Leaking goals: Whether it’s the change in the formation, change in players or just poor form. Liverpool have leaked goals particularly of late.",
      "Missing Trent: I hope the long-time critics of TAA can see the error of their ways. Defensively Trent was never as bad as people alleged and Liverpool have not locked down the right hand side of the defence since he left. Issues on the right were never Trent being ‘the worst defender’ in the world. They were chiefly the result of Salah not tracking back and neither Milner or Henderson being replaced to fill in the gap.",
      "There is a Trent shaped hole in this team from an attacking perspective. It lacks creativity from deep and the ability to turn defence into attack with one quick pass",
      "Salah out of form: No one misses Trent more than Salah whose form has dipped noticeably. No one expected last year again but he has been poor. He has not found the right chemistry with teammates on the right. The lack of a consistent ball over the top (Trent!) means he is easier to mark. Putting Wirtz into midfield means there is one less person to do his running leaving us badly exposed to pace on the opposition left (Semenya, Eze, Mbuemo etc…). If I zoom out, I think in the absence of Trent, Salah is more likely to drift infield to an inside right position which I think is really where Wirtz would like to play. Really what we are seeing is the painful transition from a Salah led offense to a Wirtz led offence. It is now a question of how soon this happens.",
      "Big names, small performances: New signings have not settled. Isak in a red shirt is still miles from Isak in a Newcastle shirt. Frimpong is supposed to bring pace on the right to provide an overlap for Wirtz and others creating from midfield. He has had a shaky start and doesn’t seem to be a defensive upgrade from Trent. Wirtz has not looked like the best player in Germany and doesn’t seem to know where he should play. He looks for time he’s not going to get in the PL. Most disappointing for me has been Kerkez who isn’t adapting to a new league and should have been an immediate improvement on the left. He has been physically weak and reckless in tackles.",
      "MacAllister has been poor in every aspect of the game from tackling to passing and has rightly been dropped for Jones. Konate had a shocking start to the season and there is a risk his head has been turned. Salah, see above.",
      "Missing Allison: The new keeper does not look like the best young keeper in the world. He’s been nervous coming and dealing with crosses and dived too soon twice for Brentford goals. It was tough watching Kelleher for Brentford on Saturday. When you miss Allison you miss a keeper who makes saves he shouldn’t and is lethal in one on ones.",
      "Brass tax, Liverpool have conceded 7 in GM’s 3 PL games vs. 7 in Allison’s 6 PL games.",
      "Look at the 3 games and the goals conceded and ask would Allison save it? Mbuemo definitely, Caicaido he could have and the Brentford goals he would certainly have done better.",
      "Solutions:",
      "Sort the defence first. It applies to Sunday league and premier league alike. You cannot win games conceding too many goals. We need to get a defence sorted. For me that means putting Gomez at RB and Robbo at LB. Play a flat back 4. If the game requires it, start Endo at the base of MF until RG is fit again. This also means getting midfielders and wingers to put in a shift to cover the defence.",
      "Continue everyone is droppable: Salah and MacAllister have rightly been dropped for playing badly. This needs to be the case. Chiesa and Jones deserve their chances and if they don’t get them now then they have to leave the club. Past performances and big transfer fees shouldn’t guarantee a player a spot either.

This should always have been the case but it’s easier to have the big transfer injured than dropped. Jones and RG being out means playing an offensive midfield 3 of Macallister, DS and Wirtz which makes the solid 4 at the back even more important. Hopefully this will see MacAllister and Salah settle and find their form but if that doesn’t happen Chiesa and Endo should be put in.\nPL from DL",

      "James Outram: I completely get why you (or Pool fans in general) would feel aggrieved. My response is that VVD and McAllister conspired together to be absolute balls and the ball immediately went into a dangerous area leading to a goal. Two things here. It was a Liverpool player who made that howler; if it was Mbeumo who did it then 150% stop play but it seems like something rife for gaming the system if play gets stopped because teammates run into each other and someone goes down holding their head. Ed more than welcome to tell me if I’m talking bollocks",
      "With regards to the stitches, having worked at sea for 10+ years, I’ve had (cumulatively) 7 staples and 12 stitches in my head over three separate occasions, it’s nothing more than an elaborate boo boo that McAllister definitely made the most of and considering there was no actual concussion test or anything that I saw, in hindsight, I think the ref got it right.",
      "Ryan, Bermuda: All salient points made, well done that man – and decent PS from Ed. Which leads me on to one of my bugbears in football. A defender can often come sliding through, absolutely clattering a striker after they have had a shot without any censure because of some weird logic that they’ve already had a shot without any consideration to the fact that an uncontrolled ~100kgs of defender sliding at the striker across the turf at 20km/h, may have in fact, put the striker off.",
      "Essentially, if the defender tackles late enough, he can put the striker off and foul him without any punishment. It is truly baffling and Ryan certainly is Me when I scratch my head at some of the rules, the opaqueness of their application and disaster refereeing. I know we have more chance of Maggie rising from her grave to vote for the Green Party, but I do think we should all, as Prem fans, start making more noise for the rules, VAR and refereeing to be MUCH MORE professionally applied to the Prem.",

There seems to be an allure of big personalities, hungry for glory, loving the limelight , as if that alone will rub off on the team and make them successful. Managers celebrated for their drive and self-assurance when things go well (well, at least the managers do a great job of selling that vision.)

      "As promised we’re revisiting this ranking of the 20 biggest summer signings having last judged just three games into the season.",
      "“We’re all thoroughly looking forward to the prospect of Alexander Isak being the flop of all flops,” we wrote at the time, as the striker wasn’t included at that stage having not yet made an appearance for Liverpool. But joy of joys, he has now.",
      "Nick Woltemade, Eberechi Eze, Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho also make it this time, but the wait goes on for Yoane Wissa to make up the full 20.",
      "We’ve included their previous position in brackets.",
      "All of his personal gripes with Newcastle and their ‘broken promises’ considered, along with the injustice surrounding the imbalance of power between clubs and players with regard to contracts, we can’t help but feel quite pleased he’s not gone to Liverpool and continued to bang goals in for fun, particularly given the consistently trotted-out reason for his struggles being his lack of fitness, which is entirely his own fault.",
      "READ: Top 10 things that make no f***ing sense as Premier League enters its chaos era",
      "He’s playing like someone who’s always trying to make up for mistakes he hasn’t made yet, but then duly does make because of that desperation to impress. He doesn’t know where to be or what to do so tries to be everywhere and do everything, and is therefore usually nowhere, doing nothing.",
      "We all nodded in agreement with Dave Tickner’s sage assertion that while Elanga might not be worth £55m to any other team he is to Newcastle because of their excellence in transition on the counter-attack, but are now very much distancing ourselves from that fool of a journalist/man. No goals, just one assist and now spending most of his time watching Jacob Murphy from the bench.",
      "",
      "Still feels nailed on to be the next talented forward Chelsea can’t be arsed to develop before flipping for profit, or at least for no great loss within the next two years. He’s started just two Premier League games as Alejandro Garnacho is now Enzo Maresca’s preferred choice on the left, but did impress in the 5-1 win over Ajax in the Champions League.",
      "The German media claimed after another so-so performance from Wirtz in his national team’s victory over Northern Ireland that the poor lad ‘has forgotten his joy’, and that feels like a very accurate assessment of his Liverpool career to date.",
      "It’s impossible to know how big a problem he is in a sea of problems for Arne Slot, but he was never a solution.",
      "Wirtz was signed as a generational talent the Liverpool chiefs rightly or wrongly – it evidently looks more like the latter right now – believed they couldn’t miss out on, rather than a player they needed having walked to the title with a brilliant, fully-functioning midfield last season.",
      "READ: Liverpool screwed Marc Guehi transfer in biggest Premier League regret of the season",
      "The jury’s out and frankly we don’t expect them back in session for the rest of the season. He was good against Liverpool, then terrible against Nottingham Forest before being hooked at half-time, and got his first goal for Chelsea against Sunderland but did f*** all besides. A predictably frustrating season awaits.",
      "Thomas Frank cruelly compared the Netherlands international to Florian Wirtz when asked about his struggle to adapt to life in the Premier League, and Simons has indeed looked similarly short of whatever that thing is required to succeed in the English top flight, looking overawed by the pace and physicality of the football, which tends to be happening around rather than through him.",
      "It’s a huge frustration for all non-Arsenal fans that although their striker not scoring goals remains a valid stick to beat them with, they now couldn’t give two sh*ts about it, as is the case with them only scoring goals from set-pieces.",
      "If anything, Gyokeres drawing blanks and Declan Rice corners and free-kicks being their only weapon has become something many of them genuinely hope continues indefinitely, such is the balling of fists it engenders in their rivals. If they get to a point where they don’t bristle when the rest of us call out their manager for being an arrogant pr*ck they will be indestructible.",
      "READ: Arteta, Gyokeres among eight reasons why Arsenal won’t win the Premier League title this season",
      "He did himself no favours by stepping up 10th in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town having put a stoppage-time chance over the bar from roughly four yards out to ensure the game went that far, but fair f***s to him for not crumbling after that inauspicious introduction to life as a Premier League footballer.",
      "",
      "Given we may never have been more invested in an Arsenal player doing well we briefly wondered whether the #NOTOMADUEKE petition was actually signed by a bunch of genius Gunners seeking support from the masses for one of their big summer signings.",
      "We gave our heads a wobble and reverted to our previous opinion of them as a bunch of unthinkable tw*ts lacking any sort of human decency, which will allow us to continue to enjoy Madueke’s performances after he returns from injury.",
      "",
      "Who needs Kevin De Bruyne? Oh, we do. One excellent performance against Wolves has been followed by not a lot else from Reijnders, who’s shown glimpses of his quality, but nothing like what we expected after that opening-day clinic.",
      "",
      "Feels harsh to bump down this list after a significant uptick in his impact on games against Liverpool and then Brighton, but if we’re to tar all Manchester United forwards with the brush Roy Keane has used to claim Mason Mount is underserving of a place in Ruben Amorim’s team then Cunha really needs to improve on his output after one (wonderful) goal and no assists in nine appearances for the Red Devils.",
      "Ekitike said what all players must when asked about competition for places on the back of Alexander Isak’s deadline-day arrival from Newcastle, insisting he’s looking forward to the challenge rather than frankly a bit f***ed off that he could do nothing to avoid his inevitable ousting from the starting XI in favour of his rival for the No.9 position.",
      "He will still be wondering just how terrible Isak will have to be when he returns from injury to not be included ahead of him, because apparently six goals and an assist in 700 minutes of football wasn’t worthy of that place ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "",
      "He got two goals and three assists in his opening four Premier League games to provide genuine hope that Chelsea may have found a fully-formed striker to lead their attack, and although that hope has faded as he’s not got a sausage since, that’s more down to a realisation that he’s far more accomplished as a second striker.",
      "Whether that’s something Maresca can accommodate when Liam Delap and Cole Palmer return from injury remains to be seen, but Chelsea look a far better team when the Brazilian’s playing in that slightly more withdrawn role than as the furthest man forward.",
      "Martin Odegaard’s injury has seen Eze revert to his typical No.10 position and lo and behold, when playing in the role he’s made his name in, he’s thriving.",
      "His first Arsenal goal, the winner against his former club, was really special and he joins a growing list of Gunners players making it very difficult to hate them as a whole.",
      "",
      "Manchester United have needed more Brunos and Mbeumo is chief among them. He’s now got five goals and an assist, and looks to have bucked a very long trend in being a high-quality footballer who arrives at Old Trafford and continues being that very same high-quality footballer.",
      "We would count Zubimendi in that same list of admirable, good guys in the Arsenal ranks with Eze and as suckers for low stress, technically brilliant defensive midfielders we suspect we will be swooning over the Spaniard for a long time yet.",
      "As Arteta pointed out recently, while so many others struggle to come to terms with the pace and power of the Premier League, his transition has been seamless. Just a hugely impressive footballer.",
      "We will forever have a soft spot for footballers who don’t look as though they should be good at football. Combine that with him being the cause of great mirth for naysayers in the summer having joined for a fee way above his market value as Newcastle’s fourth or fifth-choice striker and him having to replace £125m defector Isak and we’ve got a veritable jambalaya of joy at seeing Big Nick hit the ground running at St James’ Park.",
      "",
      "Suspicions that those questioning Kudus’ price tag after a very ordinary output of five goals and three assists last season were missing the obvious ‘but he was playing for West Ham’ caveat have been confirmed through his displays for Spurs.",
      "He looks a threat every time he gets on the ball, aiming to beat his man whenever possible rather than recycling the ball as far too many wingers are prone to see as priority one these days. He’s undoubtedly the player Spurs fans are paying to watch in what are otherwise stolid performances producing very good results.",

      "When asked earlier this month whether Greenwood can become one of the world’s elite if he keeps up his current form, Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi replied: “It’s true that Mason can do more, not just in terms of goals scored because in that area he doesn’t need to do better.",
      "“He’s already a top player in front of goal, but he can become one of the best players in the world, because he has the ability.",

      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",
      "The Red Devils made a poor start to the new season, with just two wins from their first six games, and there were concerns that Man Utd were heading for a similar finish to last campaign, where they ended up 15th in the Premier League.",
      "However, victories over Sunderland and Liverpool saw them win back-to-back matches for the first time since Amorim joined, while another win over Brighton on Saturday made it three in a row.",
      "Amorim had stubbornly refused to move away from his preferred formation and tactics earlier in the season and it now seems to be paying off.",
      "However, Ferdinand reckons Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” by being so inflexible about the way he wants his team to play.",
      "READ: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel: “I admire it to a certain extent. But, like I said, I think he is playing Russian Roulette with his job. I don’t think he’s changed drastically, he’s just tweaked.",
      "“That’s what a lot of fans were asking for. Just tweak what you’ve got. Maybe don’t be so much on the front foot, maybe be a bit more conservative at times when we haven’t got the ball.",
      "“You can’t press, press, press for 90 minutes, unless you’re an absolute beast of a team. PSG do it. This manager couldn’t do that with this squad.",
      "“That’s just sometimes how the cookie crumbles. We might look back in six months and, say Man United finish in the Champions League or something like that, he’ll probably sit there confidently and go, ‘Well, if I did change, I probably would be out of a job because I have been doing things that are alien to me’.”",
      "Gary Neville insists he was “a little worried” that Amorim had lost the belief of the players a few weeks ago but now believes the Man Utd head coach has survived the “month of reckoning” at Old Trafford.",
      "“But one thing that’s been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people around the club is that they really like him as a person, and that does count for a lot.

      "“We’ll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after – there’s still a big job to do in the next month. But I felt it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week against Liverpool it could have gone a different way but it feels very different, it feels like the momentum is with them a little bit and the spirit is good.”",

      "That has seen Zirkzee, who only scored three Premier League goals last term, drop down the pecking order at Old Trafford with Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim yet to start him in a game in any competition this season.",
      "Amorim raised eyebrows amongst the Man Utd hierarchy when he publicly insisted that Mainoo would be fighting for his place in the starting XI with captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "That led to the England international, who is yet to start a Premier League match this term, attempting to get a loan move before the summer transfer deadline before being convinced to stay by Jason Wilcox.",

      "Romano said: “For sure, the situation will be assessed again in the next months. At the moment, Kobbie is not creating any problem. Training at his best, trying his best for Man Utd. But he’s still not a regular starter. Kobbie wants to play, that’s not changed since August.",
      "“In August, Man Utd said no, you stay here, no chance even for a loan. Kobbie only wanted a loan, never a permanent transfer. In January, we will see, because it’s still October.",

      "Romano has also had an update on Zirkzee too over the last week, he said: “And then, guys, I wanted to mention something also on the situation of Manchester United because today we had rumours coming from England about Joshua Zirkzee asking officially the club to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "“I want to clarify something about that, guys, because I was talking about Zirkzee here on the channel a few days ago and then I told you, as of today, today is day 23 of October, Joshua Zirkzee hasn’t asked Manchester United to leave the club.”",
      "But The Sun now claims that Man Utd are ‘prepared to block requests from their players to leave in the January transfer window amid an expectant squad shortage’.",

      "And now Spanish website Fichajes insists that Liverpool are ‘considering submitting a bid of around €60m (£52m)’ and Atletico Madrid ‘must decide whether to keep him or accept a market-shaking offer’.",

      "While Harry Maguire’s revival has been built on moments, Casemiro has plugged away to make a mockery of the criticism from Liverpool-leaning pundits and Man Utd’s actual owner…",
      "When it was written that Manchester United’s refusal to buy a midfielder in the summer offered a chance to one of their current engine room operatives to step up, we were right. We just picked the wrong one.",
      "And when it was said that Ruben Amorim’s players, in their bid to make United credible again, have the template to follow in one of their renaissance men, we were also right. Again, though, we may have fingered the wrong fella.",
      "Amorim believes that shining example is coming not from Harry Maguire, but a star similarly maligned. “The other guys need to look at Casemiro,” said the boss after the Brazilian presented more evidence to suggest that he is once again one of United’s most important players.",
      "Look at the difference between United pre and post Casemiro’s withdrawal against Brighton. With the veteran midfielder, Amorim’s men were in control against a side more used to winning at Old Trafford than United of late. At 3-0 up with three-quarters of the game gone, Amorim thought it wise to give the Brazil star a break for the last 20-plus minutes.",
      "It is not often Amorim has been in such a privileged position so we can forgive him for fumbling this particular decision. Because removing Casemiro might have allowed the 33-year-old a breather, but it also breathed new life into Brighton, who had significantly less trouble playing around and through a midfield of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It is not necessarily their fault. We are learning that Fernandes can play deeper as long as he has Casemiro to hold his hand. Mainoo has only partnered Casemiro for a half or longer once in the last 11 months since United beat Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "Regardless, the contrast with and without Casemiro was stark enough to recognise the importance of the Brazilian. But if you prefer to trust numbers over your eyes, here you go…",
      "Man United with Casemiro on the pitch: 3 goals conceded",
      "Man United without Casemiro on the pitch: 16 goals conceded",
      "Impact. pic.twitter.com/byjTwd7WbU",
      "As comebacks go, Casemiro’s is certainly up there with Harry Maguire’s. In the context of Jamie Carragher’s criticism, it might rival Jesus Christ’s.",
      "“There was a saying I always remember as a footballer, ‘leave the football before the football leaves you’. The football has left him at this top level he needs to call it a day at this level of football and move”.",
      "Carragher went in two-footed on Casemiro 18 months ago, back in May 2024 after a calamitous display at centre-back, but the pundit was certainly no lone voice, even if his tone prompted more than the odd wince.",
      "No question, Casemiro’s second season at Old Trafford was poor. He told Ed Woodward that he would ‘fix’ United when he signed from Real Madrid and his first year suggested he was serious. What happened, though, in the summer of 2023, perhaps one day we’ll find out, because Casemiro returned for season two hungover or haunted from his lay-off. Possibly both.",
      "By any measure or metric, his form plummeted and the serial winner, as one of the Premier League’s highest-paid players, became one of the poster boys for United’s decade-long decline.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe even namechecked Casemiro in March – not for the first time – when discussing players recruited in the past who were ‘overpaid’ and ‘not good enough’ for Manchester United.",
      "Being bunched with Antony, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana must have been a humbling experience for Casemiro, a five-time Champions League winner. Indeed, his performances suggest he took it personally. Unlike some targets for criticism at Old Trafford in recent years, and others who were on the fringes in the early days of Amorim’s reign, Casemiro focused his energy on proving his doubters wrong and himself worthy of his wage.",
      "As Amorim got his feet under the table and assessed which characters he could trust, Casemiro’s role became more prominent. He played a major role in taking United to Bilbao for the Europa League final, but while fattening himself up for the summer market, in Ratcliffe’s eyes at least, he also became one of his manager’s most-trusted lieutenants. When those in the United boardroom would have piggy-backed him to anywhere they might find a club who would take his salary off their books, Amorim was reluctant to lose an ally.",
      "It benefits Casemiro that United have a shamefully light schedule this season. Even so, Amorim is at pains to rest him when he thinks he can get away with it.",
      "MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n🔴 Amorim ecstatic to be proved wrong by one player after incredible Manchester United first\n⚪ Ferdinand slams Carragher over ‘disrespect’ of Man Utd star \n⚫ Gary Neville reveals next ‘big job’ for Ruben Amorim after his ‘best week’ at Man Utd",
      "Casemiro has started all but two of the games for which he has been available – the two missed: a derby humping and Grimsby-gate – and is now one of the first names on Amorim’s team-sheet, a fact all the more remarkable in the wake of the manager’s admission on Saturday.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby Collyer,” who is currently struggling for starts at West Brom. “But he fought and he worked, and now he’s back in the national team. He’s so important for us.”",
      "No doubt it helps that Amorim has now got Casemiro surrounded by team-mates willing to run and carry out the manager’s game plan. The front three, especially Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha, can be trusted to fill the holes at the top of United’s midfield, and the centre-backs appear to be learning how and when to step in around Casemiro and Fernandes to make a trio when required.",
      "Such a framework, woefully absent for much of Casemiro’s career at Old Trafford, facilitates the kind of performance that saw Casemiro outshine Carlos Baleba, the £100million man the Red Devils were supposedly so keen on. It is said that they now have ‘serious doubts’ about him, but the hunt for a midfielder will become considerably more urgent next summer when Casemiro’s contract is up.",
      "Of course, United would only trigger the option they have to extend Casemiro’s massive contract for another year over Ratcliffe’s cold, dead body. Should he go free, then he might follow Carragher’s advice to ‘go to the MLS or Saudi’, taking ‘the football’ and a restored reputation with him.",
      "Kyle Walker forced Pep Guardiola into doing something he never had as a boss with a decision he ‘didn’t like’, but Burnley are better for his ‘selfish’ call.",

      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has promised investment in the \"right\" signings in order to realise the club's long-term vision.",
      "United have hit a groove of positivity, having won three league games on the bounce for the first time since boss Ruben Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their evident attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the Man Utd website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
      "United's summer transfer window is likely to be an important one given the fact that some members of the squad are approaching the final six months of their current deals, such as Casemiro and Harry Maguire. United had looked at possible options in the middle last summer but had prioritised other positions, especially up front. However, potential outgoings present an opportunity to strengthen in the middle of the park.",

      "By Danyal Khan and Rob Dorsett",
      "Thursday 30 October 2025 09:23, UK",
      "Manchester United bosses are quietly satisfied with their progress after securing three straight wins for the first time in 18 months - but know there is still much to do before the men's team can compete regularly at the top of the table.",
      "The team's recent run of impressive results has not been met with overt celebrations in the executive offices at the Carrington training ground. Rather, it has reassured the club hierarchy that the tough decisions taken are starting to have an impact on the pitch and strengthened their resolve to continue with the long-term plan.",
      "Ruben Amorim has targeted a place in Europe for next season, and certainly chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox would be satisfied with a top-six finish. As Amorim continues to develop his squad, no one at the club is getting too high when the team are on a positive run, or too low when results are disappointing.",
      "Crucially, while there is abundant noise outside Old Trafford calling for some heavy investment in the squad in January, among the executives there is a determination to stick to the plan. United are not expected to spend big in the New Year.",
      "A new defensive midfield player is the priority to strengthen the squad, after last summer's focus on attacking areas. But because a No 6 is likely to mean a significant level of investment - with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba all under consideration - it is much more likely to be addressed in the summer, as part of a broader review of the squad and the overall wage bill.",
      "The strategy was successful in the summer in terms of reducing a bloated and expensive squad, moving on many of the big-earning players who weren't part of Amorim's plans. But there is also an awareness that the futures of a number of Manchester United's highest-profile players are still up in the air.",
      "However determined Marcus Rashford is to pursue his career away from Manchester, he still has two-and-a-half years remaining on his United contract. Harry Maguire and Casemiro are both out of contract in the summer, and so any decision to let either move on would free up a significant chunk in the squad salary budget. Rasmus Hojlund's substantive move to Napoli is only guaranteed should Antonio Conte's side make the Champions League.",
      "All of those considerations will impact what incoming transfer business United can do, but there is a determination to avoid some of the recruitment mistakes of the past, which saw too many big names on big salaries sitting in the big Old Trafford stands.",
      "The summer focus on strengthening the attack seems to be paying dividends. Manchester United's xG has actually been lower over the last three matches compared to the first six games of the season - but the statistics make it clear United are being much more clinical in front of goal, with a very impressive 20 per cent of their shots producing goals this month, compared to just 7.4 per cent previously.",
      "The style of play has been tweaked, too, with United going more direct. Over the last three matches, they've averaged less than 44 per cent possession compared with over 53 per cent for the rest of the season. And with Senne Lammens between the posts, he has kicked long for almost 85 per cent of the time, compared to 43 per cent and 56 per cent under Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, respectively.",
      "United had no plans to change goalkeeper in the summer, despite their long-term interest in Lammens. But Onana's dip in form, and Jadon Sancho's wages being removed from the overall bill, meant a deal could be done for the 23-year-old.",
      "The stats suggest he has made a difference on the pitch. A 78.6 per cent save rate is more than 11 per cent better than Onana's, and more than 25 per cent ahead of Bayindir.",
      "It is also significant that the focus on Amorim's chosen formation of three central defenders has waned.",
      "But there have been signs in the last few games that the Portuguese coach has adopted a more flexible approach to his team structure. Even though Manchester United line up with three at the back, that sometimes becomes a four when they are defending, with one or both of the wing-backs dropping deeper.",
      "An increasingly positive mood is becoming obvious to those inside Carrington. After the defeat to Brentford last month, it would have been characteristic of the recent United past for stories to start leaking out about certain players being unhappy, or others losing faith in the head coach. There were no such stories this time, which suggests there is greater unity in the squad than has been seen for a while, and a widespread buy-in to the coaching methods.",
      "United's bosses know they are still in the early stages of their revolution. And they expect some rocky roads ahead as they search for stability and, ultimately, silverware.",
      "But, for the time being at least, all is quiet at Carrington, as the club's power brokers feel things are moving in the right direction.",

      "Analysing some of the biggest talking points from the latest round of Premier League matches, including a new wave of set-piece creativity, Man City's lack of identity and Man Utd's recent momentum after three wins on the spin",
      "Monday 27 October 2025 14:28, UK",
      "Before Super Sunday, Everton were the only team yet to concede from a set-piece in the Premier League. Given the prolificacy of set-piece goals this season that fact is impressive. What followed in a 3-0 defeat to Thomas Frank's Tottenham, though, was Micky van de Ven tucking away twice from corners.",
      "It would seem no team is immune to the set-piece phenomenon sweeping through the league.",
      "This is not a radically new idea. And it's a matter of personal preference as to whether this development is having a positive or negative effect on entertainment value. Fashion isn't always about aesthetics. Sometimes it's about practicality. If the best wearing pair of jeans only look good on the hanger, then really they serve no purpose at all.",
      "Nineteen per cent of all English top-flight goals this season have come via corners (45/241), the highest proportion ever in a Premier League campaign. Arsenal are the masters of this art. Gabriel is so effective, in fact, Jamie Carragher has called him the \"most influential player in the league\" right now.",
      "It's true that Mikel Arteta has got his team delivering machine-like efficiency. Arsenal have scored 11 goals via set-pieces this season, two more than any other side (Chelsea are second on nine). 69 per cent of goals scored in 2025/26, in fact, have come via set-pieces (11/16). Arteta's squad has been assembled with physicality and power purposefully to operate in such a way. But they are not the only ones.",
      "Brentford have made the long throw their party piece, scoring eight times via that method since the season began. Michael Kayode catapults the ball into the mixer and asks a team-mate to make first contact. That bit is fundamental. And then it's about who reacts quickest. At the weekend it was Dango Ouattara to spark a 3-2 victory over reigning champions Liverpool. Every side are susceptible to this type of threat if it's choreographed well enough.",
      "If only Tony Pulis' Stoke side were alive and kicking to relish in this era.",
      "Romanticists might call this evolution boring, but it's actually initiating a levelling out of the league. Bournemouth, who have used set-piece threat to good effect five times this season, are second in the table. Spurs, boasting the same success rate from dead-ball situations, are third.",
      "Frank has long been an advocate of the benefits of set-piece ability because it offers realistic marginal gains. It's a product of dedicated training ground practice. When pass-heavy football was all the rage it was less transferable because far fewer players, often costing huge sums, have the specialist talent to play that way. They were ring-fenced for the top clubs.",
      "The formula is equally true of both ends of the table. Those teams who concede from set-pieces most regularly - Nottingham Forest and West Ham, both 10 - are 18th and 19th respectively. There is little point in resisting or ignoring the shift. \"If you're not doing it, you look like a bit of a dinosaur as a coach,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Super Sunday.",
      "This new, or perhaps just elevated, manuscript is here to stay. And if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.",
      "When Manchester City were the Premier League's most potent emerging force in the early 2010s, before Pep Guardiola, managers at the very top of the game criticised City's lack of clear identity. Carlo Ancelotti, when at Chelsea, once said City had \"skill and ability\" but were \"not a team\".",
      "Not once has that ever been said of a side under Guardiola's charge - not in any part of Europe. Not at Barcelona, not at Bayern Munich and never previously at Manchester City - until now. The scars from last year's well-documented meltdown are having a lasting effect on Pep's newly-shaped squad. And it's unclear exactly what they stand for.",
      "City's most recent defeat to Aston Villa - their third of the season - was indicative of a side caught between the style change that has glorified set-pieces over pretty passing patterns. Pep has publicly professed to want to embrace what he calls \"modern football\" but a lot of the ideas go against the fibres of what made him so famously successful at every club he's managed. He was the ultimate philosophy coach.",
      "Gary Neville has been critical of this recent erosion. \"Man City aren't even good to watch any more,\" he said on this week's podcast. \"They look like they can be beat in any game of football. The play is like a hybrid between direct, old Pep in terms of passing, a bit scruffy - I'm not quite sure what it is.\"",
      "This period of flux is evidently difficult to control for a perfectionist manager. Guardiola is not going to be enlisting the long throw any time soon. City are actually the only Premier League side yet to score from a set-piece this season, which gives an indication of just how seriously, or not, Pep has welcomed these new rules of engagement.",
      "Their latest downfall was engineered by a brilliantly worked Matty Cash strike, and it came from a corner.",
      "It was City's first loss since August, and just the second time they've failed to score all season, but their repeated predictability has meant falling short far more times than is necessary to seriously challenge for the Premier League crown.",
      "Guardiola blamed \"the last action\", needing \"to shoot better or to cross better,\" but really it was a lack of ideas that cost. And if City aren't strangulating teams in possession like they once were - keeping the ball in such a methodical way that opposition sides got fed up of chasing - then what exactly are they doing?",
      "Being more direct with fast wingers is ok if you have got the physicality to cope when play breaks down and City without the lesser-seen Rodri, arguably, do not. They won just 42 per cent of ground duels at Villa Park. Not for the first time, Unai Emery got his tactical setup spot on.",
      "Back to the drawing board for Pep, then. City need a new plan B.",
      "In case you didn't hear over the weekend, and you would have to live under a rock not to, Manchester United have won three consecutive Premier League games in the same season for the first time since February 2024. Ruben Amorim is nothing if not persistent, and his will has finally been rewarded.",
      "As he himself noted in the press room at Old Trafford after making a comfortable win over Brighton look difficult, though, a sense of \"suffering\" seems to surround Man Utd before any positive outcome is reached.",
      "Only they can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. How can a performance so assured coincide with one so fraught with nervousness? Perhaps we will never know. This seems to be Amorim's brand and for now it's working.",
      "What is clear and admirable about this version of Man Utd, which is all the more tangible when you watch from the terraces of Old Trafford, is how devoted the players are to the manager's cause. \"The players really like Amorim,\" Neville said over the weekend. \"He's authentic and honest. The players want to do well for him.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes in a sacrificial midfield role, Amad at wing-back, and Luke Shaw's willingness to slot into a back three are all evidence of the buy-in. The stars of this latest triumph, however, were undoubtedly Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - recruited to fit a style that is starting to show promise.",
      "While Pep's might be lost in the post, Amorim has got the modern football memo. This is not a side who are going to dazzle with intricate build-up, but can clearly sustain threat with fast, direct play that puts Cunha and Mbeumo at the heart of each attacking phase.",
      "Cunha's opener was also evidence of his maverick quality, which is helpful too. Since the start of last season no player has scored more times from outside the box than him (seven).",
      "\"We feel like we can solve anything,\" Amorim said with a smile on Saturday, later revealing he enjoyed the performance against Brighton better than beating Liverpool the week prior. \"It was more complete,\" he added. Some semblance of coherence is certainly building but Amorim was right to caveat his excitement with realism. He cannot afford to get complacent.",
      "Trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in consecutive weeks will stress-test just how much progress has really been made."
