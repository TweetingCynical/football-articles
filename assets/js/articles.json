      "Manchester United are expected to be busy ahead of next week's transfer deadline and Hannibal Mejbri could be the latest player to depart Old Trafford amid interest from the Championship",
      "Burnley want Manchester United ’s Hannibal Mejbri to replace Fulham -bound Sander Berge.",
      "Fulham have agreed to pay £20million, rising to £25m, for Norway midfielder Berge, having previously targeted United midfielder Scott McTominay - but they were unable to reach an agreement. Now the Clarets are targeting Mejbri as Berge’s replacement.",
      "Mejbri, 21, played in United’s win at Turf Moor last September and is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford, having entered the final year of his contract. United would prefer a cash deal for the Tunisia midfielder, who made just six appearances during an all-fated loan spell at Sevilla.",
      "Burnley are also signing Chelsea centre-back Bashir Humphreys, who enjoyed a successful loan spell at Swansea last season.",
      "Humphreys has had his medical at Burnley and the 21-year-old will strengthen their defensive options with Republic of Ireland international Dara O’Shea being targeted by Wolves and Brentford.",
      "Wolves want O’Shea to replace Max Kilman, who has joined West Ham for £40million, and the Clarets want £15million for him after paying his £7million release clause at West Brom last summer. Brentford are also keen and Burnley are determined he will only leave if their asking price is met.",
      "United, meanwhile, also remain in the hunt for Paris St Germain’s Uruguay midfielder Manuel Ugarte. They will not pay PSG ’s £51million asking price for Ugarte and the French club may lower their demands as the end of the window looms into view.",
      "Ugarte, 23, was not involved in PSG’s opening night win at Le Havre on Friday and the South American is keen to come to Old Trafford. United boss Erik ten Hag wants a midfielder to sit beside Kobbie Mainoo in the holding role and the club have been pursuing Ugarte for weeks.",
      "United are focused on Ugarte after seeing other targets Youssouf Fofana join AC Milan and Berge move to Fulham. They could offer PSG a loan to buy deal, although it is understood they would prefer a straight cash deal.",
      "United do not need to offload anyone to finance Ugarte’s move, although Napoli remain keen on Scotland midfielder McTominay.",
      "However no deal is imminent despite days of talks between United and the Serie A side.",

      "Manchester United have spent huge sums since hiring Erik ten Hag but the Dutchman believes much more in needed before they can become the team he pictured when he arrived",
      "Manchester United have spent £530million in the transfer market since Erik ten Hag became manager - yet according to the Dutchman himself they are only half-way through the rebuild he envisioned when he arrived at Old Trafford.",
      "When Ten Hag assessed the squad he inherited in the summer of 2022, he estimated it would take him six transfer windows to address the weaknesses he found.",
      "Two years on, and the United boss feels his timetable has had to be redrawn after seeing his plans thwarted by the Premier League ’s Profit and Sustainability Rules and his own failure to secure vital revenue through Champions League qualification.",
      "Despite investing heavily each summer, United's finances have meant the club has not spent a single penny in either of the winter transfer windows of Ten Hag’s reign.",
      "As Ten Hag himself revealed during a summer interview: “United were in a situation where there were a lot of long contracts - and that made it complicated to thoroughly refresh and strengthen the team. When we started, my thought was that in roughly six transfer windows it would be solvable.",
      "“Formally, we have now had four transfer periods, but because of the Financial Fair Play restrictions we have we have only been able to actually do business in two periods.”",
      "Ten Hag has since returned to Old Trafford after being given a vote of confidence by club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to see £115million spent on Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Noussar Mazraoui. The club are also in the market for a new central midfielder.",
      "Frankie de Jong has been Ten Hag’s prime target for the last three summers, but with Barcelona preferring to get Ilkay Gundogan off the wage bill rather than cashing in on the Dutchman, the focus has moved onto Paris St Germain’s Uruguayan international Manuel Ugarte.",
      "PSG will have to slash their £50million asking price on the 23-year-old to make the deal happen - although there are suggestions in France that a loan-now-pay-later alternative is now on the table.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada, Director of football Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox agree with the manager’s assessment that Brazilian veteran Casemiro and teenager Kobbie Mainoo cannot be expected to cope with the demands of a campaign that will see United compete in the Europa League without reinforcements.",
      "United spent over £200million on signing Antony, Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez and Tyrell Malacia when Ten Hag first arrived. Only Martinez, when fit, has proved to be a success. That same summer they raised less than £20million on sales - although they did save on the wages of the departing Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Edinson Cavani and Jesse Lingered.",
      "When Ten Hag asked the board for a new striker at the turn of the year, he had to be satisfied with seeing Burnley flop Wout Weghorst arrive on loan alongside Marcel Sabitzer and keeper Martin Dubrovka. Twelve months later, there wasn’t even any money left in the pot to secure any loan deals after a summer which saw another £172million lavished on Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount, Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "Almost £50million was recouped in departures - and a similar amount has been raised this summer by selling Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Mason Greenwood, Willy Kambwala and Alvaro Fernandez.",
      "Scott McTominay is also likely to depart, but attempts to find buyers for Jadon Sancho, Antony and Victor Lindelöf have not been successful. It means United’s net spend under Ten Hag is hovering around the £400million mark - with no fewer than 13 members of his current squad having been signed by the Dutchman.",
      "Ten Hag said: “When everyone’s fit, we already have a good team and achieve a high level. But we also know, in depth we need more players. There are more games this season, more intense games, no winter break, a January that’s very condensed. You need squad depth. It’s about survival of the fittest.”",

      "Jadon Sancho has returned to Manchester United but could still depart this summer with those at Old Trafford conscious that Chelsea could make a play for the winger",
      "Manchester United officials sense that Chelsea could still make a play for Jadon Sancho before deadline day.",
      "The winger has returned to Old Trafford after his loan spell at Borussia Dortmund, which came about after a public fallout with manager Erik ten Hag. The pair have since settled their differences and Sancho has returned to the first-team picture this term.",
      "There is talk of him leaving though with PSG having a summer-long interest in the player who moved to Manchester for £70million back in 2021. Saudi Arabian clubs too have been touted as possible buyers but Chelsea also remain an interested party.",
      "The Athletic reports that those at Old Trafford believe a late play from the Blues could be on the cards as they continue to throw money at their squad. Despite adding Pedro Neto and Joao Felix about to join the Chelsea bosses could still move for Sancho.",
      "The Englishman has underwhelmed throughout his time back in the Premier League. Back in his first spell at Dortmund he was one of Europe's most productive players, but he's scored just 12 goals across his 83 appearances in all competitions whilst at the Manchester outfit.",
      "United are willing to accept a major loss on Sancho with a £40m price tag place on the winger, whose demise in recent years has cost him his England spot. Recently Chelsea and the Red Devils did business when Mason Mount left west London and moved north.",
      "Sancho was included in the Community Shield at Wembley, missing a penalty as Manchester City claimed the trophy. However he was left out of the Premier League opener against Fulham with Ten Hag claiming the winger missed out due to illness.",
      "He said: \"First of all we need squad depth it is a season of survival of the fittest Jadon in the week had an ear infection and wasn’t 100 per cent fit. He could play but we preferred other players. That will change in season when we need to rotate. Sometimes it is frustrating for the player. But every player will get his chance.\"",
      "United are still open to selling a number of their first-team stars. Scott McTominay is among those who they will listen to offers for with Victor Lindelof also potentially making his way to the exit door. Casemiro's future has been under the spotlight, although he's featured in the opening games of the season.",

      "Bayern Munich's Leon Goretzka was once a target for Manchester United, and while the loyal midfielder turned down any notion of the move - that could now be about to change",
      "Former Manchester United target Leon Goretzka appears to be back on the market after being axed from Bayern Munich's squad.",
      "Bayern got their season underway with a 4-0 win over Ulm in the first round of the DFB-Pokal last Friday, but boss Vincent Kompany left out the decorated Germany star from their matchday squad. The Belgian boss opted to keep his cards close to his chest regarding the midfielder's future, saying: \"As a club, we always want to be clear with the players, that is the reality. We do that internally within our family. We don't need to say anything publicly.\"",
      "However, according to Fabrizio Romano, it will be made clear to Goretzka that he will not be a regular starter under Kompany this season, potentially forcing him to look elsewhere for first-team football.",
      "With two years left on his contract in Germany, the 29-year-old faces competition for a place in central midfield from the likes of Joshua Kimmich, Joao Palhinha, Konrad Laimer, Aleksandar Pavlovic and Raphael Guerreiro. While there has been no reported interest from United in Goretzka as yet, that could change with the club in the market for a player of his profile to compliment Kobbie Mainoo in midfield.",
      "What's more, United have toyed with the idea of signing him in the past. The Red Devils made plans to sign Goretzka in 2021 as he struggled to agree new contract terms at Bayern - with his old deal due to run out in 12 months at that point. It was claimed at the time that United had handed the German star a 'concrete offer' to give him what he wanted in terms of a pay rise.",
      "However, Goretzka extended his contract at Bayern in the September of 2021, securing his place in the squad until 2026. He spoke at the time of the extension and shared his joy at staying in Germany, adding: \"We’ve won everything there is to win over the past three years. But what would be even better than winning titles is confirming and repeating these successes. We want to build on this in the coming years.\"",
      "Last year, Goretzka was again linked with a move to Old Trafford and quickly talked down any rumours of him leaving Bayern, telling Sky Germany: \"No. I love the club, I love the city, I love the fans.\"",
      "This led Ten Hag to sign Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount in a £54.7 million move, as well as securing Sofyan Ambrabat's signature on loan from Fiorentina for £7.6m. Erik ten Hag has again expressed his interest in signing another holding midfielder, with targets including PSG star Manuel Ugarte, Monaco's Youssof Fofana and Burnley's Sander Berge.",
      "It was reported that United are planning to wait until the final day of the transfer window to try and sign Ugarte, as they refuse to pay PSG's asking price of over £50m. Fofana has closed off any chance of a move to Manchester by signing for AC Milan in a £21.3m deal, while Berge is on the verge of a move to Fulham after the Cottagers accepted a £25million bid for the former Sheffield United man.",
      "With Scott McTominay's future also still uncertain, it could lead United back to Goretzka, who would seem to be available following his recent omission from Bayern's squad.",

Aston Villa would be attractive given their Champions League campaign ahead, and Palace could also get in on the defender merry-go-round.",
      "Sancho wasn’t involved in Manchester United ’s opener against Fulham on Friday and looks set for another loan deal, or if United get their way, a sale.",
      "United have spent more than £155m on four new stars this window and could do with balancing the books after backing Erik ten Hag on and off the pitch. It is unlikely his fall out with Ten Hag will be smoothed over.",
      "Another big asset left out of United’s squad for the first game. It is time for the Scotland international to move on and become a leading light at a mid-table club.",
      "Talks with Fulham have been revived, while there is a question mark over whether Everton could afford his £30m price tag.",
      "The England right back has a year left on his Toon contract. He’s just been made vice-captain at Newcastle but was not in their starting XI against Southampton, with Tino Livramento ahead of him.",
      "Trippier had to turn out for the Uunder 21 team on Monday night for fitness work. Time for a move? Boss Eddie Howe wants to keep him, and all of his squad, but there could be pressure from above to cash in for £10m. 'Tripps' is a huge player for United, but a three or four year deal elsewhere, possibly abroad, would surely be tempting.",

      "Manchester United remain active in the summer transfer market with 10 days left until the window slams shut, but they now need the help of Premier League rivals Fulham",
      "Fulham have hijacked Manchester United's move for Sander Berge, but the Cottagers could still help their Premier League rivals to land Manuel Ugarte.",
      "United had appeared to move on from the Uruguyan midfielder after talks with PSG stalled. One of their targets was thought to be Berge, with Burnley willing to sell the Norwegian following their relegation.",
      "But Fulham have stolen a march on the Red Devils and are closing in on a £25million deal for the 26-year-old. The Cottagers have money to spend after selling Joao Palhinha to Bayern Munich for £47.4m.",
      "With money still remaining in their warchest, there have been suggestions that they could reignite their interest in Scott McTominay. The Scot is a prime candidate to leave Old Trafford this summer having been relegated to the role of squad player last season.",
      "According to The Athletic, United's focus for the final two weeks of the window is on outgoings and talks have stepped up over McTominay's exit. While Napoli are one of the interested suitors, Fulham have also been eyeing a move.",
      "United are seeking a fee in the region of £25m for the 27-year-old and have already rejected several offers from the Cottagers below that fee. Despite signing Berge, Fulham could still return for McTominay.",
      "There is an expectation that a decision on a move will be left until late in the window, which closes at 11pm on 30 August. Fulham boss Marco Silva has warned his side still have a lot of work to do to rebuild their squad following several key exits.",
      "“We lost four starters [in the transfer window. We are probably the only team in the Premier League that lost four starters. We have to rebuild again. There is a lot of work for us to do over the next two weeks to rebuild,\" he told Match of the Day after the defeat to United last Friday.",
      "“But we are very pleased with how the players have worked. We are working hard to get what we need. When the game becomes open we should have kept the balance and kept compact. But in those moments we lost emotional control and that allowed them to score.",
      "“The game was open and broken – we tried to rush our decisions. Many times we started to lose the ball too quickly. We let the game go too emotional and we didn’t want that. Frustration with the result for us. Big frustration for our players and fans, for sure.\"",
      "If some of that work involved signing McTominay, it may allow United to find a breakthrough for Ugarte. The Red Devils have been in negotiations with PSG for the midfielder for some time and would have the money to match the French side's valuation if McTominay moved on.",
      "Ugarte has been Erik ten Hag's top target for central midfield all summer, with PSG willing to allow him to leave after just one season at the Parc des Princes. PSG are seeking a fee of £51m for the 23-year-old.",

      "Mohamed Salah and William Saliba both set records as Liverpool and Arsenal recorded opening weekend wins with Jamie Vardy making his presence known on his return to the Premier League",
      "The Premier League returned with the opening weekend spanning four days as several big hitters staked their claims.",
      "Manchester United's win over Fulham on Friday night, owing to a late winner from Joshua Zirkzee, proved that old habits die hard before Liverpool welcomed Ipswich back to the top flight. Mohamed Salah came up with his customary strike on the opening day as Arne Slot was introduced to the Premier League.",
      "Newcastle and Aston Villa are looking to prove that them breaking into the establishment in the past couple of seasons is not a flash in the pan with both ambitious outfits claiming victory.",
      "Arsenal got their campaign off to the best possible start with a win over Wolves before they saw Manchester City respond 24 hours later in true champion style. Missing some of their key cogs - Rodri among them - they made light work of Chelsea as they embark on their latest bid for glory.",
      "Tottenham concluded the weekend as they were forced to settle for a point at Leicester, when nearly all of their rivals picked up three. Here are the takeaways from the opening weekend.",
      "United left several of their new signings on the bench for their opening clash against Fulham. Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt were introduced late on and - with the game meandering towards a goalless draw - the club's new Dutch forward came up with the winning goal.",
      "Despite all the talk of change in Manchester the Red Devils themselves certainly didn't look a new and improved outfit. Fulham had their chances but, in front of the new INEOS hierarchy, it was the win that was most crucial on Friday night and Zirkzee's neat touch from Alejandro Garnacho's cross provided it.",
      "When the Egyptian scored for Liverpool in a 3-3 draw with Watford on the opening weekend in 2017 few could've foreseen the goal machine he would become. Even less likely was the prospect of Salah scoring on the opening day almost every time he took to the pitch for the Reds.",
      "He netted their second in the 2-0 success over Ipswich and, in doing so, scored for the opening weekend for the ninth time, setting another Premier League record, with the only time he failed to score in a season opener coming at Chelsea last season when he assisted Luis Diaz and had a goal ruled out for a marginal offside. There has been talk of the frontman leaving sooner rather than later with his contract winding down, but he continues to offer reminders of just how integral he is.",
      "The Frenchman has transformed the Gunners' back four and his inclusion in the first-team has coincided with their rapid rise under Mikel Arteta. When Saliba plays Arsenal are a notably better team and his absence is often telling. He picked up another clean sheet against Wolves and also a slice of history.",
      "Saliba went into the clash on Saturday having won 49 games as an Arsenal player, with victory seeing him hit half a century of wins quicker than any Gunners player in the Premier League. It was a record previously held by Nacho Monreal, but Saliba has now replaced him on the list.",
      "Fabian Hürzeler wasn't even born when the Premier League began. Sean Dyche in contrast has proved himself to be a shrewd Premier League operator and had his Everton side playing at home against new look Brighton.",
      "The result therefore, a 3-0 success for the visitors, proved that Hürzeler's infancy will be no hinderance for the Seagulls this term. Brighton looked as good as they did under Roberto De Zerbi, playing with their own new style after a summer in which they may have acquired yet more quality that has gone under the radar - Yankuba Minteh among them.",
      "A team who have three efforts on goal beat a team who had 19. That was the story of the day at St James' Park as newly promoted Southampton couldn't find a way past the dogged Newcastle defence, spurred on after they'd seen one of their own sent off.",
      "Tempers flared and Fabian Schar paid the price when he clashed with Ben Brereton Diaz, leading to a straight red. It left the Magpies with an uphill battle as more than an hour of the contest remained but they were clinical in a way the Saints simply weren't. A misplaced pass allowed Alexander Isak to provide the assist for match winner Joelinton.",
      "Denied by an 86th minute equaliser, but Nottingham Forest were good value for much of their clash with Bournemouth. They looked on course for victory, which would've been the ideal start given some have quietly tipped the City Ground outfit for the drop.",
      "One thing - or two - that will certainly help their cause is the quality of their wingers. Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga - two men once tipped for solid careers at Chelsea and Manchester United respectively - now find themselves rebuilding their careers in Nottingham and are poised to be looked upon to deliver time and time again this term.",
      "Their stunning end to the season has some believing Crystal Palace could upset the European party, but defeat to Brentford on the opening weekend wasn't the ideal start. Less than ideal was the refereeing blunder committed by Sam Barrott - who later owned his mistake.",
      "He blew up before Eberechi Eze's smart free-kick hit the back of the net, meaning VAR couldn't intervene. The foul the ref thinks he saw was certainly debatable and may well have been overturned if those at Stockley Park had a chance to take a look - but we'll never know. Let's hope its not the start of things to come with officials too often a talking point last term.",
      "The clash at the London Stadium was one team with European ambitions against a team who have fulfilled them. Go back a year or two and Aston Villa will have themselves where West Ham currently are - beginning a journey by landing a quality Spanish manager and backing him in the transfer market.",
      "Villa though proved that they certainly are further along in their own story as they left London with three points - which are likely to age well with West Ham poised to improve as the year goes on. Unai Emery will have been thrilled to see his £50m signing Amadou Onana bag himself a debut goal.",
      "Much was made of City's record minus their Spanish star last term. In the four matches he was absent they lost three with Pep Guardiola simply having no one capable of filling the void left by the man who many have tipped to win the Ballon d'Or. He only returned to training last week and thus was left out for the win at Chelsea.",
      "A former Blue in Mateo Kovacic stepped in and helped City dominate against the lavishly assembled midfield at Stamford Bridge. The Croatian would score the visitors' second after Erling Haaland began his hopes of a third Golden Boot with yet another strike as the quest for five titles in a row begins.",
      "He's been one of the Premier League's most divisive figures for the best part of a decade. The Leicester City frontman engages with fans - for better or worse - like few others and his parting gift to the travelling Tottenham faithful was to deny them three points and remind them of their trophy drought.",
      "Vardy's header cancelled out Pedro Porro's opener before the veteran frontman was withdrawn as he wrestles with an injury issue. Before walking off he pointed to the Premier League badge on his shirt, citing his own success in 2016, before reminding Tottenham they are yet to match his feat.",

      "Gary Neville has become one of the UK's leading sports broadcasters during his time with Sky Sports - but it wasn't always positive feedback for the former Manchester United captain",
      "Gary Neville is one of the UK's most respected pundits – but one of his old-team-mates wasn't particularly impressed with his start to life on Sky Sports.",
      "The former United captain is now in his 13th year as a sports broadcaster, having joined Sky Sports at the beginning of the 2011/12 season. He has become one of the country's brightest football analysts in that time, forming a great relationship with Jamie Carragher and presenter Dave Jones.",
      "But his first forays into TV were far from the finished article, with old Manchester United team-mate Nicky Butt even claiming Neville was \"s***\" in his early days on Monday Night Football. Butt was once very critical of Neville's debut on Sky Sports, as he was seen looking pretty shaky while speaking to former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini.",
      "In his debut on MNF in 2011, Neville stuttered over his words, leaving Butt unimpressed by his performance. The 49-year-old told The Athletic in 2021 that he wasn't enamoured with Neville's debut, but admitted that his old team-mate went on to prove him wrong in time. He said: \"As a manager, you’ll have tough times and get cr*p off the press. I know that – and I’m fine with the media.",
      "\"I wasn’t when I started in my first interviews – or my first managerial speeches, but you learn. I remember seeing Nev on Sky Sports at first and he was s***, and I told him. Now he’s the best, by a mile. And you have to be prepared for questions – journalists have a job to do too.\"",
      "Neville has continued to impress since his initial start and now sets the standard punditry. He began his 14th year on Monday Night Football last night (Monday, August 18) as Tottenham Hotspur began their Premier League season against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium.",
      "Since 2011, Neville has won the Sports Pundit award at the 2014, 2015 and 2022 Royal Television Society (RTS) awards. MNF also won the best Sports Programme honour at the 2016 RTS awards, and the Television Show of the Year prize at the 2024 Sports Journalists' Association Awards, which showcases the popularity of the programme.",
      "Neville has gained traction for his detailed insight on the game, as well as his rivalry with Carragher. He is considered one of - if not, the best - football pundit, but he was once of the same opinion as Butt about his TV appearances.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "The 49-year-old looked back on his punditry career with Sky Sports' Off Script and told them he actually had \"huge doubts about taking on the prestigious job. He said: \"People were very doubtful about 'Mr. Manchester United' being able to come on to Sky Sports and be neutral and be fair to all the other different teams that I've obviously disliked over the years... There was a wave of opinion and doubt against me.",
      "\"They sent one of the MNF analysis screens to my house about three weeks before the start of the season and I had a couple of weeks with it. But I had huge doubts and didn't really want to do it.\"",

As ever, the duo did not agree on much, with Neville backing Arsenal to pip Manchester City to the title, while Carragher is convinced City’s domination will continue.",
      "But it was when it came to discussing their former clubs that things got particularly interesting, with their predictions mirroring each other. While Carragher said Liverpool would finish third, two places ahead of United in fifth, Neville went for the exact opposite – and when it came to explaining why, the former United defender struggled to justify himself.",
      "Asked by Dave Jones which areas of the United team were superior to Liverpool’s, Neville took a long pause and then replied: “Ermmm, I wouldn’t say they were superior in respects of a particular area. I think Liverpool have got a better team than Manchester United. Liverpool have got far better forwards, that is the thing that they do have.",
      "“I think in midfield, if I look at Manchester United’s midfield players, if you add equal coaches – and we don’t know what Erik ten Hag and Arne Slot are going to match up like – I do think Liverpool, with [Wataru] Endo, [Dominik] Szoboszlai and [Alexis] Mac Allister, they’ve done unbelievably well to get the performance levels out of those three that they have with Jurgen Klopp.",
      "\"I really do question [whether] that midfield three is going to stand up throughout the season. If it does again, I’ll take my hat off to them, ‘well done, unbelievable, you’ve proven me wrong’. I think Manchester United have got more in midfield, more depth, good players in there…”",
      "Carragher then cut in: “That was Manchester United’s biggest problem last year, in midfield! The whole of the middle of the pitch!” Neville replied: “It was the structure of the midfield. Kobbie Mainoo has come into that midfield alongside Casemiro. [Bruno] Fernandes is in there, Mason Mount, McTominay – they’ve got five players in there that I think…”",
      "Carragher: “How many are you going to play? You’ve just named six players there!” Neville: “I said they’ve got more depth in there.”",
      "Liverpool are clearly happy with their depth in midfield, having opted not to reinforce the team after failing in their efforts to sign Real Sociedad’s Martin Zubimendi for £50million. Meanwhile, United are hoping to bring in Paris Saint-Germain star Manuel Ugarte to bolster Ten Hag’s midfield, while McTominay could leave.",

      "The Portuguese star's name will forever be synonymous with the club thanks to his first spell at Old Trafford. His second stint didn't quite go to plan, with Ronaldo eventually leaving by mutual consent after a notorious interview with Piers Morgan.",
      "Ronaldo, who is still playing out in Saudi Arabia for Al-Nassr, turns 40 in 2025. He hasn't confirmed either way what his future holds, both at club level or internationally ahead of the 2026 World Cup in the United States.",
      "Despite his infamous 'coaching' on the sidelines during his nation's Euro 2016 final triumph, the superstar hasn't gone public with any stance on a future managerial career, either. But that hasn't deterred Saha from believing he'd be great in the dugout, potentially at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Cristiano Ronaldo has the passion and dedication to return to Manchester United one day,\" Saha told TVSporten. \"That could be as a coach or even a manager.",
      "\"His second spell didn’t end how everyone had hoped, and you can see why that frustrated him. He didn’t see the same formula and didn’t see the passion from young players that he had been used to seeing.\"",
      "Ronaldo's second spell at United was turbulent, to say the least. He played under three different managers and criticised the club and its hierarchy before being released in November 2022.",
      "It was the icon's interview with Piers Morgan that all but ended his second stint at the club, with his disapproval of Ten Hag and the club's younger players proving to be the final nail in the coffin.",
      "Ronaldo still scored 27 goals in 54 games during that spell, however, and will always be remembered fondly by United fans overall. He has since been enjoying his time in Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr, having scored 35 goals in his first full season at the club.",
      "He will reportedly stay put this season, but his future beyond that remains a mystery. The forward's old United team-mate Saha has tipped Ronaldo to head into coaching, but only if he improves a few of his personable skills.",
      "\"Now he will know that he needs to find a new way to communicate when he becomes a coach,\" added Saha. \"Which maybe isn’t as harsh or direct as it was when he was at the club.",
      "\"He will work out how to be successful and use all his knowledge to do that; we’ve seen Roy Keane go into management and have success. Cristiano will understand what he needs to do as a manager. I see no reason why he wouldn’t be a success.\"",

      "Andy Robertson has been a stalwart at the back for Liverpool since 2017, and may have a successor on his hands in the form of an Olympic medallist",
      "Liverpool are reportedly interested in 22-year-old French left-back Adrien Truffert, who could eventually replace Andy Robertson.",
      "Arne Slot's reign at Anfield got off to the perfect start in the Premier League on Saturday as they beat newly-promoted Ipswich 2-0. However, the transfer market hasn't proved quite so easy for the Dutchman.",
      "The Reds haven't brought anyone in this summer, missing out on the likes of Anthony Gordon and Martin Zubimendi. It now appears they are in the market for Truffert, who excelled at the Paris Olympics and could provide the perfect understudy for Robertson, while not costing as much as previous failed targets.",
      "According to L'Equipe, the Reds – alongside fellow Premier League clubs Nottingham Forest, Wolves and Manchester United – are all interested in securing the young Frenchman's services.",
      "Truffert graduated from his current club Rennes' academy, and is one of the country's premier defensive prospects. At just 22, he's played over 150 times for his boyhood club, contributing 21 assists in the meantime.",
      "The youngster is currently valued at around £15.3m but, given his age and the fact that his contract doesn't expire until 2026, any fee paid for Truffert could rise higher.",
      "PSG, who have recently signed Truffert's starlet of a team-mate and fellow Olympian Desire Doue, reportedly held an interest in the defender and could return for him on the back of Lucas Hernandez's injury.",
      "The French champions identified Truffert as a target prior to the Paris Olympics, but playing under Thierry Henry at the Games only highlighted the youngster's talent to the rest of Europe and beyond.",

      "With the season up and running and less than a fortnight of the summer transfer window left to go, Manchester United have a few remaining pieces of business they need to wrap up",
      "Manchester United have less than two weeks left to make some last-minute additions to their squad to help them improve on last season's showing.",
      "Erik ten Hag has already welcomed in four new faces, two of whom were already familiar to him. Former Ajax defenders Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt have joined from Bayern Munich, following Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro to Old Trafford.",
      "United began their campaign with a win against Fulham thanks to a late Zirkzee strike. Their manager may well feel there are gaps left to plug, though, especially after last season's injury woes.",
      "We may well also see some more departures before the window shuts, as Ten Hag streamlines his squad. That's where some of our focus lies as we bring you all the latest.",
      "Fulham haven't given up on luring Scott McTominay to Craven Cottage. Marco Silva's side saw a bid knocked back earlier in the summer, and Sky Sports suggest they could be ready to improve on that £20m bid.",
      "Napoli are also in the mix, and their opening day Serie A defeat could spur them into action. Manager Antonio Conte suggested more signings were on the way after a dismal 3-0 reverse at Verona.",
      "McTominay came on as a substitute in the Community Shield and again in the Premier League opener. Nearly half of his 32 league appearances last season came from the bench, but only two United players bettered his return of seven goals in the competition.",
      "Manchester United have opened talks with Panathinaikos over a move for Facundo Pellistri, according to The Athletic. United want around £8.5million for the Uruguay international, who is in the final year of his contract.",
      "The 22-year-old moved to Old Trafford in 2020, but had to wait more than two years for his debut. He played 14 times in the first half of last season, but was allowed to spend the second half of the campaign on loan at Granada.",
      "United have welcomed Amad and Jadon Sancho back into the fold in the last 12 months after both looked close to an exit at various points. With plenty of competition for places, the club are not expected to stand in the way of a move for Pellistri, though Greek side Panathinaikos aren't the only interested party.",
      "Manchester United have lodged a bid for Sander Berge which falls short of Burnley's valuation, according to The Mail. The same publication indicates the Norwegian remains an option, but that United would prioritise Manuel Ugarte if Paris Saint-Germain lower their asking price.",
      "PSG are thought to want their money back on Ugarte, who joined from Sporting CP for around £60m last summer. The Uruguay international wasn't part of Luis Enrique's squad for the opening day win against Le Havre in Ligue 1.",
      "Berge joined Burnley from Sheffield United for a reported £12m last summer, with the Clarets after £30m for tne Norway international. He has missed the first two games of the 2024-25 season as he works his way back form injury.",

      "If the Clarets accept and Berge does head to Craven Cottage then it would leave United's options looking increasingly limited. A permanent swoop for Sofyan Amrabat, who was on loan in Manchester last season, is another option being considered by the hierarchy.",

      "Andre Onana endured a difficult debut season at Manchester United last term and has sparked fresh concern after insisting he will continue to play a high-risk, high-reward style",
      "Andre Onana has been slammed for claiming he will take more 'risks' for Manchester United this season.",
      "Onana endured a difficult debut campaign at Old Trafford last season, conceding a whopping 83 goals in all competitions. The Cameroon keeper was able to hold onto just 13 clean sheets in his 51 appearances after joining from Inter Milan.",
      "Several of the goal he conceded came from mistakes the United star made himself. Despite that, the 28-year-old has insisted he will continue to look to play a high-risk, high-reward game.",
      "That revelation has come as a shock to former United keeper Tim Howard, who won the FA Cup and the League Cup with the Red Devils. The American has urged Onana to revert to a more conservative game during his second year at the club.",
      "\"I’m rarely surprised at things in football. [But] I was utterly shocked to hear Onana say ‘be prepared I will take a lot more risks this season’. He conceded 58 goals, that number has to come down,\" Howard told NBC Sports",
      "\"He can ill-afford to make too many mistakes. Some of the goals that went past him were very, very saveable. The fact he’s willing to take more risks I guess is exciting and compelling.",
      "\"I wasn’t convinced last year, but right now he has a lot to prove. He has brilliant ability but he hasn’t put that into place and too many goals are going in that need to be saved.\"",
      "While Howard is concerned over Onana's free spirit, United legend Peter Schmeichel has given his full backing to the Cameroon international. Schmeichel even tipped the current United No.1 to become a 'world-class' keeper.",
      "“I just thought he was a bit unlucky for two reasons,” he told GOAL. “First of all, not playing behind a consistent defence. That’s a problem as a goalkeeper. You can be the best goalkeeper in the world, but if your defence is not protecting you, you have a problem.",
      "“Secondly, the goal he conceded in Munich was unlucky; if you do that for Inter or Ajax, it goes away within a week or two. If you do that for Man United, it stays, and you will be a goalkeeper who makes mistakes. That’s just the cruel reality of playing for Man United.",
      "“I saw a lot of improvements with different things in his game over the season. He needs help like any other goalkeeper in the world, he needs a defence in front of him. If he’s got that, I’m sure we’ll have a world-class, top-quality goalkeeper who will do well.”",
      "Onana has started both of United's games so far this season - in the Community Shield and against Fulham. He kept a clean sheet in the latter to help his side start the Premier League season with a win.",

      "The upheaval at Manchester United since the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe in February reportedly could be turned into a documentary.",
      "Ratcliffe has implemented widespread changes after completing a 27.7 per cent takeover of United earlier this year. The British petrochemicals billionaire has brought in some of his own INEOS people to run the club alongside hiring new staff and making hundreds of others redundant.",
      "The new regime brought in consultants to see where they could make savings and decided in July to make 250 redundancies as part of a major restructuring. Erik ten Hag only kept his job as manager by the skin of his teeth after winning the FA Cup and has been rewarded with four summer signings, worth a combined £150million.",
      "The aim behind all this drama is to make United successful once again and turn a profit for Ratcliffe and the Glazer family, who still have a stake in the club. It could also become content in its own right, with Ratcliffe believing that a behind the scenes documentary would go down well with fans.",
      "The Times reports that Ratcliffe has been keeping a video diary since February and a sports writer has been hired to document things. Matt Dickinson will write a book about the early stages of INEOS’ work at United and it could then be turned into a documentary too.",
      "As well as struggling on the pitch in recent years, United have fallen behind their rivals when it comes to content creation. Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham have all cashed in by making documentaries, which offer fans a peek behind the curtain and have sold well on streaming platforms.",
      "The All Or Nothing series involving City, Arsenal and Spurs have been huge hits for Amazon. Liverpool have footage from Jurgen Klopp ’s final season in charge but have yet to decide what to do with it. Amazon Prime released a series about the 1999 United side, entitled 99, over the summer and could be interested in another documentary.",
      "Speaking in February, Ratcliffe outlined his goals for United. “We have to ensure that the right people end up in the right positions,” he said. “Every person in management must be world-class. And then it is important to create a positive, supportive, friendly and high-quality environment. That culture was missing before. Only in such an environment can you get the best out of sportsmen. If successful, the results will follow automatically. That's the plan and I believe in it.”",
      "United kicked off their Premier League season with a 1-0 win over Fulham on Friday night, with new signing Joshua Zirkzee scoring a late winner after coming off the bench. The match also saw Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui make their United debuts following transfers from Bayern Munich.",

The Belgian boss opted to keep his cards close to his chest regarding the midfielder's future, saying: \"As a club, we always want to be clear with the players, that is the reality. We do that internally within our family. We don't need to say anything publicly.\"",
      "However, according to Fabrizio Romano, it will be made clear to Goretzka that he will not be a regular starter under Kompany this season, potentially forcing him to look elsewhere for first-team football.",
      "Some thoughts from our man Simon Mullock...",
      "\"Manchester United have spent £530million in the transfer market since Erik ten Hag became manager - yet according to the Dutchman himself they are only half-way through the rebuild he envisioned when he arrived at Old Trafford....\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "Manchester United officials sense that Chelsea could still make a play for Jadon Sancho before deadline day.",
      "The winger has returned to Old Trafford after his loan spell at Borussia Dortmund, which came about after a public fallout with manager Erik ten Hag. The pair have since settled their differences and Sancho has returned to the first-team picture this term.",
      "There is talk of him leaving though with PSG having a summer-long interest in the player who moved to Manchester for £70million back in 2021. Saudi Arabian clubs too have been touted as possible buyers but Chelsea also remain an interested party.",
      "The Athletic reports that those at Old Trafford believe a late play from the Blues could be on the cards as they continue to throw money at their squad. Despite adding Pedro Neto and Joao Felix about to join the Chelsea bosses could still move for Sancho.",
      "With a departure expected for the youngster, the MEN report that United would prefer to see him leave on a permanent deal as opposed to a loan.",
      "The Tunisian has drawn interest from Burnley who are considering a transfer or loan with an obligation to buy after the 21-year-old joined United from Monaco for £9m in 2019.",
      "While earlier reports suggest United would not be in the market for another full-back, Team Talk suggest Ten Hag has Ben Chilwell on his radar.",
      "The Chelsea defender has already been deemed surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge. Enzo Maresca told reporters that it would be better for last season's captain to move on.",
      "Sport report that Juventus ace Federico Chiesa has received an offer to join United.",
      "The winger has been deemed surplus to requirements in Turin and is expected to move having not been included for the team's opening match of the season. It could take just £13m to secure the deal it is said.",
      "Chelsea have also been linked with the Italian with a deal that could see Raheem Sterling head to the Old Lady in the opposite direction.",
      "The Danish midfielder has been offered to Ajax according to reports and United are looking for at least £5m for the former Spurs star. The Athletic claim that the Dutch side require sales to balance their books however.",
      "Jadon Sancho would be open to leaving United to play regular football elsewhere, according to The Athletic.",
      "The winger missed out on United's squad for the opening day win over Fulham after suffering with an ear issue but has been linked with moves away from the club. It has been said he could be used in a swap deal to PSG, while he has also been touted for an unlikely move to Chelsea..",
      "Fulham are reportedly set to confirm a deal for Sander Berge today. The Burnley star is undergoing his medical ahead of completing a move and was one of United' back-up options.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reports Facundo Pellistri's exit has now been agreed.",
      "Panathinaikos and United have agreed a fee in excess £5m for the winger with a sell-on fee set to be included for the 22-year-old. Pellistri will leave Old Trafford after 25 first-team appearances.",
      "Burnley are the latest suitors to show interest in signing Hannibal Mejbri this summer. The Clarets are said to be open to either a permanent deal or loan with an obligation to buy, per the Athletic.",
      "The Athletic also report that United have decided against signing a left-back this summer, even with Luke Shaw's injury. The Red Devils were linked with a move for Fenerbahce’s Ferdi Kadioglu but are said to have decided they are content with being able to utilise Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot.",
      "Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna has travelled to England to participate in face-to-face meetings, per the Athletic. McTominay is on the agenda with progress being made over a deal. They also report Fulham have moved on as McTominay waits for other offers. Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Evertoon could also emerge as options.",
      "Manchester Evening News report that the departure of Scott McTominay is required to facilitate a move for Ugarte in the next week or so. The Scotland international has been linked to Fulham and Napoli in recent days.",
      "Gary Neville didn't sound entirely convinced as he made his argument but claimed that Manchester United's midfield could be the area they have more strength and depth than Liverpool.",
      "With Ugarte seen as a priority, maybe he shouldn't make the claim just yet...",
      "Full story.",
      "United signing another forward has not been ruled out this month and there could yet be a shock move before the deadline. Dominic Calvert-Lewin could prove an opportunistic move.",
      "Fabrizio Romano said: \"In terms of a striker at the moment, Manchester United know that there are many opportunities on the market. Calvert-Lewin is out of contract in one year at Everton, so it could be an opportunity for many clubs.",
      "\"Ivan Toney wants to change, and he is another player who is out of contract in one year, so Manchester United are aware of these opportunities, but at the moment their focus is on different positions.\"",
      "The Red Devils are apparently prepared to wait until deadline day to make their move for the Uruguay international, with PSG remaining steadfast in their £51m valuation for the moment.",
      "United are 'prepared to bide their time' in the hope of strengthening their position, according to The Guardian.",
      "Reports suggest that United are now looking to come to an agreement to sign Manuel Ugarte on loan from PSG, with an obligation to buy the midfielder. Jorge Mendes is said to be leading negotiations.",
      "With new arrivals in the backline Victor Lindelof's may have dropped down the United pecking order. The Swede is only interested in departing the club if the correct move comes along however. Fiorentina have been linked so far but an exit may not yet be on the cards.",
      "“Lindelof is not desperate to leave Manchester United,\" reports Fabrizio Romano. \"It has to be for a big opportunity, big, big club.",
      "“He was on the list of Atletico Madrid, Inter, and several others clubs [last year], and Man United never wanted to let him go, and Erik ten Hag always wanted to keep him in the squad. Now Lindelof, with one year left on his contract is not going to accept something that is not 100 per cent what he really wants, otherwise in January he can agree to sign with any club in the world.",
      "“This is why Lindelof will take his time, not desperate to leave, unless there is a good opportunity at an important club. I don’t think 100 per cent Lindelof will leave Manchester United.”",
      "We are back once again for another day of Manchester United transfers. Stick around and we'll keep you updated with all of the latest goings on!",
      "That's all from us - we'll be back tomorrow with all the latest!",
      "Brentford are keen to get Ivan Toney sorted by the weekend - and are likely to accept £45m for the striker, reports The Sun.",
      "Man Utd are among those interest but Chelsea could yet be tempted into a late swoop for the England striker - despite them having major squad issues and needing to get players off their books."

      "The sale of Scott McTominay could be critical if Manchester United hope to complete their midfield revamp before the close of the transfer window, with the Red Devils short on funds for both Sander Berge and Manual Ugarte",
      "McTominay’s future has been uncertain throughout the summer, with interest arriving from Fulham and Napoli for the central midfielder. United rejected Fulham’s £20million offer earlier this summer, but the Daily Mail have reported that interest has been revived. Napoli, meanwhile, would prefer a loan-to-buy deal for the Scotland international",
      "McTominay has just one year remaining on his contract with United, albeit the club has the option to extend it for a further 12 months.",
      "A product of United’s academy, the 27-year-old has clocked over 250 appearances for the club since making his senior debut in April 2017. Last season saw him relish his best-ever goal return in the United shirt as he scored 10 times, including winning goals against Brentford, Chelsea and Aston Villa in the Premier League.",
      "However, McTominay could make way to help fund manager Erik ten Hag’s ongoing squad revamp.",
      "United are currently interested in Burnley ’s Berge and Paris Saint-Germain’s Ugarte. United’s initial offer for the Sheffield United defensive midfielder was short of the club’s £30million valuation, while Ugarte is reportedly the preferred choice but any move remains at the mercy of PSG ’s asking price.",
      "Ugarte was not involved in the French club’s Ligue 1 season opener against Le Havre last Friday amid transfer speculation.",
      "While PSG are reportedly happy to part ways with the midfielder, they are unwilling to budge from their £52million valuation, which is how much they paid Sporting to sign him in July last year.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Ugarte featured in 37 games for the French heavyweights last season as the club won Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France.",
      "Berge has not featured in either of Burnley’s opening two fixtures in the Championship. New manager Scott Parker attributed the absence against Luton in the season opener to a squad injury.",
      "Although Parker had hoped to get Berge back in time for the clash against Cardiff, it ultimately came too soon. Berge moved to the Clarets from Sheffield United last summer but was unable to halt the club's slide back down to the Championship.",

      "According to reports in Spain, Gundogan has indicated he's ready to leave Camp Nou after just one season. Turkey or Saudi Arabia could provide an exit route for the German international, who impressed in his first year after a free transfer from Manchester City.",
      "Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has held talks with his compatriot and suggests it's more likely than not that Gundogan will stay. If Barca decide it's time to take the big earner off their wage bill, though, it's hard to see a second midfield departure following.",

The project I saw from the Club aligns with my ideas\".",
      "Valencia manager Ruben Baraja is preparing for Giorgi Mamardashvili to stay at the club despite interest from Liverpool and Manchester United. On Saturday, we brought you the news that United were looking to hijack Liverpool's move for the Georgia goalkeeper.",

      "Manchester United were heavily linked with Youssouf Fofana, but the midfielder has instead signed for AC Milan from Monaco and sent a pointed message about the move",
      "Manchester United were interested in signing Youssouf Fofana this summer, but the midfielder has joined AC Milan instead.",
      "Fofana was among several options being explored by United, along with PSG's Manuel Ugarte and Burnley star Sander Berge, but the France international has now completed a £21.3million move to Milan.",
      "And Fofana appears to have sent a pointed message to United when discussing why he chose Milan, highlighting the fact they will be playing Champions League football this season while the Red Devils are in the Europa League.",
      "\"When the club is looking for you like AC Milan was looking for me, it's obvious you want to go there,\" Fofana said. \"This is the right moment, for me and the squad: now I am a complete player, I want to play in the Champions League and win the Scudetto, I cannot wait to start.",

      "Fofana also revealed he spoke to his France team-mates Theo Hernandez and Mike Maignan about joining Milan. \"I went and asked them about the club, the city, but also other French players have spoken well about Milan,\" he added.",
      "\"I think their words influenced my decision. I am not here to replace anyone, I am myself: a modern midfielder who has work to do in both halves of the pitch.",
      "\"This evening, the league begins, and I want to play already, people often say that waiting makes the desire stronger, and now I am happy to be here with you. I have been patient, and today I am at AC Milan. There is no best version of me, I hope I can improve year after year.\"",

      "Outgoings are taking centre stage right now with an eye on the August 30 deadline. Academy graduate Will Fish has agreed a move to Championship side Cardiff City as United continue to trim down their first-team squad with Scott McTominay also thought to be attracting interest - both at home and abroad.",
      "United have signed Noussair Mazraoui, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee so far this summer. In their ongoing search for another midfielder - with PSG's Manuel Ugarte and Sander Berge on radar - player sales will be needed in the first instance to make sure there are enough funds in the budget for a fifth marquee arrival.",
      "Uruguay winger Facundo Pellistri is also being inked in for a departure. He's expected to leave before the deadline after spending time away from Old Trafford, previously, via three separate loan spells.",
      "Burnley are interest in signing Mejbri on loan with a mandatory buy clause and have started talks with Man United.",
      "Soccer News claims PSV Eindhoven have started to look elsewhere for a new left-back following Malacia's fitness.",
      "Malacia's last appearance for United came in May 2023 due to two rounds of knee surgery and he is continuing his rehabilitation at Carrington. Erik ten Hag said he is 'in a good place' and is likely to only return in October.",
      "PSV have grown concerned over his injury record and are said to have 'completely discarded' the idea of signing him.",
      "Manchester United have been told Fiorentina plan to hold onto Sofyan Amrabat past the transfer deadline.",
      "Amrabat spent last season on loan at United from Fiorentina after the Reds agreed a €10million (£8.5million) loan fee for the midfielder. The deal also included the option of making the move permanent for a fee worth up to €25million (£21million) including add-ons.",
      "Read more here.",
      "L'Equipe report Man United and Liverpool have been named as the latest clubs to show interest in Rennes left-back Adrien Truffert.",
      "The report claims there is a number of teams from the Premier League interested in the 22-year-old, including Nottingham Forest and Wolves. Paris Saint-Germain are also mentioned.",
      "Truffert came through the same Rennes youth ranks that produced Eduardo Camavinga, Ousmane Dembele, Mathys Tel, Sylvain Wiltord and Mikael Silvestre among others. He is under contract until 2026.",
      "Man United academy goalkeeper Radek Vitek is close to joining BW Linz on loan, according to reports.",
      "The 20-year-old is thought to have attracted plenty of interest in the summer transfer window but is set to join the Austrian side. Vitek received offers from teams in the EFL this summer after impressing at League Two side Accrington Stanley in the second-half of last season.",
      "He was included in Erik ten Hag's pre-season squad for their US tour but was naturally behind Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton in the pecking order.",
      "Man United officials reportedly sense that Chelsea could still make a move for Sancho before deadline day on August 30.",

      "Speaking to Android Poker Apps, the former Arsenal and Chelsea man said:",
      "Joshua Zirkzee's goal was very lucky but his start could be a sign of many things to come for him. If you're scoring a last-minute winner with your first shot on goal, it could be seen as destiny or fate. Man United could have killed the game earlier on, Zirkzee saved the three points for them and I think Erik ten Hag will be very pleased that he's already contributed. The start of the season is always the most important time for a player, if you start well then you can avoid the noise and continue playing how you are.",
      "With Sancho's future remaining unsettled, former striker Michael Owen believes Sir Alex Ferguson would have dealt with the saga a lot differently if he was in Erik ten Hag's shoes.",
      "He told Casino Hawks:",
      "The Jadon Sancho situation would’ve played out very differently under Sir Alex Ferguson. It would either have been done and dusted and you're out, or the air would’ve been cleared. Under Ten Hag that’s happened a year too late. If you confront something straight away then you can come to the right outcome, this has just happened so late. Spending all that money on wages and eventually it’s all been sorted. What Ten Hag should’ve done is sit down and have this chat last year. If my son or my daughter are annoyed then we sit down and speak about it. With Sancho we’re talking about a player that cost tens of millions of pounds during a time when United have their backs to the all in terms of performances on the pitch needing all they’ve got to try and get back on track. They had a really talented player that had to go out on loan because they couldn’t clear the air. It's pretty depressing if you're a Manchester United fan. Sense has prevailed a year too late but sense has prevailed and we'll see what happens now.",
      "According to journalist Alfredo Pedulla, Juventus are still keeping an eye on Sancho as a back-up option for their attack this summer.",
      "The Englishman is considered a Plan B because the Old Lady are looking at a couple of other options for their attack.",
      "Fiorentina’s Nicolas Gonzalez and Porto youngster Francisco Conceicao remain higher up the wishlist than Sancho.",
      "United have been guilty of hoarding players in their squad who deep down we all realised needed to be sold sooner rather than later.",
      "It appears the Reds are being much more brutal this summer with Pellistri and Hannibal being sold before they inevitably left for free.",
      "There is always a market for a player and United will be happy to recoup some money for players who are on the fringes of the first-team.",
      "MEN Sport understands United would prefer Hannibal to be sold on a permanent basis this summer.",
      "Burnley are thought to be considering a loan with obligation to buy or a permanent transfer.",

      "READ MORE HERE",
      "With McTominay being sought after by Napoli it appears another club wants to take a midfielder off United's hands.",
      "Championship side Burnley are thought to be keen on a move for Hannibal this summer, according to The Athletic.",
      "Scott Parker's side are expected to come into some money shortly with Berge, who was linked to United, expected to join Fulham.",
      "Ahead of his club's 3-0 loss at the weekend, Manna spoke highly of McTominay and refused to rule out a move for the midfielder.",
      "They [McTominay and Brighton's Gilmour] are good, strong players. Let's see what happens in the next few days. It's useless to make forward momentum today there is the game and after the game, we will think about the market.",
      "While Toney will no doubt have storming success in the Middle East, a £50m transfer fee is just too steep for the Reds to afford this summer.",
      "Toney is a talent but with a lack of resale value, it would just not make the right financial sense for Ineos.",
      "It now seems increasingly likely that the Reds will go to January with just Hojlund and Zirkzee as their recognised centre-forwards.",
      "According to The Times, Brentford are resigned to the fact that Ivan Toney will be leaving their club this summer.",
      "However, a move to United is not expected.",
      "Instead, it is believed that Saudi Pro League club Al Ahli are the favourites to bring Toney in before the deadline. Brentford are set to demand £50m for his signature.",
      "While there will be question marks as to how Pellistri did not manage to gain more of a shot at United, you can't argue that this would not be the right time for him to leave.",
      "The winger has not managed to gain the minutes he would have been hoping for at Old Trafford and with Amad, Garnacho, Rashford and Antony all in front of him, there was only one likely outcome this summer.",
      "According to The Athletic, United fans may be anxiously checking their watches on Friday, August 30 to see if Ugarte's arrival will be confirmed.",
      "It is believed that while a deal with his agent Jorge Mendes and PSG is still a possibility, the move may only get over the line in the final knockings of the window.",
      "MEN Sport understands United will need to sell one of their central midfielders this summer in order to bring Ugarte to the Premier League.",
      "McTominay is seen as the most likely player to leave considering there is interest from other clubs but Fulham are not one of them any more as they look to finalise their signing of Berge from Burnley.",
      "READ MORE HERE",
      "According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, Facundo Pellistri's exit from United this summer has been agreed.",
      "Panathinaikos have agreed a fee of just over £5m for the winger with the Reds believed to have included a sell-on fee for their forward.",
      "Pellistri will leave United having made just 25 first-team appearances for the Reds.",
      "The likely option for McTominay now is a transfer to Napoli.",
      "The Athletic understands Napoli director Giovanni Manna has travelled to England to continue negotiations with United for McTominay.",
      "While this is thought to be progressing well, no agreement on personal terms has been reached yet.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano on Monday, Fulham have now exited the race to sign McTominay this summer.",
      "It is believed the Whites switched their attention to Burnley's Sander Berge at the beginning of the week and the Norwegian is down in London today ahead of wrapping up a £25m transfer.",
      "With Berge in the bag, Silva is now extremely unlikely to go after McTominay again this window.",
      "MEN Sport understands United's No.1 target for the midfield this summer is Ugarte.",
      "The Uruguayan defensive midfielder has been on the radar since July and the Reds are looking to bolster that area of the pitch before the August 30 deadline.",
      "However, a move for Ugarte is dependent on McTominay leaving the club this summer.",
      "According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, United are working on a loan with an obligation to buy bid for Ugarte this summer.",
      "Agent Jorge Mendes is negotiating with PSG to get the deal over the line.",
      "Ugarte is very keen to join United having agreed personal terms with the club in July.",
      "Former United striker Louis Saha has backed Jadon Sancho to be a success this season.",
      "Sancho spent the second half of last season on loan at Borussia Dortmund and has now returned to Old Trafford to be part of the United squad. Saha believes that the form Sancho showed in Germany is evidence that the forward can still be a success for United.",
      "\"Manchester United have to sign a new attacking midfielder this summer, but Jadon Sancho will feel like a new signing if he stays and can find his form,\" Saha said in an interview with TVSporten. \"The way he played at Borussia Dortmund shows that he can still do it, he could be the creative player that Erik ten Hag needs.",
      "\"United also need people with character, they are missing that. Current players can have that but because the team is unbalanced. Sometimes when things aren’t going their way the current players are comfortable with that situation, they need to be aggressive.",
      "\"United need their big characters to outnumber the players that are comfortable with not winning. They have too many players like that.\"",

      "For Manchester United's current holding midfielder, the opening weekend of the Premier League season was an improvement. A leaner-looking Casemiro showed glimpses of encouragement to suggest the obituaries penned for his career in Europe can be filed away for a little longer yet.",
      "But what stood about the 32-year-old was his quality on the ball. One of the standout moments for the United midfielder was the pass he threaded to Bruno Fernandes to create the best chance of the first half.",
      "Casemiro's passing has always been an underrated aspect of his game and one that he has displayed more at United than he ever needed to at Real Madrid. But primarily his job is to hold the fort at the base of midfield and he found that difficult last season.",
      "Read the full opinion piece here",
      "Manchester United are reportedly willing to wait until the transfer deadline day to sign Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The midfielder remains a top target for Erik ten Hag but so far, there has been no breakthrough in negotiations. Paris Saint-Germain are understood be holding out for a £51million (€60m) fee as they are keen to recoup the sum they paid to Sporting Clube de Portugal for him last summer.",
      "However, that fee is deemed too 'high' by the United hierarchy and therefore, the club are 'prepared to bide their time' which might force a reduction in price, according to The Guardian. It's claimed that there is no need for any outgoings to finance the sale, though.",
      "It is also being widely reported that United may look to negotiate a loan with an obligation-to-buy option.",

      "It was three, rather than two, attack-minded substitutions by Erik ten Hag that procured Manchester United's victory against Fulham.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho crossed for Joshua Zirkzee, who prodded the ball ahead of the expertly-placed Scott McTominay.",
      "McTominay has form for that. Cast your mind back to Casemiro's added-time equaliser at Chelsea in October 2022 and his nearest 'marker' was McTominay, directly behind him.",
      "The Scot scored ten goals for United last season and all of them were big. Two beyond the 90th minute against Brentford, two against Chelsea, a winner against Aston Villa, FA Cup quarter and semi-final goals, the opener at Sheffield United and restoring two-goal advantages at Galatasaray and Wolves.",
      "That extended to the European Championship in Germany, where he became only the sixth Scotland international to register at a Euros.",
      "A 27-year-old United-bred Premier League proven international with goal-getting nous and robust fitness is a valuable player. Only United overestimated McTominay's value last year when they knocked back West Ham United's offer of £30million. McTominay was inexplicably valued at £40m.",
      "The sums did not add up. McTominay started only 16 games in Ten Hag's first season and had been rumbled by the United manager, who favoured midfield technicians.",
      "The latest was Kobbie Mainoo, only Rodrygo collided into his ankle during pre-season last year and Mainoo did not represent the first team again for another four months. That reprieved McTominay.",
      "And so one of United's biggest players last season was a player they had planned to sell. They still plan on doing so but are running out of time.",
      "United may take a dim view of Fulham offering a larger overall fee for the twice-relegated Sander Berge of Burnley. Berge is only 14 months younger than McTominay and scored twice last season.",
      "The new United are determined to change their reputation in the market and the days when they gave away players for a tuppence are over. Fulham's last offer of £23m for McTominay was derisory.",
      "The bigger picture is United cannot command much more than that. McTominay's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026 but he would have to have a stonking season to maintain his resale value in 12 months' time.",
      "United also want to reinforce their midfield with a more balanced addition in Manuel Ugarte. McTominay is a proven game-changer but he jars with whatever game model United are attempting to implement.",
      "McTominay's game revolves around net-busting and bustling. United are seeking a more refined approach and their only defensive midfielder is a 32-year-old who now prefers to attack.",
      "Last year, United banked a derisory £15m up front rising to £20m for Dean Henderson. Chelsea offered £40m for Henderson in 2021, the summer Ole Gunnar Solskjaer promised to install him as United's No.1. The supine Solskjaer reneged on that when Henderson recovered from Covid-19.",
      "Like with his academy teammate Henderson, United have to take a hit to make a profit on McTominay. They will now do well to get £25m, especially as Fulham do not plan on tabling another offer if they sign Berge.",
      "Only five United players have been sold for fees of £25m and above: David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel di Maria, Romelu Lukaku and Daniel James. Mason Greenwood would become the sixth if his add-ons are triggered.",
      "Overseas clubs have fluttered their eyelashes at McTominay but most have received short shrift as they do not have the funds to meet United's asking price. As much as Jose Mourinho wanted to reunite with him, McTominay was not keen on the prospect of relocating to Istanbul.",
      "He was receptive to moving to London last year. McTominay's girlfriend's family hail from nearby Bromley and that is thought to have had a bearing.",
      "Some members of McTominay's family were miffed by his treatment at the start of last season. So much so one of the family regulars at Old Trafford was not in attendance for the remarkable recovery against Brentford when McTominay struck in the 93rd and 97th minute.",
      "Lancaster-born McTominay's attachment to United dates back to the age of five when he joined their development centre. He has spent seven-and-a-half years in the first team and endeared himself to managers as diverse as Mourinho, Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick and Ten Hag.",
      "A teammate once disparagingly referred to McTominay as a \"teacher's pet\". That was a compliment. McTominay has fared far better under all four managers than said teammate through a mentality that has taken him a long way.",
      "And contributed to Friday night's winner.",

      "Manchester United's academy building at Carrington is currently a hive of activity.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's project to renovate the main building, which is costing £50million, began in June and the senior players are sharing the youth building while construction is ongoing.",
      "There is a tangible buzz around the academy building and the Manchester Evening News were recently invited through its doors to speak with Under-21 manager Travis Binnion.",
      "Binnion has been generous with his time since taking charge of the U21s and discussed the likes of Toby Collyer, Ethan Wheatley, Harry Amass, and how INEOS have impacted the academy during the interview, which was ahead of the youngsters' game against Barnsley in the EFL Trophy.",
      "\"Over the last year, those two players you mentioned, Amass and Wheatley, have progressed a lot, a hell of a lot,\" Binnion said. \"Ethan Wheatley in particular has turned into a real eye-catching centre forward and his profile is one that managers like because he’s lean, quick and tall.",
      "\"If you drew a No.9, you’d draw him looking like Ethan, but his game has come on leaps and bounds, so knowing where to run and his link-up play has improved, and being in better positions.",
      "\"He’s spent around 12 to 13 weeks consistently training with the first-team, just like Harry, and I think within that environment, particularly when you’re having to play like they did in pre-season, you’re able to learn quicker. The good players always do in that situation.",
      "\"Equally, if you find it hard in that environment, it can be an unforgiving place to be because the level is possibly too high if you’re struggling. You find out a lot about yourself in terms of your game, but you also find out a lot about yourself as a person and as a professional as well.\"",
      "Wheatley and Amass were both taken on the USA pre-season tour and were given opportunities by Erik ten Hag, who named them in a handful of first-team squads last season.",
      "Both are highly regarded at United and Wheatley is seen as a young striker with vast potential, while some have predicted Amass could become Luke Shaw's long-term successor.",
      "\"Harry’s very good on the ball, he can defend well, but he knows a big part of his game is wider defending to ensure he deals with movement and defending space in behind,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"His game in possession is in a really good place and he’s physically capable, but he knows that he’s got to keep working, as most full-backs have, in their defensive moments.\"",
      "Collyer was another youngster to stand out during pre-season and Ten Hag said he'd 'earned' his first-team chances when he spoke to reporters before the USA tour.",
      "Last month, Collyer signed a new contract until 2027 and Ten Hag insisted on attending his signing ceremony at Carrington, while the Dutchman was also spotted deep in conversation with him after the FA Cup final, which was reminiscent of his exchange with Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Collyer's athleticism has impressed staff and his running stats are among the best in each training session, which saw him make his competitive senior debut in the Community Shield.",
      "\"If Toby had a clean 18 months and a clean two and a half years with us, we would be talking about a really top young player,\" Binnion said. \"We’re talking about a really good young player with high potential. He joined us from another club and took a little while to get going.",
      "\"He couldn’t play in the FA Youth Cup run, so he was here but couldn’t play. He's also had a couple of injuries and nothing terrible, but when you have a spell out of the game and have a couple of injuries that stop you playing, it takes a while to get going, but when we signed him, we had no doubts about what he was capable of - he's a fantastic athlete and effective without the ball.",
      "\"Toby is also making great strides with the ball, so we’re talking there about someone who can be really effective in all moments of the game and I think that’s what you saw on tour.",
      "\"That's why the manager has involved him in numerous squads. I think he’s earned the trust of the manager and that’s not easy to do, so great credit to him, he’s a fantastic lad.",
      "\"He's got a superb attitude and he’s getting what he deserves. We just know the manager really likes him and the conversations I have with Fletch [Darren Fletcher] are along those lines and we talk about what’s right for his development, so what’s next and what does he need to do?\"",
      "Kobbe Mainoo was standing outside the academy building, chatting to Hannibal Mejbri, before Binnion arrived for the interview and the U21 boss said the next step for the likes of Wheatley, Amass and Collyer is to emulate how he's established himself as a senior player.",
      "\"The challenge for those boys is to become Kobbie, [Alejandro] Garnacho, or Omari Forson, who has left the club now but he was around a lot of matchday squads and featured more than once.",
      "\"That’s your first step, train with the first-team all the time, which some of those boys are doing, then it’s to be in multiple squads, then it’s to make multiple appearances and then become an established sort of starter. There are four stages there and that’s if you stay in the building.",
      "\"I don’t think there’s a better club in the country to be at to aspire and achieve and see very quickly what you can do. With that comes a great expectation and you’ve got to be good enough, but I really don’t think there’s a better club to be at for the ‘pathway’. People use that word and I don’t like it, but that’s the title that’s given and this is the best club to be at for that.\"",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho have both previously starred in EFL Trophy fixtures, a competition in which Premier League sides field U21 teams against League One and League Two senior teams, and United get their new campaign under way on Tuesday night against Barnsley.",
      "United will also play Doncaster and Huddersfield in their EFL Trophy group and the U21 side has been followed by a sold-out away support over the last few seasons in the competition.",
      "\"My two fondest memories are the FA Youth Cup final, with the brilliant crowd that night, and Stockport away in the EFL Trophy,\" said Binnion. \"Salford was good last season, bar the result, and Fleetwood was great. Garnacho’s late winner at Barrow was great and we can’t shy away from the two drubbings against Bolton, so I’m glad we’re not in their group this year.",
      "\"But that was a great learning experience. We are very lucky to work at a football club where the academy is integral and you feel it. There’s an expectation that comes with that, but there’s excitement from the fans that I don’t see from any other club towards its youth players",
      "\"The EFL Trophy is the best competition for us, alongside the Youth Cup. They’re the two we’re involved in every year that I think we find the most about the players and the players look forward to most, so that’s a good indicator of the importance it plays within our programme.",
      "\"It gives the players a first taste of senior football and a real good opportunity against senior opposition, which brings different challenges, but they also have to deal with the expectation of having to deliver with a different level of challenge, which is obviously greater.",
      "\"The good players and the better players thrive in those moments, so I can remember both of those players [Mainoo and Garnacho] delivering high-level moments that gave the manager and fans insight into whether they had the capability of breaking into the first-team.",
      "\"It’s all well and good performing for the U18s or in the PL2, but there are certain games when you feel and can see in front of your eyes that players grow. On the other hand, some players don’t deliver the sort of performance you were hoping to see and that’s not terminal.",
      "\"But if over three games and two years of playing in that competition, they’ve maybe not delivered or they have, it probably points towards what they will do within the club.\"",
      "Binnion last spoke to the MEN in May for a season review article and he'd just overseen an academy trip to France that saw United take on the youth team of INEOS-owned Nice.",
      "Since then, INEOS' relationship with United's academy has strengthened and Binnion provided insight into how technical director Jason Wilcox and sporting director Dan Ashworth have been involved since joining from Southampton and Newcastle respectively.",
      "\"Dan and Jason have vast experience in the game and their relationship with Nick [Cox] and myself, along with the support from a wider perspective into recruitment from INEOS, only gives the academy more avenues to develop players and have greater depth of experience.",
      "\"I think the appointments, the resource and the experience they have, can only make the decision-making process around our players stronger. I've had meetings with both since they joined and they have been very involved in terms of supporting Nick and supporting myself.",
      "\"Whether that be from a recruitment, playing style or from a squad planning and loans perspective, they [Wilcox and Ashworth] are across all of that, so before it was [Darren] Fletch, Nick and myself. You've still got the same people involved, but there's now an extra layer from executive level, but we have football people, who have youth football experience, in those roles.",
      "\"Any level of expertise can only help us be even more aligned from academy to first-team. It will help us recruit the right players, the environment is important and the profile of our recruitment is important. If you get those right, with the right training programme, then you’ve got utopia.\"",
      "Binnion had a strong working relationship with Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag's former assistant manager. He departed this summer, but Darren Fletcher has been appointed as a first-team coach and the former United player is now the main conduit between the academy and first-team.",
      "\"Fletch has become even more integral in the first-team coaching set-up, so for me now, he was really important in terms of day-to-day involvement, loans and player minutes,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"I got close to Mitchell about what he saw each day, but with Fletch increasing his amount of coaching, I’ve kind of got one person to deal with now for almost everything, so Mitchell has gone and that’s happened, but Fletch is doing more and that’s only a good thing for our younger players.\"",
      "The transfer window shuts in 10 days and a few academy players could leave on loan before the deadline. \"There could and should be two or three exits on loan,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"I won’t say who because those players are because they could be disappointed if they stay in the building, but as I’ve stressed previously, the loans have to be right for them.",
      "\"We’ve seen previous loans of just getting the boys out of the building are not good enough. They need to get out there, play, learn and get the opportunity to develop.",
      "\"If we don’t get those opportunities, it can be a stagnant part of a player’s career, or if you get two poor loans in a row, it can be really quite detrimental to a player’s progress.\"",
      "Tickets for Tuesday's match at Barnsley are available here, while supporters in the UK will also be able to watch the fixture live on Sky Sports+.",

      "Even with five injuries to contend with, the Manchester United squad against Fulham was strong enough that two international wingers were omitted.",
      "Facundo Pellistri is unlikely to be named in a United matchday party again and several supporters will hope Jadon Sancho's absence extends to Brighton and beyond. Erik ten Hag clarified Sancho was fit enough to be involved on Friday evening, despite suffering an ear infection last week.",
      "Ideally, United would recruit three more players. Realistically, it will be one - a midfielder. If Pellistri and Sancho both go, United have first and second-choice wingers on both flanks. Ditto the peripheral Hannibal Mejbri; Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount are ahead of him as No.10s.",
      "Victor Lindelof has played two halves of football since he reported for pre-season six weeks ago and done minimal training. He was nursing a \"niggle\" and then came off against Liverpool as a \"precaution\". Now he is on crutches. That's a nasty niggle.",
      "READ MORE:Zirkzee has already given United something they did not have last season",
      "Lindelof, 30, is borderline unsellable. He missed 21 games last season through injury, has started this season out injured and is out of contract next year. Takers will not be queuing around the block.",
      "United at least have four senior centre halves in his absence. The enforced withdrawals of Noussair Mazraoui and Harry Maguire (both building up their fitness) in the 81st minute could have destabilised the defence against Fulham. Matthijs de Ligt and Jonny Evans ensured United's shop remained shut after Joshua Zirkzee scored. Leny Yoro will return after the clocks go back.",
      "Provided Luke Shaw does not suffer an umpteenth setback, he is due back after the September internationals, so United will hope to get by with Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot at full back against Brighton and Liverpool. Tyrell Malacia's early October return date should be lightly pencilled in and United have Harry Amass as an alternative.",
      "It was apparent at the start of this summer United would not break the £60million barrier for a signing and the final fee for Yoro was just shy of that. For years, Manchester City prided themselves on not exceeding £60m for a signing and only four additions (Rodri, Ruben Dias, Jack Grealish and Josko Gvardiol) have fetched fees above that. The common denominator, of course, is Omar Berrada.",
      "United's current summer outlay stands at £155.35m (including add-ons), with an up-front sum of £139.98m. United sources have stressed this is the summer of budget discipline and swift market action.",
      "Scott McTominay, the only truly sellable asset in midfield, has to make room for an incoming, preferably Manuel Ugarte. United are confident of getting Ugarte but it is understood to be contingent on McTominay going.",
      "United should not be shortchanged for an academy graduate and proven Premier League player with matchwinning nous and international pedigree, yet McTominay's contract situation forces their hand. They likely have to take a hit on a player valued at £40m last year to make a profit this year.",
      "Whatever United's game model is (Ten Hag mentioned his new buzz phrase twice during his tour sit-down and twice again at Carrington on Thursday), McTominay jars with it. He is an industrious impact player but not a technician and he might have gone a year earlier had Kobbie Mainoo not hobbled off in Houston 13 months ago.",
      "Ten Hag has stressed the need for quantity and quality. Toby Collyer has emerged as an additional option in midfield, an area where at least five out-and-out options are required. Discounting Mount, United already have a quintet with an average age lowered by Mainoo and pre-season tour breakout Collyer. Ten Hag can also call upon Fernandes, arguably a better footballer in the middle third than the final third.",
      "This is a season where the minimum aim for United has to be a top four finish. There have been too many like that in the past decade (2014-15, 2019-20, 2022-23) but United have not challenged for the championship since they last won it.",
      "United's squad is still not where it needs to be though they were never going to complete their gradual rebuild in one summer. The two senior left backs are crocks, two of their midfielders are creaking and there is not a dependable goalscorer in the frontline.",
      "Ducks must be lined up for next summer: Evans, Lindelof and Eriksen can be released. Maguire could be, depending on his form this term, Casemiro should be easier to shift and a succession plan at left back is warranted with Shaw clocking up more days in the medical centre than on the training pitch at Carrington. Malacia, out of contract in 2026, is vulnerable.",
      "Provisionally, United will need a centre back, a left back and two midfielders next summer. Maybe an extra forward if wayward wingers Marcus Rashford and Antony do not improve over the next nine months. Two wingers could already be going this month.",

      "Pellistri was effective when entering games from the bench, which helped him take advantage of tired legs, but he couldn't shake off his reputation as an impact substitution.",
      "His opportunities became limited in the winter and it was no surprise to see him leave on loan in the January window. It's also not a surprise that United prefer a permanent sale of Pellistri this summer, despite having the option of extending his contract by an extra year.",
      "The one-year extension in Pellistri's contract could be triggered and he could be sent on loan again, with the hope of increasing his resale value, but there won't be much upside.",
      "United need to sell more players before August 30 to generate funds and operate within PSR rules and cashing in on Pellistri is logical to help balance the books, especially when considering that Victor Lindelof may be unable to be sold, depending on the severity of his injury.",
      "It's thought Panathinaikos have submitted an offer that means United will recoup most of the £9m they invested into signing Pellistri and that might be good enough to seal the deal.",

      "United have been criticised for failing to clear out their dead wood in the last 10 years but they have been proactive in the selling market this summer to raise funds to reinvest.",

      "Ronaldo's second spell at United was tumultuous, marked by playing under three different managers and criticising the club and its hierarchy before his release in November 2022. The legendary forward's interview with Morgan was the catalyst for his departure from United, with his criticism of Erik ten Hag and the club's younger players being the final straw.",
      "Despite this, Ronaldo managed to net 27 goals in 54 matches in his second stint, after scoring 118 goals on the way to Premier League and Champions League success in his first spell. He has since been thriving at Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia, scoring an impressive 35 goals in his debut season.",

      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag believes Leny Yoro can help the club to 'win trophies' when he returns from injury and he also lavished praise on Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Zirkzee was the first signing of the summer at Old Trafford and he sealed a €42.5m (£36.5m) move from Bologna last month, signing a five-year contract that will expire in 2029.",
      "Yoro joined from Lille in a deal worth €62m (£52.8m) plus €8m (£6.8m) in add-ons on and impressed on his first appearance in pre-season, but disaster struck in his next game when the defender fractured his metatarsal against Arsenal, an injury that required surgery.",
      "The Frenchman is not expected to return from the sidelines until October and was standing on crutches when he was introduced to the Old Trafford crowd before the Fulham game.",
      "Yoro's return from injury is something for supporters to look forward to and Ten Hag, speaking to SuperSport, said he is 'sure' the centre-back will help United win trophies in the future.",
      "\"We are so happy that we could sign him, he's one the biggest assets in European football, so we managed to bring him in and we are very pleased,\" said Ten Hag about Yoro.",
      "\"Leny knows he has to progress a lot and we know must help and support him, and we know we have the skills in our team to help him to achieve his high ambition.",
      "\"The potential is absolutely there and we are sure he can help us win games, we are sure he can help us to win trophies. That's what United stands for.\"",
      "When Ten Hag was asked about Zirkzee, who scored on his debut against Fulham, he added: \"He's still a young player, but he's already had an impressive career so far.",
      "\"He played in Germany, played in Belgium, Italy, so he's already had experience and is now coming to the Premier League. He has a great skillset for such a big guy. He's got a great technical skillset and a great intuition of play, he can be very creative and I think he really fits well into this club.\"",

      "Manchester United are looking to secure the signing of Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte before the summer transfer window closes on August 30.",
      "Personal terms have been agreed with the Uruguayan for some time but agreeing a transfer fee with PSG for the midfielder has been a sticking point. Another potential obstacle is the future of Scott McTominay with Ugarte's arrival at Old Trafford said to be contingent on his departure.",
      "But if a deal can be agreed for the 23-year-old, Erik ten Hag may have his most important summer signing. Ugarte's impact on Kobbie Mainoo's game may be transformative for the teenager and United's midfield.",
      "Mainoo is widely regarded as a generational talent and one of the best players to come through United's academy in years. A 19-year-old doesn't get called up to the England squad at Euro 2024 unless they are a special talent.",
      "However, despite enjoying a breakthrough season in 2023/24 in which Mainoo emerged as United's great saviour, one flaw emerged. The ageing and labouring Casemiro in midfield struggled badly in his second season at United.",
      "The Brazilian's lack of mobility often saw huge gaps in midfield as the Reds were exposed repeatedly, leading to a huge number of shots on Andre Onana's goal. Only relegated Sheffield United conceded more shots in the Premier League last season.",
      "And Mainoo's game was impacted, with the Stockport midfielder needing to offer greater protection to United's back four, limiting his ability to influence the attacking play. In fairness to Casemiro, the 32-year-old has looked much improved in the early stages of 24/25 but he cannot be relied upon for another gruelling campaign.",
      "It's why signing Ugarte is so important to unlocking Mainoo's full potential. The Uruguay international will be able to do a lot of the defensive work in midfielder which will free up Mainoo to have a greater impact in attack.",
      "United will no longer be limited in how their midfield functions with greater mobility to cover the spaces which Casemiro could not do. With Ugarte's arrival, Ten Hag's team will finally have what they have missed so badly.",

      "Manchester United would prefer a permanent sale of Hannibal Mejbri before the transfer deadline.",
      "The one-year extension in Hannibal's contract was triggered in December, which means he's entered the final year of his deal and United are looking to offload him this summer. Burnley are interested in signing Hannibal and are exploring a permanent deal or a loan with an obligation to buy, but United's preference would be to sell him permanently.",
      "Hannibal started against Burnley at Turf Moor in the Premier League in September and clocked 12.9 kilometres during the game, which was a record for a United player since they began gathering the data in 2019, and more distance than anyone else on the pitch that night.",
      "Hannibal looked to have broken into the first-team fold at one stage but was taken out of the side and his start against Burnley was the only time he made the league XI last season.",
      "Sources described 'wide interest' in both loan and permanent transfers for Hannibal last summer, but the decision was taken to keep him around Erik ten Hag's squad following a promising loan spell with Birmingham in 2022-23 that saw the Tunisian make 41 appearances in all competitions.",
      "United fought off interest from Tottenham, Barcelona and Bayern Munich to sign a young Hannibal from Monaco in a deal worth £9million in 2019. The 21-year-old progressed through the youth ranks and won United's Denzil Haroun Reserve-Team Player of the Year award for his performances in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "United hoped Hannibal would develop into a first-team starter, but he's been unable to nail down a regular starting place and his opportunities under Ten Hag became limited. Hannibal joined Sevilla on a six-month loan in the January transfer window and the Spaniards had the option to sign him permanently for £17million. But the move didn't go to plan as Hannibal managed just 100 minutes across six appearances and the option wasn't triggered.",
      "Hannibal's loan got off to a bizarre start when Sevilla announced he wouldn't be considered for selection just over a week after his arrival and the picture gradually got murkier. There were claims of differences between Hannibal and manager Quique Sánchez Flores and a suggestion he had a bust-up with a teammate during a training session.",
      "But Sevilla's president denied those reports, praised Hannibal's character and he was reintegrated into their squad. United and Birmingham sources have previously given Hannibal a glowing character appraisal and he is known to stay late at Carrington to complete extra work after training.",

Mazraoui made his full debut in the 1-0 victory against Fulham on Friday and Zirkzee scored the matchwinner from off the bench.",

Yoro was unveiled to the Old Trafford crowd before the game and he stood on crutches following a successful surgery on the metatarsal injury that he sustained in pre-season.",
      "The young defender, who was signed from Lille for an initial €62m, is expected to return to action in October and will attempt to help United qualify for Champions League football again. That is the minimum target for Ten Hag and Guardiola recently told reporters he expects United to be in contention for top four and to have 'momentum' after their summer transfers.",
      "“Always at the beginning of the season, the first target is to finish in the top four,” Guardiola said about the tough competition in the Premier League this season. “People say: ‘Oh, come on’, I say ‘no’. Newcastle are not in Europe, and are going to play one game a week. Newcastle with one game a week this season will be the Newcastle of two seasons ago.",

      "United finished eighth in the Premier League last term, which represented their worst finish in the top flight, and were eight points adrift from the Champions League places. The bookmakers have made City, Arsenal, Liverpool and United their favourites to finish in the top four, with Chelsea and Tottenham priced as the most likely after that.",

      "Manchester United have issued a statement in support of their former midfielder Angel Gomes after he was hospitalised due to a severe head injury sustained while playing for French side Lille.",
      "The Reds academy graduate was contesting an aerial ball when he collided with Reims defender Amadou Kone which resulted in his dismissal from the game. Gomes's teammates formed a protective circle around the former United star and fans from both sides chanted his name for a lengthy period.",
      "After being stretchered off, Gomes was transported by ambulance and the match restarted after 34 minutes. United's statement following the incident read: \"Everyone at Manchester United is sending best wishes to former Reds midfielder Angel Gomes, who suffered a serious head injury while playing for Lille on Saturday.\"",
      "Following Lille's update which confirmed he had regained consciousness, United wrote on X: \"Sending love and strength to Angel Gomes, who has been taken to hospital following a collision while playing for Lille. We’re thinking of you, Angel.\"",
      "After the game, Lille manager Bruno Genesio spoke to the media about the incident and delivered an update on Gomes's condition. \"The latest news is rather reassuring, but it's better to be careful,\" he said.",
      "\"Angel asked if he was going to play [next] Saturday. It's a good sign if he has a sense of humour. The match was secondary for me tonight. Angel was conscious when he was carried out.",
      "\"I know he spoke, he asked about the result, he showed he's in good spirits, but I think we have to wait a bit.\"",
      "Lille went on to win 2-0 and after the match, his teammates posed with a shirt adorning the message: 'Courage Angel'.",
      "Gomes left United in 2020, joining the French club before spending a season on loan in Portugal, with Boavista. Despite being hailed as one of the most promising talents of this century by United's academy staff, he struggled to secure a regular spot at the senior level at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",
      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",
      "Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "For Manchester United's current holding midfielder, the opening weekend of the Premier League season was an improvement. A leaner-looking Casemiro showed glimpses of encouragement to suggest the obituaries penned for his career in Europe can be filed away for a little longer yet.",
      "But what stood about the 32-year-old was his quality on the ball. One of the standout moments for the United midfielder was the pass he threaded to Bruno Fernandes to create the best chance of the first half.",
      "Casemiro's passing has always been an underrated aspect of his game and one that he has displayed more at United than he ever needed to at Real Madrid. But primarily his job is to hold the fort at the base of midfield and he found that difficult last season.",
      "That is why United are looking at long-term replacements and Uruguay international Manuel Ugarte is likely to fill that position this season. The 23-year-old has been top of United's wishlist all summer and there is growing confidence a deal will be done with Paris St-Germain before the transfer window closes on June 30.",
      "Ugarte is an aggressive, physical holding midfielder with a big engine. He will be able to get through more work than Casemiro and cover more ground, allowing United to shift another midfielder closer to Fernandes. That could even be Casemiro, or more likely Kobbie Mainoo, over Mason Mount. It could even be a couple of them if Fernandes plays in the front three.",
      "It would give Ten Hag an embarrassment of riches in central areas but it does feel like Ugarte might be the final piece of the jigsaw. Casemiro made an excellent fist of that in a more defensive-minded United side in Ten Hag's first season, but the progression didn't materialise last season because of his struggles.",
      "Ten Hag has always envisaged a connecting player between his holding midfielder and Fernandes. It was the role he earmarked for Frenkie De Jong and now it looks ideal for Mainoo. The presence of Ugarte would allow the academy graduate a little more freedom.",
      "One of Ugarte's strengths at Sporting and PSG is his ability to cover large areas of the pitch. He has excelled as a sole holding player because of that.",
      "Across the last year in Europe's big five leagues and in UEFA competitions, Ugarte is in the 99th percentile for midfielders in the metric of tackles per 90 minutes, averaging 4.19. Joao Palinha, one of the best in the business in this position last season, came in top with 5.07.",
      "The aggressive Ugarte certainly loves a tackle, but he can read the game too as well. He is in the 97th percentile for interceptions for midfielders, with 1.89 per 90 minutes. Those are the attributes United need to be able to push another midfielder forward.",
      "The addition of Ugarte - and United are increasingly confident they will land him this summer - would be another significant moment for Ten Hag. He would have the new goalkeeper he wants, a centre-back pairing he signed, a workaholic holding midfielder and two strikers he wanted.",
      "This is a team increasingly moulded in his image and as he looks to make his United team more attacking, Ugarte could unlock a little more potential.",

      "However, that fee is deemed too 'high' by the United hierarchy and therefore, the club are 'prepared to bide their time' which might force a reduction in price, according to The Guardian. It's claimed that there is no need for any outgoings to finance the sale, though.",
      "Ugarte meanwhile, is believed to have already agreed terms with United, who was left out of PSG's 4-1 win at Le Havre in their opening Ligue 1 game of the season. He is no longer part of Luis Enrique's plans and given United are the most interested in his services, the French champions could be forced to sell at a lower price.",
      "Elsewhere, Victor Lindelof is attracting interest from Fiorentina, according to Corriere Fiorentino. However, his wages are said to be a stumbling block which could prevent a transfer.",

      "\"A great feeling, a great feeling, it couldn’t be any better,\" he said. Zirkzee was incredibly laidback in his first interview with club media last month and was equally relaxed when speaking to reporters, despite having scored the winner at Old Trafford around an hour previously.",
      "\"What can I say? Debut, winning, scoring in front of the Stretford End, so yeah, it’s unbelievable,\" Zirkzee added. Most players would still be riding the crest of the wave when speaking in the mixed zone after scoring on their debut but it was as if the 23-year-old had just played in a park.",
      "Some may interpret Zirkzee doesn't care because of his laidback nature but it's part of his charm - there won't be an occasion that fazes him and that will help at the world's biggest club.",
      "United are the most scrutinised team in the world and Zirkzee looks tailor-made to deal with the pressure, simply because he chooses not to feel it. \"Where does this moment rank? Somewhere between my debuts and it’s a bit below winning the Champions League with Bayern and my national team debut, but it’s up there,\" he said with an endearing grin on his face.",
      "\"I'm just trying to be the best version I can be, help the team and club, so no specific goals.\" However, Zirkzee does want to start for United and many believed he should have featured in the Community Shield last weekend, a game in which even Jadon Sancho was used in.",
      "\"I’m sure the manager had a good reason for it, I’m not too difficult with these things. It’s his choice and today, my debut, wasn’t too bad,\" Zirkzee replied about that decision.",
      "So is he a natural goalscorer? \"I’m not going to talk about myself like that, but it was a good touch today, so hopefully more of that,\" said Zirkzee. \"Not really [doesn't come naturally], it’s something you really have to work for and my role is probably what works best for the team.",
      "\"I’m a striker that’s comfortable coming in deep and helping the team play football, so it doesn’t really matter. This was my game in Italy [dropping in deep positions] and previously in Anderlecht, so that could be an option but if the manager needs me to do something else, I’m here.\"",
      "Zirkzee became the sixth Dutchman to score on his Old Trafford debut for United after Jordi Cruyff, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Robin van Persie, Alexander Buttner and Donny van de Beek.",
      "The goal extended United's opening day record in the Premier League - they have won more opening games than any other team - and also provided Zirkzee with 'relief'.",
      "\"I mean yeah, first game, first goal, it’s always a relief to have that off your shoulders, but it goes on,\" he explained. \"I saw the replay of my goal and it didn’t look too bad.\"",
      "United paid €42.5million (£35.8m) to sign Zirkzee from Bologna this summer and he made the best possible start to vindicating that investment by scoring the winner against Fulham.",
      "\"Why Manchester United?,\" he laughed. \"For some people, it might be crazy, but for me, this is the biggest club in the world, so it wasn’t a difficult choice to make, to be honest.\"",
      "Zirkzee is being coached by Ruud van Nistelrooy at Carrington and he described the opportunity to work with the legendary former striker as a privilege. \"Yeah, it’s a privilege to have someone like that. As a striker, it’s not every day you have someone that you grew up watching,\" he said.",
      "\"That’s pretty much it, but everybody in the staff up to now has been great and I enjoy working with these people a lot. It’s not just him, but obviously it’s an extra privilege.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy is a familiar face to Zirkzee, given he idolised him as a child, but he has established friendships with United's latest signings, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "\"I mean they’re two great players and we’ll see in the future what they can bring,\" said Zirkzee, who played with both players during his time spent with Bayern Munich.",
      "\"I’m sure they’ll do a lot of great things here. I think Mazaroui had a great game today as well and I think De Ligt came in with a lot of good energy as well, so yeah, it’s good to have familiar faces around, but everybody in the team has been very kind and it’s top being part of this group.",
      "\"He [Mazraoui] arrived this week and it’s not easy to come into a team and play the way he did. I think it all looked natural and that was the most special part of his game today.",
      "\"But yeah, that’s just the player he is, he’s there to do his job and perform the best way he can and I think he did great today… and I'm not just saying that because he’s my friend!\"",
      "Most United fans will want Zirkzee to start against Brighton next weekend and in the meantime, they might find him walking his dog around the leafy suburbs of Manchester.",
      "\"I don’t do much, I have my dog, I take him for a walk and sit in the house and watch a TV series, play PlayStation or do whatever,\" he said about his hobbies. \"I’ve just finished The Umbrella Academy on Netflix and it wasn’t too good of an ending but I enjoyed it, it was good.\"",
      "If Zirkzee was any more laidback he'd be horizontal - he can deal with the pressure of United.",

      "And when the full-time whistle was blown, Ronaldo chose not to stick around and receive a runners-up medal. The Portuguese cut a frustrated figure throughout the contest and he won't have liked the celebration from Al Hilal captain Salem Al-Dawsari when he lifted the trophy.",
      "Salem chose to bob from side to side as he made his way in front of his teammates before hoisting the trophy aloft. It was a carbon copy of what Ronaldo's rival Lionel Messi did at the 2022 World Cup when he led Argentina to a penalty shootout victory over France in the final.",
      "Saturday's result caps off a frustrating summer for Ronaldo. The 39-year-old played every game for Portugal at Euro 2024 but struggled badly having failed to find the net before seeing his nation knocked out by France on penalties in the quarter-finals.",
      "Ronaldo left United under a cloud in 2022 after a controversial interview with Piers Morgan where he criticised United boss Erik ten Hag and the standards at Old Trafford. He joined Al-Nassr on 30 December that year where he has gone on to win the Arab Club Champions Cup.",
      "However, despite scoring 66 goals in 72 games, Ronaldo is yet to win the Saudi Pro League. His team finished 14 points behind Al-Hilal in last season's title race, but despite their struggles former United team-mate Rio Ferdinand recently claimed that their star forward isn't going anywhere.",

      "Manchester United could sign their third Bayern Munich player of the summer and their former midfield target in one fell swoop after the German giants put Leon Goretzka up for sale",
      "Fabrizio Romano reports Bayern will make it clear to Goretzka that he will not have a starting role under new manager Vincent Kompany this season. With the German international surplus to requirements, it would make sense for last year’s Bundesliga runners-up to cash in on the box-to-box midfielder.",
      "There has not yet been any reported interest from United’s part regarding the 29-year-old. But that could well change as the Red Devils are currently in the market for a similar profile of player.",
      "Erik ten Hag’s current options in the centre of the pitch are Kobbie Mainoo, Scott McTominay, Mason Mount and ageing duo Christian Eriksen and Casemiro. Goretzka is currently in his prime and offers dynamism in midfield, capable of playing in a three and in a double-pivot.",
      "Should United make a successful approach, Goretzka would astonishingly become their third Bayern signing this summer. It comes after they secured a double swoop of defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui for a combined sum of over £50m last week.",
      "The move may not be as simple as it may seem initially, though, with Goretzka repeatedly insisting his desire is to stay at Bayern due to his love for the club and the city. Yet he would be forced out should a tantalising enough offer come in, as Bayern will look to cash in on him before his contract ends in 2026.",
      "United also have other targets who play in the same position, such as Burnley’s Sander Berge and PSG’s Manuel Ugarte, who are valued at £30m and £52m respectively. Goretzka, however, was a target last summer at Old Trafford and towards the backend of last year, with reports claiming United had “never lost focus on Goretzka” after he fell out of favour with at-the-time Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Goretzka signed for Bayern in 2019 as a 22-year-old with expectations on his shoulders. His career in Bavaria has often been blighted by injuries and his progress hampered as a result of falling down the pecking order under a merry-go-round of new managers.",
      "He played a key role in Bayern’s historic sextuple-winning season in 2019/20, however. And last season was one of his most productive to date, featuring in 42 games across all competitions, scoring six and setting up 11.",
      "Vincent Kompany's brutal stance on Goretzka also comes just 12 months after club chief Christoph Freund branded him a dressing room leader, saying: \"Leon is an absolute top player, which he has consistently proven at the highest level over many years. In the past few weeks, he has shown strong performances in various positions, playing with a broken hand – that shows his great mentality. Leon is a leader who always leads the way on the pitch and takes responsibility even in difficult situations.\"",
      "However, Ugarte remains United's No 1 target and they want to sign him if PSG lower their demands, while the club have submitted an offer for Burnley's Berge, which is said to be below their £30m valuation, according to the Daily Mail.",

The latter completed his move to Old Trafford last week as part of a double swoop from Bayern Munich that saw Noussair Mazraoui pen terms in the north west.",
      "There is still more work to be done, more cover in the left full-back department due to the persistent injury issues for Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia. One of the most important pieces of business came within the squad as Bruno Fernandes signed a new three-year deal, keeping him at the club until 2027 with the option of a further year.",
      "The skipper faced uncertainty over his future after Bayern Munich and Inter Milan began to lurk following United's worst top-flight showing in 30 years, as they finished eighth. The campaign was salvaged by their heroics in the FA Cup final, with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo on target in an unlikely win over rivals Manchester City.",
      "Mainoo was one of the breakout stars for Ten Hag last season, but with the glimmer of light he provided, there were some difficult performances from those featuring alongside him. Casemiro faced criticism, namely from the likes of Jamie Carragher, for his showing after a dark display in a chastening defeat away at Crystal Palace towards the end of the season.",
      "Scott McTominay popped up with pivotal goals but was never far away from scrutiny of his own. This summer, the Scotland international has been the topic of interest from the Premier League and clubs around Europe.",
      "On Monday, the Daily Mail reported that Fulham have revived talks with United over the midfielder; Serie A side Napoli are also interested, but Antonio Conte's side would prefer a temporary move for McTominay. The Cottagers have already seen a £20millon bid rejected, it has been reported, but United do face a race against time to offload the midfielder should they wish to do so.",
      "With one year remaining on his contract, United could lose him on a free, but that option is somewhat alleviated as there is currently the clause to extend by a further year installed in his current deal. McTominay found himself used as an impact substitute during stages of last season, proving his importance to the Dutchman, but only managed six minutes during Friday's season opener against Fulham.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has been fiercely linked with a move to the Premier League as his future at Paris Saint-Germain remains uncertain. The Uruguayan was left out of the squad for their season opener against Le Havre on Friday, with reports suggesting throughout the summer that he had agreed to a deal to make the move to the English top-flight.",
      "The defensive midfielder would provide stability in front of the back four and would be a welcome partner to Mainoo while having the possibility to unlock Fernandes. In the season opener, due to the injury issues up front, the Portugal international was deployed as a striker.",
      "Fernandes could be moved further back in place of Mason Mount as Ten Hag deployed a 4-2-3-1. Sander Berge of Burnley has also emerged as an option in midfield and should they fail to meet Ugarte's £52million price-tag, the Norwegian could be a cheap alternative.",
      "Berge has missed the start of the season through injury, according to Clarets manager Scott Parker. The 26-year-old has Premier League and English football experience, attracting links with Liverpool, and could offer a defensive option.",

      "What Manuel Ugarte and Jadon Sancho did on Friday night remains unknown, but what they didn't do is play football for the clubs that pay their wages. Ugarte was left out of Paris St-Germain's squad for their opening Ligue 1 game and the same fate befell Sancho against Fulham.",
      "After a summer reconciliation with Erik ten Hag, the winger might have expected to be among the 20 players named in the squad at the start of the season, but he was deemed surplus to requirements. It has felt an uneasy truce and although Ten Hag claimed illness was the reason for Sancho's absence, a departure before the end of the window still cannot be ruled out.",
      "In Paris, PSG could certainly do with selling Ugarte. They have spent €60m on signing 19-year-old Joao Neves as part of a €170m spending spree and the Uruguayan is likely to be the fall guy just a year after joining from Sporting. Kylian Mbappe's wages are a cost-saving but PSG's net spend across the last two summers is more than €400m.",
      "That makes their situation around financial fair play rules pretty tight and sales are a necessity. United have been interested in Ugarte, 23, all summer but have struggled to agree a fee with the club. The holding midfielder is desperate to make the move to Old Trafford and United remain confident of doing a deal given PSG's situation.",
      "But United are in a tight spot themselves when it comes to FFP rules and the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability regulations. They haven't sold as many players as they would have expected and their net spend is around £88.5m this summer, which doesn't give them a lot of wriggle room.",
      "The failure to move on Casemiro has contributed to that while a market never really developed for Sancho before he buried the hatchet with Ten Hag. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen are the midfielders United wanted to sell, but they might now have to cash in on Scott McTominay.",
      "There is another solution and it's one we saw in the Premier League before the latest PSR deadline of June 30, when clubs close to breaching the rules agreed transfer deals with each other. Aston Villa, Everton and Chelsea all signed and sold academy graduates to each other to get around potential issues.",
      "With PSG holding some interest in Sancho, the two clubs could engineer a swap deal that might help both balance the books this summer, while also getting rid of a player they might not want for another who does fit the bill.",
      "PSG are shorn of marquee names since the departures of Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi and while Sancho is not in their league, he would still be considered a coup. They had held an interest in signing English players previously and have enquired about Marcus Rashford before. Sancho's best performance last season came against PSG for Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "With Alejandro Garnacho and Amad taking a step forward this season, United can cope without Sancho, but they do need another midfielder and Ugarte is the priority target. He is the player they have identified as the long-term replacement for Casemiro.",
      "In the modern era, when spending rules are beginning to bite and leagues are baring their teeth when it comes to punishments, clubs must get inventive. We saw that in the Premier League this summer, we see it with obligations to buy and Chelsea attempted something similar with long contracts.",
      "For United, signing the one remaining player they really want this summer could involve a solution from outside the box as well. Sancho might just provide it.",

Injuries have ravaged through United's ranks in the position with Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia on the treatment table and while there is a timeframe, there is always the challenge of getting up to speed with the Premier League intensity as well as forcing the returnee back is likely to spark more issues.",

      "Having made light work of Newcastle United in their opening Premier League fixture of the 2010/11 campaign, winning 3-0 at Old Trafford, Manchester United travelled to the capital the following weekend with ambitions of scooping another three points.",
      "Goals from Dimitar Berbatov, Darren Fletcher and Ryan Giggs had sealed a comfortable opening day triumph over the Magpies at Old Trafford and a road trip to Craven Cottage looked like another enticing opportunity to get maximum points on the board.",
      "Having taken an 11th-minute lead through Paul Scholes, United's army of travelling supporters in the Putney End were confident of enjoying another comfortable afternoon watching their team.",
      "However, Fulham, who were under the stewardship of Roy Hodgson at the time, hit back 12 minutes after half-time through Simon Davies. It was nothing more than what the hosts had deserved and United knew they were locked in a battle for maximum points.",
      "But when Cottagers defender Brede Hangeland turned the ball into his own net with just six minutes of regulation time remaining, United looked on course to preserve their 100 per cent start to the season. Just moments later, the Reds were given a golden opportunity to make sure of the points once and for all.",
      "After Damien Duff sliced his own clearance, the ball struck his own arm. A penalty was awarded and United were given the opportunity to wrap up the game from 12 yards.",
      "Giggs, who had stepped off the substitutes bench a little over 10 minutes earlier, was United's designated penalty taker at the time and looked set to place the ball down on the spot. However, Giggs handed the ball to Nani, who had forced Duff's error to win the spot-kick.",
      "The Portuguese international stepped up and saw his effort saved by Fulham goalkeeper David Stockdale. It was a relatively easy strike for Stockdale to react to, palming it away to his right-hand side.",
      "No doubt preparing himself to face the wrath of Sir Alex Ferguson for his failure to convert from 12 yards, Nani's fears of a tongue-lashing from the former United manager worsened when Hangeland atoned for his error, scoring at the right end in the 89th-minute to earn Fulham a point.",
      "It was an action-packed conclusion to the game that saw Hangeland at the centre of the drama. Whereas the former defender had looked set to leave the hero as a villain, it was Nani who was in the firing line.",
      "\"That day he [Ferguson] was so mad at me,\" Nani said. \"But he preferred to kill Giggs, because he had the ball and was the most experienced player on the field.",
      "\"But because I was playing so well and I won the penalty, I wanted to score it. Giggs saw that and said 'yeah, take it' – but then I missed.",
      "\"When we went to the dressing room, Sir Alex was shouting at Giggs, saying 'Why did you do that?' and then said to me 'Nani, you'll never take penalties anymore'.\"",
      "As is still the case when United play in London, the squad made the trip back north after the stalemate on the banks of the Thames by train. They alighted the service in Macclesfield - roughly 20 miles south of Manchester - and Ferguson was in need of a lift home.",
      "Living next door to Ferguson at the time, Nani was tasked with the responsibility of chauffeuring the legendary Scot. Having missed from the penalty spot to wrap up three points just hours earlier, the now-37-year-old could have been forgiven for fearing an ear-bashing.",

      "\"When we got in the car, we were not talking for one minute. I was waiting for him to say something to me but he didn't.",

      "How does it feel to play for Manchester United in front of thousands of fans at just 17 years old?",
      "Just ask Harry Amass, who started against Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool on tour in the USA.",
      "\"I enjoy it, man,\" he said. \"In front of the crowds, playing with the best players, I’m enjoying it. You’ve just got to show your aggressive side. You might be young, smaller than the opponent, but you have to show you are aggressive and don’t back down. Then you can have a good game.\"",
      "Amass spoke to Manchester-based reporters in the mixed zone in the Snapdragon Stadium last week and a start against Liverpool in Columbia followed that conversation.",
      "The youngster was asked about a potential start in the Community Shield against Manchester City and said: \"No conversations have been had yet, but this pre-season is a chance to prove that if I am picked I can do it. Obviously we’ll see what happens when Luke [Shaw] and Tyrell [Malacia] come back.",
      "\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career. I am just waiting for that moment, I am ready.\"",
      "Luke Shaw started for England in the final of the European Championship against Spain and has been given an extended break, while Tyrell Malacia is still recovering from injury.",
      "Malacia last played a competitive fixture for the Netherlands in June last year and has faced a prolonged period on the sidelines due to a knee injury, which required two rounds of surgery.",
      "The 24-year-old is expected to be available again in two months, which opens the door for Amass, and the London-born full-back intends to capitalise on the opportunity.",
      "After just one year at United, Amass has already drawn comparisons to Shaw, who swapped the South for the North himself when he was a teenager. \"It is a good comparison,\" he said.",
      "\"In my opinion, [Shaw is] one of the best left-backs in the Premier League, if not the best for a long time. So I am not gonna complain at the comparisons!\"",
      "United thought Shaw had the quality to play at Old Trafford for 10 years when he was signed from Southampton in 2014 and they recognised similar potential in Amass when he was signed from Watford last summer, a move that was considered a coup given the interest from other clubs.",
      "Amass was persuaded to sign for United and hasn't looked back. He was tremendous for the Under-18s last season, playing a key role in a supremely talented team that won a treble, and is now on the cusp of making his senior debut after delivering mature pre-season performances.",
      "Anyone who has watched Amass will understand there can be no concerns about his ability, talent or mentality. He is a technically exceptional, modern-day full-back, but the only question mark against the youngster was whether he was physical enough for senior football.",
      "Amass is diminutive but proved himself on the pre-season tour. His 'aggression' compensates for his lack of stature and he got the better of Mohamed Salah at the weekend.",
      "Malacia won't be involved in the squad for the Community Shield against City on Saturday and Shaw won't have the fitness to play 90 minutes at Wembley.",
      "Amass is almost guaranteed to be involved in some capacity and that will highlight his impressive progress in the space of just a few months, as the youngster only got close to the pitch when he warmed up on the sidelines when he was last at Wembley for the FA Cup semi-final.",
      "Erik ten Hag named Amass, Ethan Wheatley, Habeeb Ogunneye and Louis Jackson on a handful of benches at the end of last season due to the injury crisis and any observers would have noticed how slight they looked, which is normal at their age, in the pre-match warm-ups.",
      "However, what Amass lacks in physicality, he makes up for in character, aggression and talent, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see him start against City in the Community Shield.",

      "\"Quite a few of us wanted it and we had a bit of banter about it!\" Wheatley says of the 250 milestone. He is stood with Amass and Collyer, both smiling ruefully in the Snapdragon Stadium mixed zone.",
      "Southerners Collyer and Amass are doing their utmost to extend the number to 251 as soon as possible. United expect Collyer, Amass and Wheatley to remain with the squad beyond the transfer window.",
      "Collyer, 20, has started in three of United's four pre-season games and strapped on the captain's armband for the second half against Rosenborg. The 17-year-old Amass has lined up in both tour games in the United States.",
      "Left back Amass followed up his invaluable 45 minutes against Arsenal in Los Angeles, where he was blindsided by Gabriel Jesus for the equalising goal, with a complete performance against Real Betis in San Diego. He capped it with an assist for Amad and drew approval from the crowd with his tenacious tackling.",
      "\"I enjoy it, man,\" the Londoner says. \"In front of the crowds, playing with the best players, I’m enjoying it. You’ve just got to show your aggressive side, you might be young, smaller than the opponent, but you have to show you are aggressive and don’t back down. Then you can have a good game.\"",
      "Amass only joined the United academy from Watford last year. Such was his importance during the run-in last season, Erik ten Hag checked on his well-being in the Carrington canteen when the academy squad returned from their title-clinching win at Wolves in April.",
      "Luke Shaw only played 15 times for United last term and Tyrell Malacia's absence from club football is nearing 15 months. Amass could conceivably start the Community Shield against Manchester City on Saturday.",
      "\"No conversations have been had yet,\" he admits, \"but this pre-season is a chance to prove that if I am picked I can do it. Obviously we’ll see what happens when Luke and Tyrell come back. My intention is to play first team football at this club.",
      "\"I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career. I am just waiting for that moment, I am ready.\"",
      "Diminutive, fleet-footed and attack-minded, there are obvious parallels with the great Barcelona and Spain left back Jordi Alba. Shaw is another Cockney left back who has settled in Manchester for a decade.",
      "Amass approves of that comparison. \"It is a good comparison. In my opinion one of the best left-backs in the Premier League, if not the best for a long time. So I am not gonna complain about the comparison!\"",
      "\"We have to make progress,\" Ten Hag said on Amass. \"But we all see here a potential where we have seen in previous years, for instance two years ago, Garnacho last season. We had it during last season with Kobbie, but he (Amass) is not that far now at this moment. But if we train him well, if we coach him well, then in three months it's possible that he can be on that point.",
      "\"But in this moment he needs to catch up and he has to develop some skills already to play for Manchester United, competing for the highest positions in the league. But with big talent it can go up very quickly and that is very interesting to see if he is capable of doing this.\"",
      "Collyer, signed from Brighton as an 18-year-old two years ago, trained under Ten Hag as early as September 2022. He is one of only three academy players whose contract signing Ten Hag insisted on attending. The other two were Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"I think it's a massive boost,\" Collyer says of Ten Hag's attendance for his signing ceremony. \"It shows obviously he rates me as a player. Just onwards and upwards really, just got to give my best every day and see what happens.\"",
      "Collyer came on for half-an-hour at the Snapdragon Stadium and thwarted Betis twice in injury time with valiant interventions. He has acquitted himself impressively and United need to bring down the average age of their midfield department.",
      "\"When you're on the bench I think it's really valuable just to be in and around it, experience what it's like on a matchday,\" Collyer explains. \"In the changing room, on the bench, with a crowd, getting used to it. Now I've managed to get quite a lot of minutes in pre-season, so I'm happy.",
      "\"I'd say with me, a lot of my work is off the ball as well. Predominantly, I'm a really busy player, I like to get about the pitch and an area of my game I'd like to improve on is in possession. So I think the only way you're going to get better is by demanding the ball, getting on it and not backing away from situations when you could.\"",
      "Ten Hag made a beeline for Mainoo after United's League Cup victory last year and back at Wembley 15 months later, did likewise with Collyer after United won the FA Cup. \"He just said take it all in, enjoy myself and keep working hard and you never know what can happen,\" Collyer reveals.",
      "\"He's a really good guy, the manager. With everyone, he tells you what he wants from each player, he tries his best to help you out, as well as with the other coaching staff as well.",
      "\"At the end of the day, they do everything for us and we have to put it out on the pitch and give everything for them.\"",
      "Stockport-born Wheatley was one of a handful of positives from the listless defeat to Rosenborg last month. He can expect to continue training with the first team amid Rasmus Hojlund's six-week absence with a hamstring strain.",
      "\"I'm just taking everything as it comes, to be honest,\" he cautions. \"Obviously, I had a little taste of it last season. This season, I just want to keep my head down, keep developing as a player and keep impressing, so hopefully get more chances.",
      "\"The club, its history is of bringing through loads of academy players, the likes of Kobbie, playing with us less than a year ago and breaking into the first team, inspires us and motivates us. Because we know the pathway is there. If we impress, get the chances that will be given at this club we'll take them.\"",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy has not rejoined United as a striker coach but Wheatley, born in the same year that Van Nistelrooy left United, is picking his brains. \"I think especially since Ruud came in, obviously he was a top striker, he was probably one of the best strikers we've had at the club.",

      "Manchester United have a number of areas that need to be improved, but the club selected three priority areas this summer.",
      "A striker and a centre-back have arrived, while it is thought that Erik ten Hag is closing in on a new midfielder, Manuel Ugarte. While Leny Yoro’s three-month setback could push United into another centre-half signing this window, other positions may need some attention.",
      "One of those is left-back, given how injuries decimated options there last season. Luke Shaw is back to fitness but only played 15 matches last term due to issues and is yet to go through a full season at United without injury.",
      "Meanwhile, Tyrell Malacia is not expected to return until October, having not played in more than a year due to setbacks in his rehabilitation from serious surgery. Sergio Reguilon was acquired on loan last deadline day but returned to Tottenham in January after Ten Hag ended his stay early, with Shaw and Malacia both expected back soon. That never happened.",
      "As a result, Diogo Dalot, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and even Victor Lindelof had to cover in the role with full-back options stretched. Sorting another loan this summer to cover for Malacia would be sensible.",
      "But meanwhile, academy recruit Harry Amass has impressed so far in pre-season, most notably against Real Betis. The 17-year-old joined from Watford last August with big hopes for the future, and the first fruits of his potential are starting to show.",
      "A few first-team stints this coming season followed by consistent progress, and United might not need to find a new left-back when Shaw’s contract runs out in 2027, saving a good few million. For now, third-choice at United is an ample status, and the reality is that the team might still need more experienced cover at left-back via a loanee until Malacia returns.",
      "Another area of debate is the right-wing position. On paper, United have a number of options there, with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford able to play in the role, Alejandro Garnacho too, albeit to limited effect.",
      "In reality, the spot has hardly been nailed down in Ten Hag’s tenure, with Antony underwhelming his £85m price tag, Rashford preferring the left flank far more, and Sancho falling out with the manager, a feud that has now been quashed.",
      "There has been good reason to suggest that the right wing needs a new addition, but United need not bother. Amad can save United a good few quid in the short term with his assets from the right, as shown against Real Betis.",
      "His breakaway goal against Liverpool in last season’s FA Cup tie showed the raw talent he has, something that former Sunderland boss Tony Mowbray was never shy to underline during Amad’s 14-goal loan spell at the Black Cats two seasons ago.",
      "Amad has now scored twice in pre-season, for what that is worth. His goal against Rangers might have felt sweet given his torrid former prior loan spell in Scotland.",
      "But it was against Real Betis that he showed what he can do when he has minutes under his belt, scoring United’s second of the game after winning a penalty for their first. After recovering from a long-term injury in time for the second half of the season, Amad only managed to start the final three league games.",
      "Now 22, the attacker has the confidence and ability to show he can challenge and perhaps usurp Antony on the right for more starts. Either way, his resurgence has saved United from forking out millions for another",

      "The setting - in front of just 829 fans at an overcast Prenton Park - belied the enormity of the occassion. This was United's first competitive game in 13 years, their first competitive outing since the Glazer regime opted to disband their senior women's team after deeming it not to be part of the club's \"core business\".",
      "The team was peppered with familar faces. Alex Greenwood, now captain of Manchester City, teed up Arnot to score the winner. Lauren James, who returned to childhood club Chelsea for what was - in 2021 - a British record fee, started in midfield, while current United stars Ella Toone, Millie Turner and Leah Galton also featured.",
      "\"For a team that has only been together for six weeks they weathered the storm quite well,\" manager Casey Stoney told BBC Radio 5 Live after the game.",
      "\"I recruited from the second tier, they've stepped up and shown they are more than capable of playing a level above that. There's no pressure from the club to get promotion but these players want to be playing in the top flight. They're history makers now.\"",
      "In spite of Stoney's measured assessment of United's ambitions, the Reds did achieve promotion at the first time of asking, subsequently finishing fourth in their first season in the Women's Super League (WSL). And now, just six years on from that League Cup victory over Liverpool, United are a card-carrying member of the top flight's elite.",
      "Stoney's departure in the summer of 2021 was a blow but her replacement, former Birmingham City boss Marc Skinner, has presided over the most successful period in the club's history. In 2022/23, the Reds took the title race to the final day, posting a club-record points tally in the process while also reaching the FA Cup final.",

      "While the Reds have come a tremendously long way since then, it is fair to say this summer has not been without its challenges. First came the revelataion that Skinner had been handed a one-year contract extension - a decision which was not universally popular with the United fanbase.",
      "Then came the exodus of some of the club's biggest stars. England goalkeeper Mary Earps left to join Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), citing United's transitional state and her own ambition to compete for more silverware as her chief motivating factors. Club captain Katie Zelem also departed on a free transfer, as did fan-favourite striker Lucia Garcia.",
      "All of this unfolded has against the backdrop of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's barely concealed apathy towards Skinner's side. The INEOS chief gave a tone-deaf interview to Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "This was swiftly followed by United Women being ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp, though it is understood Skinner and his players will still have access to all the necessary facilities.",
      "Still, the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United have been concerning.",
      "That said, the Reds have recruited shrewdly in the transfer market, with the acquisition of Brighton & Hove Albion striker Elisabeth Terland and Swedish defender Anna Sandberg, in particular, inspiring excitement, while the appointment of Dan Ashworth as sporting director inspires hope of tangible change at the club.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said in an open letter to supporters last month.",
      "\"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",
      "“Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",
      "Indeed, six years on from that win over Liverpool, United now have all the ingredients in place to be truly successful. The Reds may already have made history in the years since their reformation but, with the WSL set to be more competitive than ever next term, it is clear the hard work is only just beginning.",

      "Dan Ashworth has met with Manchester United Women's players after a turbulent summer for Marc Skinner's side.",
      "United have come in for criticism of late number after a number of high-profile players, including England goalkeeper Mary Earps and captain Katie Zelem, were allowed to leave the club on free transfers, while co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy when he admitted plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "Fan frustration was further compounded when it emerged Skinner's side were set to be moved out of their state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate the men's team while a £50m refurbishment of their Carrington facilities was underway.",
      "However, Ashworth's long-awaited arrival from Newcastle United last month has offered some cause for optimism, with the sporting director having previously been a huge advocate for the growth of the women's game during his time with the Magpies and in his previous role at Brighton & Hove Albion. And the 53-year-old has now met with Skinner and his players as they ramp up their pre-season preparations at St George's Park.",
      "Pictures shared on the club's website show Ashworth giving a speech to the women's first-team squad and shaking hands with stars such as Ella Toone and Millie Turner. This comes after he outlined his vision for the Reds in an open letter to supporters.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said last month. \"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United.",

Awujo made her senior international debut for Canada at 18-years-old and has 19 caps for her country to date, reaching the quarter-finals of this summer’s Paris 2024 Olympic games.",

      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “Simi is an exciting young talent who we are delighted has chosen to continue her football journey with us here at Manchester United. Our wonderful fans can expect a midfielder with international pedigree, who will only develop further in our competitive English game.”",
      "Awujo is United's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Melvine Malard, Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandber.

      "Earps joined the Reds in 2019 and helped the club win the FA Cup last year. However, the shot-stopper opted to embark on a new chapter when her contract expired in June after a disappointing Women's Super League (WSL) campaign saw United finished fifth last term - 21 points worse off than in the previous campaign.",
      "Despite being linked with a move to Arsenal, Earps chose to join PSG, who have qualified for the Women's Champions League for six consecutive seasons. Speaking on the latest episode of the BBC's Tooney & Russo Show, Earps said she has established some \"great relationships\" in Manchester, but her decision to leave was fueled by \"the opportunity to play for a great team in top competitions\" and be \"in a position to win silverware\".",
      "\"It's like an itch you can never scratch enough,” Earps said. And the 31-year-old's former United teammate Ella Toone, who also plays alongside Earps for the Lionesses, was full of praise for the goalkeeper.",
      "\"She deserves everything,\" said Toone. \"Mary's dream - and it always has been - is to play at the highest level, play in the Champions League and that's what she's done.\"",
      "Earps is not the only player to have left United this summer, with captain Katie Zelem and forward Lucia Garcia also having departed. Reflecting last month on her decision to move overseas, Earps wrote on Instagram: \"The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don’t feel it aligns with the timing of where I’m at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.\"",
