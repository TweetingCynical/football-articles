      "Darren Bent has cast doubt on whether Liam Delap is capable of leading Manchester United ’s frontline with the former striker turned pundit instead urging Old Trafford chiefs to sign an elder statesman this summer.",
      "Goal shy United are in dire need of a prolific scorer this summer to avoid the embarrassment of a domestic campaign that sees them in the bottom quarter of the table.",
      "And with under fire head coach Ruben Amorim still looking to guide the club to Europa League final glory against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao next week with the prize of a spot in next season’s Champions League on the line, there is a pressing need for improvements in attack.",
      "But Bent reckons an experienced figure should be the priority to help develop Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish youngster has scored just four goals this season - compared to a dozen for Delap at relegated Ipswich - and Bent feels having two relatively inexperienced men up top would be a mistake.",
      "“You’re talking about 16 Premier League goals between them: four for Rasmus and 12 for Liam,” Bent told talkSPORT.",
      "“Listen, I’m a big fan of his [Delap]. Watching him week in, week out, of course he’s improved so much and the confidence that he’s got in his own ability, the confidence he’s got to go up against anybody. He doesn’t care who it is, he won’t get overawed by anyone.",
      "“What you don’t want is to have two young centre-forwards. This is his first full season in the Premier League.",
      "“To go from Ipswich, who were in the Championship last season, to Manchester United and be expected to lead the line and score the goals…",
      "“It might work. I think he’s got the confidence within himself to do it but there’s going to be dips in his form, goal droughts, and that’s where you need maybe that elder statesman to learn from.”",
      "Delap, who joined Ipswich from Manchester City last summer, has plenty of admirers with Chelsea among the other Premier League clubs maintaining a keen interest.",
      "He is expected to depart Portman Road because of a relegation clause of £30m built into his contract. That fee will still see The Tractor Boys double their initial investment of £15m in the all action centre forward."

      "Real Madrid are keen on a move for the Benfica left back Alvaro Carreras but Manchester United could still have a significant say over whether a deal is completed, according to reports.",
      "United sold Carreras to Benfica last year for just £5m and had previously been linked with re-signing the defender after he became a star man for the Portuguese giants.",
      "But now Real, who are set to welcome in Xabi Alonso as their new head coach next month following confirmation that Carlo Ancelotti will depart when La Liga concludes next week, are keen on a deal in addition to bringing in Trent Alexander-Arnold as a free agent when his Liverpool contract expires.",
      "Benfica will allow Carreras to leave for a fee of €50m but Spanish outlet Marca have suggested that Real are weighing up whether to liaise with United in very strange circumstances.",
      "That is because United had a buy-back clause of £15m added into the deal that saw Carreras leave for Lisbon but they turned down that option in January.",
      "Yet Marca’s report says Real are wondering if United could activate that clause before then offering the Premier League giants a fee midway between that and Benfica’s asking price to buy him.",
      "United continue to trim costs under the ownership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has overseen two rounds of redundancies along with trimming the squad's wage bill. Several big name players are set to depart this summer, including Marcus Rashford, who is on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Ruben Amorim faces a decisive Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao next Wednesday with the prize of a spot in next season’s Champions League on offer.",
      "That will have huge financial implications for the club because a season in Europe’s top competition can be worth in excess of £100m depending on a team’s progress.",
      "And while United players will be given pay rises if they compete in the Champions League, there are other considerations such as the reduction in sponsorship payments should they miss out.",
      "Carrera came through at the academy of Spanish side Deportivo La Coruna before signing a four-year deal at United. However he did not make a first-team appearance before heading to Benfica, where he has quickly established himself as one of the best left backs in Europe."

      "They would be unlikely to recoup the £72m they parted with to sign the Denmark international, though, which could make a loan move more attractive.",

      "Manchester United won't spend significant funds on a new goalkeeper this summer after Ruben Amorim decided on other priorities. Andre Onana's future at Old Trafford has been under the microscope after failing to cut errors out of his game.",
      "Onana, 29, was dropped by Amorim last month after two howlers against Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals. His understudy, Altay Bayindir, has featured more regularly as the season has worn on but his performances haven't inspired confidence.",
      "It was reported at the turn of the year that Amorim wants to sign a new goalkeeper who can push Onana. With the Cameroonian continuing to make high-profile mistakes, an increasing number of fans want the club to go searching for a direct replacement.",
      "The former Inter Milan shot-stopper wants to stay, though, and his recent decision to change agencies wasn't made with a view to a transfer. Turkey international Bayindir, however, could be the one to leave Old Trafford in search of more regular starts, with the 2026 World Cup a year away.",
      "Third-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton is in the final few weeks of his current contract and turned 39 last week. Senior United figures hope that Onana can rediscover his best form which he's rarely showcased since his £47million transfer from Inter in 2023.",
      "Those same figures and Amorim have prioritised bringing in a playmaker, a striker and a midfielder. United hope to make three or four key signings and Champions League revenue would help them secure their top targets.",
      "In order to bank that, the Red Devils need to win the Europa League final next Wednesday. Amorim's side face Tottenham, with Onana expected to start.",

      "\"I am also underperforming. We need to improve. We cannot change all the players. We need to improve every position on the field. Goalkeeper is the same; we can work with Andre. Andre Onana already proved he is a top player with Inter. Altay the same with Fenerbahce. We have some seasons where we are underperforming.\""

Of course I want every player to be fit. But Leny Yoro had that problem with his foot. I was so concerned about the next season, the next squad, the way we build up the squad.

      "Sean Dyche claims he would win more games than Ruben Amorim after admitting his Manchester United dream. The Red Devils have endured a rotten season in 2024/25, with the Portuguese boss failing to arrest the slide.",
      "They currently sit 16th in the table with just two games remaining and could even finish just one place above the relegation zone. Amorim has already claimed that his job should be under scrutiny should things not improve very quickly next season.",
      "Former Everton and Burnley boss Dyche has recently admitted that United are one club he would love to manage before the end of his career, while suggesting that time is running out for Amorim to turn the tide.",
      "Speaking to Stick to Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, he said: “It was always Manchester United because of the size of the club, not because it’s Man U – but due to the sheer grandeur, particularly back then. I know they are going through a tough run at the minute, but the whole worldwide feel of it. That’s a big superpowered club.”",
      "Dyche added: “He [Ruben Amorim] better win some games – pretty quick. I reckon if I went there and played my way, we’d win more games. Just 4-4-2 – give them basic rules of principles. They have some good players. You don’t have to over teach everyone.",
      "“I’d be interested more in the longer run, if he can stick to his principles and then next season, we’re all going, ‘Fair play’ – but, he’s been there a while now so you better start bringing some wins soon.",
      "“I’d be surprised if Ruben Amorim is not under pressure [early next season]. Let’s give him the benefit of the doubt this season – he’s laying down his platform for success, the future, and educating, let’s say.",
      "\"Then you get your pre-season, because now you’ve got that window to actually work on it, day in, day out. Shift a few players out who maybe don’t buy in, shift the players in who do buy in. Then, if it’s not early next season, how long do you go?",
      "“The perfect scenario is at least if you get a pre-season and juggle the transfers, then by Christmas, if you’re not having some form of success – most people go, ‘Things need to start working pretty quickly’. You probably get the next window, and then by January/February, they are going, ‘It’s not working’.”",
      "Fortunately for Amorim, he has a way of rescuing United’s season and ensure Dyche stays away from Old Trafford. United take on Tottenham in the Europa League final later this month and will secure a spot in the Champions League should they secure victory."

      "Manchester United chief Jason Wilcox is on the lookout for a new academy coach after Adam Lawrence left as he sought opportunities as first-team boss. The 39-year-old has had several offers and is now weighing up his options - but has left a vacancy at Carrington.",
      "Lawrence's exit had been likely and he's looking to work in a first-team environment but is equally open to a fresh academy challenge. Wilcox and Nick Cox are now eyeing someone to replace the outgoing coach with talks already underway, reports the MEN.",
      "Wilcox is among those bought to Manchester under the Sir Jim Ratcliffe reign and served as technical director, but did step in as sporting director. Wilcox, earlier in his career, served as academy director at Manchester City and has proven himself in that capacity.",
      "He helped unearth the likes of Phil Foden and United will hope that experience aids them in their recruitment process as they look to continue their strong academy tradition. The club have backed youth for years and continue to produce young talent.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the latest graduate who has become a first-team regular and those involved in the academy set-up will be tasked with producing more players of that quality to aid the squad.",
      "Neil Wood was the last high-profile coaching departure from the academy. He had managed the U21s for three years and that helped him get appointed at the Salford City boss with the Class of 92 holding a high opinion of him - he led the club to the League Two play-offs.",
      "Amorim gave 27 debuts to academy players during his time in charge at Sporting Lisbon - several of those going on to become key players - and he is already showing faith in United’s young talent this season. Recently handing debuts to the likes of Tyler Fredricson",
      "Cox, who is the Head of the academy, said on Lawrence's efforts: \"Adam has contributed greatly to our club throughout his four years at Manchester United. His passion for helping young players to maximise their potential has played an important role in the success of our academy system.",
      "\"We take great pride in supporting and witnessing the development of our staff, Adam is a fine example of that, moving up from the Under-16s to the Under-18s, enjoying success and now being ready to seek a new challenge in the game.\""

      "A former Manchester United prospect, once hailed as the club's \"best young player\", turned hero for Leyton Orient as they punched their ticket to Wembley. Ethan Galbraith, who spent six years in United's ranks, netted the match-winning penalty in a tense shootout win over Stockport County on Wednesday night.",
      "The victory secured Orient's spot in the League One Play-Off final, and leaves them within touching distance of a return to the second tier of English football for the first time in 43 years.",
      "Galbraith has been a key figure throughout their promotion charge, regularly featuring in the starting XI and chipping in with crucial goals – including a brace against Stockport earlier this season.",
      "His influence won't come as a shock to those familiar with United's youth system. The 24-year-old Northern Irishman had once been seen as a serious candidate to break into the Red Devils' senior squad.",
      "Having arrived from Linfield in 2017, it didn't take long for Galbraith to make an impression. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gave him his first-team debut against Astana during the 2019/20 Europa League, having already been impressed with his performances for the U21s and in senior training sessions.",
      "A source told MEN in August 2020: \"He's the best young player outside the core first-team group at the club.\" However, Galbraith struggled to consistently deliver at the top level.",
      "After a friendly against Aston Villa in September, Solskjaer was openly critical of his play, frustrated with how often he lost possession. \"Galbraith... I spoke to him after the game and he knows a couple of times he gets caught on the ball but that's the learning he needs,\" the Norwegian coach said. \"That's going to make him, next time he's on the pitch, be ready for it.\"",
      "The midfielder was then loaned to Doncaster Rovers in League One for the 2021/22 season, followed by a spell at Salford City in League Two. Though he impressed in both stints, he hadn't quite progressed at the speed United had envisioned.",
      "Galbraith's chapter at the club came to a close in 2023, with new United boss Erik ten Hag showing little interest in him. With his deal expiring and no offer to extend it, Galbraith accepted defeat and looked elsewhere.",
      "\"After six years, my time has come to an end with this magnificent club, Manchester United,\" he wrote on social media at the time. \"My earliest ambition as a boy was to become a professional footballer and I'm forever grateful to the club for giving me the opportunity and support to fulfil that dream.",
      "\"It's been a privilege and I feel very honoured to have been able to represent the club. I step into the next chapter of my career a more mature, well rounded person and I'm excited for what's next.\"",
      "That next step was a gamble. Though there was interest from clubs like Newcastle, Stoke, and Derby, Galbraith chose to sign with newly promoted League One outfit Leyton Orient, seeking regular minutes on the pitch.",
      "He quickly adapted to life in east London, playing a major part in helping Orient to their best league finish in over ten years during his debut campaign. Year two has gone even better, with Richie Wellens' men launching a late-season surge to secure a surprise spot in the play-offs.",
      "In the return leg against Stockport, Galbraith didn't just convert the decisive penalty - he also set up Ollie O'Neill's opener, delivering a complete performance that saw him named Player of the Match.",
      "With a Wembley showdown on the horizon and the chance to earn promotion, Galbraith now has an opportunity to demonstrate - both to those watching and perhaps those back at Carrington - that he was right to back himself.",
      "If he leads Orient to victory, it may not only be a landmark moment for the club but also a personal comeback story for a footballer still striving for the heights he once seemed destined to reach."

Complimentary tickets are very much at a premium, which has not gone down well with the playing group, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "The club are handing out just two complimentary tickets per player for friends and family - as well as seats on a chartered flight. That will land 60 miles away in Santander on the morning of the game whilst the guests will also be given food and drink at the team hotel.",
      "Their return flight is also from Santander - more than an hour’s drive from Bilbao - and leaves at 2.15am following the final, which means any celebrations are unlikely.",
      "The players can buy up to 10 more tickets from UEFA at face value, which range in price from £200 to £55. But if they took that option they would have to stump up the costs for the additional flights and hotel rooms.",
      "The Manchester outfit could land themselves £100million in revenue with victory in the Europa League, by virtue of landing themselves a spot in the Champions League. Despite that their INEOS chief has continued to watch the costs - a move that has not been well received.",

It is complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff - it is a really hard position.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"My reaction was to help. Then we talk to the players and the players had the same reaction - everybody wants the staff there and their families there.\"",
      "The finalists have been given an allocation of around 15,000 each and while Spurs are offering a free ticket to every full-time employee, United have only set aside a small number for a staff ballot. Instead they've been invited to a screening in Manchester where they will be offered two free drinks."

      "A notorious ex-Manchester United hooligan has revealed his favourite London away day. Tony O'Neill was once dubbed Britain's toughest hooligan and 'the general' of the Red Army firm.",
      "Delving into his experiences on the Webby and O'Neill YouTube channel, part of his 'Fan Culture' series, he explained: \"We had tricky situations but London was always the main focus for United. Every time United were playing there, I would always get there, it would be very rare that I would miss London games because anything could happen.",
      "\"Euston (Station) was always the main focal point and that is why the Red Army in London was hated because when the Red Army travelled you could not control them.",
      "\"We could trust each other and there were some dangerous places to go, and I always say the night games are dangerous to go - and I had some dangerous night games.\"",
      "Once considered a public menace at football grounds, Tony found himself behind bars three times over football-related brawls, with police branding him 'Target Kilo'. His penchant for violence started in the 1970s and his last offence came in 2001.",
      "Since hanging up his hooligan boots, he has penned the titles Red Army General and The Men in Black and taken to lecturing students about choosing a better path in life.",
      "Tony spent his youth embroiled in skirmishes with rival supporters across London, clashing with fans from clubs like West Ham, Millwall, Chelsea, and Arsenal. Yet, out of all the confrontations, one particular group remained firmly etched in his mind.",
      "Despite fierce rivalries with Arsene Wenger's Arsenal and Chelsea under Roman Abramovich’s it was another away day that stood out for him.",
      "He explained: \"Tottenham was my favourite ground. Going there in 72... unbelievable! It is the best ground for a young lad. But going forward throughout my life, Tottenham was always my favourite ground, anything could happen there, it was just great.\"",
      "Tony later found himself on the payroll providing security at Gary Neville's Hotel Football and has even chatted with the ex-United skipper on his channel numerous times.",
      "In reminiscing over earlier times, he also named the notorious Chelsea Headhunters, labelling them a \"violent mob\".",
      "Despite this, to truly illustrate the sheer scale of football hooliganism in the '70s, he pointed out: \"They (Chelsea) weren't the only violent mob, virtually every big club in the first division had violent mobs up and down the country - and it was uncontrollable.",
      "\"And I can't really put into words how uncontrollable it was, every weekend it was happening up and down the country.\"",
      "In 1977, the British government and the Football Association took drastic action to try and stem football violence by making all away matches ticket-only and barring match day ticket sales.",
      "However, Tony was skeptical about the effectiveness of these measures, saying: \"It has never worked. They haven't got a clue. It is a disease. It is there. It gets passed down generation to generation. Liverpool Man United. It is a disease. The hatred gets passed down. Leeds Man United, gets passed down. That's the way it is. Millwall West Ham, gets passed down. You can't avoid it. It will always be there.\"",
      "Despite admitting that things have evolved over the last couple of decades, he reminisced about his earlier days as a fierce young man, claiming: \"That was the society we lived in, the 70s was wild, absolutely wild, there was so much freedom.",
      "\"People got everywhere and the police and government just could not handle it.\"",
      "After sharing the footage, one Tottenham supporter recalled: \"Spurs v United at WHL was always something to look forward to back in the day, United always brought a big and good firm.\"",
      "Another stated nostalgically: \"Spurs was always the big London games for United. Spurs v United used to attract bigger crowds than when we played Arsenal.\""

Since moving to Birmingham, Rashford has become a key player for Villa under Unai Emery - contributing four goals and six assists. His campaign was cut short, however, due to a muscle injury.",

      "Some good advice for Ruben Amorim over the next few days would be not to take any unnecessary risks with your Manchester United team selection against Chelsea.",
      "Amroim will pick his team to face Chelsea with the Europa League final at the forefront of his thinking, and it would be sensible not to pick any players who will start against Tottenham.",
      "The only problem with that is Amorim might be forced to pick some players who he intends to start at the Estadio de San Mames. United have a handful of injuries in the squad, which means even a second-string team at Stamford Bridge may require the presence of two starters for Bilbao.",
      "Those players could be Andre Onana and Alejandro Garnacho. Amorim rested Onana from the squad against West Ham last weekend, but goalkeepers have minimal injury risk and he should be recalled.",
      "Onana is prone to making errors and he feels like the kind of goalkeeper who needs to play before a final, so it might be asking for trouble to parachute him back into the team at the Estadio de San Mames.",
      "Amorim shouldn't lose too much sleep over the prospect of starting Onana because his injury risk is low, although he's probably got a slight headache over the remainder of the team.",
      "When you pick a reserve team to face Chelsea, the options are limited and picking an academy player to start in one of the No.10 roles would be the answer to give Garnacho a rest.",
      "But which youngster could fill in? Jack Moorhouse has been named in a handful of matchday squads and would be perfect for the role, however, he was absent from the Under-21s' final games of the season and wasn't in first-team training on Wednesday.",
      "Amorim might feel James Scanlon has done enough to receive his debut against Chelsea. Scanlon took part in senior training at Carrington this week and would also be a logical selection.",
      "It's possible that Amorim doesn't believe there is a youngster from the academy who is ready to start in the left No.10 position against Chelsea, though. And in that case, he would have to take a risk with Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho has made 56 appearances in all competitions this season, working his socks off for United again. Garnacho's finishing can leave a lot to be desired at times, but the winger has actually had an underrated season and everyone seems to forget that he's still only 20.",
      "United must have Garnacho in their starting team in Bilbao, so resting him at Stamford Bridge is the best option, but it does feel like he could be given another start in London on Friday.",
      "Garnacho deserves huge credit for his robustness. He has only picked up an ankle injury since he broke into the first-team in 2022 and he's almost always been available for selection.",
      "It will be fascinating to see what degree of risk Amorim deems acceptable against Chelsea, especially after Leny Yoro picked up an injury after his surprise selection against West Ham.",
      "There was also an injury scare when Rasmus Hojlund went to the ground, clinching his shoulder, in that game. Amorim was spotted on the cameras nervously biting his knuckles.",
      "The fitness of Yoro, Diogo Dalot and Matthijs de Ligt for next week's Europa League final are going to be touch-and-go, which means United cannot afford any more casualties against Chelsea."

      "However, no move materialised at that time and he has stayed on loan in the Turkish Super Lig, where he has continued to rack up the goals. The Nigerian has scored 35 goals and provided eight assists in all competitions for Galatasaray this season.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim faces an anxious wait to find out if centre-backs Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt will be available for the Europa League final.",
      "The duo were absent from the open training session United hosted at Carrington on Wednesday morning as part of their preparations for next Wednesday night's clash with Tottenham Hotspur at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao.",
      "Yoro was forced off in the second half of Sunday's 2-0 defeat to West Ham United at Old Trafford with a foot problem and De Ligt has missed the last two games after being forced off in the first half of the 4-3 defeat to Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium earlier this month.",
      "Issuing an update on the duo on Wednesday afternoon, Amorim said: \"I don't know if they're going to be available, we'll try to push, it's a final, all the players want to play really bad. I don't think they will not go to Chelsea but we'll have some of them for the final.\"",
      "Amid the prospect of them missing out, United could go into battle against Spurs with a patched up defence. Diogo Dalot is also fighting to be ready in time for the final and he is doing all he can.",
      "But with Yoro and De Ligt currently the main concerns, MEN Sport has looked at three possible defences Amorim could deploy if they both miss out:",
      "United must get through Friday night's trip to Chelsea before switching their focus completely towards the Europa League final, but with less than a week to go, supporters are beginning to paint a picture in their minds of how they expect United to line up in Bilbao.",
      "With Amad back in the frame after a spell out injured, he could start at right wing-back, allowing Noussair Mazraoui to move into the back-three and operate as the right-sided centre-back. He has proven countless times this season that he is capable of doing a solid job from most positions on the pitch.",
      "Harry Maguire's resurrection has continued and he should be one of the very first names on the teamsheet. He is an obvious choice to start in the centre of the back-three.",
      "On the presumption Yoro and De Ligt miss out, likewise youngster Ayden Heaven, who is also still sidelined, Luke Shaw is a strong candidate to start as the left-sided centre-back and provide United with a left-footed presence in the backline.",
      "He does not have the necessary athleticism to play as a wing-back in Amorim's system, making a centre-back spot ideal for him. Patrick Dorgu is a likely starter at left wing-back.",
      "This summer's transfer window is likely to mark the end of the road at Old Trafford for several members of the squad. Victor Lindelof is highly likely to be moved on when his contract expires at the end of June, yet he could play a more prominent role than first thought between now and the finish line.",
      "The Swede, who will turn 31 in the summer, could retain his place for the third Europa League game running and start as the right-sided centre-back, just as he did against Athletic Bilbao in the two legs of the semi-final. That could see him operate in a three-man defence alongside Maguire and Shaw, with Mazraoui and Dorgu flanking the three centre-backs.",
      "Amad's starting position could have a huge bearing on the landscape of the defence, with the Ivorian capable of playing at both right wing-back and right-sided No.10. If he starts as one of the playmakers, potentially at Alejandro Garnacho's expense, Mazraoui could be pushed into the right-wing back role.",
      "Dalot's fitness could also have a part to play.",
      "Despite missing almost all of this season through injury, the prospect of Shaw's fitness levels stopping him from starting against Spurs would be a real blow. His profile as a left-footed player can provide the backline with balance in the absence of Lisandro Martinez and Heaven.",
      "Yoro, despite being right-footed, has excelled on the left of the defence recently, but few in United's pool of centre-backs can progress the ball as well as he can, particularly on their unnatural side. If Shaw can't start for whatever reason, and the starting line-up at Stamford Bridge should offer a clearer indication of Amorim's plans for the final, Lindelof may have to start on the left of the back-three.",
      "If that proves to be the case, Mazraoui must start as the right-sided centre-back, with Maguire stationed in the middle. That scenario would leave Amad with a free run at starting as the right wing-back, though Dalot could give him a run for his money if passed fit."

      "It was the players who weren't involved that garnered the most attention, but Jonny Evans and Toby Collyer did take part in the training session as they return to fitness.",
      "Evans hasn't started for United since Amorim's first game in charge at Ipswich and at best he will be looking for a place on the bench next week as his Old Trafford career enters its final few weeks.",
      "Collyer was making an impression on Amorim before his injury but the Europa League team is settled and there is no chance the youngster can break into it. Again, a place on a 12-man bench is his best hope.",
      "Amad brings the fun",
      "You only have to browse through Amad's social media activity to see he likes to have fun and it turns out he is exactly the same during training as well.",
      "His energy was infectious during the training games and at one point he crossed his hands with his knees and started dancing to celebrate a move in a rondo.",
      "He was a bubbly figure throughout and is clearly already a valuable presence in the dressing room.",
      "Chelsea clues",
      "It was a larger than usual group for the training session, with more than 30 players involved, and it showed Amorim was trying to manage plans for Chelsea as well as Tottenham.",
      "There were roles for young defenders Jaydan Kamason, James Overy, Godwill Kukonki, Tyler Fredricson, Sam Murray, Daniel Armer and Harry Amass. Fredricson and Amass are regulars in the first-team group now but amid a defensive injury crisis some of the others might fancy their chances of being involved at Stamford Bridge.",
      "James Scanlon, Sekou Kone, Jim Thwaites, Jack Fletcher and Victor Musa also took part in the session, as did Ethan Wheatley, who has been on loan at League Two Walsall since January but has become a peripheral figure at the Bescot Stadium."

      "Napoli and Galatasaray striker Victor Osimhen has interacted with Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand overnight after winning the Turkish Cup.",
      "Osimhen bagged a brace in the second half on Wednesday as the Istanbul club beat Trabzonspor 3-0 to lift the Turkish Cup for the 19th time in their history. Unsurprisingly the victory sparked celebrations for the Turkish team's supporters and even Ferdinand got in on the act.",
      "While visiting a barber during the final, the match was being shown and when Osimhen was shown on screen, the camera panned round to Ferdinand in the chair chanting the Nigerian forward's name. Showing his appreciation, Osimhen shared the clip on his Instagram feed responding with two laughing emojis and the yellow and red hearts to symbolise Galatasaray.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United are targeting Ipswich Town's Liam Delap to be their main striker next season but Ferdinand has always suggested that Osimhen would be a wiser purchase, despite costing at least double the Englishman's release clause. \"Forget Delap’s ability, potential, whatever you want to say about him,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"His quality as a player, it’s not about that right now for Man United. I think they need experience in there.",
      "\"Someone who knows how to score and someone that these younger guys can learn off. Rasmus Hojlund needs help. He doesn’t need a competitor.",
      "\"You need someone who can come in who he can go: ‘Listen take the pressure off me. You’re going to be the main guy.",
      "\"'I’m going to learn a little bit in the background and take my chances when they come.'\" Ferdinand's hopes of seeing Osimhen at United next season will have taken a hit this week when it was claimed by Football Transfers that Chelsea were scheduling crunch talks with the forward over a move this summer.",
      "It is claimed that the only sticking point for Chelsea is Osimhen's wage demands. The Nigerian is thought to be wanting approximately £10m per year in wages which is unattainable for the Blues.",
      "However, if he was willing to negotiate down from that position, it is believed that Chelsea would be able to get a deal done."

      "It's the time of year where Wembley is the destination of choice. From the FA Cup final to the play-offs, clubs, managers, players and fans are chasing a dream day out in the capital.",
      "Rochdale are no different. And for Aidan Barlow, a winning afternoon under the arches would complete something of a personal arc from Manchester United, to training alone without a club during the pandemic, to being back in the Football League.",
      "Dale saw their 102-year stay in the Football League end in 2023, having only been relegated from League One two years earlier. A host of financial issues followed, before a takeover by the family of local businessman Peter Ogden last year finally brought some stability.",
      "Barlow arrived after that period of turmoil, joining at the start of this season, and knows more than most about the rollercoaster life of football.",
      "\"Football is crazy with the highs and lows but you have to stay grounded, humble and level headed,\" he reflected.",
      "This is a player who caught the eye coming through the academy at United, impressing under the guidance of Nicky Butt and starring and scoring in Youth League games.",
      "Jose Mourinho was a fan. Barlow was only 18 when Mourinho promoted him to first team training ahead of a clash with Pep Guardiola's City. United had just come from behind to beat Juventus 2-1 in Turin in the Champions League and Barlow had impressed in the Youth League equivalent, scoring in a 2-2 draw.",
      "DAZN is broadcasting every game in the National League play-offs, including Oldham Athletic and Rochdale fixtures, with 50% off until May 15.",
      "It wasn't the first time the midfielder had been in and around the senior set-up, but it made headline news and led to suggestions he could break through. Ultimately, despite a show of faith from Mourinho and his successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, that first team debut didn't materialise.",
      "He was frequently involved in first team training sessions and earned international recognition, playing a key part in England's run to the Under-17 European Championship final in 2017 where they were beaten on penalties by Spain. Barlow was the sole England player to convert his spot kick in the shoot out after the Young Lions conceded an equaliser with the last kick of the game in a 2-2 draw.",
      "Mourinho had been impressed with the cultured left-footer during his Old Trafford stay and under Solskjaer, Barlow joined Norwegian side Tromso on loan after conversations with the United staff about the best way to break into the first team in Manchester. Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard were among the senior players to take the Salford boy under their wing.",
      "\"Everyone was welcoming but the ones who have come through like Marcus, Jesse and Andreas (Pereira) knew what it was like and where they had come from them and they guided you and helped you,\" he recalled of his time on the fringes of the first team, summing up training and working under Mourinho as 'everything you imagine it would be'",
      "\"He was top,\" he added. \"Anything you can think of, it was like that! I loved it. I embraced it and said to myself 'go and enjoy it.' The players you are training with and the manager you have . . . you have to enjoy that. Moments like that don't last forever. I wanted to take it all in.",
      "\"When the training starts it is down to you, it is sink or swim. You either step up and if you don't you will stand out like a sore thumb. It is not easy!\"",
      "Barlow held his own but was ultimately released in 2020. He then spent a season without a club, training on his own in the midst of a Covid pandemic unsure of what was to come.",
      "\"It wasn't easy,\" he reflects. \"It wasn't easy for anyone but that made me who I am as well. I had to be really tough mentally, I had to try and believe in myself and continue to work even not knowing what was to come. Every day I told myself that you get out what you put in.\"",
      "His hard work paid off and earned him a move to Doncaster Rovers. In 2023 he dropped into non-league with Eastleigh before moving to Dale. It is a journey that plenty of fellow former United academy players will have taken, and for Barlow it is a case of enjoying his football and living in the here and now rather than wondering what if.",
      "Looking at his international age-group team-mates, your eye is drawn to Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden among the star names now at the top of the game. Erling Haaland played for Norway in the tournament.",
      "But Barlow, level-headed and with plenty of wisdom beyond his years, does not look on at what might have been.",
      "\"I don't think you can think like that,\" he said of his United career. \"There is no reason to live with regret or what if this or that happened. I look back with great pride, amazing memories, It was a great time.\"",
      "He continued: \"Playing for England was a great experience, I remember getting called up for the tournament after having a good season.",
      "\"I made my debut against Ukraine (in the second group game), scored on my debut and I felt like I grew into that tournament.",
      "\"It was great to be around those players, if you look at that squad and what some of the names are doing it is mental. That team and age group was ridiculous.",
      "\"We were really unlucky not to win it, we conceded late in the game and lost on penalties. What I learned from that tournament . . . our manager was Steve Cooper and look at what he has done. I learned a lot from the experience, and from the players in training.",
      "\"I have had highs and lows and that is football, you can be there (playing for Manchester United and England) and then you can feel like you are nothing.",
      "\"The best way to be is to stay grounded and take things as it comes.\"",
      "Easier said than done but Barlow has constantly tried to approach his life in football like that.",
      "\"I feel like I have always been like that but I have matured and more transparent with it with age, and the understanding,\" he surmises.",
      "He added: \"It has been up and down but that is what football is, when you get a few years in to a career you become grateful for everything that happened and things that happened help you for the future and to deal with things in the present.",
      "\"You have to embrace it and enjoy it, even when things are not going well. You need to know that doesn't last forever.",
      "\"I don't think anything can prepare you for (leaving United), they don't prepare you for it but the way they are instils the characteristics and the way you are as a person and the way you carry yourself. That still helps me now. If you are at a club like United it is always going to benefit you, you have to appreciate it positively.",
      "\"It is the things you learn that I can pass on now, everyone is different and had a different journey, especially here at Rochdale.\"",
      "The next step on his journey could be a Wembley final.",
      "\"Reaching Wembley would mean a lot for me personally and my family, but also everyone involved with the club,\" he said. \"The fans, staff, players, everyone.\""

      "\"You have to give Ruben another season,\" he told GIVEMESPORT. I’m sure he is not happy that he has not got more out of this squad in the Premier League. He keeps almost confirming that in every interview, which I find a little bit strange. What people want to hear is a bit of reassurance. But if you keep saying ‘maybe I’m not the right man for the job’, it doesn’t sound good.",
      "\"I don’t know why he keeps saying it. It has been an amazing run in the Europa League and, against Athletic Bilbao, they were very good over two legs. There were no problems and it was a really confident walk into the final. But in the final they will play against Tottenham, who have had an equally disastrous season but it’s a Premier League team. Tottenham have definitely shown that they are capable of beating Manchester United.",
      "\"They haven’t been firing on all cylinders but, if they have got everybody fit outside of James Maddison and as long as they’ve got Pedro Porro and Micky van de Ven fit and have stability in the backline, it’s a one-off game. Amorim will definitely be there at the start of the season, but he has to make improvements in the first three months of the season in the Premier League.\""

      "Man Utd and their owners dominate the Mailbox as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his vulture capitalism are more than a match for the Glazers.",
      "Come on, let’s have some different subjects; mail us at theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Good news\nDelighted to see that Reading have been taken over by a guy that seems, at least from the outside, interested in running a football club and that club being good at football. No community should go through losing a club, and it seemed all too possible.\nDan, Plastic LFC",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe is like Gordon Gekko\nSo Lee wrote in to support Ratcliffe. Just to be clear it’s a different Lee because this Lee would only ever be caught saying Chuck Feeney is a decent billionaire (Google him, it’s a good story ) the rest are just self serving vultures.",
      "There’s a couple of things I’d like to challenge in Lee’s mail",
      "1. We don’t know if Ratcliffe will turn the club around?",
      "2. He’s a self-made billionaire",
      "Answering question 2 will actually answer question 1 so we’ll start there.",
      "There is no such thing as a self made billionaire. Every billionaire starts from a position of middle-class safety in which they have a family which funds their living costs while they build their dream, Jobs, Gates, Musk, all had it. Ratcliffe had two working class parents who had become middle class thanks to their work which gave Ratcliffe the middle class base he needed.",
      "He also got his start in petrochemicals after convincing Esso to pay for his MBA, so that’s three different people who have helped him already but like I said there is no such thing as a self made billionaire.",
      "But this doesn’t mean a billionaire doesn’t work hard, most work long hours and rarely take holidays. So did Jim. But Jim didn’t get where he is by being a brilliant engineer and inventing something amazing or even being a chemical engineer and inventing something. His wealth comes almost entirely from raising private capital which he would then use to buy struggling companies, asset stripping them and moving their headquarters to tax havens.",
      "His chemical businesses in Middlesbrough also regularly just ignore environmental warnings about air and water pollution so if the air and water is terrible – his company is a big reason why.",
      "But his general MO in every case is as follows – identify struggling business with assets which can be sold. Buy very cheap. Immediately cut staff, sell assets, change HQ to tax haven and then pocket the money while publicly claiming the business is struggling and needs to cut costs.\nSound familiar?",
      "Jim is a proud Manc and English man. So proud that he campaigned for Brexit to give Britain back to the British and then once the vote had been taken immediately moved his personal residence to Monaco so he didn’t have to pay UK taxes and support UK services and economy.",
      "Jim is not Lou Gertsner or Warren Buffet who invest in businesses to make them succeed. He’s closer to Gordon Gekko, a vulture capitalist who bends rules (or ignores them) to benefit himself while putting thousands of people out of work.",
      "Will he turn around United? Why don’t we ask the fans of OGC Nice – the other team Ratcliffe owns…",
      "He bought Nice for 100m when they were struggling financially, he immediately came in promising greatness while making massive cuts to staff. Managers last on average 14 months before being fired.",
      "In the six years before Ratcliffe bought the club nice finished in the top 4 three times. Since he bought it? 0 times. At first fans liked Jim as they saw him attending games regularly, this changed within two years especially when Jim was caught saying ‘Nice games just aren’t very interesting to him’.",
      "Today the Nice supporters often protest Jim’s ownership stating he promised a lot and never delivered anything but constant change and chaos.",
      "So my guess….is Jim probably won’t save United. But he will be en excellent bullet shield for the Glazers for a few years.\nLee (the LFC one)",
      "",
      "BBQ fine though\nIt’s simple, United don’t do parades for anything but Premier League and Champions League. Haven’t had a parade since Fergie’s last season.",
      "Kind of of a ‘nothing to see here’ situation this BBQ thing but alas that wouldn’t be clickbaity or allow for DISGRACE and EMBARRASMENT would it.",
      "In fact, United have NEVER held a parade for anything other than the Prem or Champions League… even in Fergie time…. MADNESS",
      "PATHETIC attempt at journalism lol…. AGAIN\nMoses",
      "READ: Why Manchester United must sack Amorim, sell Fernandes, appoint Moyes and raid French side",
      "",
      "Glazers have done a fine job\nHow can you say that the Glazers mismanaged their ownership of Man United? In over 20 years, with minimal input by themselves, they have made hundreds of millions of pounds in personal profit. That seems like brilliant management to me. They even managed to sell a debt ridden business with run down assets for more than they paid for it. Again astounding business.",
      "Hell, the shambles that is the football part of the business even managed to win a trophy every couple years. They can take pride in having won more in the last 20 years than the owners of all but 3 clubs in England (assuming City, ‘pool and Chelsea have actually won more).",
      "How dare you say the Glazers, who bought so much footballing pleasure to the ABU crowd over the last 2 decades are guilty of poor management. After all there are many more ABU’s than MU supporters. By any measure personal to the Glazers they have done a brilliant job of managing the club.\nMurray (life long member of the Anyone But United crowd who was saddened when the Glazers left)",
      "(Erm, they haven’t left; they still own more than 70% of the club – Ed)",
      "",
      "Pashun and wages\nFirstly, some people seem to have issues with Liverpool fans proclaiming themselves as special, or the best in the world, while also booing Trent. Whilst I’m not a fan of booing, it’s probably fair to say that far from being mutually exclusive, they probably go hand in hand.",
      "Typically, fans leave an impression not for their chat about ecumenical matters in the pre-Columbine era, but more for making a massive racket in the stadium and knowing a lot about their players. This might also be called passion and knowledge. It’s therefore no surprise when the outliers do then act like jilted lovers when a player leaves.",
      "On another matter, people often redefine their league failures by quoting where they are in the wages league table. Obviously some clubs pay more than others (I’m looking at the republic of Mancunia), but in the main, professional contracts at elite clubs can give up to 100% extra on top of base salary for hitting performance targets, so is that really any justification? It all sounds a bit chicken and egg to me. Or am I missing something?",
      "To put that sentiment more succinctly, Arsenal will be low wage payers this season because they underachieved in most metrics.\nAdam, LFC",
      "",
      "Trent and ‘family’\nFirst things first, I’m an Arsenal fan so I’m more than likely obnoxious. Just gonna say that up front so all the fans of other clubs can decide whether my opinion is worthy of reading. And yes it is about Trent.",
      "Obviously the Liverpool fans booing a man who has played an important role in winning them everything are stupid, classless, ungrateful, all that. And I also understand that fans are allowed to be stupid and classless. It’s not illegal, it doesn’t necessarily point to a problem with anybody’s character. It’s sport.",
      "You’re not a worse person for booing Trent Alexander-Arnold or for being bitter toward him. But you are stupid, classless, and ungrateful. And you probably don’t have anything in your life worth celebrating if you can’t even celebrate this wonderful footballer, and I mean that sincerely.",
      "What disturbs me about the whole thing is the justification that “he’s one of our own so it hurts more.” That if he’s part of the Liverpool “family” then it makes it even more of a betrayal. Honestly I have to wonder how you treat members of your own family if that’s how you think about it. You should want your family to leave home and spend time experiencing the world. Just because of where he’s born he has to compromise his career to make his family happy? “But we didn’t even get a fee!” Let the man have a life.",
      "I have to wonder how players like Van Dijk and Salah must feel when they see how some of these fans react to “one of our own” leaving his hometown to start a new chapter of his life. Some (often abusive) people are far more horrible to their families than the people they work with and see outside the home, so I have to wonder exactly what kind of person has this sentiment.",
      "Again, you can feel however you want. You’re not better or worse than anyone else for booing your own player (the best right back in the history of the Premier League besides Lauren of course). If you want to allow a thug and a bully like Jamie Carragher to dictate how you feel then be my guest. I’m sure plenty of people will be able to point to other clubs who have booed their own players, been horrible, etc. But I’m not talking about them.",
      "What we saw on Sunday was needlessly small and petty behavior directed toward a club legend, and I don’t think players forget things like that. You’ll never walk alone until you do.\nDeadbeat Cat Dad",
      "",
      "Ronaldo Jnr?\nAm I the only person who finds it completely mental that Cristiano Ronaldo has a 15 year old son playing for Portugal’s U15s? I guess Ronaldo still seems to be 25 in my head.",
      "No idea if the kid is good enough to make it to the men’s team, but it would be one to watch if they both played in the same match (would Sr lose his shit and dock his pocket money if Jr didn’t pass to him?)",
      "Has there ever been a father/son combo in an international match before?\nPhil, Manchester",
      "",
      "FA are actually blameless\nFurther from Paul’s mail earlier about officials not flagging offside at the time they see them, and how this could have prevented the nasty injury suffered by Awoniyi.",
      "I totally agree that the current rules/guidance isn’t necessarily correct but it had to be changed to accommodate VAR.",
      "What I don’t agree with is Paul blaming the FA. They don’t decide the rules which officials follow – it’s IFAB who do this.\nA, LFC, Montreal (stuck up for VAR recently, now the FA – something must be up with me!)",
      "",
      "Beckett is an Evertonian\nI just want to respond to Mick T, Liverpool from his comment on Evertonians and relegation. When I lived in Liverpool, I actually became good friends with a bunch of Evertonians (massive Liverpool fan here) and found them 20+ years ago to be better with the banter (Rafael Beneath Us) and all that. But I always looked at Everton as a kind of second team in my books…happy to support them 36 out of 38 games during the season, etc. But there has been a real shift in them (I blame Jordan Pickford), and they are a supremely bitter club…but also delusional (We won 2-2 at Goodison Park).",
      "And so, let Everton wish for relegation before Liverpool wins a title. I wish Everton a perpetual life of 17th place finishes, staying up on the last day forever, never getting relegated, but always that fear. A sporting equivalent of Waiting for Godot.\nJonathan, Toronto",
      "According to reports, Manchester United staff are ‘dreading even more savage cuts’ if Ruben Amorim’s side lose to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Man United boss Ruben Amorim is doing what Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cost-cutting INEOS crew won’t: paying for staff to attend the Europa League final.",
      "Arsenal are seemingly ‘lucky’ that they play in the Premier League and not in Portugal while Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a victim of Man Utd.",

      "Despite slugging it out with Europa League final opponents Spurs to see who can embarrass themselves the most domestically, 16th-placed Manchester United have set themselves the objective of a top-six finish in 2025/26.",
      "Every Premier League club has been set a target for next season but that seems like one of the more outlandish examples.",
      "Only five times in the history of 20-team Premier League campaigns has a side improved their league position by 10 places from one season to the next. Nottingham Forest will make that a half-dozen soon enough, but what lessons can Manchester United take from the past?",
      "",
      "Aston Villa (from 16th in 2002/03 to 6th in 2003/04) – changed managers\n“I had another year left on my contract and I was under no pressure to resign as Aston Villa manager,” said Graham Taylor. “But I have become increasingly unhappy at how the club as a whole was run,” he added, never naming infamous chairman Doug Ellis but leaving little doubt as to his reasoning either.",
      "Having broken his managerial retirement after nine months at the beck and call of a panicking Villa in February 2002, Taylor should perhaps have consulted predecessor John Gregory about the business practises of his new boss.",
      "But Taylor was lured back to the West Midlands in what he would later state he always knew was a “transitional” role. A record of 19 wins from 60 games saw Villa lurch from 8th one season to 16th in his first and only full campaign, before a jump back up to 6th under his replacement.",
      "David O’Leary had been out of work for a year after leaving trophyless Leeds, but an exciting crop of Villa academy graduates dovetailed wonderfully with the experience of Dion Dublin, Ronny Johnsen, Nolberto Solano and Juan Pablo Angel to turn relegation battlers into European qualification contenders.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Make Ruben Amorim quit; he genuinely doesn’t seem far off anyway.",
      "",
      "Everton (from 17th in 2003/04 to 4th in 2004/05) – sold best player\n“I sold Wayne Rooney and Everton got better,” was how David Moyes allayed any concerns West Ham might have had over losing prized asset Declan Rice. And frankly it was powerful logic: they avoided relegation by six points with him as their top scorer, Manchester United handed £27m over after Euro 2004 and Everton used those funds to help qualify for the Champions League.",
      "It does skip past a few key points, like the signing of Tim Cahill, the partnership between David Weir and Alan Stubbs and the form of Lee Carsley. But fundamentally Everton improved as a team when they cashed in on their star player.",
      "Only Norwich (3rd in 1992/93) have ever finished higher in the Premier League with a negative goal difference than the Toffees, who scored the same number of goals when finishing 4th as they did to come 17th, while only actually suffering four fewer defeats.",
      "Even when they chucked their new-found transfer weight around it backfired, but without Rooney at least Thomas Gravesen could finally spread his wings.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Sell Bruno Fernandes, and maybe sign Marcus Bent.",
      "",
      "Fulham (from 17th in 2007/08 to 7th in 2008/09) – signed competent keeper\nIt remains one of the more unlikely relegation escapes in Premier League history, perhaps a little lost in the mire of Derby selfishly and simultaneously recording their Apocalypse Season.",
      "Fulham were already 18th and in trouble when they appointed Roy Hodgson as Lawrie Sanchez’s successor in December 2007. But their struggle to build any momentum left them in this spot heading into the final straight:",
      "The Cottagers then trailed Manchester City 2-0 within 21 minutes of the first of those three must-win games. Yet they did precisely that, Diomansy Kamara capping a ludicrous comeback in stoppage time at the Etihad before Birmingham and Portsmouth were felled for no apparent reason.",
      "Fulham’s eagerness to avoid a similar scenario meant a substantial summer spend, with Andy Johnson, Bobby Zamora, John Paintsil and Zoltan Gera among those signed. But it was free agent Mark Schwarzer, released by Middlesbrough, who rejected Juventus and Bayern Munich to move to west London.",
      "Perhaps a full pre-season of Hodgson’s double training sessions of two banks of four was actually the decisive factor but Fulham went from conceding 60 goals in 2007/08 to letting in only 34 in 2008/09, fewer than Arsenal and indeed every team bar the top three, with Schwarzer equalling a record for most clean sheets in a Premier League season for the Cottagers which still stands.",

      "It might also be an idea to identify one of the most effective players in Premier League history, going entirely unnoticed in Ligue Un at a ludicrously low price. Leicester, unbeknownst to everyone including themselves, already had most of the pieces in place to win the title, but N’Golo Kante, a £5.6m signing from Caen, made director of football Steve Walsh perhaps the sport’s most coveted man.",

A great many things would not have happened without lockdown and West Ham almost qualifying for the Champions League is chief among them.",

The promoted pair are in though, except not Burnley, because they haven’t got any academy graduates to sell, just like Fulham and Wolves. The values come courtesy of the wonderful Transfermarkt.",

      "We were umming and aahing over whether to include Colwill and James before giving our heads a wobble and deciding that of course we should.

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim claims it was a “simple” decision for him to pay for staff and their families to attend the Europa League final out of his own pocket.",
      "It was announced earlier this week that the club’s part-owners, INEOS, has offered staff the option to buy two tickets instead of funding their trip to Bilbao, as was the norm for major finals before they took over football operations.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has led significant cost-cutting measures at United including laying off some 450 staff, and amid fear of further redundancies, Amorim has offered to fund the staff to go to the game next week, claiming it was a “simple thing”.",
      "“The situation is simple,” he said during a press conference on Wednesday. “We know that we have had a lot of things with people leaving and changes in the staff. In this moment, in our club, sometimes it is hard [to know] when to give and when to take.",
      "“It is complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff. It is a really hard position. That situation was explained and in that moment I could help. It is not going to change my life to help the staff to be there, to be better for the final.",
      "“All the players had the same reaction. Everyone wants the staff there, their families there. It is hard to manage things in our club, so it is a simple thing.”",
      "United are planning to hold a comically low-rent BBQ in celebration should they beat Spurs and claim the trophy, rather than with an open-top bus parade, but Amorim wouldn’t be drawn on the report.",
      "“Personally for me, I think the Champions League is more important for everything, to prepare the next season,” said the Portuguese. “We are supposed to be in the Champions League; the Europa League here is not enough. This is the best way to get us to the top in a few years.”",
      "Paul Merson labelled the plan not to hold a parade as “arrogance” as they may not win another trophy for 15 years.",
      "“For me, it’s a bit of arrogance. Winning trophies was the past, so enjoy the present. Who says they win another one for 15 years?",
      "“Now they’re going to have a BBQ, think of the fans! They’ll let you know when the parade is on whether it was right to do. Do not leave the fans out because it is about the fans. I would want a parade.",
      "“They could win a trophy and if they win it, they have won more than Arsenal. Arsenal would love to have a parade. It is hard to win trophies, so do not underestimate winning one. It is difficult.”",
      "Is the Man Utd axe ‘looming’ for Ruben Amorim? No, but many want you to think that. Meanwhile, Gary Neville is the king of hyperbole.",
      "Former Everton and Burnley boss Sean Dyche insists he would “win more games” than Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",

      "RB Leipzig have been informed that star midfielder Xavi Simons wants to leave the club this summer, with the Premier League looking like his next destination.",
      "The Dutch international, 22, joined Leipzig on loan from Paris Saint-Germain last year before the Bundesliga side made the deal permanent for around £42m.",
      "But just five months after that agreement, Simons has told the club he’s ready for a new challenge.",
      "Fabrizio Romano confirmed the development on social media this week, reporting: “Xavi Simons’ decision has been made: he’s ready to leave RB Leipzig this summer.",
      "Plan confirmed as reported in recent months — he’s ready for a new chapter with top Premier League clubs and Bayern all attentive to his situation. RB Leipzig are aware of the player’s plan.”",
      "That will come as no surprise to a host of English clubs. Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City and Man Utd have long been tracking Simons, while Bayern Munich are also believed to be watching closely.",
      "However, Leipzig’s asking price and Simons’ preference for a Premier League move put English sides firmly in the frame.",
      "Reports suggest Leipzig want a quick and sizeable return on their January investment, with the Bundesliga side expected to demand around €80 million (£67m).",
      "A sizeable fee, but one that won’t deter top-tier Premier League interest, particularly with Simons’ consistent output at the top level.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Reds repeat: Liverpool the overwhelming F365 favourites to win a 21st title…\n👉 Man Utd are ‘financial shambles’ but are still bigger than Liverpool!\n👉 Arsenal win the title, Leeds survive, Liverpool’s new dynasty – a 2025/26 target for each Premier League club",
      "The Netherlands international has nine goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga this season, despite Leipzig enduring an up-and-down campaign.",
      "Last term, he registered 25 goal contributions across all competitions and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.",
      "Speaking recently, Simons hinted at his future, telling Sky Germany: “I’m still a young player, I have many dreams and the club knows that. But right now, the most important thing for me is to play well in the upcoming games. Then we have the international matches, and after that we’ll sit down and see what happens.”",
      "Simons’ desire to play Champions League football is thought to be a key factor in his decision. Leipzig are currently seventh in the Bundesliga, with their hopes of qualifying for next season’s competition all but over.",
      "That could give the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool the edge. Man Utd are also interested, but their financial flexibility may depend on Europa League success and the Champions League qualification that comes with it, as revealed by Duncan Castles recently.",
      "He said: “Their problem is an obvious one in that they don’t have much money to play with, certainly not the kind of money that Leipzig are looking at as a sell fee.",
      "They will need to win the Europa League and qualify for the Champions League to be able to afford such a deal. But he’s on a list of players that they’re looking at.”",

      "Man Utd’s hopes of landing one of their summer transfer targets on a free transfer have taken a serious hit after Fabrizio Romano revealed Bayern Munich are now in pole position.",
      "Utd had grown “increasingly confident” of securing Tah in recent weeks, amid mounting uncertainty over their defensive options.",
      "With Victor Lindelof expected to leave this summer, and ongoing concerns over Matthijs de Ligt’s fitness amid a number of other injuries, defensive reinforcements are a top priority for INEOS this summer.",
      "Defence isn’t the only priority, as the Red Devils are looking to move early in the market to secure their top targets, including Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "Tah, 29, is viewed as one of the most experienced and dependable defenders on the market. And with his contract up at the end of the season, he had emerged as a serious candidate for a reshaped Man Utd backline under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But Bayern Munich have now made their move.",
      "According to Romano, the Bavarian giants have submitted a full proposal for Tah, including a complete salary package, and have now received internal approval to press ahead.",
      "The only thing left, Romano said on X, is a green light from the player himself.",
      "“Bayern formal proposal to Jonathan Tah has been approved internally at the club, salary included,” Romano confirmed.",
      "“Green light needed from the player in order to close the deal and get it done, as final crucial step. Up to Jonathan Tah.”",
      "Barcelona were also linked earlier this year but are now out of the race. Romano confirmed the Catalan side have no intention of moving for the Germany international, citing their wealth of centre-back options as the reason. “Not because of FFP,” he added, “but because they have many centre-backs.”",
      "Real Madrid, Tah’s current boss Xabi Alonso’s new home, are reportedly focused on other targets. And that leaves Bayern, once again, looking likely to poach a top performer from a direct Bundesliga rival.",
      "It’s a hammer blow to Utd, who were one of the first English clubs to seriously explore the free-agent opportunity and saw Tah as an ideal blend of experience, physicality and leadership.",
      "His 400+ appearances for Leverkusen, capped off by a historic unbeaten title-winning season last term, had put him firmly on the radar of INEOS chiefs.",
      "Tah himself confirmed earlier this year that his decision to leave Leverkusen had already been made.",
      "“Definitely,” he said when asked if he would leave at season’s end.",
      "“I made the decision not to renew my contract and to stick with it. That’s the case now. The club knows about it. Everything has been said from the beginning.”",
      "But there remains a flicker of hope for Utd. If Amorim’s side can secure Champions League football by lifting the Europa League, they could re-enter the frame with a more attractive sporting package.",
      "But for now, Bayern are firmly in control.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly ‘increasingly confident’ of signing Bayer Leverkusen Jonathan Tah on a free transfer as their third summer signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘reached out’ to Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Jonathan Tah as they ‘sense an opportunity’.",
      "Man Utd are weighing up whether to attempt to beat Barcelona and other clubs to the free transfer of Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah, according to reports.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen star Jonathan Tah reportedly has ‘one and a half feet’ in Old Trafford and could sign for Manchester United after Barcelona’s late U-turn."

      "Lots of teams need a striker, he’s available for £30m, he’s young, he scored 12 league goals in a terrible team. Someone’s going to buy him, probably. And that someone is Man United or Chelsea, probably.",
      "The Sun are taking no chances, though, and are hedging their bets to make sure they get it right.",
      "The Sun, May 12:",
      "LIAM DELAP reportedly has a ‘preferred club’ out of Manchester United and Chelsea.",
      "United and Chelsea are thought to be the biggest hitters in the race, with both teams seeking firepower.",
      "However, Delap is now said to favour one side over the other. According to talkSPORT, the 22-year-old would prefer to join United.",
      "The Sun, May 13:",
      "CHELSEA are increasingly confident of landing Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap despite interest from Manchester United.",
      "United are in the market for a new centre-forward but Delap, 22, is favouring a link-up with the Blues’ boss Enzo Maresca, his academy coach at Manchester City.",
      "His clear number one preferred choice will be Arsenal by some point this afternoon.",
      "",
      "Six appeal\nWe’ve all enjoyed the idea of Manchester United having the target of a top-six finish next season, with the Mirror quick to point out that teams leaping 10 places in the table from one season to the next is an unusual event managed only five times by anyone in 20-team Premier League seasons – or ‘FIVE times in history’ if you’re an overexcited Reach headline writer.",
      "But we’re not sure pointing out that United’s own biggest Premier League leap is a mere three places ‘from seventh to fourth’ is all that relevant. The fact they’ve never finished below eighth is kind of the point.",
      "When you look at the club’s entire history, not since 1964 has the club jumped ten spots in the league, and that needed the brilliance of Sir Matt Busby to be achieved.",
      "Yes, but it also needed the non-brilliance of finishing 11th or lower the year before. United haven’t even had the opportunity for a 10-place jump since the final few years before football history officially began – and going from 13th in 1990 to sixth in 1991 feels at least vaguely adjacent to this latest supposed mission.",
      "In all, since those far-off days of 1964, United have had a whopping five whole seasons where a 10-place top-flight finishing position jump was even possible, and in three of those only winning the league could have achieved it. And in one of those they did go from 11th to second, between 1987 and 1988.",
      "So yes, a 10-place jump back into the top six next season seems unlikely and United probably won’t do it. But their own failure to achieve such a thing in over 60 years doesn’t really seem that damning.",

      "Gary Neville claims only ONE Man United player would get in Tottenham’s team and reveals why he has a ‘sickly feeling’ for Europa League final",
      "Just to tick these all off quickly: the TEN players is in fact ‘eight to 10’ by the time you get to the intro and only ‘five or six’ actually still under contract beyond this season by the time you get to Neville’s actual quote, the FOUR club stars are Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia so, well, yeah, probably right, and the Neville ‘sickly feeling’ reveal is… he thinks only ONE Man United player would get in Tottenham’s team. You just told us.",
      "",
      "Snub knows\nA genuinely baffling headline from the Mirror here, creating not so much a curiosity gap as a sense chasm.",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s verdict on Xabi Alonso speaks volumes after Real Madrid snub",
      "Good to know volumes are being spoken at least, that’s always good. But the rest of it is a puzzle. What Real Madrid snub? Who’s snubbing who exactly?",
      "Infuriatingly, we have no choice but to read on to try and find out what’s occurring here.",
      "Jurgen Klopp has hailed Xabi Alonso as a ‘standout’ manager as he prepares to take over at Real Madrid. The Spaniard has already confirmed that he will be leaving current side Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the summer.",
      "Right, okay, fine. But where’s the snub? He’s going to Real Madrid. That is, if anything, the opposite of a snub.",
      "Of course, we do here have the now-standard tabloid use of the word ‘as’ where instead of the usual dictionary meaning of ‘something that happens during the time when something else is taking place’ it in fact means ‘something that happens at literally any time other than the time when something else is taking place’.",
      "Last season, in this specific example, when Xabi Alonso was busy winning the Bundesliga and pointedly not preparing to take over at Real Madrid or anywhere else. It was quite significant news at the time.",
      "Yet still we get no nearer to this Real Madrid snub. Until, far later, when we eventually get this.",
      "Ironically, Klopp might have actually talked himself out of contention for the Real Madrid job, with the Spanish side eventually moving for Alonso. It had long been reported that the former Liverpool boss was among their favoured candidates for the role.",
      "So the snub is Real Madrid not giving the job to Jurgen Klopp, a man who expressed no interest in the job and who made it very clear when leaving Liverpool that he would not be returning to a frontline managerial job for some time and quite possibly ever? What a snub. What volumes spoken. What absolute bollocks.",

      "Dave seems to assume that Liverpool are now firmly established as the utterly dominant force in the Premier League, set fair to effortlessly win titles for a decade to come á la PSG, Celtic etc. That’s surely the only reason you can retrain your sights to usurping Real Madrid astride European football, right? Why jump ship to that mob when we’re about to overtake them? Eh? Eh?",
      "Liverpool are coming off a first league title in 5 years (2nd in 35!!!), fully deserved but with valid question marks over the challenge presented to them. An exit from the Champions League at the last 16 stage having been outplayed home and away. A limp league cup final defeat, and losing to a lower league team in the FA cup. In the grand scheme it’s not exactly the sort of season that screams “watch out Europe, here we come” is it? I’d say that Barcelona, PSG, Bayern and Inter have all objectively achieved more over the course of their seasons.",
      "But it’s Liverpool, so of course the blue touch paper has been lit and they’re on the charge like it’s the early 80s again. And if Jonny Nic once said something about them having a ceiling, it MUST be the case. This is top tier bonkers, backed up by references to a decade old article written by a man who seems to yearn for an era of football when things were simpler and English teams at a general level were utterly dominant. The nostalgia and the associated theorisation there are not objective in any way.",
      "Zero disrespect to LFC as a club here. They naturally have a high ceiling, as do all the other big clubs. That’s the nature of being set up the way that they all are. It’s just supremely arrogant and one-eyed to think that you’re somehow the ONLY team capable of such majestic greatness that you can squash the nasty team of bullies who happen to have just effortlessly nicked your hometown-hero-turned-traitorous-swine. The usual self-obsessed drivel from fans who we’re told are a vanishing minority, but who seem to be omnipresent wherever football is discussed.",
      "As a more specific rebuttal to Dave’s point about Liverpool’s status as the English team with unmatched potential: City could return to their previous guise with the right tweaks to their squad over the summer, without the need for any medium-term planning. Chelsea and Arsenal both have very obvious room for improvement.",
      "And while they’re currently a total mess, if United gradually get their shit together over the next 5 years and their stadium plans come to fruition, you could easily argue that they’d naturally reassume the mantle of “biggest club in England” instead of that phrase just echoing around Old Trafford as it does at the moment. I’m not sure any of those fan bases will set the crosshairs on Real if they do “ascend to the perch” though.\nKeith Reilly",
      "",
      "…Thanks Dave, I really didn’t need reminding how small minded and arrogant the cult followers of LFC are but you certainly managed it.",
      "Sorry Arsenal fans, let’s all remember who the most annoying fan base are.\nWill"

      "Wolves: Start properly, don’t require managerial change by November\nWolves have a recent habit of allowing the sloppy end to one season to bleed into a difficult start to the next, often accompanied by rushed or half-baked managerial change.",
      "They lost four of their last six games in 2020/21, and then four of the first five in 2021/22. That season ended with a seven-match winless run, followed by one win in the first nine of 2022/23.",
      "The 2022/23 season then ended with four defeats in their last seven games, and one win in six started the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "That season ended with seven defeats in the last 10, mirrored by seven defeats (and no wins) in the first 10 games of this season.",
      "The fact Wolves have pretty comfortably remained a Premier League club throughout all that tells you that in the middle part they’re generally doing fine.",
      "But these stumbling finishes and slow starts feel like an unnecessary frustration.",
      "It did look like they might be about to buck the trend this time with a six-game winning run through March and April raising genuine hopes of approaching the summer with momentum and optimism.",
      "May, though, has brought a pair of defeats and with games against Palace and Brentford to come there is no guarantee Wolves do snap back out of it before the summer. And as with West Ham above, and Wolves’ own early struggles this season, it would appear a particularly bad time to be offering early hope to newcomers.",
      "Wolves also have a fine manager on their hands; it would be deeply careless should a continuing trend for slow starts leave them feeling the pressure to switch to a tried-and-tested firefighter by November.",
      "Someone like Gary O’Neil, maybe."

      "Thursday 15 May 2025 22:39, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has played his last game for Aston Villa - for now, at least - after Unai Emery confirmed injury would keep him out against Tottenham. The forward is ineligible to face Manchester United on the final day, so attention now turns to his future.",
      "Rashford is set to decide on his next steps after the season is over, with little certainty around where he will be playing once the summer transfer window has closed, aside from the expectation that it will be away from United.",
      "Being at Villa and working under Emery has rejuvenated Rashford, whose relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim broke down before he left in February. The forward, often overlooked for a place in United's struggling squad, displaced Ollie Watkins at Villa.",
      "Rashford, who scored four goals and provided six assists in 17 games on loan, began to repair his reputation at Villa after a concerning 18 months at Old Trafford in which his work-rate and desire were widely questioned.",
      "Those performances will not have gone unnoticed and are likely to generate a bigger market for Rashford this summer than the one in January. His next move will be crucial, particularly ahead of the 2026 World Cup. But where does he want to go?",
      "Villa are outside the top five on goal difference with two games left to play and, unless they can win heavily against struggling Tottenham and Man Utd, are relying on the teams above them to drop points to return to Europe's top competition.",
      "It is too close to call with two games to go in the hunt for the top five...",
      "United have set that same asking price for any other interested suitors, and it is understood Villa will not have first refusal on Rashford.",
      "Emery's side can make the deal permanent for £40m this summer if they wish, but there is nothing in the agreement which gives them priority.",
      "This means that other interested clubs could buy him at United's valuation if the club and player agree to their proposal.",
      "If Rashford goes elsewhere in the Premier League, it is believed he does not want to move to London and feature for one of the clubs in the capital.",
      "Barcelona were keen on Rashford in the winter window and continue to monitor his situation. The forward was said to be interested in a move to the Catalonian club but an approach never materialised.",
      "Competition for places at Barcelona is high in the wide forward positions, with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, two of the favourites for the Ballon d'Or, unlikely to be displaced.",
      "As far as Man Utd are concerned, they are seemingly already pursuing replacements for Rashford, with Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap among their top targets.",
      "Rashford's wages, of which Villa agreed to cover at least 75 per cent of during his loan, were considered a potential stumbling block in January and could well cause issues again.",
      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",
      "Emery's side sit in sixth place, one spot outside securing a spot among Europe's elite, after winning six of their last seven games in the Premier League.",
      "Villa face Tottenham and Man Utd in their final two fixtures and sit level on points with Chelsea, ahead of them in the table only on goal difference.",

      "\"If Man Utd win the cup [Europa League], they will be celebrating and won't be fussed. If they lose, you'd have to push them out the dressing room to play that game!",
      "\"I see Chelsea winning on Friday Night Football. Then they have to beat Nottingham Forest.",
      "\"The problem is Man City, they could be sixth in the league by the time they play Bournemouth! I expect Chelsea and Villa both to win. City don't play because of the FA Cup final.",

      "Fresh from a 7/1 winning double, our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his Premier League insight and sees problems for Chelsea on Friday Night Football.",
      "Tottenham going off 7/1 with Sky Bet for the away win tells you all you need to know about their prospects in this fixture. It's the biggest price they've been by a long way vs a non-big six team in the last 10 years.",
      "Even if you added another zero to that 7/1, I'd be tempted to swerve it.",
      "Villa have a goal in sight and have been relentless in their pursuit of a top-five finish, winning seven of their last eight Premier League games. They've crashed the markets and the top five party and are now just 11/10 with Sky Bet to finish there.",
      "Pro-Villa angles are the only betting angles to consider across the props markets and with Jacob Ramsey (suspended) and Youri Tielemans (injured) out for this fixture, backing Boubacar Kamara's shots lines makes appeal based on he could be playing with attacking licence.",
      "He did last weekend in the win at Bournemouth, hitting two shots, which is way above his season per 90 average of 0.44. It's 4/1 with Sky Bet for him to repeat the feat and register two or more shots.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's suspension makes this fixture trickier for Chelsea than the 1/3 odds with Sky Bet imply. Jackson has played his last game of this season following that red card at Newcastle and it leaves Enzo Maresca with a huge issue at centre-forward.",
      "Jackson has missed seven Premier League matches for Chelsea this season, they've lost four of those matches against Arsenal, Brighton, Aston Villa and Ipswich, scoring just one goal along the way. A criticism of Maresca this season has been the predictability of Chelsea's play and that is more apparent when you remove Jackson from the equation as he does bring a bit of surprise and directness to what Chelsea are trying to serve up.",
      "Goals could be hard to come by for Maresca's team without their focal point in attack and when you throw in Manchester United's inability to put the ball in the net along with what is lurking on the horizon for them on Wednesday in Bilbao, the goal line set by the markets feels too high.",
      "United have failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton, Everton (both 15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more. Since December 22 they have scored just 21 Premier League goals in their 20 games. The under 2.5 goals line is a big price at 13/8 with Sky Bet considering all the correct scores you get on your side.",
      "Opposing goals in matches at Wembley remains a sustainable long-term betting strategy.",
      "It might be the mecca of English football - to play there is every footballer's dream - but I'm convinced the place saps the momentum out of a game. Maybe the jeopardy of what is at stake plays a part which in turn leads to low-scoring football matches but I think games there rarely spark into life.",
      "The last 46 domestic and European matches played at Wembley, the average goals per 90 stands at 1.98 goals in normal time and if you backed the under 3.5 line in those 45 games, you'd have won 42 times. Yes, the prices on offer for under 3.5 goals are quite tight but a return at that strike rate means you'd be swimming in profit if backing that line blind.",
      "If you back Crystal Palace +1 handicap (double chance) and under 3.5 goals through the RequestABet function with Sky Bet you have a juicy 7/4 shot on your side with Sky Bet.",
      "The Grand Old Lady is set to belt out one final tune and if previous farewell games at stadiums are anything to go by, there should be two things on the menu: a home win and lots of goals.",
      "The final games at Upton Park, Highbury, The Dell, Griffin Park and White Hart Lane all ended with the home team signing off in style with a win and a total of 23 goals scored in those five matches.",
      "Meanwhile, only Sheffield Utd (97 in 23/24) and Swindon (85 in 93/94) have conceded more goals at this stage of a Premier League season than Southampton, so Everton couldn't have wished for a more welcoming visitor on goodbye Goodison day.",
      "Everton to win and over 2.5 goals at 11/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play.",
      "The market has got completely carried away with Nottingham Forest here. Just because they need to win, it doesn't always work out like that.",
      "Taking a price as short as 6/4 with Sky Bet on a Forest win makes little sense based on what Nuno Espirito Santo's team has been serving up for the past 12 Premier League games.",
      "Across those 12 games their expected goals against process is working at 1.68 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process. They allowed Leicester to create 1.29 worth of expected goals and score twice, so West Ham with Jarrod Bowen and Mohamed Kudus bringing top quality final third to the table, should be confident of scoring multiple goals.",
      "Bowen has five goals or assists in his last four starts and looks overpriced to grab another one at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Brentford don't want the season to end. They've lost just two of their last 12 Premier League games, winning the last four for the first time in the top-flight since 1939.",
      "Only Liverpool, Newcastle, Man City and Arsenal have scored more goals in the league this season (63) with the Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa combination so exciting to watch.",
      "The Bees can sting you from all angles though, including set pieces where the addition of Michael Kayode and his excellent long-throw has given them an extra attacking dimension. Sepp van den Berg is the beneficiary of these clever set pieces and he's had eight shots from his last 10 starts when playing centre-back. He is 8/11 with Sky Bet for another shot.",
      "Sometimes the narrative is just too powerful to ignore.",
      "Jamie Vardy will make his 500th and final appearance for Leicester here and will not feature in the season finale at Liverpool next Sunday to allow him a King Power Stadium farewell.",
      "He will be celebrated before and after kick-off as the club finish their home campaign in a battle between two already relegated clubs.",
      "With nothing on the line this could turn into a bit of Vardy sideshow and he is no stranger to grabbing the limelight. He is searching for his 200th goal for Leicester too. His 5/4 anytime goalscorer price is an obvious starting point but boosting it up by taking the 4/1 with Sky Bet on him scoring the last goal of the game makes sense.",
      "Some things are just meant to be.",
      "The draw at 5/2 with Sky Bet must be of interest based on it suiting both teams. If this rolls past 70 minutes with the scores level we could get a drifty end that peters out.",
      "Newcastle know a point will be just fine for their prospects as they'd have Champions League qualification firmly in their hands heading into the final day knowing a win over Everton at home would secure a top-five finish.",
      "Meanwhile, you get the feeling Mikel Arteta and his boys just want the season to end now. Arsenal have dropped 18 points in their last 11 Premier League games, winning just three times and have been beaten by the Toon on three occasions already this season. A draw is fine for them in terms of finishing second with only Southampton to come for them.",
      "Taking a view on player cards in end-of-season games isn't an ideal punting strategy but we've got a full-back here who is in an aggressive mood.",
      "Conor Bradley is a man looking to take his chance following Trent Alexander-Arnold's decision to move on and his ability to play calm and composed isn't going to be helped by the transfer move for Jeremie Frimpong. Bradley does still look quite reckless and raw at times, making five fouls and being carded on both in his last two starts. He's 5/2 with Sky Bet to pick up another booking.",

      "Thursday 15 May 2025 11:51, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has said he is far from quitting as Manchester United boss after warning he could walk away if results do not improve next season.",
      "Amorim was \"embarrassed\" after West Ham came to Old Trafford and won for the first time in nine matches to move above United, whose dreadful Premier League campaign has left them 16th in the table after losing 17 games.",
      "The United boss warned that everyone at the club must \"seriously think about a lot of things\" before saying they should \"give space to other people\" if the poor form continues after the summer.",
      "But Amorim insisted in his press conference ahead of next Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham that he has no plans to step down.",
      "Asked if he would seriously resign, Amorim said: \"I am far from quitting.\"",
      "\"What I am saying is that since I arrived here I am always talking about the standards. I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League, and not say something and take responsibility,\" he added.",
      "\"I have a clear plan of what to do. I understand the problems of the team.\"",
      "But the United boss, far more upbeat than in the aftermath of the defeat to West Ham, warned \"we need to perform or else they will change us\".",
      "Amorim also confirmed he had agreed to pay for his backroom staff to go to next week's Europa League final after reports claimed the club would not be covering the cost of their tickets.",
      "This is just the latest cost-cutting measure implemented under United's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has overseen more than 400 redundancies since taking control of football operations from the Glazer family.",
      "Amorim, who acknowledged it is \"hard to manage things\" at United, said the cut-backs made it difficult for the club to pay for those staff still in a job.",
      "\"We have had a lot of people leaving and a lot of changes in our staff,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"In our club at the moment it is sometimes hard to understand when to take and when to give and to respect the people when we have taken their jobs to survive and rebuild.",
      "\"It is complicated for the club to give to other members of staff, so it is a really hard position.",
      "\"That situation was explained and my reaction was to help because - I am not a good guy - it is not going to change my life. The players had the same reaction.",
      "\"Everybody wants the staff and the families there.\"",
      "Amorim says injured United defenders Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven and Diogo Dalot are pushing to feature in next week's Europa League final.",
      "Yoro joined fellow centre-backs De Ligt and Heaven on the sidelines after limping off in Sunday's 2-0 loss to West Ham with a foot injury.",
      "The trio were absent from training just a week out from facing Spurs and head coach Amorim said: \"I don't know if they are going to be available.",

      "The 26-year-old has made 51 appearances for United this term in all competitions but last month suffered a potentially season-ending calf injury.",
      "\"Dalot is trying really bad,\" Amorim said. \"I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, second injury [follows] and then it's a big thing.",
      "\"We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad, so we will see but he's working really hard to get in the final.\"",

      "Paul Merson has criticised Manchester United's decision not to hold an open-top bus parade if they go on to lift the Europa League trophy.",
      "They would instead hold a small celebration. It has been reported that would be in the form of a barbecue at the club's training ground.",
      "United did not organise a bus parade when they won the Europa League in 2017, the FA Cup in 2016 and 2024, or for the Carabao Cup triumphs in 2017 and 2023.",
      "\"The trophies do not come thick and fast,\" Merson said. \"Man Utd are a million miles off. Enjoy it (trophies) while you can.",
      "\"For me, it's a bit of arrogance.",
      "\"Winning trophies was the past, so enjoy the present. Who says they win another one for 15 years?",
      "\"Now they're going to have a BBQ, think of the fans! They'll let you know when the parade is on whether it was right to do. Do not leave the fans out because it is about the fans.",
      "\"I would want a parade. They could win a trophy and if they win it, they have won more than Arsenal. Arsenal would love to have a parade. It is hard to win trophies, so do not underestimate winning one. It is difficult.\"",
      "Man Utd suffered their 17th top-flight defeat against West Ham in their last outing, with nine of these losses arriving at Old Trafford, and Ruben Amorim will now be tasked with picking his side up in a bid to salvage the campaign with silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim believes he knows \"what the team needs to be so much better\" as he looks to address the \"unacceptable\" position the club finds itself in next season.",
      "\"I'm really embarrassed that in 25 games, we've won six. Something is wrong in the way we are playing football, and sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically and technically.",
      "\"It's the way we face competition and the way we suffer and the way we get mad because we are losing, and the way we protect the goal.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if we can change our position in the league or not - that feeling is nothing about confidence. It's about the belief and the understanding that we are Manchester United, and we don't want to be the worst in the league.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable and, for me, that is not a lack of confidence, that is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "In the build-up to Friday's penultimate league game against Chelsea and the final against Tottenham, United centre-backs Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven have all sat out training.",
      "Amorim could be dealing with a depleted backline against Spurs, judging by United's open training session at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "Yoro limped off during Sunday's 2-0 home defeat to West Ham with a foot problem and was conspicuous by his absence at training, as was De Ligt after picking up an issue at Brentford the previous weekend.",
      "Heaven did individual work ahead of last week's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao but was not seen at Wednesday's session, in which Jonny Evans took part along with Toby Collyer.",
      "Diogo Dalot did an individual session before the main group trained as he seeks to make the final, but Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are out for the remainder of the season.",
      "Former United defender Patrice Evra has called the Europa League final a \"crucial moment in the history of the club\" to salvage a disastrous campaign.",
      "\"I love his honesty. I want him to succeed but of course, the results are really bad this season.",
      "\"It's a process. It's his first year, I see a lot of improvement. Even when I arrived, I had six months to adapt.",
      "\"It would be good to play Champions League due to the player we can attract. It's [Europa League final] a crucial moment for the history of the club.",
      "\"Bruno Fernandes is the most important player in the team. If he wasn't there we wouldn't be in the final and it could have been possible [relegation].",
      "\"We have to forget this season. I am confident but it will be tough. Good luck to both teams but come on Man Utd!\""

      "Man Utd will finish this season with a record-low Premier League points total and their most-ever defeats in the competition",
      "By Pete Gill and Ron Walker",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 18:11, UK",
      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

      "Both matches started in the same vein - Arsenal came flying out of the blocks in both. Like in Paris on Wednesday night, the Gunners had multiple chances to open the scoring - most notably Bukayo Saka's from a free-kick - but they failed to take them. Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side ended the first half with the same number of shots as Liverpool, but they were two goals down. Liverpool took their chances while Arsenal didn't have the firepower. It hit the nail in the coffin that a new striker was needed.",
      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "The three points moves West Ham above Man Utd into 15th. Meanwhile, United, who have now suffered back-to-back league defeats at Old Trafford, are without a league win since March 16.",
      "\"If you look at the goals that we suffer, we can avoid these goals. The lack of energy, of urgency. That is the most dangerous things in this club. You can feel it at the beginning of the game. Between our box and opponent's box there is a lack of urgency. That is something we have to change in this club.",
      "\"I am responsible for that. It is frustrating because we are so near the goals. We have such a lack of urgency to protect our goal. This is week by week. We don't play so well in the Europa League but we have a different sense of urgency.",
      "\"It's something we need to work on. It's inside the pitch and outside the pitch. If we are not able to do, we have to go away and give the space to different people. All of us.",
      "\"We are going to face a team from Premier League so we are going to struggle. Of course we are going to be more focused, and that is a concern because we have to be focused every game.",
      "\"For me, it doesn't matter if we win the Europa League because the problems are much bigger than that.\"",
      "Manchester United suffered their ninth home Premier League defeat of the season, their joint-most ever home losses in a single league campaign, along with 1930/31, 1933/34, and 1962/63.",
      "United have fallen 1-0 behind 12 times at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season, with only Leicester (15) doing so more at home in the 2024/25 competition, while it's the Red Devils' most ever in a single Premier League campaign, overtaking 11 times in 2023/24.",
      "Man Utd are winless in seven Premier League games (drawn two and lost five), their joint-longest ever run in the competition, also going seven without victory from September to November 1992.",
      "West Ham have completed only their fifth top-flight double over United, after 1926/27, 1928/29, 1976/77, and 2006/07. Indeed, this was the Hammers' first league win at Old Trafford since 2006/07, ending a run of 16 league trips there without a win (drawn three and lost 13).",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game.",
      "But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in to this team in the longer-term.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two.",
      "Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch.",
      "You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could improve greatly next season.",
      "West Ham goalscorer Tomas Soucek:",
      "\"It's always great. I'm so proud of how we played. Last week we played in a similar style and we wanted to show how much we want to play for West Ham. We got three points today and I thought it was fully deserved.",
      "\"We were all together and fought for every ball. We had great pressing. When someone went to press others helped him. When somebody lost the ball, we didn't turn our backs.",
      "\"One of my goals is I want to be in the right place at the right moment.",
      "\"Three days ago my wife gave birth to my son so I scored the goal for him.",
      "\"For us and a new manager it's so important to get three points.\""
