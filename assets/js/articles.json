      "Manchester United's pursuit of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton could be thrown into disarray by Liverpool's transfer plans. Ruben Amorim's squad are considering midfield targets after bringing in three forwards this summer.",
      "New striker Benjamin Sesko is set to lead a revamped United attack, supported by fellow signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. After assembling their front three, United have shown interest in Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Seagulls' hefty price tag has reportedly led the club to consider Palace ace Wharton as an alternative. However, United's chances of securing a deal for Wharton could hinge on the futures of Palace's other star players, Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze.",
      "The Independent has stated that United have identified Wharton as an alternative to Baleba due to the latter's price tag, said to exceed £100million. However, it is suggested that the Eagles may demand even more for Wharton if they do part with England duo Guehi and Eze.",
      "Liverpool are keen on Guehi to strengthen Arne Slot's defensive choices. The 25-year-old is in the final year of his contract and Liverpool are hoping to sign the centre-back for £35m, while Palace are believed to be demanding £40m. The centre back is keen on the move but a deal looked to be off with both clubs some distance apart on his valuation.",
      "However, Guehi's situation at Palace has been further muddled by the club's interest in Liverpool's Harvey Elliott, who is valued at the same price. The Sun reports that a swap deal involving Guehi and Elliott hasn't been ruled out, which could damage United's hopes of signing Wharton.",
      "There was previously hope that Guehi might remain at Palace this season, potentially making the Eagles more receptive to offers for Wharton. However, the club are not prepared to let the defender walk away for nothing next summer.",
      "Following Palace's Community Shield victory last weekend, chairman Steve Parish said: \"Players come and go in football clubs, you know, I mean, it's a life cycle isn't it? Hopefully they're still here. That's what I'd like but we'll see.\"",
      "In the meantime, Palace are reportedly eyeing up Elliott as a potential replacement for Eze, who has caught the attention of Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. Eze's release clause is set at £68m, but it s claimed to be expiring on Friday.",
      "Should Palace part ways with just one of Eze or Guehi, the Eagles might be more inclined to consider bids for Wharton. However, if both Guehi and Eze depart, they'll become even more determined to retain the midfielder and will boast a stronger financial position following potential transfer fees for the duo.",
      "The 21-year-old has garnered widespread praise since his switch to Selhurst Park from Blackburn Rovers in February 2024, although injury setbacks hampered his campaign last term, limiting him to just 20 league outings.",
      "The defensive midfielder shares the same age as Baleba, who has likewise caught the eye in the Premier League since his move to Brighton from Lille two years ago. His boss, Fabian Hurzeler, dismissed speculation that Baleba was set to depart the club after he sat out Brighton's friendly against Wolfsburg due to a minor knee problem.",
      "\"He trained today, he trained yesterday,\" Hurzeler said. \"So we don't want to take any risks, but he will be back.\"",
      "United are eager to bolster their midfield ranks ahead of the forthcoming season. Amorim chiefly turned to Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield last campaign.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roy Keane made his thoughts clear on Manchester United's transfer plans by blasting Sir Jim Ratcliffe over his decision to get rid of staff meals. It's been an expensive summer for the Premier League side who've spent over £210million following what was one of the worst seasons in the club's modern history.",
      "Bringing in the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and most recently Benjamin Sesko, Ruben Amorim has transformed his attacking line-up through heavy spending. Despite the overhaul at the top end of the pitch, the Red Devils still possess issues in defence and midfield, especially the latter, with no signings having been made to improve the engine room.",
      "United are interested in signing Brighton's Carlos Baleba, who is reportedly valued at £100million by the Seagulls, who want to recoup a nine-figure fee to part ways with the talented 21-year-old.",
      "The Red Devils have also been linked with a move for PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who announced his acrimonious exit from the French champions on Wednesday after being shunned by Luis Enrique. Donnarumma could well join City instead but United have also been linked with other big-money moves, including for Emiliano Martinez and Adam Wharton.",
      "The two potential incomings were discussed on the return of The Overlap's Rest is Football podcast, as Keane took aim at United's possible further expenditure. \"If United were to get him [Donnarumma] and there's talk of Baleba from Brighton which I can't believe,\" Gary Neville began saying.",
      "After the Irishman asked how United would get the money to pay for Donnarumma and Baleba, Jamie Carragher piped in and said: \"I thought they were going bankrupt. They were months away from going bust weren't they?\"",
      "The Liverpool legend referenced Ratcliffe's claim earlier this year, where he said the club would have run out of money by Christmas this year if he hadn't introduced several rounds of redundancies and cut back on staff meals to save money.",
      "\"Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year - by the end of 2025 - after having me put £232.72m ($300m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer, he told the BBC. \"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans.",
      "\"The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\" In jest, Keane responded with: \"Are the staff gonna get their sandwiches back?\" It was in February that it was announced that free lunches for staff at Old Trafford and Carrington were removed, as well as the closure of the staff canteen at the stadium.",
      "While Keane said United's struggling midfield will receive some respite due to the ability of the new attackers to be on the front foot, it remains an issue for Amorim. The ex-United skipper said: \"There's slightly less pressure on their midfield, don't get me wrong, but that will be the problem that'll still hold them back over the next year or two unless they bring in players.",
      "\"But they have to start somewhere. They weren't going to bring seven or eight players.\" When asked by Neville whether he believes they could pull off a move for Baleba, Keane said there's one main reason a deal won't be done.",
      "\"I'd be surprised if it happens,\" he said. \"I still think he's got to do a bit more. It's still potential. You can't pay £100m for a player that you don't know where it's going to go.\" Amorim's new-look United attack will face an immediate acid test as the Red Devils' campaign commences on Sunday when they host Arsenal.",

      "Manchester United may have finally found a route out of Old Trafford for Jadon Sancho but it will come at significant cost. Serie A giants Roma have launched a £20million bid for the England international — a figure more than £50m short of what they paid for the winger in 2021.",
      "Sancho's four-year spell at United has not seen him find the success many anticipated. A falling out with Erik ten Hag in 2023/24 saw him return to Borussia Dortmund on loan before he spent last season at Chelsea.",
      "The Blues had an obligation to make his move to Stamford Bridge permanent but opted to pay a £5m penalty to see him return to United. Sancho has not been part of Ruben Amorim's first-team set-up this summer and has trained separately as he attempts to broker a move to a new club.",
      "Juventus had been hotly linked with securing a move for the 25-year-old who has just one year remaining on his contract. The Turin-based team have not been forthcoming in getting a deal over the line however, with one Italian chief suggesting players would need to be sold to coutenance a deal.",
      "United have already been forced to admit they will sell Sancho for less than £25m this summer, while Roma could also be interested in a loan deal, per BBC. That would contain clauses to be triggered at the end of the season but is complicated by Sancho's contract situation.",
      "The Red Devils have an option to extend the star's deal by a further year but his significant salary places some doubt over whether United would be willing to action such a move. Sancho was willing to half his wages in order to facilitate a move to Juventus, but the Old Lady were able to offer the lure of Champions League football, Roma are unable to provide the same incentive.",
      "Sancho is one of a number of players United have been unable to get off their books so far this summer. The ex-Manchester City youth product has been kept away from first team operations along with Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The latter is hoping for a move to Chelsea having agreed personal terms but a fee has not yet been agreed between clubs. Antony meanwhile is holding out for a transfer to Real Betis but has been handed an ultimatum by United to make a move more quickly with the La Liga side planning on waiting until the very end of the summer window.",
      "United boss Amorim has suggested that group could yet return to his plans. \"Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team,\" said Amorim earlier in the summer.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",
      "\"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.\"",

      "Gary Neville has warned Manchester United that they risk missing out on European football unless they sign a new goalkeeper. The pundit believes that Ruben Amorim must upgrade on Andre Onana in the final weeks of the transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils have been busy in the transfer market, with Benjamin Sesko joining the ranks and potentially forming part of a new-look front three under Amorim. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who netted a combined 35 league goals for Wolves and Brentford last season, have also arrived at Old Trafford.",
      "United are eyeing a move for Brighton's highly-rated midfielder Carlos Baleba as they look to bolster another area of their squad. However, Neville insists that without a new number one - amid links to PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma - United could fall short of their ambitions.",
      "\"You've got to get a goalkeeper. If you've got a goalkeeper and a midfield player, I think fifth or sixth will be achievable,\" Neville stated on the Stick to Football podcast. \"I think without a goalkeeper, it's eighth or ninth.",
      "\"That is the number one most difficult position in English football, Manchester United goalkeeper. I think it's the most scrutiny that anybody comes under.\"",
      "As for potential replacements for current first-choice Andre Onana, Neville suggested: \"Donnarumma or [Emi] Martinez. When they said about Martinez from Villa earlier in the season, I wanted him. His personality. He's got guts. He's got that presence.\"",
      "Martinez appeared poised to depart Villa this summer following tearful scenes towards the end of last season at Villa Park, but he seems to be remaining with Unai Emery's squad. Meanwhile, Onana has endured substantial scrutiny since joining United as David De Gea's replacement in 2023, though he has won the FA Cup and reached the Europa League final during his time at the club.",
      "Donnarumma has surfaced as a potential target for United late in the transfer window following his recent dispute with PSG. The Italian shot-stopper was omitted from the club's UEFA Super Cup triumph over Tottenham Hotspur and the 26-year-old posted what appeared to be a goodbye message to PSG supporters on social media.",
      "\"From the first day I arrived, I gave everything – on and off the pitch – to earn my place and defend the goal of Paris Saint-Germain,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team's success. I am disappointed and disheartened.",
      "\"I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done. If that doesn't happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.\"",
      "Donnarumma is in the final year of his deal and has yet to pen fresh terms, leading PSG to snap up Lille shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier during the transfer window. However, United's cross-city rivals Manchester City could possibly make a move for Donnarumma, despite welcoming James Trafford back to provide competition for Ederson.",
      "PSG's choice to axe Donnarumma from their Super Cup squad suggests the keeper is set to depart the French giants. When asked about his client's future, Donnarumma's agent Enzo Raiola didn't dismiss the prospect of a switch to England.",
      "\"Gigio is very disappointed, I'm shocked, I didn't expect this from PSG,\" Raiola said, as reported by Gazzetta dello Sport. \"We've had so many seasons of respect and success, a castle of four years has collapsed in ten days.",
      "\"The situation went on for a long time because PSG had offered lower terms in the spring, which Gigio had accepted out of respect for the club and the fans. However, in March-April, once we had decided to move forward together, the club changed the rules again. So we preferred to talk about it again after the Champions League final.",
      "\"We spoke again after the [Club] World Cup, they confirmed the situation, and I replied that Gigio would respect his contract but would not renew. Then, in the last ten days, PSG changed everything again. It's a lack of respect, beyond the technical decisions the coach talks about, and in the coming days we will also discuss with my lawyers how to address the situation.",
      "\"We will consider solutions now, maybe in the Premier League there will be clubs able to pay what's needed. Paris Saint-Germain are asking for big money. They talk about respect, but it's only about the money.\"",

      "Wrexham co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac have been handed a reality check on the extent of their popularity. The two actors have taken the football world by storm since buying the Welsh club in February 2021.",
      "The Red Dragons have registered three promotions in a row, lifting them from the National League to the Championship. Wrexham have also attracted a global fanbase after their achievements were highlighted on the Welcome to Wrexham documentary.",
      "However, while supporters in the North Wales city are more than happy to have the A-list pair on board, a new poll shows not every fanbase would be. Betfair's annual 'Nation Predicts' survey shows 66 per cent of more than 2,000 football lovers questioned wouldn't be interested in Reynolds and Mac owning their club.",
      "Liverpool and Newcastle supporters were most against the idea of Hollywood ownership. The findings of the poll conducted by YouGov Sport are perhaps unsurprising given the two clubs' relative satisfaction with their current owners, who are also far richer than the Wrexham pair.",
      "The Reds lifted the Premier League title last season and a summer of big spending has followed under owners Fenway Sports Group. Meanwhile, Newcastle, backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, clinched their first piece of major silverware since 1969 by winning the Carabao Cup.",
      "Manchester United fans were the most receptive to the idea of Reynolds and Mac taking the helm, with 27 per cent supportive of the prospect, compared to 56 per cent against. That could potentially be down to significant discontent with the Glazer family's ownership and, more recently, the partial takeover by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Surprisingly, 69 per cent of Tottenham supporters were against the notion of the Hollywood duo taking charge, with only 21 per cent in favour. That's despite Spurs fans often voicing their anger at chairman Daniel Levy over the club's fortunes in recent years.",
      "While supporters of Premier League sides might turn their noses up at Reynolds and Mac, who recently filed to legally change his surname from McElhenney, their stock in Wrexham remains as high as ever. And former England goalkeeper Nigel Martyn also believes that celebrity ownership can provide a net benefit for football after highlighting the progress enjoyed by Wrexham and Birmingham City, who are part-owned by NFL legend Tom Brady.",
      "Speaking to Parimatch, Martyn said: \"I think it's been a breath of fresh air if I'm totally honest. Seeing things like the Wrexham documentary on television and how open they've been with everything is great for the game.",
      "\"They're popular people and while Ryan Reynolds is somebody that most people think, 'Yeah, he looks like he's a nice guy and he's funny,' both he and Rob McElhenney are serious about how they run the football club as well.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "\"You won't hear anyone in Wrexham say a bad thing about them, I wouldn't imagine, because they've turned them around from a team that had been out of the Football League to one which I expect to see pushing into the higher echelons and the Premier League. It's been tremendous.",
      "\"Anything that boosts the club and the standing of your club in a positive way is a good thing. To have Tom Brady at Birmingham City, for Birmingham fans, it makes them stick their chest out a little bit further and say, 'Look who we've got now.'\"",
      "He added: \"So far, Wrexham have done it tremendously well and Birmingham appear to be making progress. In all honesty, it doesn't matter how much money you throw at it, there is no guarantee that you're going to win the league. But, so far, both teams have bounced up the leagues pretty well.",
      "\"Fair play to them, it's going to be interesting but I think it's a positive thing, definitely, and celebrity ownership, with people trying to copy Wrexham and Birmingham, is probably something we'll see more and more and more of.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",

      "Instead the 21-year-old is set to join the Baggies as he looks to aid their Championship promotion push and his own personal development, reports the Athletic. The likes of Harvey Barnes have previously excelled after spending time on loan at the Hawthorns.",
      "Several second tier clubs were keen on Collyer but West Brom, where Ryan Mason is now manager, look to have won the race, which puts pay to Brighton's hopes of re-signing the midfielder.",

The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan,\" he said.",
      "Collyer came through the ranks at Brighton before leaving in 2022 and those in Manchester were surprised when the chance to sign him came up. He was considered one of the best midfielders in his age group and United jumped at the chance to snap him up.",

      "Arsenal meanwhile, who drew this fixture last season, will want to get off to the best possible start with Mikel Arteta's side potentially including a number of their new recruits. Viktor Gyokeres is likely to lead the line, which is a plus given Gabriel Jesus remains sidelined with a serious knee injury.",
      "The Brazilian has been out since the early part of 2025 and it meant Arsenal were struggling for players to spearhead their attack, motivating their pursuit of Gyokeres. Leandro Trossard is one player who has done that when required but the Belgian too is struggling for fitness.",

      "Premier League chief executive Richard Masters insists there are no plans to play a top-flight match abroad, maintaining \"it's not a debate around our table\", after La Liga announced its intention to take Barcelona's clash with Villarreal in December to Miami.",
      "England's competition is the most popular globally but all of the matches are played in the UK and that is not set to change. Italy, alongside Spain, have signalled their plan to take a domestic match abroad and are seeking permission from FIFA and UEFA.",
      "It could mean that the Serie A sees AC Milan and Como facing off in Perth, Australia in February. Other one-off matches like the Italian Super Cup and Spanish Super Cup have also been played abroad in recent years.",
      "The Premier League is much more driven by tradition as opposed to some of the other major sporting competitions. Staging NFL games outside of America is now common practice and hugely lucrative but that is not currently on the agenda from a football stand point.",
      "Masters told the BBC: \"I don't think it changes the Premier League's view on this at all, we don't have any plans to play matches abroad. It's not anywhere near my in-tray and it's not a debate around our table.\"",
      "The idea of the Premier League playing an extra round - which became known as the '39th game' - outside England was raised in 2008 but those plans were binned amid huge backlash from fans.",
      "Former Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claimed a decade ago that clubs were keen on the idea, but Masters insists that is not forthcoming despite the amount of American interest in the Premier League. There are 11 US-owned clubs in the top flight, putting them close to the two-thirds majority of 14 that is needed to bring about changes to the Premier League's rules.",
      "Masters added: \"The first thing to say is it hasn't happened yet. You need a whole bunch of things to happen. The Premier League flirted with this over a decade ago and the reason was to grow the league internationally and we were able to do this through different means - digital means, broadcast partners, concepts like the summer series in the US. The necessity that was driving that concept has dissipated.\"",
      "Last year, Liverpool chairman Tom Werner told the Financial Times he hoped to see Premier League games played in New York, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Riyadh and Rio de Janeiro. However, Bournemouth's American owner Bill Foley has said he does not support staging league matches abroad.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has tipped Liverpool for the title and his old side for a Premier League resurgence under Ruben Amorim. However, he believes the Red Devils are one or two bodies short going into the new season.",
      "United kick off their season at home to Arsenal on Sunday and are eager to bounce back from a dismal 15th-place finish last season, which represented their worst Premier League campaign. But with new signings Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha bolstering their attack, there's a sense of optimism for a fresh start.",
      "\"I still think they [United] need one or two more signings,\" said the Old Trafford icon. \"But I think you can see what Amorim is doing. I think it's looking better for Manchester United, and I think they will sneak into the top five. I hope they do, you never know.\"",
      "Laurens was quick to tease Rooney about his obvious bias given his 559 appearances for United. The Red Devils face a monumental challenge in regaining their Champions League credentials, especially after consecutive seasons of setting new records for new all-time worst league finishes.",
      "\"Who did you play for again?\" quipped Laurens, leaving Rooney and the rest of the panel in stitches over his potentially biased perspective. Despite his Everton and United roots, Rooney didn't let his loyalties cloud his judgement as he predicted Liverpool would retain their title.",
      "Moreover, he believes that if Arne Slot's team manage to secure Isak, they're a sure bet for the crown. The Newcastle forward is currently at loggerheads with the club after it was revealed the Swede is determined he has played his last match for the Magpies, keenly awaiting another offer from Liverpool following a rejected £120million bid.",
      "\"I already had Liverpool as favourites to win the title this year,\" Rooney admitted. \"But if Isak comes in, then I think they're gonna be unstoppable.",
      "\"The quality they've got, as Danny's just alluded [to], and I think a big thing was replacing Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. There's a lot of chances created, a lot of goals came from that side. I think [Jeremie] Frimpong has got the attributes to fill that, so I think Liverpool look strong.\"",
      "Rooney could only grin as he spoke the words, though it wasn't one of joy. Rather it seemed to pain the pundit to heap such praise on his old nemeses, regardless of how well-deserved the praise might be.",
      "Many pundits echo this sentiment as the new season approaches, especially with Liverpool bolstering their squad with talents like Florian Wirtz and Huge Ekitike. However, Slot's men may not find immediate success after Crystal Palace snatched the Community Shield at Wembley on Saturday.",
      "Rooney also predicted Arsenal will secure the Premier League's runner-up spot for the fourth consecutive year. He also tipped Manchester City and Chelsea to round out the top four.",

      "Marcus Rashford says Frenkie de Jong has been helping him communicate to his new Barcelona team-mates. The former long-time Manchester United target's English-speaking skills were highlighted when Rashford opened up about his experience settling in at Barcelona.",
      "The forward was left out of United’s first-team training sessions during pre-season by head coach Ruben Amorim, after a falling out last December led to him being exiled from the squad and sent out on loan to Aston Villa until the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "The England international, 27, finally secured his dream move to Barcelona last month, albeit only on loan until the end of this campaign. Rashford has impressed for his new side in pre-season and appears to be settling in smoothly, registering a goal and two assists in four appearances for the reigning Spanish champions.",
      "Playing an important role in that process has been none other than Dutch midfielder De Jong, who once upon a time might have ended up at Old Trafford himself.",
      "Rashford was asked by Gary Lineker on the latest episode of The Rest Is Football podcast what the main language in the Barcelona dressing room is, having previously been Spanish and Catalan during Lineker’s time with the club in the late-1980s.",
      "Rashford began by saying: “It’s still Spanish, a lot of the lads speak Catalan, but the easy thing for me is that a lot of the lads understand English. So I’ve just been picking up on the basics on the pitch, which I think I’ve done quite quickly.”",
      "Rashford, who used Duolingo to improve his Spanish over the summer and has begun taking in-person lessons since his move to Catalonia, went on to explain De Jong’s role in helping him settle in.",
      "He added: “There are good people who are like a bridge. Frenkie [de Jong] speaks really good English, Jules [Kounde] speaks very good English, but they also have good Spanish because they’ve been here a few years.",
      "“But on the pitch, honestly it’s easier than what I thought it would be. Also football overall, I know a lot of people say it, but it’s a language in itself and it’s easy to communicate through the general vibe on the pitch.”",
      "De Jong during Erik ten Hag’s stint as United manager was frequently linked with the Red Devils, which may provide one explanation for his excellent English-speaking skills. Talks were reportedly held between the club and player in the summer of 2022 but De Jong was said to be reluctant due to United’s lack of Champions League football and his desire to remain in Barcelona.",
      "United and Barcelona reportedly even agreed an initial deal worth around £56million, indicating that the Spanish giants were willing to cash in on the midfielder, only for De Jong to refuse a move and United to bring in Casemiro instead.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest was sporadically mentioned the following year, with loose reports of some reignited interest. De Jong, whose current deal runs until 2026, shut down any further speculation this year by telling Sports Illustrated he hopes to renew his contract until 2029.",

      "Liverpool have been tipped to retain their Premier League title by Opta's supercomputer with their algorithm giving the Reds a 28.5 per cent chance of going back-to-back for the first time.",
      "Arne Slot's side won the title relatively unchallenged last term and those on Merseyside and now hoping to claim successive Premier League crowns for the first time ever. Arsenal are backed to be their closest challengers.",
      "Unfortunately for the Gunners though they've been backed to finish second for a fourth season on the trot. Their likelihood of winning the title has been ranked at 24.3 per cent. In keeping with last season's table, Manchester City have been tipped to finish third.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side have invested in a bid to return back to the summit of English football, but the Catalan will go two years without a title for the first time in England if Opta is to be believed. They have an 18.8 per cent chance of success.",
      "Manchester United are hoping for a resurgence after a pre-season under Ruben Amorim and more than £200million of new signings, which includes Benjamin Sesko. However the Opta algorithm believes it will be another mid-table season for the Red Devils with 12th their predicted finish.",
      "At the other end of the table the concerning Premier League trend may continue. Opta's stats believe that Sunderland, Leeds and Burnley will all go straight back down with the Black Cats propping up the table. It would be the third year in successive all the promoted teams go back down.",
      "Wolves are the side tipped to struggle the most, but they will occupy the 17th spot so many teams covet. In fact their likelihood of relegation is just 7.3 per cent. Which is minimal when compared to Burnley (16.6), Leeds (17.8) and Sunderland (34.1).",
      "Chelsea are the team tipped to round out the top four. However the Blues hopes of becoming champions has been largely dismissed, given just an 8.4 per cent chance of finishing top which represents a major drop from the top three.",
      "Their London rivals Tottenham are eyeing a major rebuild under Thomas Frank but few strides are made on last season's difficult year. They remain behind the Red Devils with Opta handing them a finishing position of 14th - which is below Frank's former sider Brentford.",
      "Despite the wholesale changes and the loss of one of their best players the Bees are tipped to finish in tenth, which represents an impressive year given the loss of talent they have had to deal with.",
      "Nottingham Forest were the Premier League's surprise package but Opta has not backed them to replicate those lofty heights. European football could place more strain on their resources with a bottom half finish predicted.",
      "Crystal Palace are likely to be buoyed by the supercomputer's take on their season with the Eagles sat in seventh. That would likely mean European football once again as Oliver Glasner continues to take the club forward, albeit that may be dependent on them keeping their best players.",
      "Aston Villa and Newcastle remain part of the European picture, but there is a change to the order. Unai Emery's side nab fifth place, which could mean a return to the Champions League. The Magpies meanwhile drop to sixth which would be a blow.",

      "Manchester United have been advised that they can secure a top-five finish by making one more crucial signing; Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. Ruben Amorim has been hard at work reshaping his squad this summer following a lacklustre first season in the Premier League.",
      "United's attacking prowess has been significantly enhanced with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Brighton star Carlos Baleba is also on United's radar as they aim to bolster their midfield options.",
      "However, Amorim still faces a conundrum in goal as he seeks to provide competition for current No. 1 keeper Andre Onana. The Cameroonian sat out United's pre-season due to a hamstring injury and was guilty of several high-profile blunders last term.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma has been touted as a potential addition at Old Trafford. However, French newspaper L'Equipe reports that an agreement has already been reached between him and local rivals Manchester City, with Pep Guardiola seemingly set to thwart any move to United, despite having already brought back James Trafford from Burnley this summer.",
      "Ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster has now urged his former club to refocus their attention on signing Villa's Martinez. A loan switch for the Argentinian was mentioned earlier in the transfer window, and was reportedly turned down by Villa.",
      "Foster reckons he could be the crucial component to help United secure a top-five finish this season, which would now guarantee them Champions League football for the subsequent campaign.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"United have got a better chance of doing it this year. I've loved United's transfer window. I think it's taken them and changed them from having another mid-table disappointment of a season to genuinely looking like competing alongside Newcastle and Villa.",
      "\"I think that if United get off to a good start, they can finish fifth this season. If they get another goalkeeper in, and if Emi Martinez has signed for Man United, they finish fifth this season.\"",
      "Martinez sparked concerns amongst Villa supporters that he was poised to depart the club after what seemed to be an emotional farewell at the conclusion of last season. As he left the pitch following the final home match of the campaign, he tearfully gestured to the fans before heading off the pitch.",
      "Villa are believed to have informed United that it would require an exceptional bid of around £40million to part with their first-choice keeper. Last month, The Athletic reported that the club would not be pursuing Martinez further due to the asking price and substantial wage demands.",
      "Meanwhile, former Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos has suggested that United should consider signing Inter Milan goalkeeper Yann Sommer.",
      "\"I think Yann Sommer is a very, very experienced player and a calming presence,\" Senderos told BoyleSports. \"He makes the defence better because of that presence.",
      "\"I can't really judge Andre Onana in this situation, but if United were to target Yann Sommer, I'd really believe he'd add invaluable experience.",
      "\"It's about how he is as a person, how he is on the pitch. He's a great character and amazing in what he brings to a defence. We've seen it with Inter Milan and Bayern Munich the year before.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been reunited with his favourite No. 30 shirt at Manchester United, after fellow summer signing Diego Leon gave him the number. Sesko, 22, was unveiled at Old Trafford during United's recent friendly against Fiorentina.",
      "He arrived in a deal worth £66.4million with potential add-ons of up to £7.6m. There will be a lot of pressure on Sesko, as well as fellow forward recruits Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It has become apparent his new team-mates are doing their best to make himself feel at home. One star who has gone above and beyond is Leon, who gave up his first ever United shirt number to give it to the Slovenian international.",
      "Leon, who arrived shortly after Cunha from Paraguayan side Club Cerro Porteno, was initially given the No.30 shirt when he joined the club. After Sesko arrived, the young left back gave up his number - despite wearing it in friendlies against West Ham United and Bournemouth - so the forward can be handed his favourite shirt.",
      "For Leon, his move to United is a significant moment in his young career and it's likely his first United shirt will mean a lot to him. His decision to part with it and take the No.35 instead demonstrates his selflessness and ability to see the bigger picture.",
      "Sesko has worn the No.30 since 2020, when he was playing for RB Salzburg, before moving to RB Leipzig in the 2023-24 campaign. After his arrival on the red side of Manchester, he was paraded to jubilant United fans at Old Trafford, before his new side went on to draw 1-1 with Fiorentina.",
      "Shortly after securing his move, Sesko did not contain his excitement. He told the official Manchester United website: \"It's just a historical club that is unbelievable. For me, the team is great.",
      "\"It is getting better and better and that's why also there is just stuff that makes you come there, gives you this energy that you want to be part of. I think it's a great project, in general, and I can't wait to start, definitely.",

      "Big things will be expected from Sesko, who was also subject to immense interest from Newcastle United in the summer and from Arsenal, until the north Londoners opted to focus on Viktor Gyokeres instead.",
      "Last season, Sesko contributed 21 goals and six assists in 45 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig. He was particularly impressive in the Champions League, where he netted four goals in eight appearances.",

      "Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes are at odds over Manchester United's decision to splash out on Benjamin Sesko. Scholes fears the club is repeating past mistakes made with Rasmus Hojlund, but Ferdinand feels differently.",
      "The Slovenian international has officially put pen to paper on a five-year deal with the Red Devils after RB Leipzig accepted a bid of £66.4million plus £7.6m in add-ons. With a total package worth £74m, United pipped Newcastle to the post for Sesko's signature after the Magpies launched their bid earlier in July.",
      "Despite Newcastle offering the striker a more lucrative wage package than United, Ruben Amorim's project persuaded the 22-year-old to turn down the north east and the promise of Champions League football this season. However, United legend Scholes believes that Sesko may have made an error in choosing his former club. He fears the fans will scrutinise the young striker as they did previously with Hojlund.",
      "During The Overlap Fan Debate last week, the ex-United midfielder expressed his belief that Newcastle would have been a better place for young Sesko to develop. Scholes said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed – going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",
      "However, the former England international recognised the potential for future success at Old Trafford, but remained adamant in his belief that Sesko should have opted for Eddie Howe's side. He added: \"Which club are going to be successful first? Are Man United going to win the league before Newcastle – if they ever do? Of course they are.",
      "\"That's why he wants to go there, but I'm saying, from a United point of view, is it the best bit of business? I still think you're in the same boat as having Hojlund.\"",
      "Despite Scholes' reservations, another former United legend believes that Sesko arrives at the club with considerably more experience than Hojlund possessed in 2023. Ferdinand continued the debate on his YouTube channel, Rio Presents, protesting that Sesko will thrive in Manchester.",
      "Ferdinand said: \"Now we've got someone who's not as experienced but he's more experienced than Rasmus Hojlund. He's played probably almost double the amount of games as Hojlund when he came, he's two years older than what Rasmus Hojlund was when he signed.",
      "\"And he's shown that he can score goals. He hasn't gone and blitzed it and scored a ridiculous amount of goals, but he's a kid. He's young. Again, we can't expect that. I don't see him coming in and scoring 25 Premier League goals, or 20 Premier League goals.",
      "\"If he comes and scores between 10 and 15, I think that's an unbelievable return.\"",
      "When quizzed on why he believes Sesko will fare better at United than Hojlund has managed, Ferdinand added: \"Well, I think it's more hope at the moment. I think we've got to wait and see man. I think because you look at it and go, when Hojlund came and when Amorim came during the season, it's a new way of playing, a new style, a new environment.",
      "\"The manager was finding his feet and also you have a number nine finding his feet. So under Amorim, that's the way it's been for him [Rasmus]. So hopefully, there's a clearer picture, a clearer identity given the preseason that we've had.",
      "\"There's more goals, like I said, and players that understand the Premier League getting more experience up top, in the top end of the pitch. You'd like to think that counts for a lot going into the new season, to help a new number nine coming into the building.\"",
      "Whilst the two United icons might disagree over Sesko's potential impact at Old Trafford, the most crucial viewpoint belongs to the striker himself – and he certainly believes in his ability to restore glory to the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "In an interview with MUTV, the 22-year-old said: \"For me, the team is great. It is getting better and better and that's why also there is just stuff that makes you come there, gives you this energy that you want to be part of. I think it's a great project, in general, and I can't wait to start, definitely.",
      "\"I've just been here for a couple of hours and it's already been amazing. I can already feel that we're going to be a great family and it is a pleasure to be part of it.",
      "\"It feels good, you know, the thing is it [the badge] fits well and I'm looking forward to just playing in it a lot and try to represent in the good ways possible.\"",
      "With speculation surrounding his future at United, current number nine Hojlund previously insisted he will fight for his place in the squad.",
      "During the recent pre-season tour in America, the Danish striker said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Since then, however, it appears that Hojlund has warmed to the idea of a move to AC Milan. Only time will tell if he'll be giving Sesko a run for his money in the squad this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Although nothing is finalised, Sheffield Wednesday are thought to be leading the race to sign Amass and it's understood United would be happy to send the youngster to Hillsborough Stadium.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been in turmoil over the last few months due to problems with the club's owner, Dejphon Chansiri. The Owls were handed a transfer embargo for their failure to pay players and staff, but the embargo has been lifted and they have pitched to sign Amass on loan for 2025/2026.",
      "Despite the unrest at Sheffield Wednesday, United sources have indicated that game time is the priority when considering a loan offer and Amass would benefit from consistent starts.",
      "Amass is understood to be weighing up his options, but United have no qualms about potentially sending him on loan to Sheffield Wednesday and would green-light a move to S6.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday started the Championship season with only 16 registered first-team players after several departures and supporters have protested against the club's ownership.",
      "Last weekend, Sheffield Wednesday fans walked into their game against Leicester City late to protest against Chansiri, and further protests are planned before facing Stoke on Saturday.",
      "The Sheffield Wednesday Supporters' Trust has encouraged fans not to buy other merchandise or food at the ground, while supporters have boycotted the new home and away kit.",
      "After internal discussions and the arrival of Diego Leon this summer, Amass was earmarked for a loan move. Ruben Amorim handed Amass his first-team debut against Leicester in March and the youngster made a total of seven first-team appearances throughout the campaign.",
      "Amass was named on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham. He was subsequently considered to stay with the first-team for the new season, but Leon has impressed in pre-season.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Paraguay club Cerro Porteno to sign Leon, who was due to be assessed this summer before a decision was made on his future.",

      "Manchester United will be eyeing a winning start to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign when they face Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The Reds, who have not beaten the Gunners in the league for almost three years, will be hoping to build on the positive atmosphere and environment that has been created on the back of a successful pre-season campaign on and off the pitch.",
      "United went unbeaten in pre-season for the first time since 2019 and brought in four new signings.",
      "Ahead of the visit of Mikel Arteta's side, United's players and staff are continuing to put the hard yards in at Carrington, and here are five things we spotted from Wednesday's training session:",
      "The weather has been glorious in Manchester this week, meaning Ruben Amorim's players have been gearing up for Sunday's curtain-raiser in sweltering conditions.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The sun has been beaming down on the club's training ground, meaning United's players have been pushed to the maximum. The weather forecast for Sunday says temperatures could reach as high as 26 degrees Celsius.",
      "Pictures captured from Wednesday's training session at Carrington showed several members of the squad training in sleeveless vests. Among those donning a top of that type included Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Unfortunately, it will not be all that long before United's players are reaching for their hats, gloves and snoods for training.",
      "On Monday, United published images that had been captured from Sunday's post-Fiorentina training session. The day after a game is a recovery day for the starters, while those who start on the bench train as usual, whether they come on or not.",
      "Every substitute from the 1-1 draw with Fiorentina was accounted for except for striker Rasmus Hojlund. It felt somewhat significant amid United's efforts to offload him to AC Milan.",
      "However, he was pictured training alongside the rest of his teammates on Wednesday, meaning he remains in contention to be included in the squad for Sunday's game.",
      "It wouldn't be a United training session without a youngster or two involved. It has become a regular theme at Carrington in recent years, and Amorim has not shied away from giving some of United's most promising talent a chance to catch the eye.",
      "After going on the pre-season tour of the United States, both Tyler Fredricson and Jack Fletcher are continuing to train with United's senior figures. It was confirmed on Wednesday the latter was working with the first-team squad.",
      "Fredricson, 20, was given his senior debut by Amorim towards the end of last season, starting United's Premier League defeats to Wolves and Brentford. Fletcher is still waiting to make his competitive bow for the club, but was named on the bench seven times last term.",
      "With just three days to go until the opening game of the season, it is looking increasingly likely Noussair Mazraoui will miss out. Just as he was on Sunday, the Moroccan was absent from the pictures published from Wednesday's session.",
      "The defender has been missing since United's 0-0 draw with Leeds United in Stockholm almost a month ago, failing to play a single minute of their tour of the United States. He is currently nursing an injury and the last image published of him by United in training was on July 25.",
      "The Moroccan was a key player for the Reds last season, racking up 57 appearances in all competitions.",
      "The start of a new season always brings fresh optimism and hope. After a successful summer both on and off the pitch, United's players have every right to be in an upbeat mood ahead of the clash with Arsenal.",
      "The pre-season tour of the US captured just how positive the mood is within the camp, and that appears to have continued since returning to England just over a week ago.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Despite already signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon, Enzo Kana-Biyik and Matheus Cunha, the club want more over these final three weeks of the summer transfer window. Further business could still be done on the market despite their significant investment in three high-profile attacking signings.",
      "Carlos Baleba is of interest to United - albeit Brighton & Hove Albion are said to want £100million. Gianluigi Donnarumma is another name around whom speculation continues to increase after quickly falling out of favour at Paris Saint-Germain this summer. United, however, must move on multiple players before they go again in the market.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia spent pre-season away from the first-team squad to help secure transfers. Due to Sesko joining, Rasmus Hojlund is another player who appears to be on the way out, while another goalkeeper arriving could impact the futures of Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır.",
      "Follow the latest Manchester United transfer news below:",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano on his YouTube channel, Brighton have deployed the same negotiation tactic they used to offload Moises Caicedo, to Chelsea, on Manchester United for Carlos Baleba.",
      "The journalist said: \"For Carlos Baleba, the contacts are still ongoing. This is a difficult deal for Manchester United, not just financially but also in terms of strategy.",
      "\"What is important to mention is Manchester United are still there, still in contact with the agents, still working on a deal. They want to understand how high is the wall from Brighton but they are still working on the Carlos Baleba.\"",
      "Romano added: \"They are not giving up. Difficult? Yes. Very difficult? Of course. But, United are still there.",
      "\"The player is not closing the doors at all. Personal terms are not a problem, European football for Baleba is not a problem. He'd go to United immediately and I can guarantee that. But club to club, we are still far from a solution...\"",
      "Fulham are showing 'tentative interest' in signing Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund, according to the Daily Mail. Marco Silva's side are weighing up a move for the Denmark international as Rodrigo Muniz is the subject to offers from Serie A side Atalanta.",
      "AC Milan have been in talks with United for Hojlund and have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m. However, the 22-year-old has made it clear that he wants to fight for his place at Old Trafford, despite the arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last week.",
      "Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho has been given until the weekend by Besiktas to make a decision about their offer before they turn their attention elsewhere, as per journalist Secan Dikme, via Sports Digitale. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are said to have 'gotten tired' of waiting for Sancho this summer.",
      "They're yet to hold negotiations with United about him but if they don't receive a response, they will turn their attention to other options. The pressure is now on Sancho to make up his mind.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand has advised Hojlund to leave Old Trafford this summer to provide himself with further experience.",
      "I think Rasmus Hojlund has to go on loan. I think if I was him, I’d definitely want to go out on loan, minimum – fresh start. Italy. He knows the place and did good out there. I think it would be a good move for him. What could happen when he comes back? Who knows?",
      "Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho has now agreed terms with Chelsea, according to journalist Ben Jacobs for GiveMeSport.",
      "The 21-year-old is 'waiting' for a move to Stamford Bridge, as club-to-club talks are advanced.",
      "United insist on receiving at least £50m for Garnacho, as the Reds argue that he should not be sold for much less than the £52m Chelsea got for Noni Madueke, who made the move to Arsenal last month.",
      "However, Chelsea are aware that United need to sell players, especially if they want to pull off a record-breaking deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba before the end of the transfer window.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, following a summer which has seen him be linked and ultimately reject a move to Saudi Arabia, Fernandes has set out his goals for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "I hope you'll hear less about Bruno this year, but a lot more about United. That's my main objective because my name being spoken, let's say vaguely alone, it doesn't fill me with pride or anything. United being talked about, being positive, that's the most important thing and that's what I want for this season. If it happens that Bruno has to score fewer goals, provide less assists or do another type of provision of what is necessary for the games, I would be very happy.",
      "Roma have submitted an official bid to Manchester United to sign Jadon Sancho, according to Fabrizio Romano. The Serie A side have offered £20million to United for the 25-year-old's services.",
      "I Giallorossi are also open to a loan to buy deal for Sancho, should that be United's preference. The Reds, however, are keen to offload the England international on a permanent basis.",
      "Gian Piero Gasperini's men are in contact with both Sancho and Aston Villa's Leon Bailey, as they look to strengthen out wide before the end of the summer.",
      "Sancho, meanwhile, has 'opened the doors' to a move to Roma and is prepared to make the switch to Italy for the next step of his career.",
      "While there is scepticism that a deal for Baleba can be sorted between now and September 1, Fabrizio Romano believes that derives from club to club negotiations rather than the 21-year-old's preferences to the move.",
      "Romano claims he 'guarantees' that Baleba would agree a move to Old Trafford quickly if a fee could be agreed.",
      "However, agreeing said sum is still far down the line.",
      "Explaining the latest situation in a Q&A, The Athletic's Laurie Whitwell has discussed the possibility of signing Baleba this summer.",
      "The journalist believes that there is a level of scepticism on both sides that the deal will be done this summer.",
      "If that's the case, it could be time to look at some alternatives that have been mentioned previously.",
      "Along with Wharton and Baleba, it is believed that Atalanta's Ederson and Sporting's Morten Hjulmand are being considered by the Reds.",
      "Ederson has been heavily linked with the Reds for some time now and has yet to move from the Italian club.",
      "Hjulmand, meanwhile, has a long-standing relationship with Amorim after they worked together in Lisbon previously.",
      "Accompanying their update on Amorim's stance, The Independent adds that United see Wharton as an alternative target this summer.",
      "Eventually, the dream scenario would be to play Baleba alongside Wharton but Crystal Palace are expected to be even trickier to negotiate with.",
      "It is believed Steve Parish has no interest in potentially losing Wharton, on top of Guehi and Eze before the window closes.",
      "The Independent understands that Amorim is pushing hard for Baleba to join his team.",
      "He sees the Cameroonian as being a player who could complete his midfield this summer and add more bite to the centre of the pitch.",
      "However, there are alternatives that could be considered to bolster United.",
      "Amid the ongoing reports that United want to sign the Brighton midfielder Baleba, the Daily Telegraph understands that the Seagulls have set a price tag of £100m for him.",
      "It has long been thought that Brighton will value the central midfielder the same as Moises Caicedo who left them to join Chelsea for £115m.",
      "Unsurprisingly, it is believed that United will not want to purchase Baleba at that price.",

      "United are reportedly willing to include Jadon Sancho in a deal to sign Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Independent, however, claims Brighton & Hove Albion are unlikely to accept such a proposal, instead wanting around £120million. United are said to be considering a £80million initial offer, paying the other £40m in add-ons.",
      "Milan are reportedly prepared to match the wages Rasmus Hojlund is currently on at United.",
      "Corriere dello Sport claim the Italian club are now trying to reach a financial agreement with the striker. Negotiations are reputedly ongoing on a loan with an option to make the move permanent for Hojlund.",
      "Nineteen days remain of this summer transfer window, with the Premier League season just one more sleep away. We will update you on all the latest reports about United's potential business in the market throughout today.",
      "According to The Independent, United are pushing to sign Carlos Baleba before the transfer window slams shut on September 1. The report claims that Ruben Amorim wants to sign a midfielder this summer, and Adam Wharton has been identified as an alternative to the Brighton ace.",
      "It's said that United would, ideally, like both, but Crystal Palace are expected to be even more difficult to deal with than the Seagulls.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping an eye on long-time target Harry Kane. The 32-year-old, who joined Bayern Munich from Tottenham Hotspur in 2023, has a release clause in his contract which will come into play in January 2026.",
      "This could see him leave the Bundesliga champions for as little as £56m. Kane, who won his first major trophy earlier this season, has two years remaining on his current deal.",
      "Manchester City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Gianluigi Donnarumma over a move to the Etihad. The Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper has recently been linked with a move to the Premier League after he was deemed surplus to requirements at the Parc des Princes under Luis Enrique.",
      "United were one of several clubs linked with a move for Donnarumma, though it seems that bitter rivals City are now looking to strike a move for the shot-stopper. French publication L'Equipe claims that the 26-year-old had been in talks with both United and City but it is the latter who have reached an agreement on personal terms.",
      "Manchester United's blockbuster signing of Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko has reportedly caused frustration not only among their Premier League rivals, but also clubs abroad.",
      "It represented a major coup for the Manchester club, as the 22-year-old was also a top target for Newcastle United, who are desperately searching for a potential replacement for Alexander Isak. But it seems the Magpies were not the only club on the continent eyeing a move for the striker.",
      "According to Spanish outlet SPORT, Barcelona in particular have been left ‘hurt’ by Sesko’s recent switch to Old Trafford. Sporting director Deco is said to rate the player highly and was considering him as a long-term successor to Robert Lewandowski.",
      "Following on from reports that a deal for Brighton's Carlos Baleba is not imminent, that has now been backed up by a report from The Telegraph.",
      "The article notes that Manchester United are currently unwilling to buy at the Seagulls' asking price of more than £100 million and the clubs have not yet spoken directly.",
      "While the 21-year-old is the midfielder the United hierarchy would like to sign, they are still operating within tight profit and sustainability lines.",
      "Instead, they decided to put their resources into strengthening the forward line, most recently with the addition of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig."

      "Arne Slot's side finished ten points clear of the Gunners in second place, with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City 13 points adrift of the summit in third. Enzo Maresca's Chelsea completed the top four, and a number of big name pundits have waded in on the debate ahead of this weekend's Premier League curtain raisers.",
      "Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has been left impressed by Ruben Amorim's summer transfer window but believes they still need further additions to sneak a top five finish.",
      "\"I still think they need one or two more signings,\" Rooney told the Match of the Day special edition preview. \"But I think you can see what Amorim is doing. I think it's looking better for Manchester United, and I think they will sneak into the top five. I hope they do, you never know.\"",
      "Rooney made it clear he expects Liverpool to retain the title, predicting Arsenal to finish second for the fourth year in a row, with Man City and Chelsea completing the top four.",
      "\"I already had Liverpool as favourites to win the title this year,\" said Rooney. \"But if Isak comes in, then I think they're gonna be unstoppable.",
      "\"The quality they've got, as Danny's just alluded [to], and I think a big thing was replacing Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. There's a lot of chances created, a lot of goals came from that side. I think [Jeremie] Frimpong has got the attributes to fill that, so I think Liverpool look strong.\"",
      "Former United defender Gary Neville believes Amorim's side could finish in fifth or sixth, but stressed the importance of signing one key position.",
      "“You’ve got to get a goalkeeper. If you’ve got a goalkeeper and a midfield player, I think fifth or sixth will be achievable,” Neville argued on the Stick to Football podcast. “I think without a goalkeeper, it’s eighth or ninth.",
      "“That is the number one most difficult position in English football, Manchester United goalkeeper. I think it’s the most scrutiny that anybody comes under.”",
      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher does not believe Liverpool would be automatic title favourites this season even if they sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak. \"Yeah, I think so,\" Carragher replied when asked if the Reds are the favourites.",
      "\"But I don't get this narrative of Liverpool are going to run away with it. If you look at history, it could tell you that it's not just about having the best players, it's about having the best team, and sort of making that balance right, and at the weekend it didn't quite look right.",
      "\"I think we will have a title race, and I think there's a lot of talk. I think the great thing about football is what we actually saw on Sunday with Liverpool. It didn't look right.",
      "\"It tells me it's not just about spending lots of money and buying the best players, you've still got to manage that team and make it work and have a nice balance to it.\"",
      "\"If they get Isak, which it looks like he's agitating for a move, then it will make them massive favorites. But Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, I think will push them closer than last year.\"",
      "Former Spurs and Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp also believes Liverpool are on to retain the Premier League title this season, especially if they're able to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, with Manchester United omitted from his predictions.",
      "He told BetVictor Casino : \"I'd have to fancy Liverpool again. They're looking strong, have made some good signings and are still obviously trying to get Alexander Isak in.",
      "\"If they get him, that would be icing on the cake probably for them. I've just got a feeling they could go on a run for a couple of years like we had with Manchester City dominating.\"",
      "\"Arsenal and Man City, they're the two big dangers,\" Redknapp added. \"I think everyone's expecting Chelsea. They're going to do it, they'll be close. But I think Arsenal and Man City, I see them as bigger dangers than Chelsea to Liverpool.",
      "“I think that will be the top four basically in whatever route, I think Liverpool top. After that, it will be second and third for either Arsenal or Man City. And I think Chelsea will probably finish fourth again.”",
      "Also on The Overlap - Stick to Football podcast, Neville probed Arsenal legend Ian Wright on whether Arteta's squad could finally clinch their first championship since 2004.",
      "Initially, he highlighted the three issues that Arsenal seem to have addressed, with the north London side now boasting a fit squad and having secured Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and prolific striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "Neville, speaking to Wright, said: \"Last season, three problems - injuries to [Bukayo] Saka and [Kai] Havertz obviously caused big problems, obviously you have to keep players fit.",
      "\"You had a problem in midfield and you've got Zubimendi come in and you had a problem up top, with presence really, and Gyokeres has come in. Does that give them the 'difference' to win the League?\".",
      "Wright replied: \"I hope so. I think so, because we've added to a team that's finished second three times now and we've added goals to it.",
      "\"You know, Zubimendi, especially with that mid-block [in the opposition] we can't break, Zubimendi the way he plays, I'm watching him break through [the mid-block]. You've got Gyokeres who can score a goal. You look at the fact that [Arsenal] were 17 goals behind Liverpool [last season] but defensively we're brilliant.",
      "\"So if we can sort that out, and this mid-block [problem] then yeah, I'm going to go for Arsenal again, of course I am, because absolutely, why wouldn't I?\".",
      "He further commented: \"What's good about us as well is the [contract] renewals. Saka, in good form now, he's probably going to renew. Gabriel, Ethan [Nwaneri], and for [Arsenal sporting director, Andrea] Berta to come in, and he's unbelievable when you meet him, Berta's done the deals, he's got it done.\"",
      "Despite his doubts, Keane supported Wright's evaluation, suggesting that Arsenal have genuinely addressed their issues, stating: \"Yeah, I'm going with Arsenal,\" while warning that Liverpool's ability to score under pressure could be a deciding factor.",
      "\"The only thing, and I'll go back to Liverpool, and Liverpool on a bad day, when they're off they can score three goals,\" Keane added. \"Even in the [Community] Shield at the weekend, [where they lost to Crystal Palace on penalties] they still scored two goals. And if you're scoring two goals on average every game, then that's hard to stop.\"",
      "However, Wright, undeterred, reiterated: \"We finished second three times, why would I go someone else?\"",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, Micah Richards revisited last year's predictions before giving his take on this season, saying: \"It's a hard one because I remember saying last season that I thought Manchester City had won it if everyone stayed fit. If [City] got any injuries, those little injuries could be the difference.",
      "\"Bringing in Gyokeres now for Arsenal is massive. And not just because he's a big-name forward. Because of his movement that we talk about with strikers all the time. Havertz is really good, we're all big fans of Havertz, but in a number 10 position where he can create, not leading the line.",
      "\"I know [Havertz has] done really good movement when he plays up there but he hasn't got a striker's instinct. So that's why I think Gyokeres is gonna add something really special.",
      "\"I still don't know if it's enough to get them [Arsenal] over the line. I still don't know. I think one or two injuries and they're back to the same as last season. So I'm going to say challenging but not champions.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer was in agreement with his podcast co-pundit, telling the Rest is Football podcast Arsenal will just miss out again this season. He said: \"I think they’ll challenge, I just think they may fall short again.",
      "“I like all of their signings. I think that’s exactly what they needed. And I still don’t think they may be finished yet in terms of bringing players in and certainly players going out.",
      "“I’ve definitely got them in Champions League but I just don’t see them having enough to win the title. Just fall short.”",
      "Gary Lineker also followed suit, stating: \"I think I concur with both of you on that front. I probably wouldn’t have said that if it wasn’t that Liverpool have strengthened so well. A lot too will depend on how Gyokeres does. I mean he scored a terrific goal in pre-season but we all know pre-season is not that important.",
      "\"Although, it is for a striker in terms of that feeling of hitting the back of the net. So I think a lot will depend on him but we know he’ll get good service. I think they could go close again but I’m going to agree.\"",
      "Former Man City defender Joleon Lescott believes Pep Guardiola's side will bounce back this season and win the title. Speaking at the launch of the new Topps Premier League 2025-26 trading card collection, he said: \"Regardless of how last season panned out, they are definitely going to be one of the favourites. It's Pep Guardiola, it's Man City with some of the world's best players\", reports the Mirror.",
      "\"It would be foolish to not see them as favorites in every competition they enter. That doesn't mean they're going to win everything, but they're definitely one of the favorites.\"",
      "City finished last season 13 points behind Arne Slot's Reds but Lescott felt there was a pretty clear reason behind it.",
      "\"It was obviously an unprecedented season for them last year, but they've achieved something no one in the history of English football has achieved so it's always going to take its toll,\" he explained.",
      "\"It did that last year. Not only a physical toll, but a mental toll to stay focussed for that long and to have to win games for that period of time. When they recognised that they weren't going to win the title, whether it was subconsciously or not, they were able to switch off a little bit.",
      "\"Physically the demand was still there but hopefully they've had a break mentally, not to have to go out there and concentrate points wise, hopefully that now means they'll come back ready to go.\"",

      "That match could see three players make their competitive debuts for the club. Over the summer so far, United have completed the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and striker Benjamin Sesko, while 18-year-old Diego Leon also arrived after a deal to sign him was struck in January.",
      "But there could also potentially be some United players making their debuts away from Old Trafford over the weekend. The club have both midfielder Daniel Gore and Ethan Wheatley out on loan to EFL (English Football League) clubs with both having played for their new clubs over the past two weekends.",
      "But it seems that two other youngsters are now closing in on temporary moves away from Old Trafford. Midfielder Toby Collyer is closing in on a loan move to West Bromwich Albion with the Baggies beating off plenty of Championship interest in the 21-year-old.",
      "Left-back Harry Amass looks likely to join crisis club Sheffield Wednesday on loan to build up more first team experience over the season. The Owls are now able to sign loan players and free transfers after having a transfer embargo lifted.",
      "Both teams are in Championship action this weekend, but face a race against time if they wish for the United youngsters to make their debuts. Players have to be signed before 12pm on Friday to be able to feature this weekend.",
      "If the loan deals are completed in time, then Collyer could make his West Brom debut on Saturday when they take on Wrexham away (12.30pm kick-off). Amass, meanwhile, would have a home game as Sheffield Wednesday take on Stoke City at Hillsborough at 3pm.",

      "Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho has now agreed terms with Chelsea, it has been reported.",
      "Garnacho, 21, was subject to a £60million bid from Napoli in January, but United decided to keep hold of him and, instead, allowed Marcus Rashford and Antony to join Jadon Sancho out on loan from Old Trafford.",
      "While the Argentina international impressed in patches, Ruben Amorim left him out of the starting XI for the Europa League final against Tottenham in May, prompting a furious reaction from the player.",
      "He has since informed United of his desire to explore different opportunities this summer. Chelsea have held a long-term interest in Garnacho and the Blues are moving closer to getting their man.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs for GiveMeSport, Chelsea have agreed personal terms with Garnacho. The ex-Atletico Madrid youth product is 'waiting' for a move to Stamford Bridge, as club-to-club talks are advanced.",
      "United want £50m for Garnacho, as they are of the opinion that he should not be sold for much less than the £52m Chelsea got for Noni Madueke, who made the move to Arsenal last month.",
      "However, Chelsea are aware that United need to sell players, especially if they want to pull off a record-breaking deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Garnacho represents pure profit on United's books and Chelsea are hoping to agree a fee south of £40m, having already spent in excess of £240m on no less than ten players, including Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato.",
      "Garnacho scored 11 goals and added 10 assists in 58 matches for the Reds last season and was one of their best players in Europe. Speaking about his future, following a lack of game-time in the Europa League final, Garnacho said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and then see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Meanwhile, United head coach Amorim provided an update on Garnacho's future during the club's pre-season tour in the United States earlier this month. \"I think Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" Amorim said. \"And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "Having landed two major commercial partnerships in the past week, the anticipation is that a third will be on the way imminently for Manchester United. Both Coca-Cola and Sokin have come on board in recent days.",
      "On Wednesday, United announced that global drinks giant Coca-Cola would become the club's official carbonated soft drinks partner in the UK and Europe in a multi-year deal which has been reported to be worth around £1million to United.",
      "Then on Thursday came another announcement from the Old Trafford club that they had secured another multi-year partnership with fintech firm Sokin - who will become the club's official global business payments solutions partner in another boost to United's commercial portfolio.",
      "The decline in competitive success over recent years has been impactful when it comes to United's commercial success. While the club is still seen as a global blue-chip brand where partnerships bring exposure, the rate of growth when it comes to commercial activity has not been at the rate of their 'big six' rivals, with United seeing a 10 per cent growth since 2019 up to 2023/2024.",
      "That compares to Arsenal (97 per cent), Tottenham Hotspur (89 per cent), Liverpool (64 per cent), Manchester City (62 per cent) and Chelsea (25 per cent). Across that period, United have been surpassed by both City and Liverpool when it comes to annual commercial revenue.",
      "They do have some major sponsorship inventory still to sell, with the naming rights to their revamped Carrington training complex that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe toured this week on the block, as well as the training kit provider.",
      "The club's previous deal with blockchain firm Tezos came to an end this summer and, for recently installed chief business officer Marc Armstrong, hired from French club Paris Saint-Germain earlier this year, finding partners for these opportunities was key.",
      "The Tezos deal was worth around £24million per-year to United, while naming rights for the training ground likely to fetch some £20million per season plus, with Arsenal's deal struck with Sobha Realty last year worth £15million a year on a four-year agreement.",
      "Ratcliffe, when speaking at the opening of the revamped training complex this week, said of United as a brand: \"This is one of the most recognised brands in the world. It stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.\"",
      "With that in mind, United will see both pieces of sponsorship inventory as key to them driving revenues forward to enable them to stay within the confines of PSR, and be able to reinvest in the squad at a time when they are facing a period away from the Champions League and its riches for another season.",
      "Not underselling the value of such inventory won't be lost on United's commercial department, and the hiring of Armstrong was designed to ensure that the Old Trafford club had the best operators to navigate the partnerships space at a time where they were struggling competitively, but also still had the leverage of being one of the most globally recognised brands in world sport.",
      "The challenge for Armstrong and his team will be to wrestle back the commercial initiative from neighbours City and Liverpool, but a chunk of that will depend on whether or not head coach Ruben Amorim can deliver success on the pitch.",
      "But commercial revenues should get a healthy bump soon, with both the training ground and training kit likely to see valuable partnerships struck up very soon.",

      "So far, United have added four fresh faces to their first-team for the new campaign. Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko could all make their debut for the Reds this weekend having been signed and registered before the Premier League's registration deadline.",

      "However, because Liverpool and AFC Bournemouth kick off the new Premier League campaign on Friday, their deadline for registering fresh players has already passed for this weekend. Currently, it does not seem like United will be signing any new players before the weekend.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has been touted as a potential new recruit but it seems that United are too far away from the Seagulls' valuation to get that deal completed before the weekend, let alone Friday at noon. The registration window will be back open for United on Monday ahead of their fixture at Fulham.",

      "With Toby Collyer on the brink of leaving, Manchester United's midfield pool is about to become even weaker.",
      "Collyer, 21, is understood to be very close to finalising a move to West Bromwich Albion. It will mark a first loan spell of his senior career, meaning he will have the opportunity to get regular minutes under his belt.",
      "However, his impending exit only strengthens the argument for United to bring in a midfielder before the transfer window closes on September 1.",
      "With Mason Mount preferred as a No.10 in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, United's pool of senior central-midfielders will stand at just four players. That is not enough to get United through an entire season.",
      "Ahead of Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford, Bruno Fernandes is the only midfielder who can be considered a guaranteed starter. Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro are all competing to start alongside him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The fact there is no guarantee who will start next to Fernandes only strengthens the argument for United to bring in a new midfielder. Brighton ace Carlos Baleba is understood to be at the top of United's wish list.",
      "United's midfield has been a long-term problem they have been trying to fix for several years. Casemiro was excellent in his first season at the club in 2022/23, providing the defensive nous and bite they had been sorely lacking, but he was only ever going to provide a short-term solution, and that was demonstrated the following season.",
      "Ugarte, who arrived from Paris Saint-Germain last summer, was supposed to be the Brazilian's successor. However, he has struggled to get into any sort of rhythm and his capabilities in possession are limited.",
      "However, at the age of 24, Ugarte still has time to make a name for himself at United, and it is hoped a first full pre-season at the club will stand him in good stead for the 2025/26 campaign. Casemiro, though, has passed his peak and will turn 34 in February.",
      "With less than a year remaining on his contract, United should have been trying to sell the former Real Madrid man this summer. They need to secure £15m for his signature to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United have been guilty of allowing players to run down their contracts and leave for free far too often in recent years, meaning they should have been striving to avoid a repeat of that scenario this summer.",
      "However, with Collyer heading out on loan and still no sign of a new midfielder being brought in, United are looking increasingly unlikely to sell Casemiro, meaning they are poised to miss out on a cash injection.",
      "United have the chance to extend Casemiro's contract by an additional year, taking him through until 2027, but that feels somewhat unlikely. The chances are he will leave the club next summer on a free transfer.",
      "With no European football on the table this season, Casemiro is unlikely to play as regularly, certainly as a starter, as he might have done with European football part of the schedule.",
      "He reserved his best performances for the Europa League last season, struggling to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League. However, a lack of midfield depth means it is too risky to let him go right now.",

      "With just over two weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, United are still in the market for a midfielder, and Baleba has emerged as a top target.",
      "Since joining Brighton from Lille two years ago, the Cameroonian has gone from strength-to-strength, establishing himself as one of the most highly-rated midfielders in the world. He is capable of doing a little bit of everything in the engine room, meaning he has an attractive profile.",
      "Despite signing Manuel Ugarte in an attempt to fix their long-term midfield woes last summer, United still need fresh blood in that area of the team. Bruno Fernandes is a guaranteed starter ahead of Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal, but there is an ongoing debate about who should start next to him.",
      "Some outlets have suggested Brighton could demand £100million to sell Baleba amid his potential, meaning it feels incredibly unlikely United will be able to fund a deal for him before the end of this window. The Reds have already spent nearly £200m this summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "And in the opinion of former Reds midfield ace Keane, it is too early to be able to tell if Baleba is worthy of such an eye-watering price tag.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"I'd be surprised if it happened. Because I still think that kid, he's got to do a bit more.",
      "\"You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",

      "\"When I leave it's going to be ‘no hard feelings’. You’re not going to have any negative comments from me about Manchester United. That’s me as a person,\" those were the words of Marcus Rashford to journalist Henry Winter back in December after he first admitted his desire to leave the club.",
      "It was a noble stance to take considering he had just been left out, unceremoniously, from the squad that defeated Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. In the weeks that followed, Rashford would only make the bench at United once more for the loss to Newcastle before being shipped out on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "Before that transfer, the situation became even frostier between Rashford and Ruben Amorim. In a press conference after beating Fulham, the Portuguese head coach insisted that he would rather have goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital (now 64), on the bench before a player that did not have the right attitude.",
      "It was later clarified that Amorim was making a general point and not one about a specific player, however the remark was made after a question on Rashford. It was clear then that the dynamic between the winger and United had shifted.",
      "In the West Midlands, Rashford kept a low profile. He was protected from most media obligations and did not pass comment on United. However, that all changed this week when he conducted an interview with The Rest is Football following his loan switch to Barcelona.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He described the club as being 'reactionary' and the club have been in 'no man's land' due to the amount of transition and change since Sir Alex Ferguson left. He could have been more damning on the state that United have been in, but it is nevertheless clear the forward has changed his mind on keeping his true feelings suppressed.",
      "\"Show me a successful team that just adapts,\" Rashford said. \"When Fergie was in charge, not only the principles for the first team – the whole academy set up so you could pick players from 15 years and over – that’s a full generation. And they’d all understand the principles of playing the Man United way, right?",
      "\"You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time – they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been… we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction’s always changing, you can’t expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team – you’re not there by accident.",
      "\"This is what some people forget. So yeah, we’ve been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months – what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we’ve been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet.\"",
      "The timing of this change speaks volumes. Perhaps now he is certain to not have a future at United, Rashford feels more empowered to speak his mind.",
      "He could also feel that Amorim's behaviour towards him following the Winter interview has shifted the goalposts. But, there is more than one side to every argument.",
      "Rashford is not completely faultless for the demise of his United career or, in fact, the club as a whole. He is also not solely responsible for either scenario either.",
      "However, what is clear is that Rashford has taken a shift away from keeping quiet and is voicing his opinion on United - and that suggests the relationship with the club has now undergone a complete, and permanent, U-turn.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window spending has been a lot more lucrative than some expected to be the case back in May.",
      "Despite missing out on Champions League football, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have both been bought for substantial fees, while Matheus Cunha arrived during the previous financial period. Despite spending so big so far, United do not seem to be done yet.",
      "Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba is widely reported to be on the club's radar. It has been claimed this week that United players have spoken to the 21-year-old about the club's structure, while representatives have been speaking regarding the finances involved with the deal.",
      "The Seagulls are keen not to sell Baleba, and are eager to hold out for £100million or more, when they eventually do decide to move him on. There are no guarantees that Brighton will receive that money from United or anyone else, but those are the figures the Old Trafford giants are working with.",
      "After Sesko, the consensus was that United would be looking to make sales, and that remains the case. Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia all either want to leave or are expected to go this season.",
      "In England, the summer transfer window closes on Monday, September 1 which is - perhaps - not a great deal of time to get all these deals done. While there's confidence that Hojlund will move to AC Milan before then and Garnacho shall hope he's at Chelsea by the time the window slams shut, it still leaves lingering concerns about the remaining trio.",
      "However, plans to sell before signing Baleba are perhaps not as urgent as they at first seem. For starters, United have until June 30, 2026 to balance up the books in line with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "This gives them not one, but two windows to get the unwanted players out. Plus, there is not just the next few weeks remaining for United to sell players. The Saudi and Turkish transfer windows close on September 10 and 11 respectively. While United can't sign players from those regions, they can sell to that market.",
      "For the likes of Antony and Sancho - who have been linked with clubs in both countries - those particular leagues could become a lot more tempting after September 1. The fact of the matter is, this is also a World Cup year and if there is a choice between being frozen out at United until January or going somewhere to play football, then most self-respecting players will choose the latter option.",
      "As mentioned, if needed, United could try again to sell players in January or, in a worst-case scenario, they could sell at the end of the Premier League season prior to the start of the 2026 World Cup and June 30 deadline. At this stage, there won't be much panic from United in terms of their unwanted players remaining on the books prior to striking a Baleba deal, but an eye shall firmly be on the deadline next year to get their accounts in order.",

      "Manchester United are set to play Grimsby in the second round of this season's the Carabao Cup following the draw on Wednesday night.",
      "The last time they featured in round two of the competition was during the 2014/15 season, after finishing seventh in the league the previous campaign and missing out on European qualification. On that occasion, United faced MK Dons away, and were comfortably beaten 4-0 on the night.",
      "The competition was known as the Capital One Cup at the time and the result marked a dismal start to life under Louis van Gaal, who had been appointed earlier that summer to replace David Moyes. United were beginning what would prove to be a difficult period for the club as they tried to fill the void left by Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.",
      "This time, Ruben Amorim is overseeing things and he will be expecting a sharp increase in fortunes from last season's disappointing 15th place finish in the Premier League. The club were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the quarter-finals, falling to a 4-3 defeat to their eventual Europa League final conquerers Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United are entering the competition at this early stage due to their poor Premier League campaign, with only Wolves and Tottenham separating them from the relegation places.",
      "It means Amorim faces a huge task to change the club's fortunes, and he will be hoping to avoid a similar embarrassment to the one Van Gaal endured 11 years ago.",
      "Since their last appearance in the second round of the Carabao Cup, United have lifted the trophy twice. First in 2017 under Jose Mourinho, beating Southampton 3-2, and again in 2023 during Erik ten Hag’s first season in charge, with a 2-0 win over Newcastle United at Wembley Stadium.",

      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, plenty more transfer activity is expected at Manchester United.",
      "They still need to try and offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Antony, a handful of youngsters in need of loan moves and bring in a midfielder. The prospect of a goalkeeper also being drafted in is still possible.",
      "After experiencing their worst season in 51 years last term, United have had little choice but to splash the cash this summer. They have rightfully prioritised attacking signings, bringing in three new faces in the hope of increasing their attacking output.",
      "After signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves and bringing in Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford prior to the season tour of the United States, United completed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last weekend, bringing an end to their search for a striker.",
      "After recording a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League last season, United had to make the addition of a proven goalscorer their priority this summer. Sesko has arrived on the back of a 21-goal season for Leipzig last term.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "As a result of Sesko's arrival at Old Trafford, Rasmus Hojlund is looking increasingly likely to depart ahead of the window closing on September 1. It is understood he is open to joining AC Milan, who are in the process of rebuilding their squad under head coach Massimiliano Allegri.",
      "Hojlund started just two of United's five pre-season friendlies and watched attacking-midfielders Cunha and Mason Mount lead the line in his absence against Everton and Fiorentina. That was almost certainly Ruben Amorim's way of telling him he doesn't feature in his plans.",
      "Amid the increasing likelihood of Hojlund departing, United have been credited with interest in former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who is still a free agent after leaving the Toffees at the end of last season. It was reported by talkSPORT on Monday that United are one of three Premier League clubs he has 'held talks' with him.",
      "Reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford have baffled former United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "\"Calvert-Lewin can't stay fit,\" said the former United centre-back on his YouTube channel. \"No. Why would we bring him in to this club?",
      "\"This club is built on the academy and we've got Chido Obi sitting there. Play him if you just need someone for a few games rather than someone who's older and can't stay fit.\"",
      "Not only is Ferdinand right that United should steer clear of Calvert-Lewin, who scored just three Premier League goals last season, but he is also right that the club should prioritise the development of Chido Obi.",
      "Of course, the Danish youth international is only 17 and is still learning his trade, but he has an enormous amount of potential United should be trying to unleash instead of signing a 28-year-old that has scored just 17 Premier League goals in the last four seasons.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has only made it into double figures twice in the Premier League in his career, last doing so in 2020/21, scoring 16 goals under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "Sesko will be their main man at the tip United's attack this season and Obi will be hungry to be the support act, providing competition and help from the bench. He made eight appearances last season and will only get better the more game time he earns.",
      "United's history is built on promoting from within and their academy has been a consistent beacon of light throughout the recent struggles at first-team level. Obi has demonstrated he is an instinctive striker, possessing traits that cannot always be taught on the training ground.",
      "United supporters love nothing more than seeing an academy graduate make their mark in the first-team and there is every chance Obi will be able to do that in good time.",
      "Additionally, with no European football to come this season, United do not have as many fixtures to look forward to, meaning rotation will not be as heavy as in previous seasons. That could allow Obi to be eased in slower, helping him and United in the process.",
      "Obi is a much more appealing option than Calvert-Lewin as a secondary striker right now.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "20) 🆕 Dani Olmo – Barcelona to Tottenham Hotspur\nReports in Spain suggest Barca are ready to sell Dani Olmo to create some much-needed headroom on their wage bill. Olmo was only able to be registered last season due to loopholes and appeals, and Barca’s problems persist – Marcus Rashford remains unregistered ahead of their La Liga opener at the weekend. So Barca would sell, of course. Are Spurs actually interested? We’re far less certain of that.",

But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. It comes down to this: Brighton value Baleba at £100million. Man Utd do not. Are Brighton likely to come down? No. No they are not.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick are wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Around £67million might persuade Pep to part with the Brazilian. But 67million is a much bigger number than 42 million. Maths, that.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed.",

And their dithering could leave the door open for…",

      "13) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",

We doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step but it seems this one is moving forward. Which would improve Yoane Wissa’s mood. Andoni Iraola was unsure whether Ouattara would be involved in their Premier League opener against Liverpool.",
      "",
      "11) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",

      "10) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have made a breakthrough with one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "9) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs are close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "8) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Christopher Nkunku in as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "7) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Roma\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days and Besiktas have emerged as a possible destination for Sancho, but a move to Roma is now looking likely. The Italians have reportedly bid £20m for the 25-year-old.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",

      "5) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",

      "4) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo and Omari Hutchinson – Rennes and Ipswich to Nottingham Forest\nForest are moving mad now that their Europa League spot is confirmed. £26m for Kalimuendo is good business. £37.5m for Hutchinson is…interesting business.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nIt looks like Forest will win the race for McAtee, who has attracted interest from Germany. Reports suggest he’ll cost north of £20m having agreed personal terms with the City Ground club.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. Reports say a deal worth £39million plus another £4million in add-ons has been agreed and Ramsey is heading for a medical on Thursday evening.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Giovanni Leoni – Parma to Liverpool\nLiverpool want Leoni in addition to Guehi and it seems they have got him. Apparently, a deal has been agreed worth £26million plus add-ons. So the 18-year-old has flown in and should be a Liverpool player by the weekend."

No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",

We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might if a new-look City make a stumbling start and he decides to sod it all for a game of soldiers.",

      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "13=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "13=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "9) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nAnother really interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four points adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we’ve said elsewhere, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "5) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "2=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "1) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season has been encouraging, at least, and an opening run of games against Forest, Villa and Sunderland offers a realistic shot at an acceptable start given those clubs all have issues of their own, but things look (potentially) far choppier between the September and October international breaks with games against Chelsea, Fulham and both Manchester clubs.",
      "",
      "",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",

      "Trying to recall what happened between them last season is difficult but Pizzagate, Ruud van Nistelrooy versus Martin Keown, Roy Keane protecting Gary Neville from Patrick Vieira in the tunnel and Alex Ferguson pronouncing ‘Japan’ weirdly are all firmly embedded in the psyche and form a routine part of the pre-game build-up when the Gunners face the Red Devils.",
      "As a spectacle, the only hope of salvaging something meaningful from Arsenal v Manchester United is to feed into the contemporary phenomenon of manufacturing rivalries between players. And Viktor Gyokeres versus Benjamin Sesko has been ripening all summer long for that particular picking.",
      "The dream scenario of Gyokeres flopping for Arsenal while Sesko single-footedly drags Manchester United towards competence remains live, but really the alternative timeline in which Gyokeres delivers the title and Sesko proves to be a hilariously expensive gamble gone wrong is every bit as fun and enticing.",
      "It certainly feels a more even battle than the Erling Haaland v Darwin Nunez feud built entirely out of laborious comparisons between two pricey centre-forwards who happened to be signed at the same time by clubs with substantial fanbases.",

      "A wise sage once referred to their rivalry as ‘toxic’ because of 1) some results, 2) Newcastle once poaching an analyst from Liverpool, 3) Liverpool being one of many clubs to oppose their takeover, and 4) Liverpool having spent some money more than four decades ago, but this summer did mark a definitive turn in their relationship.",
      "The Ekitike hijack could be forgiven by a club who have known nothing different in this transfer window. A target choosing to join someone else is part and parcel of the game, and losing a race to the Premier League champions who will be among the Champions League favourites can be brushed off quickly.",
      "But the Isak saga has cast an uncomfortable cloud over Newcastle’s summer and left a sour taste. Even when handed all the cards of a three-year contract with no release clause and no need to make a book-balancing sale, the Magpies have looked thoroughly unconvincing with their hard-line stance.",
      "They did land one shot with the loaded claim that Liverpool had ‘bottled’ their first and as yet only actual bid for Isak but there is a clear sense that even if he stays, the damage has been done.",

      "The striker already had a fractious relationship with Dave Bassett after the Forest boss promised him an exit after securing promotion, but told Newcastle to pay £10m after a £7m bid. “£10m in 1997 was ridiculous,” Van Hooijdonk said. “That’s like trying to sell a cappuccino for £25.” It would be close to £200m in today’s money.",

      "Gabriel Magalhaes (Arsenal)\nThe last of Arsenal’s three world-class players — though others are close. William Saliba is very, very near that level. Martin Zubimendi could get there if he adapts quickly to English football. Martin Odegaard disappointed last season, and Viktor Gyokeres needs to prove himself in the Premier League, even if he did score 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP.",

      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",

Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",

      "11) Everton\nVery hard to rank until we actually get to see it for real. Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",

      "10) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "9) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",

      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "7) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

      "6) Sunderland\nThe last of the 20 teams to confirm their place in the top flight were also the second last to confirm their kit, and that was only due to contractual wrangles meaning Liverpool had no choice but to wait for August. But better to wait for a nice one than confirm a sh*t one, as we always say.",
      "Inevitably, the combination of red-and-white stripes plus hummel leads us down a vaguely Southampton route here, but while ‘is it obviously a Team X kit’ is one of our core criteria we are going to cut some slack here because we simply don’t think there’s any way around that particular puzzle without abandoning hummel altogether, and we’re very much in baby-with-the-bathwater territory there.",
      "Lovely simple kit, this, so much so that we don’t even mind the centred badge because everything is at least balanced. Collar is 10/10, the chevrons look as magnificent as ever, and quite simply hummel have done it again, as they nearly always do. Great bunch of lads.",

      "The striped collars and cuffs are first-rate, and the flashes of blue under the arms are just enough to avoid this falling into the Burnley trap.",
      "Also, while we generally restrict our rankings here to the tops, given the amount of switching and alternate use that goes on with shorts and socks anyway, it is worth noting that West Ham have this year’s best socks, with the stripes of the collar and cuffs deployed simply but expertly.",
      "",
      "3) Wolves\nYes, we like this. That’s a pleasingly modern take on a proper old-fashioned collar, and the whole retro vibe is enhanced by a material that almost looks knitted.",
      "Again, we could be wrong because we’re only at this stage going off pictures rather than real-world information, but it does look like the lads at Sudu have got the colour right this time. Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",

      "This shirt certainly has that, and perhaps our favourite collar of the entire season’s efforts. In a world of plain round collars, United have a double-element v-neck that – and we have no idea whether this is intentional or not but to our mind it’s a bonus – brings to mind the devil’s trident from their badge.",
      "Having praised the black, though, we’re not quite sure at first glance about what seem some very shiny black adidas stripes on the shoulders and sleeves. They’re slightly off-putting – notably on the long-sleeve version.",
      "There’s also a print woven into the sleeves rather than body of the shirt, which is an unusual choice but one that works here. The last United home shirt we can recall with sleeves that differed from the main body of the shirt was 1998/99, and that seemed to work out well for everybody.",
      "The design on the sleeves is, of course, a nod to their stadium because that seems to be what everyone is doing this season. Presumably that means after one wash it will have all holes in it.",

      "There’s only one Liverpool new boy in our top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United all have two…",
      "",
      "10) Granit Xhaka (Sunderland)\nThis shouldn’t be a thing, but it is. Sunderland, fresh off promotion, have convinced Granit Xhaka to swap Champions League football with Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap. And we love it.",
      "For just £13million, they’ve signed a player far too good for the bottom half. Sure, he’s had his critics – many of them loud and correct – but the Swiss international has matured and now walks into this team as captain-in-waiting. Sunderland have watched Burnley, Ipswich and others make transfer mistakes and get relegated. Some of their business points to the same mistakes being made, but landing Xhaka is doing things differently.",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nThis one shot up the rankings after Pedro tore it up in the Club World Cup. He wouldn’t have made the cut otherwise, but those performances were outrageous. The brace against his boyhood club Fluminense left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed out £55m, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "A few Chelsea signings deserve an honourable mention. Jorrel Hato, Estevao and Kendry Paez are three outstaning talents.",
      "",
      "8) Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford)\nAnother intra-Premier League move, Kelleher has finally left Liverpool to spread his wings as a top-flight No.1. As his ranking shows, this looks like an outstanding pick-up for Brentford, who replaced Mark Flekken superbly and sorted the goalkeeper spot early this summer.",
      "Kelleher had to leave, especially with Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving, and considering how brilliant Liverpool are at flogging fringe players, we’re honestly stunned his initial fee is only £12.5million. It could rise to £18m, which is still a steal.",
      "Selling him for half what Jarell Quansah cost Bayer Leverkusen probably sums up Liverpool’s weak stance in transfer talks. Kelleher wanted out, keeping him made little sense, and they weren’t d*cks about it. Brentford will be bloody chuffed.",
      "",
      "7) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nFinally. Arsenal have signed a striker who isn’t terrified of the 18-yard box. Viktor Gyokeres has been smashing in goals for fun over the last three seasons – 22 in 50 for Coventry, 43 in 49 for Sporting, and then an obscene 54 in 52 last term.",
      "Yes, it’s ‘only the Portuguese league’ and no, he’s not the next Bas Dost. We’re not expecting Erling Haaland numbers from Gyokeres, but we’re still backing him to be a success at the Emirates.",
      "MORE: Gyokeres to Arsenal: Bruno Fernandes second as Liga Portugal to Premier League signings ranked",
      "",
      "6) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",

      "",
      "5) Martin Zubimendi (Arsenal)\nZubimendi has looked very promising in pre-season, with Mikel Arteta delighted to build his team around the Spanish defensive midfielder as his anchor. He should help Martin Odegaard get back to his best and now Declan Rice can relax, knowing that his full-time position is further up the pitch, providing support for Gabriel Martinelli on the left.",
      "The ex-Real Sociedad star looks like the calming presence every top team needs in the middle of the park. He might not reach Rodri’s level, but he can reach Rodri levels of influence on this Gunners side.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United)\nThere’s one glaring issue with this transfer: This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. They have a habit of botching signings, no matter how brilliant the player was before taking the graveyard shift at Old Trafford.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Ruben Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal for United.",
      "",
      "3) Matheus Cunha (Manchester United)\nAnother great player that Manchester United might destroy. Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season and now finds himself slotted perfectly into Amorim’s system as a left-sided ‘wide 10’.",
      "He and Mbeumo offer something United have been lacking: actual output. Now they just need an elite centre-forward. If they get that piece, top-half football might actually be on the cards. High hopes, we know.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling. He’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, it’s Man United.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nNico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. Because that’s what really matters – not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone who’s world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summer…so far.",

      "",
      "10) Dominic Solanke (Tottenham)\nThe odds are long at 33/1 – he only scored nine Premier League goals last season – but he is still ahead of Omar Marmoush and Liam Delap among others. Perhaps the theory is that if Thomas Frank can coach a 20-goal campaign out of Bryan Mbeumo, he might just work wonders for Solanke. One thing we do know: The Golden Boot would get him on the plane to the World Cup.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nManchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million; it feels like they may have made a familiar mistake just because he is the wrong side of 28. But he scored 16 Premier League goals last season and remains Villa’s first-choice striker (we presume), and he will be supremely motivated ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United)\nSesko was the man left standing in the Manchester United striker position when the music stopped, but he scored only 13 Bundesliga goals in 24/25 so it feels like a massive ask for him to come to the Premier League and win the Golden Boot with a club that struggled with chance creation (and everything else) last season.",
      "",
      "6=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nThe odds have come in from 25/1 to 20/1 for the most expensive striker signing of the summer, but he did massively underscore according to his xG last season for Eintracht Frankfurt. Perhaps there is value to be found in backing Ekitike here; he did score in the Community Shield, after all.",
      "",
      "6=) Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nThe stand-out player as Chelsea won the Club World Cup but it’s tricky to envision a 15-goal Premier League season becoming the 25 goals – at least – necessary to win the Golden Boot. Mind you, we do think Chelsea might win the Premier League title after that summer.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nLooked excellent for Chelsea at the Club World Cup and in pre-season, with the Brazilian seemingly ready to lead the line ahead of Delap. The Brazilian has never scored more than 10 Premier League goals before, but he has never played in the Premier League with Cole Palmer, Estevao, Jamie Gittens and Pedro Neto before.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United, for now)\nNow we hit the big boys. Isak is a 7/1 shot to win the Golden Boot despite the fact that he might not kick a ball in the Premier League until after the transfer window has closed. Will he eventually play for Newcastle United, Liverpool or (don’t laugh) Tottenham?",
      "",
      "2=) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe Golden Boot holder broke several records on the final day of last season, but the Egyptian is now 33, it’s an Africa Cup of Nations season, and he’s no longer playing for a new contract.",
      "",
      "2=) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nThe top scorer in 2024 is only being beaten in 2025 by Kylian Mbappe, but he is untested at this kind of level. The final piece of the Arsenal jigsaw? If that’s true, the Golden Boot trophy will surely come with a Premier League title win.",

      "Now Raiola and Donnarumma are left to gauge the level of genuine interest in signing one of the world’s top goalkeepers.",
      "Reports suggest Manchester City are keenest of the clubs who could afford the salary Donnarumma, currently on £210,000 a week at PSG, would demand on top of a transfer fee in the region of £25million.",
      "For City, though, such opportunism is unnecessary. For a few good reasons.",
      "First, they have already signed a goalkeeper this summer. City took their chance to match Newcastle’s offer to Burnley for James Trafford and the England stopper was delighted to return to the club he left in 2023.",
      "Now, Newcastle have been swerved by many players this summer and the allure of going back to his roots was strong. But ahead of a World Cup he intends to be a part of, would Trafford have returned just to sit on the bench when the No.1 shirt at Newcastle could have been his?",
      "Trafford, almost certainly, will have been given the nod to say that he will be City’s first choice. If not immediately then soon enough. A lot sooner than he might hope if Donnarumma follows him though the Etihad door.",
      "Did City need a new keeper at all? Ederson might not be the perfect goalkeeper – there isn’t one – but he has been perfect for City and the way Pep Guardiola insists upon dominating opponents.",
      "After eight years between Pep’s posts, around his 32nd birthday on Sunday, there are sensible sketches of a succession plan for Ederson. It is thought that any advances from Galatasaray might be welcomed and whether it is this summer or next, there is no doubt change is coming.",
      "The prospect of Donnarumma taking City’s gloves is bound to intrigue. But it would be a change too far.",
      "Ederson and Donnarumma have featured on every list of the world’s best goalkeepers for last five years but that is one of the few things they might have in common. As keepers, they are very different.",
      "Guardiola employs Ederson as a first line of attack more than a last line of defence. Which is fine when City have been as dominant as they have been since the Brazilian was brought from Benfica. The quality of his passing – the choice, variety and range – is just as important to Guardiola, perhaps more so, as the trustworthiness of his hands.",
      "You could argue that very few keepers have the talent in their feet that Ederson possesses. But Donnarumma isn’t close enough to make a swap viable.",
      "Donnarumma’s qualities lie in the more traditional aspects of goalkeeping. There are few better shot-stoppers in the world, because of the Italian’s size, speed, positional nous, and reactions. If you are looking for a keeper to guard your goal, Donnarumma is your man. If you’re minded to pick one to ping passes in possession, he is not. Which is a large part of why Luis Enrique ditched him.",
      "For Guardiola, open-minded though he is, that is a non-negotiable. One of his first acts as City boss was to bin Joe Hart and sign Claudio Bravo. A fantastic goalminder replaced by a playmaker in mitts. It set the tone for the next nine years under the Catalan.",
      "The traits he looks for in a goalkeeper are a non-negotiable. And Donnarumma simply doesn’t possess the right mix. Trafford is a better fit.",
      "🚨 MORE ON THE SUMMER TRANSFER FROM F365\n👉 Wirtz, Gyokeres, Mbeumo: Top 10 Premier League signings of the summer\n👉 Isak goes Full Kane in Liverpool transfer saga, and you never go Full Kane\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025",
      "There is a club across Manchester, though, who would benefit from a goalkeeper of Donnarumma’s type…",
      "United certainly need a new No.1. They appear tempted to kid themselves and persist with Andre Onana in their net while they throw resources at other priorities. Sure, their impotent forward line and the gaping hole in their midfield do command more urgency during this summer reset. But no one could watch United shamble through last season and pretend Onana is the reliable presence Ruben Amorim needs in his goal.",
      "From the half-hearted interest they showed in Emiliano Martinez, it would appear that United acknowledge the problem. And Donnarumma offers a golden opportunity to fix it.",
      "Of course Amorim wants a No.1 who can play with the ball at his feet but his goalkeeping priorities are weighted differently to Guardiola. If they are not, they really should be.",
      "More than anything, Amorim wants a reliable last line, one who relishes the responsibility of digging United out of the holes they dig for themselves. Not a keeper like Onana who has spent his two seasons at Old Trafford reaching for shovels.",
      "Onana was signed in part to improve United in possession. Maybe he is the Cameroonian Cruyff but he’s too busy fighting fires – and lighting his own – to pull strings.",
      "Which highlights that, in their sticks, United need a top-class goalkeeper above all else. In Donnarumma, they have an opportunity to sign one.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma’s agent has accused PSG of ‘zero respect’ and said his client will likely move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has reportedly agreed to join Manchester City after an ‘exchange’ with Pep Guardiola.",

      "Chelsea have arranged three future transfers worth £56.9m for three teenagers because they really cannot help themselves at this stage.",
      "The 2025 summer transfer window is fun and all, but teams are using the opportunity to pre-arrange transfers years in advance now to steal a march on their rivals.",
      "Chelsea are chief among them but plenty of other sides are indulging in the practice. These are the upcoming transfers sorted for future windows involving Premier League clubs.",
      "",
      "Vakhtang Salia (Dinamo Tbilisi to Newcastle, undisclosed, August 2025)\n“We’re delighted to get ahead of a number of other top clubs to sign Vakhtang,” said Newcastle sporting director Paul Mitchell. “Scouting and recruiting emerging talent is an essential part of building a sustainable future, particularly within the current PSR framework, so the market is fiercely competitive.”",
      "Salia will join upon his 18th birthday in August, before which the Magpies will be thoroughly exploring possible loan avenues for a player who has scored seven goals in 39 first-team games.",
      "They will otherwise try and fail to sign a load of expensive Premier League players.",
      "",
      "Mason Melia (St Patrick’s Athletic to Tottenham, £1.6m rising to £3.2m, January 2026)\nTottenham really are going to have some team a few managers from now. Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall are basically grey-haired, grizzled veterans at this stage after pulling through an injury crisis for Ange Postecoglou, and they will soon be showing the likes of Vuskovic and Melia the ropes.",
      "They will have to wait slightly longer in the case of Melia, whose move as the League of Ireland’s record sale cannot be officially ratified until he turns 18 because Brexit.",
      "The forward had a trial with Manchester City and counted Arsenal among his numerous suitors, having made his debut – and scored – at just 15. Frankfurt actually tried to bring him in as Omar Marmoush’s replacement in January.",
      "",
      "Geovany Quenda (Sporting to Chelsea, £42.1m, June 2026)\nManchester United were not thrilled to see an obvious target move elsewhere, Ruben Amorim and one of his roaming Sporting wing-backs having been linked for months with a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",
      "",
      "Denner Evangelista (Corinthians to Chelsea, £11.5m, June 2026)\nThe cousin of Arsenal centre-half Gabriel, attacking left-back Denner will join him in London some time after his 18th birthday next February.",
      "Chelsea swooped in despite the Brazil youth international star having not yet made his senior debut for Corinthians.",
      "Of course there is a seven-year contract, add-ons and a sell-on clause.",
      "",
      "Modou Keba Cisse (LASK to Aston Villa, £4.3m, July 2026)\nThe latest in a lengthening line of young defenders signed from across Europe, teenage centre-half Cisse will spend one more season in Austria before joining up with Villa ahead of next season.",
      "“This marks a major step in my career, but I know the real work starts now,” Cisse said. “The Premier League is a dream – not every player gets this opportunity.”",
      "Playing alongside John McGinn remains a tantalising prospect for most professionals.",
      "",
      "Dastan Satpaev (Kairat Almaty to Chelsea, £3.3m, August 2026)\nIt is a record sale for the Kazakh Premier League and a relatively modest five-year deal with a 12-month option at the end. But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",

      "A Liverpool pair signed for £169m have been replaced for £49m, while a record Wolves flop could take the place of the new Manchester United saviour.",
      "It has been a busy summer transfer window featuring some remarkably expensive signings who have been excitedly crowbarred into prospective line-ups ahead of the new season.",
      "But far more interesting is how those players are going to be replaced by selling clubs with lucrative holes burning in their pocket.",
      "While the transfer plans of Premier League teams are intimately known and reported on, less publicised is how foreign sides respond to the loss of a player.",
      "These are the six biggest sales made by clubs outside the Premier League this summer – not including Victor Osimhen as Napoli had already moved on with Scott McTominay – and who has been or is expected to be signed to replace them.",
      "",
      "The Florian Wirtz replacement – Malik Tillman\nBayer Leverkusen have fulfilled their obligations as the sanctioners of a nine-figure sale, reinvesting the Wirtz money through the rest of their squad on expensive defenders, lavish forwards, a Brentford keeper and, most delightfully of all, a Senegalese defender named Abdoulaye Faye.",
      "But the fairly substantial hole left by a chief creator with 34 goals and 35 assists in the last two seasons could not be left vacated.",
      "Tillman is a slightly different sort of player, not to mention a little older and less experienced. But at £30m he will be expected to carry much of the attacking burden for Erik ten Hag, even if the new manager has described replacing their crown jewel as “almost impossible”.",
      "",
      "The Hugo Ekitike replacement – Jonathan Burkardt\nSigned around three weeks before Ekitike was sold, there must nevertheless have been a sense that Burkardt could ultimately be part of a wholesale redesign of the attack rather than a complement to Frankfurt’s breakout star.",
      "The loss of Omar Marmoush in January had already put a new forward towards the top of Frankfurt’s transfer needs ahead of a campaign in the Champions League; another expensive Premier League sale in Ekitike meant almost the entire window has been spent building their frontline back up from the ground.",
      "Burkardt is more of a natural finisher than Ekitike and indeed Marmoush, but Ritsu Doan of Freiburg can help sort the creative side. Both cost around €22m each and will be sold within 18 months for three times that.",
      "",
      "The Benjamin Sesko replacement – Fabio Silva or Romulo\nThe career of Fabio Silva remains a wonderful mystery.",
      "Since becoming their record signing in 2020 on the back of 21 first-team career games, the Portuguese has scored more goals for three of the four clubs he has joined on loan than he has for Wolves. And the five he plundered for the exception to that rule, PSV, match his total Molineux haul.",
      "Yet with a year remaining on his contract and his last appearance for the club having come in November 2023, Wolves still want around £22m for the 23-year-old and will very likely get it.",
      "Borussia Dortmund have been sniffing around but Leipzig have reportedly agreed personal terms.",
      "Yet transfer fetishist Fabrizio Romano has thrown a curveball with the revelation that a £21.6m deal has been agreed with Goztepe for 23-year-old forward Romulo, ‘the Sesko replacement they always wanted’.",
      "",
      "The Martin Zubimendi replacement – Ezequiel Fernandez or Jon Gorrotxategi\nThere has been talk of academy product Gorrotxategi stepping into Zubimendi’s shoes after an impressive loan with Mirandes, but Real Sociedad seem far more likely to go down a more proven route.",
      "The most concrete link involved Al Qadsiah midfielder Fernandez but that trail has gone cold since a €20m bid was knocked back by the Saudis in July.",
      "La Real have curiously spent basically nothing of the £60m or so they received for Zubimendi, adding £3.5m Wolves forward Goncalo Guedes and sending a small loan fee Lyon’s way for Duje Caleta-Car.",
      "They could even land a considerable windfall soon based on whether Alexander Isak can extricate himself from his Newcastle hostage situation. Real Sociedad hold a 10% sell-on clause on the Swede they kindly housed for a while this summer.",
      "",
      "The Mateo Retegui replacement – Rodrigo Muniz\nThe Saudi transfer revolution has undeniably slowed but the eight-point gap champions Al-Ittihad enjoyed at the end of last season has prompted the four sides immediately below them into action.",
      "Al-Hilal have brought in Darwin Nunez and Theo Hernandez at great expense. Al-Ahli staged a lovely hijack of Atletico Madrid to sign Enzo Millot. Al-Nassr generously rescued Chelsea from themselves over Joao Felix.",
      "And Al-Qadsiah decided to swap Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for Serie A top scorer Retegui on six times the wage he was earning with Atalanta.",
      "In response, the Italians have identified Muniz as their priority signing and have not struggled to persuade a player who has spent the majority of his Fulham career on the bench that some time playing Champions League football in Bergamo might be preferable.",
      "They face a slight obstacle in convincing Fulham to sell an excellent back-up striker in a summer the Cottagers have spent standing still while those around them jostle for position. A €40m bid has been rejected but €50m should do it.",

      "But for a forward who turns 28 before the turn of the year, who has spent the majority of his senior career playing in the second tiers of Spain and Colombia after spending three years on the books at Watford, it absolutely does represent the summit for Suarez.",

      "Thursday 14 August 2025 13:44, UK",
      "Are Liverpool destined to retain the title? Could Manchester United really finish in the bottom half of the table again?",
      "Liverpool are out to retain their crown. The champions are the Premier League's biggest spenders in this summer's transfer window as they look to build on the success of last season under Arne Slot.",
      "But will they see off the competition? Runners-up Arsenal have also strengthened. Manchester City have undergone a rebuild. Could Club World Cup winners Chelsea roar into contention?",
      "Opta predict Liverpool will retain the Premier League title following last season's success under Arne Slot, with Arsenal coming second again, albeit by a much narrower margin than last term.",
      "Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa are third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, meaning Opta's predicted top six mirrors the final top six last season.",
      "Opta's supercomputer is far from convinced when it comes to Manchester United and Spurs. They are predicted to come 12th and 14th respectively, only three places higher than last term.",
      "FA Cup and Community Shield winners Crystal Palace are predicted to clinch a seventh-placed finish, with Brighton, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest complete the top 10.",
      "At the other end of the table, Opta expect the promoted teams to go straight back down for the third season running, with Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland finishing 18th, 19th and 20th respectively, a long way off 17th-placed Wolves for expected points.",
      "Spurs, now under the management of Thomas Frank, and beaten on penalties by Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final, are predicted to come eighth.",
      "Liverpool, again, come out on top over Arsenal as champions, with Manchester City in third. But, as in Opta's table, the top two are only separated by a slender expected points margin.",
      "A key difference at the bottom of the table is that newly-promoted Leeds are predicted to survive at the expense of Wolves.",
      "The two tables feature key similarities, most notably in the make-up of their predicted top fours. But there are huge differences too.",
      "Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton are also given considerably lower predicted finishes, contrary to Opta's optimism.",
      "So why the differences? Both supercomputers are based on averages from 10,000 simulations, using bookmaker odds, historical and recent team performances, and transfer spending.",
      "But the intricacies of the algorithms are different, placing weight on varying factors, which helps to explain some of the disparities seen between the two predicted tables.",
      "The summer transfer window is of course a key factor in predicting how teams will fare. A high spend does not guarantee success. Far from it. But it can be vital to a team's capacity to improve.",
      "Their total spend is already close to £300m following the arrival of Florian Wirtz for a record fee along with the signings of Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "They are not the only ones to have strengthened at considerable expense. The so-called Big Six have spent over £1bn between them this summer. And in fact, Liverpool's net spend is much lower than most of their rivals thanks to some big sales, including those of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester City have work to do to shift their unwanted players but their high net spends help to explain why they are predicted to push Liverpool closer this term.",
      "Manchester United have overhauled their attack, making a trio of high-profile additions in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. So why the 12th-placed prediction from Opta?",
      "They are of course coming from a far lower starting point than Liverpool, having finished 15th last term, but it might also have something to do with how they have so far allocated their funds.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have plenty to offer offensively to a side that finished last season as the Premier League's biggest underperformers relative to their expected goals. The lack of firepower and cutting edge needed to be addressed.",
      "But have they overlooked other areas of their squad? Manchester United have invested nearly twice as much in forwards as any other club have invested in any position this summer, but there has been no turnover in goal or in midfield, and only £7m spent on defenders.",
      "This looks problematic given their issues last season were not limited to their attack. Ruben Amorim's side were far from solid in midfield or defence. Only nine Premier League sides conceded more goals. Only eight allowed more expected goals against.",
      "And yet, despite those issues, Manchester United look set to start the new Premier League season with roughly the same personnel as last season in goal, in defence and in midfield.",
      "Both predicted tables have Enzo Maresca's side in fourth place, and with near-identical points totals too, ensuring Champions League qualification for a second successive season, but falling a long way short of a push for Premier League glory.",
      "Chelsea, like their Big Six rivals, have invested heavily in new recruits this summer. There is excitement around Estevao, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in particular. They also start the campaign with a relatively favourable run of fixtures.",
      "But they haven't finished higher than third since their last title triumph in 2016/17. Could a tough run-in, when they face all of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Tottenham in the final 11 fixtures, and the exertions of an epic 2024/25 campaign, also bite them?",
      "Spurs finished last season on a Europa League-winning high but a 17th-placed Premier League finish did for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Frank has arrived from Brentford as his successor and the club have so far added six new players, including Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, both of whom impressed in their UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Daniel Farke's side, who pipped Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference last season, are predicted to finish 17th, fractionally ahead of Wolves, who have lost key players this summer in Cunha to Manchester United and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester City.",
      "The West Midlands club have so far spent modestly this summer, their outlay totalling just £48.4m, which ensures a healthy profit from the £103.7m received in sales, but raises questions about the quality and depth available to head coach Vitor Pereira.",
      "We asked our journalists to come up with their predicted tables too.",
      "As an average, Liverpool came out as champions, with Manchester United and Spurs in sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley are tipped for the drop.",

      "Marcus Rashford has described Manchester United as \"reactionary\" and being in \"no man's land\" - and has called on his club to \"make a plan and stick to it.\"",
      "Rashford departed United to join Barcelona on loan for the upcoming season after a similar, successful spell at Aston Villa for the second half of last season. This was after the forward had been frozen out of United's first-team by Ruben Amorim.",
      "And now, Rashford has hit out at the club's strategy in recent years - saying the club have not begun a transition yet because they do not have a recognisable style of play throughout the club.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been: we're hungry to win, so we'll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it's reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction's always changing, you can't expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it's because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team - you're not there by accident.",
      "\"We've been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over the last six months - what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we've been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it's like the actual transition's not started yet.",
      "\"To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. So this is the thing that I feel - it's not easy. Because if it's not going well, the fans demand [change].",
      "\"But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we've had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win … you end up in the middle of - you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed which managers have been the most influential in his career - citing Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as inspirations - but he left out Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "The forward also went into detail about Mourinho's desire to win at United - irrespective of how well you played.",
      "\"They're different but because we've had so many different managers, it's impossible for me to compare [them],\" added Rashford.",
      "\"Up until Jose, I never had a manager who was so fixated on winning. Van Gaal was fixated on winning but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose didn't care.",
      "\"Of course, if he could choose, he would want you to play well, but if you win, you win and move onto the next game. He had this attitude.",
      "\"And it was confusing for me as all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style and winning in a certain way.",
      "\"And in the beginning I was angry all the time - because we had not played well and we won. But because we won and he is a manager who is just a winner, he didn't bring up the points that you know were missing from that last game. Because we've won.",
      "\"But when we lost, he would bring up the points then. After six months, I learned to respect it and reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed the importance of the move to Barcelona on his chances of making England's World Cup squad next summer.",
      "The 27-year-old was named in new head coach Thomas Tuchel's first Three Lions squad back in March - but missed the June camp due to injury.",
      "\"I try not to put too much pressure on the England set-up,\" said the Barcelona forward. \"It's clearly something I want to do.",
      "\"But you don't get that without putting in the hard work just day in, day out. And showing the hard work on the pitch. That's a knock-on effect to the stuff I'll be doing day in, day out.",
      "\"This current group of English players is extremely talented, it's going to be disappointing if we don't manage to go on and do something really special because I think we've come on a lot. For the last few years, it's been: the next step is to go on and win.\"",
      "Rashford also paid tribute to his former club Villa - saying the brief spell at Unai Emery's side went \"exactly how it was supposed to be\" after struggling at United.",
      "\"The timing of me going to Villa, now looking back, it was the exact time for me to do something like that,\" he said. \"The response and reaction of what I got from the people at the club and the fans, it was what I needed in that moment.",
      "\"Six months on, I feel like everything is completely different. Everything I did at Villa, apart from the injury at the end, was exactly how it was supposed to be. The club's on the up so the atmosphere at the club in that dressing room was positive.\""

      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 16:54, UK",
      "No 9s and No 10s have been the talk of the summer and big money has been spent in the pursuit of goals.",
      "Chelsea are hanging their hopes on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Arsenal have got all their eggs in the Viktor Gyokeres basket, while Man United have gone wild and revamped their entire forward line by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £207m.",
      "Liverpool have front-loaded, too, splashing a nine-figure sum on Florian Wirtz before pushing overall spending beyond the £250m mark with a £79m outlay on Hugo Ekitike.",
      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",
      "His versatility across a fluid frontline will nevertheless be helpful to Enzo Maresca, who could use Pedro as a second striker behind the former Ipswich target man if he so wishes - or even on the wing.",
      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",
      "Pep Guardiola professed not to want wholesale change at Manchester City midway through last season's disastrous collapse, but that appears to be what he's got. City went big in January and have invested further this summer.",
      "Rayan Cherki has drawn most excitement, not least because of comparisons with one Lionel Messi - which may have as much to do with his short stature as his impressive close ball control, but any association with the great Argentinian has got to be deemed favourable.",
      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",

      "Ready to do it all again? The 2025/26 Premier League season is here; An epic title race awaits, goals are guaranteed & newly promoted teams up for the scrap; \"The Premier League is on a completely different level to anything else in world football,\" says Jamie Carragher",
      "Thursday 14 August 2025 06:22, UK",
      "The Premier League is back and has all the ingredients in the mix for this season to have serious G.O.A.T potential.",
      "For most of us the Premier League runs through our veins. Admit it, a little part of us has been missing these past few months. It is part of the fabric of society in this country - of why we all love this game.",
      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",
      "Wayne Rooney's first Everton goal that meant his world would never be the same again. Thierry Henry turning it on against Liverpool, bewildering our very own Jamie Carragher along the way, to keep Arsenal on track in the title race.",
      "David Beckham from halfway. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. Collymore closing in.",
      "Aguerooooo.",
      "Kevin Keegan loving it.",
      "Andrea Bocelli, Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City.",
      "Well, it's time to create new moments that are stamped in our memory banks as the 2025/26 Premier League rolls into town. And all the ingredients have been added to the pot to make this season one of the greats.",
      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",
