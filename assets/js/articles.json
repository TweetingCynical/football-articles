      "Ruben Amorim is the man tasked with bringing the glory days back to Old Trafford and that could start by winning the Europa League. Not only would United taste silverware for the third successive season - something that they've not achieved since the Sir Alex Ferguson era - it'd be a major boost to their finances.",
      "That's because victory in Bilbao on May 21 - although they've still got to navigate their semi-final second leg - would secure Champions League football next term. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has estimated that playing in Europe's elite competition would worth between £80million and £100m.",
      "The Red Devils are having to keep the pursue strings tight in their current predicament, with Ratcliffe's cost-cutting measures a sign of empty the piggy bank is. But selling the players that they want rid of plus Champions League football would shift the narrative.",
      "Here's a round-up of the latest transfer news from Old Trafford.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund could be offered an escape route out of Manchester United after Juventus decided to pursue a move for the Danish striker. Hojlund, who cost United £72m in 2023, has endured another difficult season with the Red Devils and Ruben Amorim wouldn't stand his way if he signalled his desire to leave.",
      "Juve are keen to sign the 22-year-old as part of their own attacking overhaul, with Dusan Vlahovic and Randal Kolo Muani expected to depart. Calciomercato report that Juventus' sporting director, Cristiano Giuntoli, has taken the first steps towards a deal for Hojlund, having initially been keen on fellow United striker Joshua Zirkzee before his upturn in form and subsequent injury.",
      "Manchester United are ready to join the race for £60m-rated Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. United watched Mbeumo, 25, closely on Sunday, as Brentford beat the Red Devils 4-3.",
      "The Bees winger wasn't able to add to his tally of 18 goals and six assists in the Premier League this season, although he still posed a threat. According to the Telegraph, United want to sign both Mbeumo and Wolves forward Matheus Cunha in a £125m double deal.",
      "Read the full story on Mbeumo here.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been told to make a shock move for Jamie Vardy, who'll leave Leicester this summer. Vardy, 38, has attracted interest from Championship clubs but former Premier League midfielder Jamie O'Hara reckons that Manchester United could do worse."

      "Premier League referee Anthony Taylor has insisted his decision to allow Brentford's second goal against Manchester United to stand was the correct decision. United fell to a 4-3 defeat away at the Bees on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Mason Mount put the visitors ahead before the hosts levelled through an unfortunate own-goal from Luke Shaw. But United were left fuming 12 minutes before half-time when Kevin Schade towered over Tyler Fredricson to power in a superb header.",
      "Taylor awarded a goal but the United players surrounded the refereeing insisting he should have stopped play earlier in the move. They pointed to Matthijs De Ligt suffering an injury in a challenge with Yoane Wissa as the reason the game should not have been allowed to continue.",
      "De Ligt went down clutching his leg before sitting up and putting his arm in the air. Taylor did not pause the game though and Brentford did not put the ball out of play, subsequently scoring.",
      "\"The main consideration was my responsibility is to decide if De Ligt is seriously injured or not. Generally you consider a serious injury a head injury in the main. In this situation because he's sitting up I don't consider that serious and allowed the game to continue. It's probably more a foul on Wissa than the other way,\" he said.",
      "\"In this situation we were more than happy to let the game continue. Brentford were in a promising attacking situation so they don't want the game stopped. United were the defending team, they probably do want the game stopped.\"",
      "Schade would go on to head in his second of the afternoon from a Bryan Mbeumo cross with 20 minutes to go. Wissa appeared to put the game to bed four minutes later.",
      "But Alejandro Garnacho scored a stunning long-range effort eight minutes from time to give United some hope. And Amad ensured it was a nervy finish when he scored deep into added time, though Brentford held on.",
      "De Ligt now looks set for a spell on the sidelines in what is a nightmare scenario for boss Ruben Amorim. United still have hope of winning the Europa League and seeing De Ligt sit on the sidelines would be a major blow to their hopes.",
      "Amorim said of De Ligt's injury: \"I don't know, we will check. I hope it is [only] a small issue because I am concerned, not only about this game [against Athletic Club, but about the squad for the next year.",
      "\"I hope it's nothing serious. We took a risk with [Harry] Maguire [having to come on]. [Luke] Shaw had to go off [at half-time] because we need players for Thursday.\""

      "His current manager Conte is adamant that McTominay has flourished since leaving United because of his consistency in the starting XI - and his \"main role\" within the team. Speaking ahead of the team's next clash with Lecce, the 55-year-old said: \"I think McTominay is stronger today than when he arrived from United.",

      "Wayne Rooney has given a scathing assessment of Manchester United under Ruben Amorim after their 4-3 defeat by Brentford on Sunday. Amorim picked an inexperienced team to face the Bees and saw his side beaten for the 16th time in the Premier League this season.",
      "With Thursday’s Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao the clear priority, Amorim named the third youngest Premier League starting XI of any club. Youngsters Chido Obi-Martin, Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson were all handed opportunities but did not impress.",
      "However, United legend Rooney was more critical of Amorim and the more experienced players who were out there. Speaking on Match of the Day 2, he called out Kobbie Mainoo for “switching off” for two of Brentford’s goals and Amorim for fielding substitute Amad Diallo out of position at right wingback and for putting a “disjointed” team together which put “no pressure on the ball” and lacked intensity.",
      "Expanding on Rooney’s points, ex-Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said: “It is about intensity, but with wingbacks, different to a back four, it allows you to go and press because you’ve got the extra centre half behind you.",
      "“But surely that’s what they do in training, no? If you’re a coach of a system – the basics of this system with wingbacks is they press the wide men quick and it doesn’t look like they’re doing it. It’s bizarre for me to see.”",
      "Rooney replied: “It’s strange, because that’s why you play a back five with wingbacks. They have to put pressure on the ball or otherwise you get outnumbered in the midfield and the ball comes back into midfield. It was strange, but they had a lot of young players.”",
      "“There was a lack of movement and a lack of knowhow on the pitch,” he added. “They’ve got a 17-year-old lad up front – the youngest ever to start up front for United – and they’re just launching balls up to him. I really felt for Obi today because you can tell he’s inexperienced but it looked like he had no help, they were just throwing balls up to him.”",
      "Murphy added: “I get that there’s young players, I understand that and they’re playing against good teams. But he (Amorim) only plays one system, he’s not mixing things up, personnel and system and he’s been there a while now. When you play a system that much and you work on it in training, surely we can see more improvement, irrelevant of who is playing because they should be organised in that system.”",
      "Rooney responded: “You’d think so, but I think the second team are playing a back four, which I found strange, because those players who are coming into the first team now with the under-23s or under-21s are playing a different system.",
      "\"For me, that’s a bit confusing. Getting to the Europa League final is papering over a lot of cracks for Manchester United and that needs solving quickly.”"

      "Manchester United are ready to enter the race to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo, who's been linked with Liverpool and Newcastle. Mbeumo, 25, was part of the Bees side who won 4-3 against United on Sunday and the Red Devils were watching his individual performance closely.",
      "The Telegraph report that the £60million-rated winger is high on United's shortlist. Mbeumo has scored 18 goals and provided six assists in the Premier League this season and will be in demand in the summer.",

      "\"We'll see what happens,\" Aperribay said. All I ask of him is one last effort to qualify for Europe and whatever happens will happen in June. There's no point in speculating now about whether he'll be there. He's had several opportunities to leave and he'll make the decision he wants, because he'll have more options.\""

Don’t fall for any salesmen’s patter about this being a seven-goal thriller.",
      "Brentford put the third-youngest line-up in Premier League history to the sword to keep the Bees on the scent of pollen and honey in Europe next season. Copenhagen-on-Thames is a nice day out for a stroll along the Thames towpath or crossing the bridge to see the Great Pagoda in Kew Gardens, but for United it has often contained all the charms of a minefield.",
      "Three years ago, in a prologue to his rancorous exit, Cristiano Ronaldo threw a monumental strop when unlamented interim manager Ralf Rangnick dared to substitute him here. Seven months later, Erik ten Hag’s reign was almost stillborn when United shipped four goals in the opening 45 minutes, a debacle which led to Harry Maguire being stripped of the captaincy.",
      "And now, with one foot in the Europa League final, Amorim risked further ignominy by making eight changes. There is nothing wrong with promoting youth, and nobody does it better than the club who gave us the Busby Babes and the Class of ’92.",
      "But with an average age of 22 years and 270 days, United's starting XI was only behind Middlesbrough against Fulham in May 2006 (20 years, 181 days) and Arsenal ’s side against Portsmouth in 2009 (22 years, 237 days) for inexperience. And at 17 years 156 days, striker Chido Obi became the youngest United player to start a Premier League game as Amorim channelled his inner Star Wars fanboy: May the fourth be with you, Obi.",
      "Yet if the Premier League is an unforgiving environment for Babybel kids in a jungle of big cheeses, at least it does not diminish the audacity of youth, and after 14 minutes the Cub Devils had the temerity to go in front. Alejandro Garnacho’s low, first-time cross was turned home from six yards by Mason Mount, his first goal since March 2024 and only his second for United - both against the Bees.",
      "Mount’s career at Old Trafford has been permanently stuck on the launch-pad awaiting take-off, and at 26 he is in danger of having a bright future behind him. Much the same can be said of United’s dreadful domestic campaign, and two goals in six minutes soon disabused them of the fanciful notion that the kids would be all right.",
      "First Mikkel Damsgaard poked Michael Kayode’s header beyond Altay Bayindir at his near post, with the help of a telling deflection off acting United skipper Luke Shaw, for the equaliser. Then, with Matthijs De Ligt lying on the floor and signalling that he would need to be replaced, Christian Norgaard charged into the gap behind the stricken Dutchman and crossed for Kevin Schade to plunder his 10th goal of the season with a soaring header.",
      "United’s token protests to referee Anthony Taylor that he should have intervened fell on deaf ears and, in fairness, the law is explicit: Play is only stopped in the event of head injuries. Maybe if players didn’t roll around feigning mortal wounds, genuine cases of distress like De Ligt’s thigh problem would be taken more seriously.",
      "Bravely United waited until the last 20 minutes to fold after De Ligt’s limping evacuation, but it was pitiful stuff. Schade was unmarked on the far post to head home Bryan Mbeumo’s deflected cross, and four minutes later the remnants of Amorim’s defence were sliced open again, Yoane Wissa rolling his 18th goal of the season into an empty net from Kayode’s pass.",
      "The persevering Garnacho’s 25-yard rocket was useful damage limitation, and substitute Amad, making his first Premier League appearance since February, added another in stoppage time. But United’s window dressing was fooling nobody.",
      "They will have to keep it much tighter on the shop floor against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night."

      "Amorim made eight changes for the trip to London as United's big-name stars from midweek were afforded time to recuperate ahead of the second leg of their Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao next week.",
      "United's youthful team even hit the front after 14 minutes when Mason Mount finished a neat one-touch move from six yards after being teed up by Alejandro Garnacho. But they had to weather an early storm to do so and Brentford got the leveller their play merited just over 10 minutes later when a Mikkel Damsgaard effort was diverted into the back of United's net by Luke Shaw. They then turned the game completely on its head through Kevin Schade just six minutes later to leave United shellshocked.",
      "The visitors improved after the break as Amorim turned to his bench. But a second from Schade and another goal from Yoane Wissa helped Brentford over the line as goals from Garnacho and Amad helped set up a grandstand finish.",
      "United may have struck first but it was Brentford who were in the ascendancy from the word go. They were slick and purposeful going forward and it always felt like the pressure would eventually tell on a youthful Manchester United team, even if Mount's 14th minute opener wasn't in the script for the hosts.",
      "This result keeps them in the mix for European qualification and on this evidence - plus the fixtures they have outstanding - you wouldn't bet against them. Thomas Frank has been given his flowers on more than one occasion during Brentford's top-flight tenure but he deserves so much more. Quite how one of the 'Big Six' have not come calling is beyond belief given the managerial turnover we've seen in some quarters. The only danger for Brentford is that more of the same - and a European tour - could change that.",
      "United had won just three of their previous 21 Premier League games played in London prior to their joust with the Bees. And while this loss may not be as bruising as some of the 15 they had suffered beforehand in the league given their personnel changes, their latest showing in the capital certainly won't live long in the memory.",
      "Bar the odd moment - particularly their opening goal - United look second best all over the pitch against a Brentford side who were snapping at their heels. If anything, Amorim's men were fortunate to make it to the break just one goal behind as the hosts unloaded a barrage of attacks on them towards the end of the first-half, with Altay Bayindir putting a nervy start behind him to keep the Bees at bay.",
      "But he couldn't keep Brentford at bay as the hosts gleefully set about laying down a market to their European rivals - even if they did have to survive a late scare.",
      "United can still salvage what has been a sorry season with victory in the Europa League, which would land them a golden ticket to the Champions League next year. So Amorim absolutely made the right move in shuffling his pack and resting a host of his more established stars given United are going nowhere fast in the Premier League standings between now and the end of the month.",
      "But United did not leave the capital unscathed with Matthijs de Ligt suffering an injury in the build-up to Brentford's second goal. The former Bayern Munich man did not look at all comfortable as he left the pitch and it wouldn't be a surprise to see him miss the biggest match of United's season on Thursday when they try and book their spot in the Europa League final.",
      "That will be a bitter pill to swallow for both him and Amorim, who would have been desperate to head back up the M1 with a clean bill of health.",
      "In an era where tactics are king and players are drilled to within an inch of their life, the havoc that Brentford's Michael Kayode caused with his long throws was almost refreshing.",
      "Manchester United looked vulnerable from set-pieces all afternoon and it was no surprise that their leveller came from the second phase of a Kayode special. It was the Italian who beat Harry Amass in the air to keep the play alive and Brentford bagged the ultimate reward. The 20-year-old is no one-trick pony, though: he was just as impressive in open play and will only get better as he acclimatises to the Premier League.",
      "United's recruitment is often scrutinised but Brentford more than often get it right in the transfer market. Kayode - signed on loan with an option in January - looks like another win.",
      "Manchester United are in need of a big summer if they are to banish this sorry season to the history books. Bryan Mbeumo is just one of a host of players who have been linked with United in recent weeks, and Sunday's game was the perfect occasion for him to show why.",
      "And even on a quiet afternoon, the Cameroon international conjured up some magic in the second half to put the game beyond United, awaking from his slumber to put the ball on a plate for Brentford's third goal.",
      "Mbuemo, 25, is versatile, deadly in the final third and affordable when compared to some of United's previous transfer dealings. This may not have been the complete 'audition' of sorts if United are mulling over a move, but Mbuemo's quality is undeniable. His assist underlined that and how United could do with somebody capable of conjuring up moments like that to ease the burden on Bruno Fernandes."

      "Mason Greenwood is said to be angling for a return to the Premier League in the upcoming transfer window, less than 12 months after moving to Marseille from Manchester United.",
      "The former England star, 23, left Old Trafford in a deal worth in excess of £26million last summer. The switch was Greenwood's second move abroad after the forward spent time on loan in Spain with Getafe during the 2023-24 season.",
      "Greenwood has scored 19 goals in 33 games for Marseille, who are managed by former Brighton boss, Roberto De Zerbi. But the United academy graduate is unsettled in the south of France and wants to return to England.",
      "As revealed by The Sun, Greenwood is 'yearning' for a return to the UK. A source explains that the opportunity to play abroad has helped Greenwood and his partner, Harriet Robson, 'rebuild their lives' after charges of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour against the striker were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "But 'the novelty has worn off' for Greenwood, who would like to move back to the north west with his partner and their two young daughters should the opportunity arise.",
      "It's claimed that Greenwood's desire for a return to England has put 'a string of clubs' on alert ahead of the upcoming transfer window. Manchester United would stand to benefit financially if Greenwood were to move on again due to a sell-on clause which was inserted in the deal that took him across the channel last summer.",
      "Despite Greenwood's impressive returns in front of goal, his time in France has not been without its challenges. His application has been questioned by De Zerbi, while the club's Ultras unfurled a banner urging Greenwood to \"get a move on\", a swipe at his work ethic.",
      "\"I expect more from him,\" De Zerbi said of Greenwood. \"He has to do more, because what he is currently showing is not enough. If he wants to achieve his ambition of becoming a champion, he has to be more consistent, sacrifice more and be more determined.\"",
      "Marseille are currently third in the Ligue 1 table with just three games remaining this term."

      "Bendito Mantato, Jaydan Kamason and Sekou Kone travelled to Athletic Bilbao last week, but they weren't included in the first-team squad against Brentford. That suggested they would feature for the U21s on Bank Holiday, although only Kone was named in the starting XI.",
      "Mantato and Kamason were present in the stands instead, along with Chido Obi and Harry Amass, who were supporting their peers after starting against Brentford at the Gtech Stadium.",
      "Even without those talented youngsters, Travis Binnion still named a strong starting side to take on the Hammers, with the likes of Ethan Wheatley, James Scanlon, Godwill Kukonki and Kone all featuring.",
      "Kone has improved with practically every month since signing from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million last summer and he wore the No.10 shirt for the quarter-final clash.",
      "The midfielder is a traditional No.6, but he operated in the most advanced midfield position, with Tyler Fletcher and Jacob Devaney occupying deeper roles, which was something new.",
      "While Kone often likes to drift forward from defensive midfield, he doesn't stand out as a player with the skillset to play as a No.10, and he wasn't as effective as usual.",
      "United play youngsters in different positions to benefit their development, though. Academy staff take young players out of their comfort zone by playing them in different areas and Monday's game will have given Kone food for thought.",

      "There were some teething problems in midfield against West Ham, so it wasn't a surprise to see the London club take the lead in the first half after Fletcher was dispossessed near his own box.",
      "Fletcher was lavished with praise by Travis Binnion after the quarter-final play-off against Everton, but he was caught trying to build out from the back and West Ham ruthlessly punished his mistake as Chukwuemeka Adiel fired into the bottom right corner.",
      "United's youngsters were bickering when the half-time whistle went. Kone has taken English lessons since his arrival from Mali and communicated with them.",
      "United's lack of creativity frustrated Wheatley up front, but Binnion felt he was also culpable. \"Wheatz, you've got to them pal, don't f****** moan,\" the U21 manager shouted at one point.",
      "Scanlon was the bright spark in the final third for United in a drab first half, so he fittingly dragged his side back into the game with a smart finish almost immediately after play resumed.",
      "The 18-year-old has already made his international debut for Gibraltar, who he qualifies to represent through his mother, and that goal was his 22nd of the season in all competitions.",
      "United were buoyed by Scanlon's goal and finally got on the front foot. West Ham began to grow weary due to their man-to-man marking and were forced into a mistake by United's aggressive pressing.",
      "Just before the hour mark, West Ham conceded possession and Wheatley picked up the ball, but there was still plenty for him to do and he finished brilliantly into the bottom right corner.",
      "Wheatley hardly celebrated his strike. His hands were on his knees and he looked shattered, but his endeavour was rewarded with a goal.",
      "\"I'm f*****,\" mouthed Wheatley to the sideline moments later, but he continued and Sam Murray sealed the victory by scoring a heavily deflected goal with just under 10 minutes remaining. Sam Mather then rubbed salt in West Ham's wounds by finding the top right corner in added time.",

      "Ruben Amorim had called it. \"Not the best moment\" to play the kids, he said recently. Manchester United's young guns might now also understand why their manager was cautious about chucking them in at the deep end this season.",
      "If this is a case of sink or swim, then the third youngest team in Premier League history were gasping for air at the Gtech Community Stadium. This won't be an afternoon that will wreck promising careers, but it could certainly be a setback.",
      "Tyler Fredricson had a promising start but was replaced by Victor Lindelof as he began to struggle. Chido Obi might have signed up to Rasmus Hojlund's strikers' union on his return to the away dressing rooms after this chastening effort.",
      "It's worth revisiting Amorim's comments from a couple of weeks ago about the danger of throwing the kids in during a domestic campaign that has become an embarrassment to the club.",
      "\"It's not the best moment or the best season to put some kids to play because again they need a strong base to really show what they can do, but in this moment we need to do it,\" Amorim said.",
      "You can't really argue with that, but you can also see why United's head coach was reluctant to do what he had to do at Brentford. The result was a 16th defeat of the season and another rough afternoon.",
      "Before kick-off, there had been excitement at the United line-up. At 17 years and 155 days, Obi became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for United. He was the junior member of a very junior team. With an average age of 22 years and 270 days, this was the third youngest team to start a Premier League game for any club.",
      "It didn't feel like that was the case when the team dropped, but youngsters such as 20-year-olds Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho have so much first-team experience that it can be easy to forget their tender years. Six members of the starting XI were 20 or younger, with Harry Amass, Fredricson, and Patrick Dorgu rounding off that number.",
      "The focus was on Obi, however, as it always is when a prolific goalscorer at academy levels begins to try and make the ascent to first-team football. The former Arsenal youngster has already seen just how taxing that rise can be.",
      "He has 14 goals in 15 games this season at youth level, but his cameos for the first team have shown how raw he is. He had chances against Fulham in the FA Cup but has toiled without reward otherwise.",
      "Amorim's comments about this not being the right time to play youngsters had a caveat: The head coach didn't think he had any other option. Europa League progression and the catastrophic state of their Premier League season have rendered these games exercises of survival.",
      "As soon as Joshua Zirkzee's season came to a premature end last month, it was clear Obi was going to be needed. In his first start and his longest run out yet, he got an understanding of why Amorim was concerned about exposing too many youngsters. You only need to look at Hojlund's body language to see what a thankless task playing No.9 for this team can be.",
      "Obi did scrap hard against Nathan Collins, but academy level doesn't prepare you for physical battles with 6ft 4in centre-backs with years of strength training behind them. On a couple of occasions Altay Bayindir sent long balls up for Obi to try and challenge for against Collins.",
      "That is exactly the kind of pass that Andre Onana often sends Hojlund's way, and gets a volley of abuse back in return. Obi isn't going to complain just yet but he can't have appreciated it either. He battled away manfully but got little change out of the Republic of Ireland international.",
      "When Luke Shaw then sent a free-kick spinning down the left channel, the kind of aimless ball forward that tells a striker 'chase that', it was met with an exasperated wave of the arms from Ruben Amorim. Obi was never in contention to win the race for the ball.",
      "It summed up his first half that he had just eight touches, half as many as the next lowest for United, which was Garnacho with 16.",
      "One of the problems for United's striker is that you can go through long spells of not being involved in the game, so when the chance does come, you're not ready for it. Obi had half an opportunity when Christian Eriksen's cross picked him out, but he failed to connect with his header. Even had he done so, it was a difficult chance.",
      "He deserves credit for sticking at it, however. His best opportunity came in the final minute, when perseverance saw him carve out half-a-yard of space in the box, before his shot from an angle was blocked.",
      "He won't be judged on this outing. You only have to watch Hojlund play to know how difficult it is for a striker here. Of the 39 shots United had against Bournemouth and Athletic Club last week, their striker had one.",
      "Now Obi understands his plight. At most clubs, it is the goalkeepers who stick together. At this one, it's their strikers who should have each other's backs."

      "However, United have sought potential bidders for Casemiro over the past 12 months and they would require £15million to sell him and avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. Interest from Saudi Pro League clubs last year came to nought.",
      "United want to bolster their midfield, an area where they are short of specialists. Manuel Ugarte joined from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer but it is unclear what long-term plans Amorim has for Kobbie Mainoo and Toby Collyer has missed 29 matches through injury this season. Christian Eriksen will be released.",

      "Fourteen months later, Alexander-Arnold was pitted against a different left winger. Marcus Rashford destroyed him in a two-goal matchwinning performance.",
      "The BBC used to air Can't Cook, Won't Cook. With Alexander-Arnold, it is a case of can't defend, won't defend. He only lost three times against United and was tantamount to their 12th man in a couple of them.",
      "Cast your mind back to United's first victory under Erik ten Hag on that balmy August evening in 2022 and Alexander-Arnold was at the scene of the crime twice. He could not be bothered to chase Anthony Elanga after his one-two with Christian Eriksen for Jadon Sancho's opening goal.",
      "Alexander-Arnold was such a liability even Martial got the better of him that time. Martial was sent on for Elanga for the second half, the first instance of Ten Hag's in-game management back when it was influential. Rashford switched from centre forward to left wing.",
      "For the second goal, Alexander-Arnold did not know whether to come or go. The indecision played Rashford onside when he was put through one-on-one by Martial.",
      "Paradoxically, Alexander-Arnold is one of the best and worst right backs United have encountered. He was involved in 7-0, 5-0, 4-0 and 3-0 drubbings in one of Liverpool's best teams. When he left Old Trafford in September, he held three fingers up to signal the final score.",
      "United have won a derisory four of their past 19 matches against Liverpool since Alexander-Arnold's full league debut at Old Trafford. Yet he was also heavily responsible for Diogo Dalot's best performance of the season at Anfield in January. Quite a few Scousers around the press box advised Alexander-Arnold to \"f**k off\" that day.",
      "Alexander-Arnold reputedly told friends he cannot remember the game. Just as well. The gulf between Liverpool and United had not been so great for decades and the game went ahead despite treacherous weather around the ground. United unexpectedly produced their best performance at Anfield for ten years and drew 2-2.",
      "The worst-kept secret is out now. After Alexander-Arnold's winner at Leicester City last month, Clinton Morrison exclaimed on BBC commentary: \"If you're leaving a football club I don't think you celebrate like that!\"",
      "Anyone not of a Liverpool persuasion did."

The 20-year-old will be keen to get on the scoresheet against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of United's semi-final clash at Old Trafford on Thursday.",

      "No sooner was Matthijs de Ligt back in the Manchester United and then he was back out of it. De Ligt limped to the United team coach as he exited the Community Stadium on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim almost tied himself in knots over the extent of De Ligt's injury until he realised it himself. \"With Mattha, I don’t know, I’m just talking,\" he admitted. Amorim had \"no idea\" how bad De Ligt's injury was.",
      "The apparent impact injury De Ligt suffered, how immediately he signalled to the United bench and the swiftness in which Carlos Fernandes summoned Harry Maguire would make it a shock if De Ligt is involved in United's open training session at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "That will be two weeks out from the Europa League final. United have only two games between the semi-final and the final. De Ligt has not completed 90 minutes since April 1. Realistically, anyone who is unable to play against Athletic Bilbao and West Ham United this week will not start the final.",
      "We are at the risk of getting ahead of ourselves, of course. Liverpool, Tottenham and Bournemouth have won 3-0 at Old Trafford this season. Manchester City, Newcastle United and Bournemouth recorded that scoreline at the stadium last season. Lyon went from 2-0 down to 4-2 up less than three weeks ago. United collapsed from 3-0 up against Coventry City to almost lose 4-3 in the FA Cup semi-final 12 months ago. United have lost eight games at home this season.",
      "The more you ponder the second leg, the more you can understand why Amorim is so phlegmatic. His first words in the San Mames press conference room were, \"I think they (the players) have to think about the second leg. And think more about the first 20 minutes than the rest of the game.\" Ie. do not dare get carried away.",
      "Luke Shaw's withdrawal at half-time against Brentford was in response to De Ligt's setback. United could be without three centre halves against Athletic, enough to make Amorim anxiously stoop down onto his haunches before kick-off.",
      "Yet he has Amad. His introduction at half-time against Brentford was planned, a full half after a Hitchcock-like cameo in Bilbao. Amad got his tenth goal of the season, a creditable tally for a 22-year-old who had still not started a meaningful match for the club this time last year and just back after almost three months out with an ankle injury.",
      "He is also a natural fit on the right wing. Amorim's reluctance to rule out Diogo Dalot for the run-in sounded more out of loyalty to a compatriot he has a tight bond with. Dalot is often derided by sections of the United fanbase but his form was improving before a first injury since January 2023.",
      "The mid-season signing of Patrick Dorgu had redressed the balance on United's wings. Without Dalot, Dorgu ping-ponged from left to right at Bournemouth. His stint on the right-hand side at Brentford suggested Amorim had imagined watching him play there on WyScout.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui had one of his most accomplished performances as a winger against Athletic Bilbao but defending is his forte. With De Ligt scheduled for another appointment in the physio's room, Mazraoui is the logical third centre half alongside Harry Maguire and Leny Yoro.",
      "Amorim did not entertain starting Luke Shaw in the first leg and turned to Victor Lindelof, United's poorest performer. Lindelof was so fortunate that Alex Berenguer hit the ball straight at him after the Swede almost unwittingly assisted the Basque.",
      "A three and four of Mazraoui, Maguire, Yoro, Amad, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Dorgu is a more bullish balance than the overload of defensive players Amorim has often opted for. He pragmatically played the percentages against Athletic last week and three defensive starters slickly combined for the game-changing opening goal.",
      "But Amad, when fully fit, has to start. In both of his substitute appearances last week, he replaced Dorgu on the right. Thursday's second leg is a logical match to restore him to the line-up for the Europa League anthem.",
      "Amad has played on the right wing in ten of his 22 appearances under Amorim, five as a starter and five off the bench. He was playing there when he scored a last-gasp hat-trick to avoid what would have been one of United's most humiliating Premier League defeats against Southampton.",
      "Amorim picked Amad on the right in his first match in charge at Ipswich Town on November 24. \"I think it was very good, he (Amad) has improved a lot,\" Amorim said that evening. \"Since these three days, he improved so much defensively but for him the opponent he had all the time was the left back (Leif Davis).",
      "\"So it’s like a winger follows the left back. It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\"",

      "Manchester United's entire season, if it was not already clear, lies solely on the outcome of the Europa League.",
      "The 4-3 defeat to Brentford on Sunday ensured that there is little hope of salvation in the Premier League this season and it is win the Europa League or bust. United have a good shot of reaching the final after a 3-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao last Thursday, but Ruben Amorim will be aware of how quickly things can change after the last round's drama against Lyon.",
      "Once the season ends - i.e. when United get knocked out of the Europa League - the focus will be fully on the summer transfer window. MEN Sport has taken a closer look at a couple of headlines surrounding the club.",
      "According to Gines Carvajal, the agent of former United defender Alvaro Carreras, there is no substance to the reports the full-back would be looking to re-join his old team or move to Real Madrid in the summer. Speaking to A Bola, Carvajal explained: \"I don’t know where this news comes from, everything that is said in it is pure fantasy and, as such, it does not deserve any comment on my part.",
      "\"Carreras is doing very well in Benfica and will continue there.\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: It would be interesting to see an alternate world where Carreras stayed at United and was able to work under Amorim. I don't think that the 22-year-old leaves Old Trafford last summer if he knows that reality is on the horizon. Now he has left, I would be shocked if he would return, especially given the turnaround has had. It feels like the full-back, while he would fit nicely in the United team now, is heading in a different direction in his career and questions should be asked as to why they allowed Carreras to leave at all.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, United are looking to close in on a move for Atalanta central midfielder Ederson. After another solid year in Serie A, it looks like the club are hoping to strike a deal with the Italians for the Brazilian.",
      "It is believed this deal will only be possible if United win the Europa League and qualify for next season's Champions League. After a solid victory in the semi-final first leg, it is claimed that a move for Ederson is now one step closer.",
      "What MEN Sport says: It cannot be stressed how important winning the Europa League is for all aspects of the club. Suddenly, the finances would improve enough to give United a safety buffer. It would also change the calibre of player that United are looking to target. Ederson is one of those better players and Amorim would be delighted to make more of these signings in the summer. The worry is, if United fall short of Europa League glory, will they be shopping in the bargain basement for players who may not exponentially improve this team? Only time will tell."

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer emerged victorious over Jose Mourinho as Besiktas clinched a 1-0 win against Fenerbahce in the Istanbul derby on Sunday.",
      "The former Manchester United managers faced off for the first time in four years during the Turkish Super Lig match at Sukru Saracoglu Stadium. They last coached against each other in 2021 when Solskjaer orchestrated a 3-1 victory for United against Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "On that occasion, a claim from Solskjaer that Son Heung-min had \"conned\" the referee caused controversy, which elicited a sharp retort from Mourinho. However, he downplayed the incident ahead of their reunion in Turkey.",
      "Meanwhile, the former Spurs midfielder Gedson Fernandes was the match's main protagonist. Within eight first-half minutes, he missed a penalty after being fouled by the ex-Leicester City defender Caglar Soyuncu before scoring the game's only goal just before half-time.",
      "The result best benefits their Istanbul rivals, Galatasaray. They now have an eight-point gap lead over Fenerbahce in the league with four matches remaining. Besiktas are a distant fourth, two points adrift of Samsunspor, who have played one match more.",
      "Solskjaer has now won half of his six matches managed against Mourinho after enjoying victory just once in his first four. The latter won their first meeting when the former was in charge of an already-relegated Cardiff City on the final day of the 2013/14 season.",
      "However, Mourinho's Chelsea did trail for almost an hour in the Welsh capital after an early Cesar Azpilicueta goal, only for Andre Schurrle and Fernando Torres to complete a second-half comeback. They would then not meet until the 2019/20 season.",
      "United beat Spurs at Old Trafford, with Marcus Rashford scoring twice on either side of a goal from Dele Alli. Solskjaer's side then drew 1-1 in north London during that campaign thanks to a late Bruno Fernandes penalty.",
      "Mourinho, though, claimed the most memorable victory in April 2020, winning 6-1 at Old Trafford. Spurs scored six unanswered goals after Fernandes put United ahead from the spot inside just two minutes.",
      "Four, though, came after Anthony Martial saw red for violent conduct. That was the last time Mourinho beat Solskjaer, with the latter now winning their two meetings since."

      "Manchester United have had little to shout about this season and the Premier League will undoubtedly get worse before it gets any better.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has already declared that the Europa League is the sole focus for United now and that has certainly been proven this week. United were at their devastating best in the Basque Country on Thursday night as they won 3-0 and, even against ten men, they were full value for their victory.",
      "Amorim then chose a weakened XI to face Brentford which showed as they fell to a 4-3 defeat in the capital. One player to be rested after a confident night in Bilbao was Casemiro.",
      "In the Europa League, the Brazilian has shown glimpses of the player who dominated in his first season at Old Trafford. His performance against Athletic Bilbao was impressive and has made things interesting regarding his future.",
      "Before his exceptional performances in the Europa League, Casemiro seemed destined to depart with his bloated wage of £350,000 per week seen as too much for United to accommodate. But, he has shown glimpses of why he can still be an asset for the club.",
      "However in a report in The Mirror, United have been shown why, if they win the Europa League, selling Casemiro must be a priority. It is claimed that a clause in the Brazilian's contract means that his wage will increase by £150,000 per week if United are playing Champions League football next season.",
      "To put this into perspective, that would put Casemiro on the same wage as Cristiano Ronaldo was on during his second spell at United. Perhaps more staggering, that would be an extra player's salary going straight to the 33-year-old.",
      "Our colleagues at Chronicle Live reported this week that United summer transfer target Liam Delap would be demanding a wage of between £120,000 and £150,000 per week. Now, the Ipswich Town striker would be a risk but he is a calculated risk and could ultimately prove to be the future of this club's attack.",
      "Casemiro, as much as he has improved as the season has worn on, is not the future. With a reported yearly salary of £26m, if United reach the Champions League, Casemiro would simply be too expensive to keep around - particularly considering his output.",
      "As a priority, United should be looking to sell Casemiro if this is the case. Otherwise, even with the Champions League bounty, they could struggle to properly mould this squad in Amorim's image."

      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank the top-flight stoppers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 12 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.2\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remain in sniffing distance of a European place.",
      "",
      "3) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +2.9\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 73.8% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, making him the favourite for the Golden Gloves award. Which he would deserve rather more than David Raya.",
      "",
      "4) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.6\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.5\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with a clean sheet v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "6) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham): +2.3\nMade eight saves to protect a point v Bournemouth as the old man proved he’s still got what it takes. Was excellent v Brighton, particularly to save a deflected effort from Yasin Ayari, and then made a series of saves v Southampton before being stretchered off with a head injury. Returned to over-concede v Fulham but he was at least on the winning side. He under-conceded v Palace and lost. Now on the West Ham bench.",
      "",
      "7) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "",
      "9) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",
      "",
      "10) Alisson (Liverpool): +1.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",
      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.2\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled.",
      "",
      "12) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.9\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "13) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +0.8\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich.",
      "",
      "14) Stefan Ortega (Manchester City): -0.7\nProof, if proof were needed, that all Manchester City goalkeepers are not created equal.",
      "",
      "15) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.8\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted.",
      "",
      "16) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): -0.8\nCulpable once again as Villa lost a crucial clash with Manchester City; that Bernardo Silva goal had a PSxG of just 0.28. Has conceded more goals than Jordan Pickford this season from a very, very similar PSxG in the same number of Premier League games this season.",
      "",
      "17) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -2.5\nA really poor season compared to his usual standards. Only Liverpool and Arsenal should actually have conceded more than Fulham this season.",
      "",
      "19) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): -3.1\nWas supposed to make a big difference to Southampton; has apparently not made a big difference to Southampton.",
      "",
      "20) Jose Sa (Wolves): -3.1\nSaved a penalty v Leicester City to keep his seventh clean sheet of the season.",
      "",
      "21) Alphonse Areola (West Ham): -4.5\nWest Ham are now so bad that Areola remarkably under-conceded in the 3-2 defeat to Brighton.",
      "",
      "22) Bart Verbruggen (Brighton): -5.7\nConceded 15 goals in six games and the numbers suggest he should have conceded around 11 goals. It’s been a pattern all season. But he was far better v Newcastle.",
      "Man Utd have made an ‘offer’ for Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak with the Red Devils looking to sell Andre Onana this summer, according to reports.",
      "Andre Onana is reportedly ‘open to leaving’ Man Utd in the summer transfer window and there is already one club that is in ‘major’ talks to sign him.",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim has ‘found’ his preferred replacement for Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana, whose ‘future is uncertain’.",
      "Man Utd could be set to rival Arsenal in the transfer market as they launch a bid to sign La Liga’s highest-rated goalkeeper.",
      "Man Utd are hoping to bring Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, it only took Ruben Amorim ‘two months’ to ‘decide’ that he wants Manchester United to sign a new goalkeeper."

      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils have had a miserable season in the Premier League with Ruben Amorim’s side currently 15th heading into the final three matches of the campaign.",
      "Amorim’s men are already guaranteed to finish the season as the worst Man Utd team to have played in the Premier League, even if they win their remaining three fixtures.",
      "One of their main issues this season has been scoring goals with just five Premier League sides scoring fewer than them this term.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have come in for lots of criticism this season with the duo only scoring seven Premier League goals between them this term.",
      "Amorim has struggled to get the best out of his group with the Man Utd squad struggling to adapt to his style of play, formation and philosophy.",
      "And now Man Utd want to support him in the transfer window with a number of signings and one of the main areas they want to improve is in attack.",
      "On Sunday, the Daily Telegraph reported that Brentford winger Mbeumo is now a ‘target’ for Man Utd ‘as well as’ Wolves Cunha as they look to overhaul their front line.",
      "The Brentford man is ‘high on list of potential targets as Amorim looks to bolster squad’ and Man Utd are ‘ready to join the race’ for Mbeumo ‘when competition for the £60 million-rated Brentford forward intensifies during the summer transfer window’.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘Wolves striker Matheus Cunha, who has a £65 million buyout clause, is a target for United in the summer but has been most effective through the middle as a No 9.",
      "‘Interest in Mbeumo is independent of the Cunha deal, with the former Troyes forward regarded as one of the best wide forwards in the Premier League.’",
      "But transfer expert Fabrizio Romano is less sure of how serious the Red Devils’ interest in Mbeumo is with “many clubs” looking to tie up a deal to sign the Brentford forward in the summer transfer window.",

So, of course, if the right price – and that’s going to be expensive – is coming, then I’m sure the club will be open for it. But I’m very happy he’s here, and I’m convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.”",

      "Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano says there is a “clear feeling” that Christopher Nkunku will “leave Chelsea in the summer transfer window.”",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano revealed that Nkunku was a genuine candidate to leave in January.",
      "However, a move never came close due to Chelsea’s reluctance to accept a loan and the player’s preference for a permanent deal.",
      "“There was a possibility for Christopher Nkunku to go on a permanent transfer in January,” Romano said. “Then all the approaches were for a loan deal, and Nkunku was not keen for a loan. Same for the club.”",
      "Romano also revealed that Man Utd, managed by Ruben Amorim, explored a potential swap deal during the winter window, but talks never progressed.",
      "“There was some interest from Bayern in January, some interest also from Manchester United, but only in case of a swap deal, and nothing happened,” he said.",
      "With Chelsea now under Enzo Maresca and preparing for another summer overhaul, Romano believes there’s now a clear path for Nkunku to depart.",
      "Surprise reports linking him with a move to champions Liverpool emerged last week.",
      "“The story for Christopher Nkunku will be different [this summer]… the clear feeling of all parties involved is for Christopher Nkunku to leave Chelsea in the summer transfer window,” he said.",
      "Nkunku, who joined from RB Leipzig in 2023 for over £50m, has struggled to find form or fitness since arriving in West London. Having missed large chunks of his first season at the club, the Frenchman has struggled to find regular minutes this term, scoring just three goals in 27 Premier League appearances.",

      "“Nkunku is not finding the space he wants,” Romano explained.",
      "“Also, probably in terms of skills, Nkunku is not exactly the kind of player needed for Enzo Maresca’s vision and idea. Nkunku wants to play on a regular basis, and at Chelsea, this is not happening.",
      "“Apart from the Conference League. But it’s about Premier League football, the crucial games, and Nkunku wants to play.”",
      "Romano also confirmed Nkunku has picked up yet another injury and will miss the next 10 to 15 days, further fuelling expectations of a summer exit.",
      "“My expectation is not to see Christopher Nkunku in a Chelsea shirt next season.",
      "“I told you that in March and in April, and I confirm that also now in May.”",
      "Chelsea are understood to be open to offers and would prefer a permanent transfer over another season of uncertainty. Clubs in Germany, Italy and Spain are also said to be monitoring the situation.",
      "It remains to be seen if Utd are open to returning for Nkunku when the window opens on June 1, but their January preference for a swap deal hints at the financial restrictions the club may have to work around.",
      "Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has confirmed three teams lead the race for Dean Huijsen, with two Premier League sides set to miss out.",

      "20) Marco Verratti (Al-Arabi)\nTwo years might well be enough for a mid-table Qatari side; will he join a really good Qatari side instead?",
      "",
      "19) Mario Pasalic (Atalanta)\nSpent six years at Chelsea without playing a single game but has played almost 300 matches for Atalanta. Neither club nor player is likely to call an end to that in the summer; an extension is very likely.",
      "",
      "18) Josh Brownhill (Burnley)\nThere are links to a West Ham move that sound like the most West Ham move ever.",
      "",
      "17) CG Egan-Riley (Burnley)\nA mainstay of one of the meanest defences in Championship history, he will surely stay for a Premier League campaign.",
      "",
      "16) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026.",
      "",
      "15) Kenny Tete (Fulham)\nAfter a one-year extension was triggered last summer, there is talk of the can being kicked even further down the road.",
      "",
      "14) Thomas Partey (Arsenal)\nArsenal have opened contract talks with the Ghanaian but he has attracted interest from Atletico Madrid.",
      "",
      "13) Kyle Walker-Peters (Southampton)\nHe has more than served his dues and a whole host of mid-table Premier League sides should be interested after he exits the club following a second inevitable relegation.",
      "",
      "12) Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)\nSurely retirement will beckon at 38. Unless he thinks he has another World Cup in him…",
      "",
      "11) Ola Aina (Nottingham Forest)\nSurely only a matter of time before Forest tie him down. “I hope so, I really enjoy it here. I enjoy the staff, the players, the club, the community. Everything about it is a good place, so, yeah, hopefully,” he said.",
      "",
      "10) Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\nInitially reluctant to commit himself to the unstable Toffees and will likely have his pick of mid-table Premier League clubs on a free transfer. Tottenham are said to be very predictably interested.",
      "",
      "9) Angel Gomes (Lille)\nThe Lee Carsley England call-up has been linked with a free transfer move back to England but West Ham do not appeal. There has been talk of Roma.",
      "",
      "8) Olivier Boscagli (PSV)\nBrighton were linked with a move for defender Boscagli this summer, while Inter have busied themselves laying down foundations for their approach once his PSV contract expires in the summer.",
      "",
      "7) Tyrick Mitchell (Crystal Palace)\nPalace are reportedly keen to open contract talks with Oliver Glasner’s first-choice left-back. He will expect an increase on his reported £40,00-a-week wages.",
      "",
      "6) Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\nThe departure has already been announced for perhaps Manchester City’s greatest player. MLS seems a likely next career move, though there is some cheeky talk of Liverpool.",
      "",
      "5) Frank Anguissa (Napoli)\nHaving been a regular for Napoli in the two seasons since he joined, Anguissa might expect his terms to be extended. But it also might depend on the mood of Antonio Conte on any given day. Both Manchester City and United have been linked.",
      "",
      "4) Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)\nDid appear to be bound for Bayern Munich until Bayer Leverkusen insisted they wanted over £35m for the German international. Barcelona are among those linked. Because of course they are. And now Real Madrid are said to be interested too.",
      "",
      "3) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nThe talk from Munich was that Bayern would not make Sane a new contract offer until March/April because his performances lacked consistency. And he’s since been named Bayern Player of the Month for March; a contract announcement is imminent.",
      "",
      "2) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool?",
      "",
      "1) Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool)\nWhile Salah and Van Dijk have opted to stay, Trent Alexander-Arnold has confirmed that he will leave Liverpool at the end of the season. He hasn’t said he is going to Real Madrid, but we know he is going to Real Madrid.",

As you can imagine, the Anfield faithful have reacted in a completely normal way and they wish their academy graduate – who has won everything with them – nothing but the best.",
      "There have been some huge players walk on a Bosman over the years and Alexander-Arnold is arguably the biggest ever to depart a Premier League club.",
      "We have picked the biggest free transfer exit for each of the 20 Premier League sides.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: Aaron Ramsey\nIf we did not restrict it to Bosman transfers, there would be a plethora of options for Arsenal. Mesut Ozil, ex-captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and club-record signing at the time Nicolas Pepe all had their contracts terminated, but did not leave on a Jean-Marc.",
      "Ramsey leaving was disappointing but nobody could blame him; the wages Juventus offered him were extraordinary and only a fool would have said no, especially taking into account it is a huge European club he was joining. It’s a shame it didn’t work a hero in two FA Cup finals.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Thomas Hitzlsperger\nRon Vlaar, Brad Friedel, Nigel Reo-Coker and Mark Bosnich were all considered but a wise man once told me, ‘If in doubt, go for Der Hammer’.",
      "The midfielder returned to Germany with Stuttgart following the expiry of his Villa contract in 2005. He did come back to England, signing for West Ham in July 2010 and spending the majority of 2012/13 at Everton.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Jefferson Lerma\nLloyd Kelly might have prevailed through recency bias but Lerma’s departure was hardly ideal for Bournemouth in their preparation for returning to the top flight.",
      "He was a linchpin in the Cherries midfield and has been an inspirational free transfer signing for Crystal Palace.",
      "MORE: Every Premier League club’s best free transfer signing EVER",
      "",
      "Brentford: Christian Eriksen\nIt doesn’t matter that there are barely any options for Brentford because Eriksen is the clear winner.",
      "The ex-Tottenham Hotspur playmaker had to leave Serie A after his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 and Brentford offered him a return to the Premier League, which was perfect in every way. The large Danish contingent would have helped Eriksen settle back into a competitive setting and the Bees were nowhere near bad enough for Eriksen to snub them and not good enough for there to be any chance of making him look out of his depth.",
      "Despite wanting to keep him beyond the six-month contract he signed in January 2022, Brentford could not convince Eriksen to sign and the midfielder went to Manchester United.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Jose Izquierdo\nEnock Mwepu obviously does not count but is worth a mention considering the horrendous circumstances that ended his career while at Brighton.",
      "Albion were a tricky one but we are pretty content with Izquierdo’s inclusion. What a throwback that is, by the way.",
      "Davy Propper was originally our first choice but no Bosman means no inclusion. It threw a spanner in the works when it became clear he was still under contract when he left.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Antonio Rudiger\nThiago Silva, Andreas Christensen, Willian, Joe Cole, Michael Ballack, N’Golo Kante, Hernan Crespo, Nicolas Anelka, Andriy Shevchenko… Chelsea are comfortably the club with the most options.",
      "Losing a prime Antonio Rudiger would have stung though. The German centre-back spent five years at Stamford Bridge before being snapped up by Real Madrid for nothing.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Wilfried Zaha\nNo contest here. Zaha is Palace’s greatest player of all time. He left when his contract expired in the summer of 2023, joining Turkish giants Galatasaray in an ambitious move for Champions League football.",
      "After years of transfer stories linking him with a move to Arsenal, Zaha could not shine in Turkey and was loaned out to French side Lyon after a season. That did not go to plan either and he is now playing under Dean Smith for Charlotte FC in MLS.",
      "",
      "Everton: Wayne Rooney\nObviously not the first time because that was for a transfer fee, but the second time Rooney left Everton is probably their most significant Bosman loss of the Premier League era.",
      "Rooney scored an impressive ten goals in 30 league matches in 2017/18. Not only was his Goodison Park exit felt, but his arrival in the United States to play for D.C. United was as well. He would later go on to manage the MLS side for 453 days.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Tosin Adarabioyo\nFulham screwed the pooch by letting Moussa Dembele join Celtic but that is more of a regret than a big transfer. Tosin Adarabioyo left the Cottagers for west London rivals Chelsea last summer in his prime years. It was gutting for Marco Silva but they have done just fine with Joachim Andersen returning as his replacement.",
      "",
      "Ipswich: Sylvain Legwinski\nIt was always going to be difficult to find someone Ipswich regretfully released while they were a Premier League club and it turns out there was literally nobody worth mentioning. As a result, we have copped out and picked the player with the highest market value on Transfermarkt to leave the Tractor Boys for nothing. That man is Sylvain Legwinski, who departed after the 2007/08 campaign and did not find a club until the following April before spending a few months at St. Neots Town.",
      "",
      "Leicester: Youri Tielemans\nCaglar Soyuncu was an unfortunate loss but nothing comes close to Tielemans’ exit at the end of the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "The Belgian left as a club legend after his FA Cup final winner in 2021. He was linked with Arsenal for bloody ages but ended up joining Aston Villa. After a difficult first year under Unai Emery, Tielemans is back to being one of the best midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Trent Alexander-Arnold\n“Giving everything day in, day out for 20 years, I’ve got to a point now where I feel like I need a new change, a new challenge for me as a player and as a person. And I think now is the right time for me to do that.”",
      "Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool departure has been confirmed and while there was no mention of Real Madrid in the club statement, we all know he is moving to the Spanish capital.",
      "This is a huge loss for Liverpool but from the outside looking in, it’s hard to blame Alexander-Arnold for wanting to spread his wings and challenge for the Ballon d’Or with the biggest club in the world. Good luck to him.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Ilkay Gundogan\nApologies for snubbing Sergio Aguero and Pep Guardiola’s ‘we cannoh replace him’ crocodile tears, but Gundogan is an easy choice. Alongside Erling Haaland, he was probably City’s most important player in their Treble-winning 2022/23 campaign, with his last job as City captain being to lift the Champions League trophy.",
      "The German returned after a year at Barcelona but he isn’t as good anymore. We thought he would be fantastic as well…",
      "In terms of successful free transfer signings, James Milner’s move from City to Liverpool is certainly up there, but that is not what we are looking at so I will shut up.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Paul Pogba\nThe difficult years that followed Peter Schmeichel’s departure in 1999 make him worth an honourable mention at least, but the fact Pogba left on a free transfer twice shades it for him.",
      "Pogba’s time at Manchester United was riddled with discourse. On His Day, he was a world beater. Unfortunately for the Red Devils, he was pretty much only ever On His Day for France.",
      "The best part of it all is obviously that Man United let Pogba join Juventus for nothing in 2012, re-signed him for a world-record £89million four years later, then let him join Juventus for nothing AGAIN in 2022.",
      "United giving him a fat new contract and then losing him to that doping ban might have been overkill, even for them.",
      "",
      "Newcastle: Jonas Gutierrez\nGutierrez’s exit in 2015 was emblematic of what Newcastle were under Mike Ashley’s ownership. The Argentine kept the Magpies in the Premier League after returning to the team following a bout with cancer and ended up being released over the phone by John Carver.",
      "“John Carver rang me and told me the club weren’t going to offer me a new deal,” Ryan Taylor said at the time. “Then he asked me to pass the phone to Jonas, which was unbelievable… I can’t really blame John because he’s under instructions on what to do.”",
      "Classy.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Stuart Pearce\nDespite all the fuss surrounding his arrival, Jesse Lingard was nowhere near good enough to be Forest’s pick, was he?",
      "Psycho was a fair bit older than Lingard but desperate times lead to desperate measures. After spending 12 years at the club, Pearce walked on a Bosman in 1997.",
      "It was a difficult final season for Pearce, who assumed caretaker player-manager duty following Frank Clark’s resignation. The role was eventually shared with Dave Bassett but Forest went down and a 35-year-old Pearce wanted out, joining Newcastle United.",
      "",
      "Southampton: Stuart Armstrong\nWe got a bit stuck. This always happens with our one-per-club features.",

Your Fabrizio Romanos of today would have got in there before Big Sol could rock up for a press conference announcing his astonishing transfer from Spurs to Arsenal in 2001, which left everyone and their nan absolutely shook.",
      "Campbell had previously told fans he was staying but turned down the chance to become Spurs’ highest-paid player to fulfil his dream of playing in the Champions League. There was nothing to indicate Arsenal were even in contention for his signature but stunned journalists witnessed the sensational and iconic unveiling.",

      "Our logic is simple: London lad, been at the club since the age of seven, but most importantly in modern times, was someone the Hammers could have sold for pure profit. Opportunity. Missed.",
      "",

      "It’s lovely to see Shaw back to full fitness and just as Chelsea have done successfully (touch wood) with Reece James, the Red Devils will have to manage his fitness very carefully.

      "No team has accrued more points nor scored more goals against the top seven than Bournemouth – and that includes those sides within it. Their return from games against the teams directly below them have ultimately undermined any Champions League push; both Brentford and Brighton doing the double over them was sub-optimal. But European qualification has been made possible by how effective they have become against the division’s best.",
      "That is pertinent because of a run-in which features the visit of Aston Villa and a trip to Manchester City, neither of which should hold any trepidation for a group which has already won at the Emirates, Old Trafford at St James’ Park this season.",
      "Bournemouth have already broken club records for points and wins in a Premier League campaign, with the bars for goals scored and conceded both almost certain to be beaten. Combine all that by securing their highest-ever finish of eighth and potentially, Europe awaits.",

      "The feeling persists that Iraola might not be able to replicate this success on the shakier foundations which come higher up the ladder with less time and patience, but it remains an entirely tantalising prospect we must one day witness.",
      "It is impressive how the Spaniard seems able to contort himself into fitting numerous different job specifications. When the Spurs links started to formalise he wisely embarked on a winless run which included exiting a cup competition to show his suitability, before undoing Arsenal with set-piece mastery to plant some possible post-Arteta seeds. Neat trick, that.",

      "Their previous Premier League victory over any of Arsenal, Liverpool or Manchester City was so long ago that Thomas Tuchel was the manager, Romelu Lukaku the opening scorer and Roman Abramovich the owner. It was fair to doubt whether Enzo Maresca and his players had the minerals for this Champions League race but three wins on the bounce is a fair riposte.",

Brentford brought Kayode in on loan from Fiorentina in January and have a £14m option to make the deal permanent, which they would be foolish not to execute. It is already difficult to think of many better signings this season.",
      "After an inevitably slow integration, the Italy youth international has found his stride. Three Premier League starts have coincided with Brentford’s first run of three consecutive Premier League wins of the season and his stated aim of “helping them reach European competitions next season” is alive.",
      "It was Kayode ugly for Manchester United but beautiful to watch a 20-year-old acclimatise so seamlessly to the league, setting up Yoane Wissa’s goal, misplacing one pass and completing more than twice as many dribbles as any other player at the Gtech.",

      "Manchester City’s old guard\nIt has been difficult to separate baby from bathwater when examining what should be thrown out at Manchester City this season, but this surge to their longest winning run of the campaign to cap what might be an outwardly respectable second-placed Premier League finish with an FA Cup winner’s medal does suggest that an element of restraint is necessary.",
      "Kevin de Bruyne bowing out from the club with a fine impression of his former unparalleled self should not shake the foundations of what is the fair decision to allow his contract to expire. This form and fitness might be sustainable and a post-Etihad career flourish could make Manchester City look foolish. But it is not a gamble even the impossibly rich should overthink if there is to be any sort of emphasis on building for the future.",
      "His final gift has been to hold Manchester City’s hand into the Champions League after this campaign’s substantial scare, simultaneously displaying himself in the shop window for those interested in parting with a ludicrous signing-on fee and wage.",
      "Bernardo Silva said that “a little bit of the soul of this team is going” with De Bruyne and it reinforces the belief that despite the Portuguese’s own personal struggles, he should be persuaded to stay for yet another year before his own deal expires in 2026. Pep Guardiola would surely prefer not to lose the two most-used players in his entire managerial career over the course of one summer, with decisions to come soon enough on Ilkay Gundogan and Mateo Kovacic too.",
      "The manager recently admitted his reluctance to use the club’s inexperienced academy graduates in this season’s more difficult moments was a mistake. A happy medium can be found, like Nico O’Reilly further embedding himself in a side anchored by that spine containing four 30-something midfield pass masters who have helped Manchester City rediscover their identity before they make necessary moves to update and improve it.",

      "Almost 300 players have played 1,000 minutes in the Premier League this season and Enciso ranks first of those for shots per 90 (4.12). Those numbers are skewed only slightly by a productive first half of the season at Brighton; the Paraguayan’s shots per 90 for Ipswich sandwich him between Mo Salah and Alexander Isak as an outlier among the league’s biggest strugglers.",
      "It would be no surprise to see Ipswich and McKenna learn from this season’s harsh lessons to return to this level soon; far more shocking would be if Enciso isn’t back immediately, shooting from ridiculous positions and earning weirdly respectful handshakes from a beaten Jordan Pickford.",
      "",
      "Newcastle had made a decent fist of that balance by simply winning 20 of their last 26 matches and losing the rest. That all-or-nothing approach ended their trophy drought and made Champions League qualification a live possibility.",
      "Only 11 teams in Premier League history had ever gone longer without a draw than Newcastle, who finally made sure they followed their manager’s advice and didn’t lose on one of the increasingly rare occasions when victory was not possible.",
      "A first draw for five months in any competition could be crucial, keeping the Magpies above Chelsea and Nottingham Forest regardless of their results in this tireless race. Avoiding a ruinous seasonal hat-trick of losses in the Yankuba Minteh/Dan Burn/James Milner/Chris Wood/Aaron Hughes/Tim Krul/Dan Ashworth derby was just a welcome bonus.",

      "Mats Wieffer\nNot, it seems, a right-back.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nIt was, in some ways, ideal preparation. Bournemouth are as similar a Premier League team to PSG as Arsenal could wish to play, uber-aggressive in the press with numerous different ways of hurting an opponent. But equally Mikel Arteta might have preferred to face any other side in between those semi-final legs.",
      "The idea was sound enough, going basically full-strength to build momentum, rhythm and confidence. The potentially season-shattering risk of an avoidable, belief-shattering defeat to an excellent side was the trade-off and while PSG themselves were beaten at the weekend by Strasbourg, they made ten changes to the starting XI which conquered the Emirates and will be fresh at the Parc des Princes.",
      "Arteta can only try to harness this and it might be that the “rage, anger, frustration and a bad feeling in the tummy” is actually what Arsenal need to pull them through and into the Champions League final.",
      "Yet the Gunners have not looked so vulnerable in as many different areas in some time, from set-piece defending to lead-squandering.",
      "The very real and very funny prospect of Arsenal failing to qualify for the Champions League while Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle, Chelsea and one of Manchester United or Spurs all win a trophy and reach the European Promised Land is on, and it starts with Nottingham Forest beating Crystal Palace on Monday night.",
      "",
      "Fulham\nMarco Silva seethed at Aston Villa’s time-wasting and an apparent refereeing conspiracy to undermine Fulham’s excellence by booking both himself and five of his players. But the fizzling out of what was almost an incredible season has been down to the fundamental flaws in his approach more than anything.",
      "It is a perfect summary of the fine margins Silva relies on that Fulham have had 18 games decided either way by a single goal in the Premier League this season, and they have won nine and lost nine of them. While it guarantees safety – which is an achievement a recently promoted club should not take for granted – it also places a ceiling on what Fulham can do. It inhibits them as much as it enhances them.",
      "That is why Fulham’s longest winning run matches their worst losing streak of two games, why they have had consecutive Premier League victories only once since November, why they can beat the distant champions and by far worst team in the division in between four defeats to clubs in the Premier League’s hard-boiled centre.",
      "It is also quite weird that Fulham have now ended two games this season with ten men despite not having someone sent off, with an injury suffered after all their substitutes were made. Not sure Emi Martinez can be blamed for that.",
      "",
      "Manchester United\nRuben Amorim cannot specifically be faulted for honouring the established trope of Premier League teams chucking out the kids to prepare for big European games.",
      "But the idea that Manchester United can actively sacrifice their Premier League season without severe censure feels doubly cowardly. It’s as if they think them giving up on it meaning anything in a material sense pre-emptively counteracts criticism or scrutiny. And when ruthless redundancies are being made, the haemorrhaging of potential prize money is an absolutely atrocious look.",
      "In any event, a ludicrously expensive squad and coach should be able to hold their own and at the very least have an identifiable style, no matter how many changes are wrought. Never allow Manchester United being this abysmal to be normalised, accepted or forgotten.",
      "",
      "Everton\nIf you don’t love David Moyes at his nine-game unbeaten streak, you don’t deserve him at his run of one win in ten games which has neatly overlapped.",
      "It does feel as though the second wedding’s honeymoon is over, that the bloom is off the rose somewhat and Everton have slipped back into their worst habits. And when their worst habits were established at the start of the season as proving 2-0 to indeed be the most dangerous lead, that isn’t ideal.",
      "Their relative ease in sweeping into a two-goal lead over Ipswich underlined how much better than the bottom three they are, but the implosion to hand Ipswich their first points from a losing position since November emphasised the work that needs to be done to steer Everton in the right direction next season.",
      "Moyes has earned the opportunity to oversee these steps into a brave new era but he will know that performance and more generally the last few weeks have not really been good enough.",
      "Sean Dyche was sacked for a run of two wins, seven draws and four defeats; Moyes is currently on two wins, seven draws and three defeats and saying “we controlled the game” after being outshot eight to 12 at home to a relegated team sounds eerily like his predecessor.",
      "",
      "Southampton\nAfter all that it really could come down to goal difference. Southampton (-57) have some wiggle room over Derby 2007/08 (-69) but Manchester City, Arsenal and Everton’s final game at Goodison Park keeps the drama alive heading into the final weeks.",
      "One record will almost certainly fall. Four sides share the honour of having lost 29 games in a Premier League season. Southampton are on 28 and have just had the league double done over them by the next-worst team. It’s not looking great.",
      "",
      "Liverpool when crowned champions\nLiverpool have played eight games as newly-crowned Premier League champions in 2019/20 and 2024/25 and they should be ashamed by a cigar-puffing, beach-dwelling, slipper-wearing record of W4 D1 L3 F16 A15.",
      "Bournemouth were wining 1-0 at the time of Evanilson’s red card before conceding a late equaliser to Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca will serve a touchline ban during their Champions League qualification race after getting booked against Fulham.",
      "Clinton Morrison doubts Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou “will be in a job on Saturday” if they lose to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday.",

      "Man Utd are closing in on their first summer departure with Atletico Madrid ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils allowed the Brazil international to leave Old Trafford and move to Real Betis on loan until the end of the season in the winter transfer window.",
      "Man Utd spent around £87m on Antony in the summer of 2022 but he made very little impact in his two-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony contributed just five Premier League goals and three assists in 62 appearances with the 25-year-old making no league starts this season before the Red Devils offloaded him to Betis.",
      "But the Brazilian has been impressing in La Liga with the winger contributing six goals and two assists in 19 matches in all competitions for the Spanish outfit.",
      "Real Betis have been keen to make the move permanent in summer with Man Utd hoping to permanently remove him from their books.",
      "And now reports in Spain claim that Atletico Madrid are ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony with the Spanish understood to have ‘submitted a €40 million offer to Manchester United to secure his services.’",
      "Real Betis ‘hoped to negotiate a permanent purchase at the end of the season’ but rivals Atletico Madrid ‘has preemptively made a compelling offer that has convinced United’.",
      "Atletico have been ‘monitoring the Brazilian player’s progress for weeks’ and manager Diego Simeone is ‘convinced that Antony can provide the speed and directness his team needs to make a competitive leap forward in both LaLiga and the Champions League’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The 40 million euro offer from the Red and Whites, presented in the last few hours, has been welcomed by Manchester United, who are willing to part with the player for a sum that allows them to recoup part of the initial investment made when they signed him from Ajax. The deal, in financial terms, is very close to being finalized, and talks are expected to progress rapidly in the coming weeks.’",
      "Real Betis are ‘unable to compete financially with Atletico’s financial muscle’ and the Verdiblancos had hoped their ‘good relationship with the player and with the United team could facilitate a more affordable negotiation’.",
      "And now it looks likely that Atletico Madrid will complete a ‘luxury addition’ for next season and the potential signing of Antony ‘could be one of the first major moves of what promises to be a busy summer at the Metropolitano headquarters’.",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen recently advised Antony to stay at Real Betis as he “has no future” at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is eyeing two Real Betis players as the Red Devils ‘propose a swap deal’ in a £25.5m ‘discount’ for Antony.",
      "Man Utd are hoping to include a Real Betis player in any deal they strike for Antony in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd plan on spending the money they receive from Atletico Madrid for Antony on Borussia Dortmund star Jamie Gittens, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘received’ a huge offer to sell Brazil international Antony with his form for Real Betis ‘not going unnoticed’.",
      "Arsenal are hopeful that they can get a deal for Man Utd flop Antony wrapped up ‘as soon as possible’, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are ‘confident’ that they will find a buyer willing to pay £40m for Antony in the summer transfer window, according to reports."

      "Arteta and Art class…\nHaving attended Art class, I found Andy H, Swansea’s entry fairly persuasive, but I have to reject one of his premises, i.e., that Arsenal were a “pratfalling mess” when Mikel Arteta arrived.",
      "I think that Andy’s assessment of Arteta’s performance is reasonably fair in itself, but Arsene Wenger’s final league finish was sixth, not fourteenth or seventeenth. A team finishing sixth in any EPL season is hardly a team doing pratfalls. They were a club with a legendary manager who led the Invincibles and transformed English football…which, in return, grew beyond him.",
      "They had plenty of talent when Arteta arrived, if some of it had been misused. They were in no sense a mess; they just needed a new coach. Maybe they needed one a couple of years earlier, but I don’t really know, as I’m not Stewie Griffin*. Arteta has improved them, no doubt, but he hardly applied CPR.",
      "I deleted a whole nostalgic paragraph about having driven for two and a half hours to see Newcastle lose an FA Cup final and Why I Don’t Hate Arsenal, but I was only belabouring things.",
      "On the other hand, five and a half years of watching Mikel Arteta at Arsenal have taught me to detest Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. I have Mailbox form here, as it were, and won’t belabour my beef either, though I will repeat that I always liked him as a player.",
      "But the fact remains that, whatever his failings, Arteta is at the very least a good coach who can really nail it against an opponent like Real Madrid once in a while. He has beaten a lot of good coaches, whatever his transfer market failures. If I were an Arsenal supporter, I think I’d be ambivalent. The wrong upgrade could be disastrous.",
      "Perhaps handing over a bit of transfer control would benefit him. Maybe he should be telling the board and Director what he wants, not who he wants, and let the scouts, the stattos and Edu go find it.",
      "All that said, my club’s won exactly one real pot in my 30 years of support, and it still feels like yesterday. Fans of some clubs think it’s an utter shambles, a travesty of justice, the end of the world when their club don’t win at least one trophy in any given season. It’s beyond me. My expectations just aren’t calibrated the way “big club” supporters I read here or in the socials.",

That’s pretty good, Man City were very slightly better over 38 games so they won the league. We all know Man City have been an unprecedented level of dominance in the league since well before Arteta joined Arsenal for various sporting reasons – even ignoring the 115 stuff they are strongest club by far.",

I am excluding domestic cups and European competitions apart from the Champions League because they don’t count in these conversations. Winning an FA Cup would not change people’s position – “ah but he can’t win the league” etc…besides, just ask Ten Hag or David Moyes whether these comps are enough to keep your job on their own. Critics like to tout the cups as a stick to beat Arteta but would not allow winning them as a defense. They are very nice though but small beer apparently – so onwards!",

      "Rio Ferdinand\nI don’t really like Rio Ferdinand on comms, for many reasons but you can’t question his talent as footballer. An absolute Rolls Royce of a defender. He played alongside Vidic? Yep, and they complemented each other perfectly. Rio was the best centre back of the noughties in the Premier League (lots of fashionable foreign defenders then too). Better on the ball and still less of a bellend than John Terry. He’d be equally lauded today as then if he was playing now. Ball playing centre backs are not a modern phenomenon either (Bobby Moore?). If I didn’t support United I’d say Van Dijk was better (almost as if you combined Vidic and Rio) but I do so I’ll stick by my man.",
      "I also completely agree with J. Nicholson about the embarrassment of United and Spurs pissing the Europa League. But it’s UEFA that should be embarrassed. It all started when they let runners up join the Champions League (literally adding losers ruins the name a bit). What we have now is a European Super League by stealth supported by two lesser European competitions which act as a safety net for teams like United who struggle to qualify the proper way. Much like VAR, we can never go back.",
      "And finally, there is so much nuance to some of the issues that are constantly debated in these hallowed pages and that affect our wonderful game. That nuance is above the heads of at least 50% of people that we end up in situations where trans people have nowhere to play football (or any sport really) and a young(ish) black woman loses her job for “clumsy” comments about an important issue. Aluko was wrong about Wright (I think) but the men’s game has been hostile to women (it was men that banned it for fifty years so fight me) and there is a representational imbalance which has been ignored in the fallout.\nAshmundo",

      "Let’s get this out of the way first; Rio is an absolutely diabolical pundit/co-commentator. I actually muttered “f**k’s sake…” when they announced he’d “made his way up to the gantry” 2 minutes into the game last night.",
      "However, Hartley in the Mailbox needs to go and wash his mouth out with soap and water for questioning him as a player. I’ve seen lots of great centre backs at United, from Bruce and Pallister, to Stam and Johnsen and then Vidic and Rio. Rio was the best of the lot and it’s not particularly close. Tall, quick, strong, great on the ball; I’d argue he’s the best centre back in Premier League history. Unfortunately, he became injury prone around 30 which is when centre halves often get the most plaudits.",
      "I’d argue he’s criminally underrated, and any United fan that knows their onions will tell you Rio covered up for Vidic, not the other way round. Vidic got mountains of praise because he’d throw himself in front of anything and came across as a warrior for the fans. That’s why he was loved. Rio did “merks” and missed drug tests, and generally came across as a bit of a knob.",
      "As was referenced elsewhere in the mailbox, likability is a really important factor in shaping public opinion, and no one really likes Rio, myself included, but you need to separate the man from the player. He was an absolutely top tier defender. See also, Terry, John.\nLewis, Busby Way",

Perhaps best to say he might have been better off getting away from it all before it kicked off, but who knows. Alcohol and youth often exacerbate things, I certainly cant throw stones from my glass house on that one.",
      "From a football perspective, he’s played the game as best he can. He can’t do any more than that. People slag him for being slow ….. well that’s just him, it’s not his fault – some guy paying £80m for you doesn’t suddenly make you run faster. But – he’s given it his all every time he steps on the pitch. He’s faced the criticism head-on and come back stronger, accepting his weaknesses. He’s accepted a new system under this new manager, knuckled down and got on with it. And for that, I tip my hat and say well played, kudos to him. Seeing him score the winner against Lyon, and then dicking all over the Bilbao fullback like a top end winger was a pleasure, and I couldnt be happier for the guy. If half the Man Utd squad had the bollocks and spine that he had, the club would be in a far better position than it currently is.",
      "A little aside on Hartley MCFC. I agree Rio is by no means the greatest commentator/pundit in the modern game. But to use that as a reason to start questioning his ability as a footballer during his career, is a little ridiculous, no? I mean, Sir Alex Ferguson, one of the greatest managers of all time, saw fit to go and get him and make him the heart of his defence for 12 years.

      "“I’d play Lisandro Martinez as the left-sided centre-back. I would play Leny Yoro as the right-sided centre-back as he has got the pace to cover in the wide areas, and then Amorim has got a decision to make whether it will be Harry Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt,” Pallister told GIVEMESPORT.",
      "“I think they’re both more attuned to playing in the middle of the three, because I don’t think they’re blessed with great pace, but they read the game really well, and they’re confident on the ball.",
      "“I would choose from either of them two, and then I think it’s about getting your wing-backs sorted as well. Patrick Dorgu has had an alright start and Diogo Dalot has been there for a number of years and does a good job there.”",
      "At present, it would seem harsh to rip Maguire out of the side. He has had to work very hard to get his game back in a good place, after being stripped of the captaincy by former boss Erik ten Hag and regularly being left on the bench by the Dutchman.",
      "Maguire has been particularly heroic in the Europa League campaign this season. United were minutes from being dumped out by Lyon in the quarter-finals, but a Maguire header completed a fantastic comeback in a 7-6 aggregate win.",
      "He had earlier assisted United’s second goal in the second leg. In the first leg of the semi-final, the defender showed his qualities as a winger, skinning a defender twice before placing an inch perfect cross on Manuel Ugarte’s head, who glanced it across to Casemiro for the opening goal.",
      "United won that game 3-0, and Maguire helped to set the tone. His rebirth up top has been such that we believe he could rival Rasmus Hojlund for a spot there – that would end discourse about him being dropped at the back!",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Harry Maguire was the hero against Lyon while Rasmus Hojlund did sweet f-all once again. Here are ten reasons Amorim should start the centre-back up top for Man Utd.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire called out ‘inconsistent’ performances during a ‘disappointing’ season as the club prepare to face Lyon in the Europa League.",
      "Manchester United will be without defender Matthijs de Ligt for the visit of Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has provided an injury update, with two of his players “ready” to return against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has hit out at Mikel Arteta for storming out of an interview after Arsenal drew 1-1 with the Red Devils on Sunday."

      "Manchester United have reportedly moved ‘one step closer’ to being able to land a ‘serious target’ for the midfield, and are ‘confident’ of the price they’ll have to pay.",
      "United have had a woeful time of it in the Premier League this season. They’re 14th in the league, having won just 10 of their 34 games so far.",
      "But in Europe, things are heating up for the Red Devils. They were about six minutes away from being dumped out of the Europa League in the quarter-finals when Lyon were 6-4 up on aggregate, before Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire turned the game on its head in the final few minutes.",
      "Indeed, they won 7-6 on aggregate in stoppage time, reaching the semis, where they thumped Athletic Club 3-0 in the first leg, putting themselves in a strong position to reach the final. United’s advancement in Europe will only help them in terms of transfers.",
      "According to GIVEMESPORT, they have ‘moved one step closer’ to the signing of Atalanta midfielder Ederson ‘thanks to having one foot’ in the Europa League final.",
      "Indeed, winning the competition would ‘put them in a better position to meet Atalanta’s financial demands’. The winners of the Europa League will get a boost of around £11million, and the runners-up around £6million, which would help towards any signings.",
      "Ederson is said to be a ‘serious target’, and he’s about to enter the final two years of his deal. United know the lack of a financial boost would hinder their attempts to sign him, but they are ‘confident’ he can be secured for below £50million.",
      "As such, the Red Devils could potentially pay more than a fifth of the transfer fee with money they don’t currently have, but will have earned if they win the Europa League.",
      "It is also believed the midfielder – who played in nine Champions League games this season – is ‘more likely to have his head turned’ by the prospect of an Old Trafford move if they gain a spot in the elite European competition. That would be the case if they won the Europa League.",
      "There is said to be a desire from United to enter negotiations over the transfer in the coming months, and silverware could be the catalyst."

      "The 3-1 defeat at Chelsea will do little to trouble Liverpool as they celebrated their deserved title. But if anyone was questioning what Arne Slot's side may have looked like with a few injuries, then that performance was it.",
      "There were probably some party-related reasons for Liverpool's flat performance and a lower intensity than normal, but Arne Slot wanted to use these final four games to help him plan for the summer. Those he brought into the team at Stamford Bridge failed to impress.",
      "The entire midfield was changed and the trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott could not cope with their Chelsea counterparts, notably Romeo Lavia and Cole Palmer who ran the show.",
      "Jones slipped in the build-up to Chelsea's first, Elliott was hauled off after the Blues' second - and Endo showed he, at 32, will struggle to replicate what Ryan Gravenberch did brilliantly all season.",
      "At the top end of the pitch, Diogo Jota was anonymous with just 13 touches - he has one league goal in 2025 - while Darwin Nunez missed two good openings after coming on. At least he managed one more touch than Jota.",
      "None had a worse outing though than Jarell Quansah, with one own goal and one penalty conceded in a disappointing and unconvincing display at centre-half, one that was reminiscent of his opening-day struggles at Ipswich.",
      "Liverpool will not stand still this summer and rest on their laurels. The club want to be busy in the transfer market and strengthen their squad to compete again next season and develop the next title-winning team.",
      "And with Kostas Tsimikas failing to ease Liverpool's left-back woes, that looks like four areas Liverpool could strengthen this summer. Left-back, centre-back, midfield and striker - and don't forget a right-back if Trent Alexander-Arnold departs, as expected.Sam Blitz",
      "Bilbao or bust has been the mantra at Manchester United for some time. Watching them fall to a 16th league defeat of the season as they lost 4-3 at Brentford, their most for 35 years, made that abundantly clear. But there is something more behind their struggles.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the third-youngest team in Premier League history at Brentford. Considering United's recent domestic form, and the eight changes made after Thursday's win over Athletic Club, defeat was almost inevitable, strange as that sounds.",
      "Everything, understandably, is focused on the Europa League. That doesn't answer the question of why United, the only undefeated side in European competition, haven't beaten a team that will be playing top-flight football next season since January 26.",
      "Since that 1-0 win at Fulham, sealed thanks to Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike, United have played 10 teams outside the bottom three and failed to win against any of them. They still had a round left of the Europa League league phase after that win.",
      "Meanwhile, in Europe United have overcome Real Sociedad and Lyon. Barring a shock collapse, not something you would put past this group, you can add Athletic Club to that list. Then they are one game from a European trophy. Puzzling.",
      "The defeat at Brentford, although not the fairest game to draw conclusions from, served up a perfect example of the problems plaguing Amorim in the Premier League: United were simply unable to cope with Brentford's physicality, pace and direct football.",
      "Regardless of who was picked, as this season has shown us, those same vulnerabilities would remain.",
      "Amorim has inherited a squad ill-equipped to cope with the rigours of English football. Those squad-building missteps must be corrected this summer, particularly if Champions League qualification is secured, otherwise Amorim will see no improvement.Zinny Boswell",
      "Alexander Isak must have felt like his moment would never come in Newcastle's 1-1 draw at Brighton. Twice he had picked up the ball thinking he was about to have a free shot at goal from 12 yards after referee Craig Pawson had pointed to the spot. VAR ruined Newcastle's fun by spotting two incorrect calls from Pawson so it was looking like one of those days for Isak and his team.",
      "But one more chance would come on 89 minutes when Pawson finally correctly spotted a legitimate penalty and Isak was in no mood to pass it up.",
      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "After United won the first leg of their Europa League semi-final 3-0 against Athletic Club on Thursday, Amorim rung the changes and named the third-youngest starting XI in Premier League history.",
      "Sensing an opportunity as a result, Brentford pressed high from the off and should have been ahead when a Luke Shaw and Altay Bayindir mix-up led to the former almost heading past his own goalkeeper.",

      "There was a brief boost when Mason Mount slid Alejandro Garnacho's cross home against the run of play, but the Bees deservedly levelled when Mikkel Damsgaard poked a shot that hit the unfortunate Shaw, then Bayindir, then the net.",
      "Within five minutes, the turnaround was complete. Man Utd switched off, wanting play to be paused when Matthijs de Ligt went down with a leg injury after a tangle with Yoane Wissa, but referee Anthony Taylor played on, so Christian Norgaard was able to pick out Kevin Schade to head home.",
      "Only a last-ditch save from Bayindir to keep out Norgaard's connection on Damsgaard's free-kick prevented it becoming three before the break.",
      "United started the second half well, but found themselves further behind when Schade headed in a peach of a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, before the impressive Michael Kayode squared for Wissa to roll home and make it 4-1, with the goal confirmed after a VAR review.",
      "Garnacho hit a stunner from the edge of the box, before Amad's strike deflected off Sepp van den Berg to make it 4-3 and set up a tense finale, but Brentford held on for their third win in succession as their positive end to the campaign continues.",
      "Brentford head coach Thomas Frank:",
      "\"Basically, from the first year in the division, we respect everyone but fear no one. We believe that we can win every game.",
      "\"We try to go for that win. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we really, really, really believe it every single time. The players are fantastic. It is a fantastic group to work with.",
      "\"We spoke about it [Europe] before the Brighton game. I rarely say that to the players as it's more about performance, but [I said] this game, we need to win. We have to win this if we want to be in with any chance of maybe having a dream about Europe. And the players did that, big credit to them.",
      "\"Then we played a difficult away game to Nottingham Forest, beat them, home to Man Utd, beat them. And all three wins, well deserved.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"I think it reflected our season. We started quite well, controlling the game, not creating big chances but controlling the pace of the game. We suffered a lot with the throw-ins and set-pieces but we already knew that our team would struggle against this team.",
      "\"We didn't have the height necessary for this kind of game. They scored twice in this kind of moments, even with De Ligt on the floor.",
      "\"And then in the second half I felt that we were near the draw and then we suffered a goal and like some other times we disconnected. And then another goal, almost three minutes, five minutes later. And then we pushed forward, tried to score, we scored twice but we didn't have the time to do better.\"",
      "On playing youngsters: \"They have to understand this season is really important also to understand that we cannot do this anymore. Of course, we know the context, but this kind of season we need to change that. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They are not playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.",
      "\"I think we can help the young kids even more, especially Tyler Fredricson did quite well in the third goal. He needs more help from Amad. So these small things I think we can help them more, but I'm really happy with the performance of the young kids.\"",
      "On De Ligt's injury: \"We don't know what will happen with De Ligt. If we don't have Luke Shaw available on Thursday we could have a problem and then we don't have enough defenders for the game. We had to protect some players at half-time, thinking about Thursday. So it was just that, not about thinking about the game.\""

      "Sunday 4 May 2025 16:50, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",

      "Friday 2 May 2025 09:22, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United earned a commanding lead in their Europa League semi-final with a shock 3-0 first-leg victory at 10-player Athletic Club.",
      "United were three up at half-time after breaching Europe's tightest home defence at the Estadio de San Mames, where the LaLiga side hadn't lost since August.",
      "It took something special to unlock Athletic Club when Harry Maguire momentarily turned into a winger, showing quick feet on the right before crossing into the near post for Manuel Ugarte, who flicked the ball on for Casemiro to head home the opener in the 30th minute.",
      "Athletic Club: Agirrezabala (6); De Marcos (5), Vivian (3), Alvarez (5), Berchiche (5); Jauregizar (5), Galarreta (5); I. Williams (5), Berenguer (5), N. Williams (5); Sannadi (5).\n\n\nSubs: Gorosabel (6), Paredes (6), Diaz (6), Gomez (6), Djalo (n/a)\n\nMan Utd: Onana (7); Yoro (7), Maguire (8), Lindelof (7); Mazraoui (7), Ugarte (7), Casemiro (8), Dorgu (7); Fernandes (9), Hojlund (6), Garnacho (7). \n\n\nSubs: De Ligt (6), Mount (5), Shaw (6), Mainoo (n/a), Amad (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bruno Fernandes",
      "The entire tie changed within seven minutes after Rasmus Hojlund was pulled back by Dani Vivian when he tried to reach a low cross in the six-yard box. The referee sent the Athletic Club centre-back off and awarded United a penalty, which Fernandes cooly dispatched, after consulting the pitchside monitor.",
      "Athletic Club made two substitutions to try and halt United's momentum, but Fernandes added a third before the half was finished, slotting home from Ugarte's clever backheel to put the visitors in dreamland.",
      "United eased off in the second half with a controlled performance to prevent the hosts from finding anyway back into the tie.",
      "Casemiro went close to his second of the night, hitting a post with a header at a corner before Fernandes and Garnacho both had shots parried by goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala.",
      "There was a further positive for United as Amad Diallo came off the bench to make his first appearance since early February ahead of the second leg at Old Trafford next Thursday.",
      "\"The result is really good. But we have to understand it too - we struggled a lot at the start. The goal and red card changed the game, but that's a good thing with a little bit of luck. We kept ourselves in the game, and anything can change with the right situation.",
      "\"We had the chances to score one more, but this is not done. The same result can happen at Old Trafford, and we need to be prepared.",
      "On Maguire's cross for the first goal: \"We all have moments where everything we do in our lives seems wrong, and everything Harry does right now is good for the team.\"",
      "\"Of course it's a great start, to get a victory here and score three goals and with a clean sheet.",
      "\"All the pressure will be on us, everyone'll be expecting us to go through.",
      "\"We need to prepare properly, and if we do that we'll give ourselves a great chance.",

      "Friday 2 May 2025 12:47, UK",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim admitted \"nobody expected\" the magnitude of their 3-0 Europa League semi-final first leg win at Athletic Club but insisted the tie was still not over ahead of next week's return match.",
      "His side became only the third to win at San Mames since August and inflicted the joint-biggest defeat on their hosts at the stadium in over a decade, putting one foot in the Europa League final at the same stadium later this month - where they look likely to meet Premier League rivals Tottenham.",
      "United weathered an early storm from the hosts but took the lead through Casemiro's header, and then played much of the game with a man advantage after centre-back Dani Vivian conceded a penalty and was sent off for pulling back Rasmus Hojlund in his own box.",
      "Despite scoring three goals in the final 15 minutes of the opening period, the one criticism of the visitors' performance was that they did not manage to add to their advantage and kill off the tie as a contest.",
      "Man Utd are the only remaining team unbeaten in Europe this season, in stark contrast to their Premier League campaign where they have lost 15 of 34 league games - but even so, the head coach had not been expecting such an emphatic victory in the Basque country.",
      "\"It's the best result because nobody expected this result,\" he said. \"But you saw two games today - the first 25 minutes and then, after the goal and the sending-off, the game changed.",
      "\"In the second half, we tried to be cautious and we created chances but the most important thing is the opponent didn't get many shots on our goal.",
      "\"We've improved in the last games. I don't look just at the results. We had some games that we won that we didn't play well and some games we lost but played well. Sometimes you need a little bit of luck.",
      "\"In the first 30 minutes, they had chances to score. If they score, it's a different game. When we scored, we felt more free to play.",
      "\"It's hard to understand but sometimes it's the context. We can win this competition. In the Premier League, we are suffering game after game. We try to manage both things with some injuries. Sometimes it's hard, even for the players.\"",
      "Amorim sounded a note of caution despite the size of Man Utd's victory, and the meteoric collapse which would be required for them to be eliminated.",
      "Of 133 previous first-leg away wins by three goals in European knock-out ties, all 133 teams have progressed to the next round.",
      "Hojlund could not add to the last-gasp equaliser he netted at Bournemouth at the weekend but did put in a strong shift leading the line for United, proving an agile target man while also showing far better positional awareness than he has in recent games.",
      "Amorim has kept faith with the beleaguered striker through his prolonged struggles this season, in part due to a lack of senior alternatives, and gave him a vote of confidence following his performance in Thursday's game.",
      "\"It was the best game he had with me as coach,\" he said. \"He helped the team a lot. He secured the ball and made runs. It was a good moment for him but like Harry (Maguire) he needs to understand everything can change so let's focus on the next one. This one is in the past.\""
