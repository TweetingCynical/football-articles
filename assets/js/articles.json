      "Manchester United's meeting with Arsenal is the headline clash on the Premier League's opening weekend but up to six players could miss the contest at Old Trafford with the hosts sweating on the fitness of Andre Onana.",
      "The goalkeeper has been missing throughout pre-season and has long been in a race against time to get back for the first game of the season. A hamstring issue has sidelined him, leaving Altay Bayindir to step in during the interim period.",
      "The Turkish shotstopper may have to continue against the Gunners, the team he performed heroics against in an FA Cup final win last year. But earlier this month Onana issued a positive update and suggested he could play. He said: “I feel good, I feel great. It’s been a few difficult weeks, but yeah, hopefully, I will be back for the start of the season.”",
      "Ruben Amorim stands to be without several members of his defensive unit with Lisandro Martinez still injured. The Argentine has struggled for fitness for some time and whilst he travelled to the US for pre-season, no timeframe is given on his return.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui hasn't been pictured in training for some time after being forced off at half-time during United’s pre-season opener against Leeds in Stockholm last month. His injury has not been specified but his lack of appearance does not spell good news.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, one player who has been linked with a move away from Manchester amid all the new faces in attack, is touch and go to play against the Gunners. The Dutchman claimed in July that he was targeting his return for the opening game.",
      "Arsenal meanwhile, who drew this fixture last season, will want to get off to the best possible start with Mikel Arteta's side potentially including a number of their new recruits. Viktor Gyokeres is likely to lead the line, which is a plus given Gabriel Jesus remains sidelined with a serious knee injury.",
      "The Brazilian has been out since the early part of 2025 and it meant Arsenal were struggling for players to spearhead their attack, motivating their pursuit of Gyokeres. Leandro Trossard is one player who has done that when required but the Belgian too is struggling for fitness.",
      "He was absent from the squad on Saturday as Arsenal beat Athletic Bilbao 3-0 in their final pre-season friendly, but Arteta is quietly confident he could him available. “He had a little niggle in the groin - but he should be fine,\" said the Arsenal boss.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Premier League chief executive Richard Masters insists there are no plans to play a top-flight match abroad, maintaining \"it's not a debate around our table\", after La Liga announced its intention to take Barcelona's clash with Villarreal in December to Miami.",
      "England's competition is the most popular globally but all of the matches are played in the UK and that is not set to change. Italy, alongside Spain, have signalled their plan to take a domestic match abroad and are seeking permission from FIFA and UEFA.",
      "It could mean that the Serie A sees AC Milan and Como facing off in Perth, Australia in February. Other one-off matches like the Italian Super Cup and Spanish Super Cup have also been played abroad in recent years.",
      "The Premier League is much more driven by tradition as opposed to some of the other major sporting competitions. Staging NFL games outside of America is now common practice and hugely lucrative but that is not currently on the agenda from a football stand point.",
      "Masters told the BBC: \"I don't think it changes the Premier League's view on this at all, we don't have any plans to play matches abroad. It's not anywhere near my in-tray and it's not a debate around our table.\"",
      "The idea of the Premier League playing an extra round - which became known as the '39th game' - outside England was raised in 2008 but those plans were binned amid huge backlash from fans.",
      "Former Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claimed a decade ago that clubs were keen on the idea, but Masters insists that is not forthcoming despite the amount of American interest in the Premier League. There are 11 US-owned clubs in the top flight, putting them close to the two-thirds majority of 14 that is needed to bring about changes to the Premier League's rules.",
      "Masters added: \"The first thing to say is it hasn't happened yet. You need a whole bunch of things to happen. The Premier League flirted with this over a decade ago and the reason was to grow the league internationally and we were able to do this through different means - digital means, broadcast partners, concepts like the summer series in the US. The necessity that was driving that concept has dissipated.\"",
      "Last year, Liverpool chairman Tom Werner told the Financial Times he hoped to see Premier League games played in New York, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Riyadh and Rio de Janeiro. However, Bournemouth's American owner Bill Foley has said he does not support staging league matches abroad.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has tipped Liverpool for the title and his old side for a Premier League resurgence under Ruben Amorim. However, he believes the Red Devils are one or two bodies short going into the new season.",
      "United kick off their season at home to Arsenal on Sunday and are eager to bounce back from a dismal 15th-place finish last season, which represented their worst Premier League campaign. But with new signings Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha bolstering their attack, there's a sense of optimism for a fresh start.",
      "\"I still think they [United] need one or two more signings,\" said the Old Trafford icon. \"But I think you can see what Amorim is doing. I think it's looking better for Manchester United, and I think they will sneak into the top five. I hope they do, you never know.\"",
      "Laurens was quick to tease Rooney about his obvious bias given his 559 appearances for United. The Red Devils face a monumental challenge in regaining their Champions League credentials, especially after consecutive seasons of setting new records for new all-time worst league finishes.",
      "\"Who did you play for again?\" quipped Laurens, leaving Rooney and the rest of the panel in stitches over his potentially biased perspective. Despite his Everton and United roots, Rooney didn't let his loyalties cloud his judgement as he predicted Liverpool would retain their title.",
      "Moreover, he believes that if Arne Slot's team manage to secure Isak, they're a sure bet for the crown. The Newcastle forward is currently at loggerheads with the club after it was revealed the Swede is determined he has played his last match for the Magpies, keenly awaiting another offer from Liverpool following a rejected £120million bid.",
      "\"I already had Liverpool as favourites to win the title this year,\" Rooney admitted. \"But if Isak comes in, then I think they're gonna be unstoppable.",
      "\"The quality they've got, as Danny's just alluded [to], and I think a big thing was replacing Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. There's a lot of chances created, a lot of goals came from that side. I think [Jeremie] Frimpong has got the attributes to fill that, so I think Liverpool look strong.\"",
      "Rooney could only grin as he spoke the words, though it wasn't one of joy. Rather it seemed to pain the pundit to heap such praise on his old nemeses, regardless of how well-deserved the praise might be.",
      "Many pundits echo this sentiment as the new season approaches, especially with Liverpool bolstering their squad with talents like Florian Wirtz and Huge Ekitike. However, Slot's men may not find immediate success after Crystal Palace snatched the Community Shield at Wembley on Saturday.",
      "Rooney also predicted Arsenal will secure the Premier League's runner-up spot for the fourth consecutive year. He also tipped Manchester City and Chelsea to round out the top four.",

      "Marcus Rashford says Frenkie de Jong has been helping him communicate to his new Barcelona team-mates. The former long-time Manchester United target's English-speaking skills were highlighted when Rashford opened up about his experience settling in at Barcelona.",
      "The forward was left out of United’s first-team training sessions during pre-season by head coach Ruben Amorim, after a falling out last December led to him being exiled from the squad and sent out on loan to Aston Villa until the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "The England international, 27, finally secured his dream move to Barcelona last month, albeit only on loan until the end of this campaign. Rashford has impressed for his new side in pre-season and appears to be settling in smoothly, registering a goal and two assists in four appearances for the reigning Spanish champions.",
      "Playing an important role in that process has been none other than Dutch midfielder De Jong, who once upon a time might have ended up at Old Trafford himself.",
      "Rashford was asked by Gary Lineker on the latest episode of The Rest Is Football podcast what the main language in the Barcelona dressing room is, having previously been Spanish and Catalan during Lineker’s time with the club in the late-1980s.",
      "Rashford began by saying: “It’s still Spanish, a lot of the lads speak Catalan, but the easy thing for me is that a lot of the lads understand English. So I’ve just been picking up on the basics on the pitch, which I think I’ve done quite quickly.”",
      "Rashford, who used Duolingo to improve his Spanish over the summer and has begun taking in-person lessons since his move to Catalonia, went on to explain De Jong’s role in helping him settle in.",
      "He added: “There are good people who are like a bridge. Frenkie [de Jong] speaks really good English, Jules [Kounde] speaks very good English, but they also have good Spanish because they’ve been here a few years.",
      "“But on the pitch, honestly it’s easier than what I thought it would be. Also football overall, I know a lot of people say it, but it’s a language in itself and it’s easy to communicate through the general vibe on the pitch.”",
      "De Jong during Erik ten Hag’s stint as United manager was frequently linked with the Red Devils, which may provide one explanation for his excellent English-speaking skills. Talks were reportedly held between the club and player in the summer of 2022 but De Jong was said to be reluctant due to United’s lack of Champions League football and his desire to remain in Barcelona.",
      "United and Barcelona reportedly even agreed an initial deal worth around £56million, indicating that the Spanish giants were willing to cash in on the midfielder, only for De Jong to refuse a move and United to bring in Casemiro instead.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest was sporadically mentioned the following year, with loose reports of some reignited interest. De Jong, whose current deal runs until 2026, shut down any further speculation this year by telling Sports Illustrated he hopes to renew his contract until 2029.",

      "Liverpool have been tipped to retain their Premier League title by Opta's supercomputer with their algorithm giving the Reds a 28.5 per cent chance of going back-to-back for the first time.",
      "Arne Slot's side won the title relatively unchallenged last term and those on Merseyside and now hoping to claim successive Premier League crowns for the first time ever. Arsenal are backed to be their closest challengers.",
      "Unfortunately for the Gunners though they've been backed to finish second for a fourth season on the trot. Their likelihood of winning the title has been ranked at 24.3 per cent. In keeping with last season's table, Manchester City have been tipped to finish third.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side have invested in a bid to return back to the summit of English football, but the Catalan will go two years without a title for the first time in England if Opta is to be believed. They have an 18.8 per cent chance of success.",
      "Manchester United are hoping for a resurgence after a pre-season under Ruben Amorim and more than £200million of new signings, which includes Benjamin Sesko. However the Opta algorithm believes it will be another mid-table season for the Red Devils with 12th their predicted finish.",
      "At the other end of the table the concerning Premier League trend may continue. Opta's stats believe that Sunderland, Leeds and Burnley will all go straight back down with the Black Cats propping up the table. It would be the third year in successive all the promoted teams go back down.",
      "Wolves are the side tipped to struggle the most, but they will occupy the 17th spot so many teams covet. In fact their likelihood of relegation is just 7.3 per cent. Which is minimal when compared to Burnley (16.6), Leeds (17.8) and Sunderland (34.1).",
      "Chelsea are the team tipped to round out the top four. However the Blues hopes of becoming champions has been largely dismissed, given just an 8.4 per cent chance of finishing top which represents a major drop from the top three.",
      "Their London rivals Tottenham are eyeing a major rebuild under Thomas Frank but few strides are made on last season's difficult year. They remain behind the Red Devils with Opta handing them a finishing position of 14th - which is below Frank's former sider Brentford.",
      "Despite the wholesale changes and the loss of one of their best players the Bees are tipped to finish in tenth, which represents an impressive year given the loss of talent they have had to deal with.",
      "Nottingham Forest were the Premier League's surprise package but Opta has not backed them to replicate those lofty heights. European football could place more strain on their resources with a bottom half finish predicted.",
      "Crystal Palace are likely to be buoyed by the supercomputer's take on their season with the Eagles sat in seventh. That would likely mean European football once again as Oliver Glasner continues to take the club forward, albeit that may be dependent on them keeping their best players.",
      "Aston Villa and Newcastle remain part of the European picture, but there is a change to the order. Unai Emery's side nab fifth place, which could mean a return to the Champions League. The Magpies meanwhile drop to sixth which would be a blow.",

At the next level, first-team level, he wouldn’t be able to because he’s not quite there yet, but his decision-making will make that easier for him physically.",
      "\"If he’s not in the right position or he makes the wrong decision, the game then opens up and it’s harder to be consistently in the right positions. It’s a long-term project with him, but his ability is there for all to see.",
      "\"I think the position he plays in on the pitch requires a lot of discipline, and we’re working on that discipline and decision-making. He is a really good player, but you can see tonight he’s had three, four or five shots and it’s like, there aren’t too many No.6s who are getting into the areas he is.",
      "\"You don’t want to stifle that completely, but if he’s not in the right area of the pitch, then it’s harder for the team to function and it’s harder for him to develop, so he’s working really hard through training and language support.\"",

      "Manchester United have been advised that they can secure a top-five finish by making one more crucial signing; Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. Ruben Amorim has been hard at work reshaping his squad this summer following a lacklustre first season in the Premier League.",
      "United's attacking prowess has been significantly enhanced with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Brighton star Carlos Baleba is also on United's radar as they aim to bolster their midfield options.",
      "However, Amorim still faces a conundrum in goal as he seeks to provide competition for current No. 1 keeper Andre Onana. The Cameroonian sat out United's pre-season due to a hamstring injury and was guilty of several high-profile blunders last term.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma has been touted as a potential addition at Old Trafford. However, French newspaper L'Equipe reports that an agreement has already been reached between him and local rivals Manchester City, with Pep Guardiola seemingly set to thwart any move to United, despite having already brought back James Trafford from Burnley this summer.",
      "Ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster has now urged his former club to refocus their attention on signing Villa's Martinez. A loan switch for the Argentinian was mentioned earlier in the transfer window, and was reportedly turned down by Villa.",
      "Foster reckons he could be the crucial component to help United secure a top-five finish this season, which would now guarantee them Champions League football for the subsequent campaign.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"United have got a better chance of doing it this year. I've loved United's transfer window. I think it's taken them and changed them from having another mid-table disappointment of a season to genuinely looking like competing alongside Newcastle and Villa.",
      "\"I think that if United get off to a good start, they can finish fifth this season. If they get another goalkeeper in, and if Emi Martinez has signed for Man United, they finish fifth this season.\"",
      "Martinez sparked concerns amongst Villa supporters that he was poised to depart the club after what seemed to be an emotional farewell at the conclusion of last season. As he left the pitch following the final home match of the campaign, he tearfully gestured to the fans before heading off the pitch.",
      "Villa are believed to have informed United that it would require an exceptional bid of around £40million to part with their first-choice keeper. Last month, The Athletic reported that the club would not be pursuing Martinez further due to the asking price and substantial wage demands.",
      "Meanwhile, former Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos has suggested that United should consider signing Inter Milan goalkeeper Yann Sommer.",
      "\"I think Yann Sommer is a very, very experienced player and a calming presence,\" Senderos told BoyleSports. \"He makes the defence better because of that presence.",
      "\"I can't really judge Andre Onana in this situation, but if United were to target Yann Sommer, I'd really believe he'd add invaluable experience.",
      "\"It's about how he is as a person, how he is on the pitch. He's a great character and amazing in what he brings to a defence. We've seen it with Inter Milan and Bayern Munich the year before.\"",

      "Leon, who arrived shortly after Cunha from Paraguayan side Club Cerro Porteno, was initially given the No.30 shirt when he joined the club. After Sesko arrived, the young left back gave up his number - despite wearing it in friendlies against West Ham United and Bournemouth - so the forward can be handed his favourite shirt.",
      "For Leon, his move to United is a significant moment in his young career and it's likely his first United shirt will mean a lot to him. His decision to part with it and take the No.35 instead demonstrates his selflessness and ability to see the bigger picture.",
      "Sesko has worn the No.30 since 2020, when he was playing for RB Salzburg, before moving to RB Leipzig in the 2023-24 campaign. After his arrival on the red side of Manchester, he was paraded to jubilant United fans at Old Trafford, before his new side went on to draw 1-1 with Fiorentina.",

      "Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes are at odds over Manchester United's decision to splash out on Benjamin Sesko. Scholes fears the club is repeating past mistakes made with Rasmus Hojlund, but Ferdinand feels differently.",
      "The Slovenian international has officially put pen to paper on a five-year deal with the Red Devils after RB Leipzig accepted a bid of £66.4million plus £7.6m in add-ons. With a total package worth £74m, United pipped Newcastle to the post for Sesko's signature after the Magpies launched their bid earlier in July.",
      "Despite Newcastle offering the striker a more lucrative wage package than United, Ruben Amorim's project persuaded the 22-year-old to turn down the north east and the promise of Champions League football this season. However, United legend Scholes believes that Sesko may have made an error in choosing his former club. He fears the fans will scrutinise the young striker as they did previously with Hojlund.",
      "During The Overlap Fan Debate last week, the ex-United midfielder expressed his belief that Newcastle would have been a better place for young Sesko to develop. Scholes said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed – going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",
      "However, the former England international recognised the potential for future success at Old Trafford, but remained adamant in his belief that Sesko should have opted for Eddie Howe's side. He added: \"Which club are going to be successful first? Are Man United going to win the league before Newcastle – if they ever do? Of course they are.",
      "\"That's why he wants to go there, but I'm saying, from a United point of view, is it the best bit of business? I still think you're in the same boat as having Hojlund.\"",
      "Despite Scholes' reservations, another former United legend believes that Sesko arrives at the club with considerably more experience than Hojlund possessed in 2023. Ferdinand continued the debate on his YouTube channel, Rio Presents, protesting that Sesko will thrive in Manchester.",
      "Ferdinand said: \"Now we've got someone who's not as experienced but he's more experienced than Rasmus Hojlund. He's played probably almost double the amount of games as Hojlund when he came, he's two years older than what Rasmus Hojlund was when he signed.",
      "\"And he's shown that he can score goals. He hasn't gone and blitzed it and scored a ridiculous amount of goals, but he's a kid. He's young. Again, we can't expect that. I don't see him coming in and scoring 25 Premier League goals, or 20 Premier League goals.",
      "\"If he comes and scores between 10 and 15, I think that's an unbelievable return.\"",
      "When quizzed on why he believes Sesko will fare better at United than Hojlund has managed, Ferdinand added: \"Well, I think it's more hope at the moment. I think we've got to wait and see man. I think because you look at it and go, when Hojlund came and when Amorim came during the season, it's a new way of playing, a new style, a new environment.",
      "\"The manager was finding his feet and also you have a number nine finding his feet. So under Amorim, that's the way it's been for him [Rasmus]. So hopefully, there's a clearer picture, a clearer identity given the preseason that we've had.",
      "\"There's more goals, like I said, and players that understand the Premier League getting more experience up top, in the top end of the pitch. You'd like to think that counts for a lot going into the new season, to help a new number nine coming into the building.\"",
      "Whilst the two United icons might disagree over Sesko's potential impact at Old Trafford, the most crucial viewpoint belongs to the striker himself – and he certainly believes in his ability to restore glory to the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "In an interview with MUTV, the 22-year-old said: \"For me, the team is great. It is getting better and better and that's why also there is just stuff that makes you come there, gives you this energy that you want to be part of. I think it's a great project, in general, and I can't wait to start, definitely.",
      "\"I've just been here for a couple of hours and it's already been amazing. I can already feel that we're going to be a great family and it is a pleasure to be part of it.",
      "\"It feels good, you know, the thing is it [the badge] fits well and I'm looking forward to just playing in it a lot and try to represent in the good ways possible.\"",
      "With speculation surrounding his future at United, current number nine Hojlund previously insisted he will fight for his place in the squad.",
      "During the recent pre-season tour in America, the Danish striker said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Since then, however, it appears that Hojlund has warmed to the idea of a move to AC Milan. Only time will tell if he'll be giving Sesko a run for his money in the squad this season.",

      "Mikael Silvestre has told Ruben Amorim pressure will mount at Manchester United if he starts this season on a losing streak.",
      "The Portuguese head coach guided his side to a 15th-placed Premier League finish last season, having taken over from Erik ten Hag in November. He has been backed to the tune of £200million this summer as United look to move up the table.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all arrived at Old Trafford to bolster Amorim's squad, and Silvestre, who made over 350 appearances for the Red Devils, believes his job could be in danger should they enter crisis mode after a poor start.",
      "\"I don't think [Ruben] Amorim is under any more pressure than any other manager in the Premier League, to be honest,\" Silvestre exclusively told Ladbrokes.",
      "\"I think they're all under pressure, it's just that he's at Manchester United, and they've now spent a lot of money. It's the size of the club, coupled with the interest from the media which makes it feel like there's more pressure there.",
      "\"There might be some pressure from the owners this season, but I would say that's the same with every other club. Amorim will go into this season under the same amount of pressure as every other manager; it's a fresh start.",
      "\"But, if you start losing three games in a row, and find yourself in that kind of form, that's when the crisis will start. That's when there's real pressure. For now, everyone is on zero points, they should all be treated the same and everyone will be judged against their objectives for the season.\"",
      "On the back of some promising transfer activity, Silvestre thinks the aim for United this season should be European football, but perhaps not the Champions League.",
      "\"As for my expectations of the club this season, they need to be qualifying for Europe,\" he continued. \"The Champions League isn't necessarily the target, but European football of any kind definitely is.",
      "\"Of course, everyone will always talk about the Champions League, but I just think that given the lack of consistency last season, I'm sceptical about their chances on that front.\"",
      "The defender also feels that jumping from a 15th-placed finish to the top four could be too tall an order, and has predicted a more modest top-flight finish for his former club.",
      "\"As for where they finish in the table, I'd say maybe sixth or seventh? I don't see them in the top four or five,\" declared the Frenchman. \"It's crazy saying that, to be honest. It just sounds so unfamiliar when we're talking about Manchester United, but that's the position the club is in right now, unfortunately.",
      "\"You know, you've got to be realistic about what the team has been achieving in recent years. OK, there are new players in place now, and a completely new dynamic. But in terms of dominating other teams and getting consistency, there are still a lot of question marks, in my opinion.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have forced 'hurt' Barcelona to alter their transfer plans by completing the signing of Benjamin Sesko for £74million. Sesko, 22, joined the Red Devils last week on a five-year contract, keeping him at Old Trafford until 2030.",
      "The Slovenian is considered one of the best young strikers in Europe, having spent the last two seasons developing with RB Leipzig. Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for the German club, proving himself in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League.",
      "Amid their search for a new striker, United made him their top target and beat Newcastle in a fiercely-contested race for his signature. But it turns out that Newcastle weren't the only ones to miss out.",
      "Barcelona were in fact considering a move for Sesko next summer. Catalan outlet Sport claim that Barca's management are particularly hurt by the 22-year-old's switch to Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko is highly rated by Barcelona sporting director Deco, who's working on a signing a successor to Robert Lewandowski in the summer of 2026. Lewandowski, who turns 37 later this month, has entered the final year of his contract with Barca and is likely to leave at the end of this season.",
      "Barcelona chiefs were well aware that Sesko wasn't guaranteed to remain at Leipzig for another year, so they weren't taken by surprise when United swooped. It's added that the La Liga chiefs weren't in a position to challenge the Red Devils for his signature due to their well-documented financial woes.",
      "Now Barca will focus on alternative targets, having previously been linked with Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez, Newcastle's Alexander Isak - who could also be changing clubs this summer - and Manchester City superstar Erling Haaland, who signed a mammoth 10-year contract extension in January.",
      "Haaland is reportedly Barcelona president Joan Laporta's dream signing, telling TV3 in May: \"Nothing is impossible. But we're not thinking about that right now. He also just signed a new contract.\"",
      "Who should Barcelona target as an alternative? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "The Blaugrana head into the new campaign with Lewandowski as their only recognised No.9. The Pole will miss Saturday's opening game against Mallorca due to injury, leaving the door open for Marcus Rashford, Ferran Torres or Dani Olmo to fill the void.",
      "Rashford is on loan from United, who've given Barca the option to sign him permanently for £26m at the end of the season. Torres was an able deputy last term, scoring 19 goals.",

      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin is poised to join Leeds after his summer search for a new club finally yielded a breakthrough.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has been looking for a new team after leaving Everton as a free agent on July 1. The 28-year-old striker spent nine years on the books at Goodison Park, scoring 71 goals in 274 appearances for Everton, but has struggled with injuries.",
      "He was linked with moves to Manchester United and Newcastle, but nothing materialised. Calvert-Lewin reportedly took the step of dismissing his agent to speed up the process and he now appears to have found a new home at Leeds.",
      "The Athletic reports that he has agreed terms in principle with the newly-promoted Premier League side and will undergo a medical. His lack of an agent will mean that Calvert-Lewin will be leading negotiations himself with Leeds, where he will compete with Joel Piroe and Lukas Nmecha for a place in Daniel Farke’s side.",
      "He was offered a new contract by Everton last summer, but an agreement was never reached and, after another difficult campaign, the two parted company on good terms. “This isn’t something I chose lightly,” he said after leaving.",
      "“Everton has been my home since I was 19 years old. It’s the place that saw potential in me, challenged me to grow, and shaped me both as a footballer and as a man.”",
      "His move to Leeds will please Rio Ferdinand, who had been baffled when the Red Devils were linked with a move for the striker, who has four goals in 11 appearances for England. Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, he said: “Dominic Calvert-Lewin cannot stay fit. Why are you bringing him into this club?",
      "“This club is built on the academy. You have Chido Obi just sitting there. Play him if you're going to think about five or six games. Not somebody who is older and cannot stay fit.” United have since signed Benjamin Sesko, in a £74million deal from RB Leipzig, to play alongside Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The major black mark against Calvert-Lewin has always been his injury record. He played just 26 times for Everton, scoring three times, last season and David Moyes admitted that his difficulties in staying fit were the main reason behind his departure.",
      "“I'll make the final decision, but Dom has to show us he's robust and can be fit to play,” he said in May. “Undoubtedly he's got qualities other strikers don't have, and he has to show us all when he gets the opportunities that he'll take it. We need him to be ready to train, play, be competitive in more games than he's been available for.”",

      "Manchester United were warned about splashing the cash on under-fire forward Rasmus Hojlund before they parted with £72million for the striker in August 2023. After a promising debut season, Hojlund has struggled at Old Trafford.",
      "The recent arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, in a deal worth £74m, has now also increased the competition for the young Dane in United's forward areas. Hojlund, 22, appears to have had a change of heart on his future too, despite claiming he would stay and fight for his place at United earlier on in the summer, with AC Milan now linked with a swoop.",
      "However, United could have avoided paying over the odds for a player that was once targeted by club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe for underperforming. According to The Telegraph, United’s data financial modelling claimed that Hojlund, who was playing for Atalanta in Serie A at the time, was actually worth £50m.",
      "Regardless, United chiefs stormed ahead with the move, paying £22m more than was recommended for the striker. Hojlund has since seen his valuation drop rapidly. The Denmark international, who has scored 26 goals in 95 games for the club, is now valued at around £30m by United.",
      "Not only did United's own data team warn about signing Hojlund, but his own manager at Atalanta, Gian Piero Gasperini, claimed the move to Old Trafford was coming too soon for Hojlund.",
      "The current Roma boss helped Hojlund become a force to be reckoned with in Bergamo, with the youngster scoring 10 goals and providing four assists in 34 games. But he harboured doubts on Hojlund continuing his development at United.",
      "\"I think so (Hojlund should stay one more season),\" the 67-year-old said. \"Then after that it’s difficult. He undoubtedly has great talent, but also great room for improvement. These things are visible in both senses, he must work to improve because he has the characteristics to become one of the strongest strikers in the world.”",
      "Gasperini's concerns were echoed by two top scouts as former United boss Erik ten Hag circled a move for the player. One said: \"He’s still unproven and the Premier League is a very unforgiving place especially if you’re in a Manchester United shirt.",
      "\"He’s left-footed, strong and powerful so inevitably there will be some comparisons with [Erling] Haaland but he’s not in his league. Haaland is a generational talent. Hojlund’s stats don’t come anywhere near Haaland and his finishing can be erratic.\"",
      "Hojlund is only two years into a five-year deal at United but the club decided earlier this year to cash in if they recruited a new centre forward, something they have now done with Sesko. United had hoped to offload Hojlund on a permanent deal this summer, but Milan are seeking to bring him on loan to the San Siro.",
      "Hojlund was an unused substitute in United's pre-season 1-1 draw with Fiorentina, which actually marked the first time he did not appear in any of United's five pre-season matches this summer.",
      "Yet sources close to Hojlund felt he would have to leave United should they bolster their forward line with Sesko. Ruben Amorim has also refused to give assurances that the player would stay, suggesting Hojlund's time at Old Trafford now looks to be coming to an end.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

To support these objectives, further recruitment is planned into a number of data, software and platform engineering roles in the coming months, as Sansoni builds out his team.\"",

      "United, following an extensive period of negotiating, went on to secure their second attacking signing of the summer, bringing in Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Like Cunha, the Cameroonian had his heart set on a move to Old Trafford, but the lack of a release clause in his Bees contract meant the deal was much more complex.",
      "Eventually, an offer of £65m plus £6m in add-ons was enough to extract him from the Gtech Community Stadium. He scored 20 Premier League goals last season and was one of the best players in the division.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The additions of Cunha and Mbeumo prior to the pre-season tour of the United States represented a fantastic start to the summer for United. The duo scored 37 goals between them last term, including 35 in the league.",
      "However, United were still without a much-needed centre-forward. Step forward, Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Less than a week after United completed their tour of the United States with a 2-2 draw against Everton in Atlanta, Sesko was unveiled to the fans at Old Trafford ahead of last Saturday's pre-season finale against Fiorentina.",

      "Hojlund, who could leave the club before the end of this summer's transfer window, joined United from Atalanta in August 2023 and has scored just 26 goals in 95 games for the Reds. United need Sesko to deliver the goods at a higher rate than that.",
      "Poised to spearhead an attack that will also feature Mbeumo and Cunha, Sesko should be confident about his chances. However, he will find himself under levels of pressure he has never previously experienced.",
      "The No.9 spot at United is one of the most scrutinised positions in world football, meaning he will be under enormous pressure to hit the ground running. But with the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Cunha, Mbeumo and Amad buzzing around him, the supply line should be productive.",
      "After scoring 21 goals for Leipzig last season, United will dream of seeing him score 20 goals in his first season at Old Trafford. Hitting the 20-goal mark would be a fantastic achievement.",
      "First and foremost, Sesko's first priority has to be reaching double figures as quickly as possible. United have signed him to score goals and ensure they are more prolific in front of goal.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are poised to play just behind him and they will also share ambitions of reaching double figures. However, just like Sesko, they are also going to experience a whole new level of pressure at Old Trafford in comparison to what they have been used to previously.",
      "With no European football on the agenda this season, the Premier League will be United's bread and butter. They need to atone for last season's struggles and make a push for European qualification for 2026/27.",
      "With a front three of Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko, United will believe they have the tools to do so. The last time United had three players reach double figures in a Premier League campaign was when Edinson Cavani (10), Marcus Rashford (11) and Fernandes (18) consistently delivered the goods in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "By contrast, nobody reached double figures for United in the Premier League last season; Fernandes and Amad were their joint-top league scorers with eight.",
      "Accounting for the increase in expectations and all of the other caveats that come with a first season at a new club, if United reach the end of the 2025/26 season having watched Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko reach double figures for league goals, it will be considered a job well done.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Carlos Baleba likes to watch horror films, so moving to Manchester United after a horror season won't scare him.",
      "The 21-year-old midfielder is a target for the Reds as Ruben Amorim seeks to add a partner for Bruno Fernandes in the middle of the park.",
      "Baleba has impressed at Brighton having moved to the Seagulls from Lille in 2023. He could be the next big money exit from the Amex conveyor belt if United are able to strike a deal.",
      "The player himself may well be open to a move to Old Trafford to join Ruben's revolution, even if he acknowledged last season that any transfer talk wouldn't affect his work rate or desire to be the best version of himself.",
      "\"If I can help a team-mate, I will. If they can help me, I'll accept that help to push forward and develop. So I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it's not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.",
      "\"I don't know if I'm going to be the star or the next big thing. For me, being the star is quite a lot. Everyone talking about you, singing your name? That just doesn't do it for me. It's not something that gets me running. I just prefer getting my head down and working on the pitch.\"",
      "It's easy to see why United are interested in the Cameroon international. Last season he excelled on the south coast and is among the best performing Premier League players in several metrics - including ball recoveries and interceptions.",
      "He is a physical and competitive midfield general who also breaks the lines with his passing range. His game intelligence has seen him utilised as a sole sitting midfielder by Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler, emphasising how adept he is at reading the play and turning defence into attack.",
      "He's not the finished article but is a player with a high ceiling - and a high price tag - with Brighton having no desire to sell someone they spent just over £23million on two years ago. His contract runs until 2028 and reports put his asking price around four times that.",
      "The youngster is an upbeat person in the Brighton dressing room and a happy character with a steely determination to improve and become one of the best midfielders of his generation.",
      "\"I’ve already done some things that some kids will never do in their football career,\" he told the Guardian last season. \"I want to do more. I want to be a big midfielder, to be a legend, across the world. To arrive there, I have to work hard.\"",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Despite already signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon, Enzo Kana-Biyik and Matheus Cunha, the club want more over these final three weeks of the summer transfer window. Further business could still be done on the market despite their significant investment in three high-profile attacking signings.",
      "Carlos Baleba is of interest to United - albeit Brighton & Hove Albion are said to want £100million. Gianluigi Donnarumma is another name around whom speculation continues to increase after quickly falling out of favour at Paris Saint-Germain this summer. United, however, must move on multiple players before they go again in the market.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia spent pre-season away from the first-team squad to help secure transfers. Due to Sesko joining, Rasmus Hojlund is another player who appears to be on the way out, while another goalkeeper arriving could impact the futures of Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır.",
      "Follow the latest Manchester United transfer news below:",
      "Roma have reportedly bid to sign Jadon Sancho on loan this season.",
      "The Times claims they want to sign the winger and Aston Villa player Leon Bailey, whom they are said to have enquired about. United understandably would prefer a permanent move with Sancho in the final year of his contract.",
      "Manchester United youngster Toby Collyer is closing in on a loan move to West Bromwich Albion.",
      "MORE: United midfielder makes decision on future",
      "Kingsley Coman is said to be signing for Al Nassr soon after years of links to United.",
      "Their interest in Coman dates back to 2020, with the winger understood to have been an alternative to Jadon Sancho. Sky Germany now reports Bayern Munich are now belatedly selling the France international.",
      "Hull City head coach Sergej Jakirovic has confirmed talks with Toby Collyer.",
      "The midfielder is a long-term loan target of theirs and Jakirovic has told Hull Live:",
      "We're waiting now for a decision from Man United and Toby as well. I'm waiting for the answer in the next one or two days.",
      "Bayern Munich are said to have made Christopher Nkunku one of the leading names on their shortlist after previous links to United.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims the situation is open, acknowledging several clubs have asked about the Chelsea player this summer. Any move to Bayern now reputedly depends on the cost of doing business.",
      "Milan are reportedly prepared to pay £34million as part of a deal for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "La Gazzetta Dello Sport claims it would include an initial loan fee and an option to buy the striker. However, they add that Hojlund wants guarantees from Milan that a permanent move will materialise next summer.",
      "United are said to have shown late interest in Giovanni Leoni before Liverpool agreed an initial £26million deal with Parma.",
      "The Times claims that other Premier League sides, with Newcastle United another one named, did likewise, with the Reds also credited with beating Milan and Inter to the teenage central defender.",
      "United are reportedly willing to include Jadon Sancho in a deal to sign Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Independent, however, claims Brighton & Hove Albion are unlikely to accept such a proposal, instead wanting around £120million. United are said to be considering a £80million initial offer, paying the other £40m in add-ons.",
      "Milan are reportedly prepared to match the wages Rasmus Hojlund is currently on at United.",
      "Corriere dello Sport claim the Italian club are now trying to reach a financial agreement with the striker. Negotiations are reputedly ongoing on a loan with an option to make the move permanent for Hojlund.",
      "Nineteen days remain of this summer transfer window, with the Premier League season just one more sleep away. We will update you on all the latest reports about United's potential business in the market throughout today.",
      "According to The Independent, United are pushing to sign Carlos Baleba before the transfer window slams shut on September 1. The report claims that Ruben Amorim wants to sign a midfielder this summer, and Adam Wharton has been identified as an alternative to the Brighton ace.",
      "It's said that United would, ideally, like both, but Crystal Palace are expected to be even more difficult to deal with than the Seagulls.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping an eye on long-time target Harry Kane. The 32-year-old, who joined Bayern Munich from Tottenham Hotspur in 2023, has a release clause in his contract which will come into play in January 2026.",
      "This could see him leave the Bundesliga champions for as little as £56m. Kane, who won his first major trophy earlier this season, has two years remaining on his current deal.",
      "Manchester City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Gianluigi Donnarumma over a move to the Etihad. The Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper has recently been linked with a move to the Premier League after he was deemed surplus to requirements at the Parc des Princes under Luis Enrique.",
      "United were one of several clubs linked with a move for Donnarumma, though it seems that bitter rivals City are now looking to strike a move for the shot-stopper. French publication L'Equipe claims that the 26-year-old had been in talks with both United and City but it is the latter who have reached an agreement on personal terms.",
      "Manchester United's blockbuster signing of Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko has reportedly caused frustration not only among their Premier League rivals, but also clubs abroad.",
      "It represented a major coup for the Manchester club, as the 22-year-old was also a top target for Newcastle United, who are desperately searching for a potential replacement for Alexander Isak. But it seems the Magpies were not the only club on the continent eyeing a move for the striker.",
      "According to Spanish outlet SPORT, Barcelona in particular have been left ‘hurt’ by Sesko’s recent switch to Old Trafford. Sporting director Deco is said to rate the player highly and was considering him as a long-term successor to Robert Lewandowski.",
      "Following on from reports that a deal for Brighton's Carlos Baleba is not imminent, that has now been backed up by a report from The Telegraph.",
      "The article notes that Manchester United are currently unwilling to buy at the Seagulls' asking price of more than £100 million and the clubs have not yet spoken directly.",
      "While the 21-year-old is the midfielder the United hierarchy would like to sign, they are still operating within tight profit and sustainability lines.",
      "Instead, they decided to put their resources into strengthening the forward line, most recently with the addition of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Brighton are set to remain firm on their stance that Manchester United target Carlos Baleba is not available this summer, according to reports.",
      "TBR Football claim United, through intermediaries, are continuing to discuss a move with Brighton but the signals are not positive. The report adds that while the player is certainly open to a switch to Old Trafford, he is not actively pushing the move at this stage.",
      "The notion that it would take Moises Caicedo money - in excess of £100m - has once again been reiterated. Brighton would have to consider an offer in that range, but it has been claimed the Seagulls are not anticipating that sort of a bid from United.",
      "Manchester United have confirmed youngster Jack Fletcher is training with the first-team ahead of Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford, writes George Smith.",
      "Fletcher, who is the son of former United midfielder and now-Under-18s boss Darren, is one of the most highly-rated players emerging from the club's academy.",

      "Serie A giants AC Milan are stepping up their pursuit of Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund, according to the latest reports.",
      "CaughtOffside claim a potential deal to bring the Dane to the San Siro is gaining momentum, which could be worth in the region of €40-€45 million in the form of a loan with an option to buy.",
      "The article adds that Milan are now in direct contact with Hojlund's agent in order to reach an agreement, but they are also keeping tabs on Dusan Vlahovic's situation at Juventus as a potential alternative.",
      "Man United are seemingly already preparing for the future, with scouts reportedly looking at a potential striker signing.",
      "The Daily Mail have reported that United are showing an interest in Internacional striker Ricardo Mathias. The 19-year-old has scored five goals across 18 appearances for Internacional and is already attracting interest from the Premier League. The report claims that United have sent scouts to watch Mathias in action, most recently last week for a 1-1 draw with Fluminense.",
      "Mathias is reported to have a £56.2million release clause in his contract with Internacional, with United said to be keen to put themselves at the top of the list of clubs interested in his signature. After the signing of Sesko, United now have four recognised centre forwards in the first team alongside Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Chido Obi. Hojlund, though, is being heavily linked with a move away from United, with AC Milan a potential destination.",
      "United have already ventured to South America for one new signing this summer, with Diego Leon arriving from Cerro Porteno in Paraguay. United agreed to pay a £3.3million initial fee with the potential for the deal to reach up to £7million.",
      "Man United can help Carlos Baleba to achieve what he has set out to do in his football career.",
      "The youngster is a versatile midfielder capable of contributing across the pitch and on paper at least, appears to be exactly the type of player Ruben Amorim’s team need. Baleba is about to embark on just his third season in the Premier League but his ambitions are clear - and United may feel they can help him achieve them.",
      "When asked if that was achievable on the south coast, the midfielder added: \"For me, there are opportunities everywhere. I can win trophies here with Brighton, I can win trophies at another club. My ambition is to just win trophies everywhere I go. Just doing that and making the world happy.\"",
      "On Tuesday, journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that talks with Brighton are ongoing as United try to understand the Seagulls' asking price. He added that they are not pursuing other targets as things stand, even though Brighton reportedly have 'no intention' of lowering their asking price of over £100million.",
      "Teddy Sheringham believes Sancho’s chances of joining another ‘big club’ are slim after his recent struggles.",
      "\"Jadon Sancho will definitely not play for a big club again,\" the former United striker told Snabbare. \"He might say he can and will, but I don’t see it that way. I think he’s burned his bridges with the manager and doesn’t even have a place in the dressing room.",
      "\"Maybe if he were given another chance, he could adapt to what Amorim wants. But from my experience, once you’ve gone down the path of being unhappy and wanting out, it’s very hard to turn things around -with the manager, the fans, and the other players.",
      "\"You have to show incredible mental strength to change that. It’s possible, and I know he’s talented, but I’d be very surprised if it happens now.\"",
      "Betis centre-back Natan has claimed winger Antony is 'waiting' to seal a return to the Spanish club.",
      "It is expected Antony's only hope of rejoining the La Liga outfit is via a season-long loan deal. Now, fellow Brazilian Natan has hinted the United winger is expecting to return to the club.",
      "\"Hopefully he can come back and be with us for another year or two,\" Natan told El Chiringuito, as quoted by Football Espana. \"Yes, he's waiting and we're all waiting.",
      "\"I think it's not just me, all the Betis. I hope he comes. Let's hope, I have hope.\"",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein claims Leeds United have reached an agreement in principle to sign Calvert-Lewin amid links to Man United.",
      "The 28-year-old became a free agent after his Everton contract expired in June. A medical for the striker at Leeds' training ground, Thorp Arch, is said to be scheduled 'imminently.'",
      "Marcus Rashford believes Man United have never properly adapted after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013.",
      "Speaking to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest Is Football podcast, Rashford said: \"At times I feel like United has been… we’re hungry to win, so we will always try to adapt and sign players that fit this system, but it’s reactionary.",
      "\"If your directions are always changing, you can’t expect to win the league. You might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you have a good coach, good players and you have match winners in your team, you’re not there by accident. This is what some people forget.",
      "\"Yeah we have been way lower than what people deem United to be, but if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months, what do you expect? People say we have been in a transition for years. To be in a transition you need to start a transition. It’s like the actual transition has not started yet.\"",
      "Referencing the early struggles Jurgen Klopp endured as Liverpool manager, Rashford added: \"When Liverpool went through this with Klopp, they stuck with him. They didn’t win anything in the beginning. People only remember his final few years when he was competing with City and winning the biggest trophies, they did not win anything at the beginning. To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it.",
      "\"This is where I want to speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we’ve had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win, you end up in the middle of them, you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Manchester City have not denied interest in Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Donnarumma - but their preference is to keep Ederson.",
      "The Brazilian has been No.1 at the club for the past eight years and the intention is to make that nine. Tuesday saw an avalanche of media reports though regarding both Ederson and Donnarumma. There have been claims that Galatasaray are closing in on a deal for the former while City have agreed terms with the latter, whose time at PSG is over.",
      "A move for Donnarumma looks certain if Ederson leaves, and City will reluctantly let him leave if they get the right offer - just as they will Savinho amid Tottenham interest. However, club sources say that there is currently nothing on the table for Ederson from other clubs and they would like to keep it that way.",
      "The speculation adds to the uncertainty around City heading into the new season. Pep Guardiola said last week that he was not expecting any new arrivals in the remaining weeks of the transfer window, but City would be forced into action by movement around Ederson.",
      "More here.",
      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining Man United face a race against time to get their shopping done.",
      "Having failed to qualify for any form of European football this season, concerns were raised about whether United would find it difficult to attract players who would not look out of place in the Champions League. However, just as head coach Ruben Amorim stated back in April, United will always appeal to players.",
      "He said: \"It's Manchester United. What I feel is that there's a lot of players that want to play for our club. I know that if you look at our club at the moment it looks like sometimes with all the problems with the staff, people going, changing coach, the results, it looks like a little bit of a problem at the moment. But we have a clear idea. \"That is the easiest part to explain to a player. And then it's Manchester United. Everybody wants to play for Manchester United.\"",
      "United remain keen to strengthen their midfield options ahead of the window closing and Baleba is on their radar. He is one of European football's most highly-rated midfielders and his ceiling is sky-high. Like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, he would not look out of place in a team playing Champions League football this season.",
      "He can do a little bit of everything in midfield and his skillset is very attractive. With United's midfield in desperate need of fresh blood, the club's hierarchy will be hoping Baleba is the latest player to prove Amorim right and be attracted to the prospect of representing the Reds.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes report Man United have submitted an offer of around €80million (£69m) for Lopez. The bid is said to be hard for the Catalan club to ignore.",
      "Barca, who are dealing with ongoing financial challenges, recognise the viability of the offer and its potential benefits for the transfer.",
      "Last week, Lopez was asked about the transfer speculation, saying: \"I want to stay here - it’s my dream, and I will stay. I’m happy to help the team.",
      "\"A lot has been said, but I’m going to keep defending these colors and working harder than anyone. The fans can relax.\"",
      "Real Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo has confirmed the Spanish club is not giving up on re-signing Man United winger Antony before the end of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Antony is expected to leave the club ahead of the window closing on September 1. Betis have maintained interest in the Brazilian throughout the summer after signing him on loan back in January for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign. He excelled in Spain, scoring nine goals and registering five assists in just 26 games.",
      "\"Both parties want him to be here this season,\" said Fajardo, as quoted by AS. \"Every day that passes allows us to dream of him being here.",
      "\"If Antony is here, it's because the numbers add up. The most important thing is the club's sustainability; we can't do anything crazy. It's okay to think big, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground.",
      "\"If he doesn't sign with a club, there are still options, but the deal would take place within the parameters we have budgeted at the club.\"",
      "United need to sell the Brazilian for £32.58million this summer to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR). He has two years left on his deal at Old Trafford."

      "Although nothing is finalised, Sheffield Wednesday are thought to be leading the race to sign Amass and it's understood United would be happy to send the youngster to Hillsborough Stadium.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been in turmoil over the last few months due to problems with the club's owner, Dejphon Chansiri. The Owls were handed a transfer embargo for their failure to pay players and staff, but the embargo has been lifted and they have pitched to sign Amass on loan for 2025/2026.",
      "Despite the unrest at Sheffield Wednesday, United sources have indicated that game time is the priority when considering a loan offer and Amass would benefit from consistent starts.",
      "Amass is understood to be weighing up his options, but United have no qualms about potentially sending him on loan to Sheffield Wednesday and would green-light a move to S6.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday started the Championship season with only 16 registered first-team players after several departures and supporters have protested against the club's ownership.",
      "Last weekend, Sheffield Wednesday fans walked into their game against Leicester City late to protest against Chansiri, and further protests are planned before facing Stoke on Saturday.",
      "The Sheffield Wednesday Supporters' Trust has encouraged fans not to buy other merchandise or food at the ground, while supporters have boycotted the new home and away kit.",
      "After internal discussions and the arrival of Diego Leon this summer, Amass was earmarked for a loan move. Ruben Amorim handed Amass his first-team debut against Leicester in March and the youngster made a total of seven first-team appearances throughout the campaign.",
      "Amass was named on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham. He was subsequently considered to stay with the first-team for the new season, but Leon has impressed in pre-season.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Paraguay club Cerro Porteno to sign Leon, who was due to be assessed this summer before a decision was made on his future.",
      "Leon made a strong first impression at Carrington and was handed a first-team squad number before the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Stockholm. Amorim started Leon in that friendly and he made substitute appearances against West Ham and Bournemouth in the United States.",
      "Amass was not brought on the USA tour because United planned to send him on loan.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window has been eventful, to say the least, and there is still plenty of time for more to come.",
      "Three new signings have been added to Ruben Amorim's squad ahead of the new Premier League season. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko's arrivals will likely see a new forward line for United this term, but it may not be the only area of the squad that sees major change.",
      "United are also thought to be looking at signing a new midfielder ahead of the September 1 deadline. Brighton star Carlos Baleba has been heavily linked with a move to United, but a deal could prove tricky to get over the line.",
      "The Seagulls are reported to value Baleba at more than £100million, with The Independent suggesting an actual price tag may be closer to £120million. What is interesting in the report is that it claims United are also looking at Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton as a midfield target, with ambitions of having the England Under-21 international start alongside Baleba in United's midfield in the future.",
      "While achieving that goal may be unlikely this summer, it would certainly be a dream to have Baleba and Wharton as United's midfield options going forward. If that was to happen, it would present United with a dream scenario going forward.",
      "As it stands, United's first-choice midfield would likely feature Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo. Given Ruben Amorim's 3-5-2 system deploys a two-man central midfield, it could mean Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future is in one of the roles behind the centre-forward, potentially as a rotation option alongside new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "United also have Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Mason Mount and Toby Collyer who can all perform in the middle of the park. Signing Baleba could see one member of United's midfield depart, although it's fair to say reinforcements are needed following Christian Eriksen's departure this summer.",
      "Wharton's arrival next summer could be viewed as a long-term replacement for Casemiro, and it seems United have big plans to revamp their midfield in the years to come.",

      "\"When I leave it's going to be ‘no hard feelings’. You’re not going to have any negative comments from me about Manchester United. That’s me as a person,\" those were the words of Marcus Rashford to journalist Henry Winter back in December after he first admitted his desire to leave the club.",
      "It was a noble stance to take considering he had just been left out, unceremoniously, from the squad that defeated Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. In the weeks that followed, Rashford would only make the bench at United once more for the loss to Newcastle before being shipped out on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "Before that transfer, the situation became even frostier between Rashford and Ruben Amorim. In a press conference after beating Fulham, the Portuguese head coach insisted that he would rather have goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital (now 64), on the bench before a player that did not have the right attitude.",
      "It was later clarified that Amorim was making a general point and not one about a specific player, however the remark was made after a question on Rashford. It was clear then that the dynamic between the winger and United had shifted.",
      "In the West Midlands, Rashford kept a low profile. He was protected from most media obligations and did not pass comment on United. However, that all changed this week when he conducted an interview with The Rest is Football following his loan switch to Barcelona.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He described the club as being 'reactionary' and the club have been in 'no man's land' due to the amount of transition and change since Sir Alex Ferguson left. He could have been more damning on the state that United have been in, but it is nevertheless clear the forward has changed his mind on keeping his true feelings suppressed.",
      "\"Show me a successful team that just adapts,\" Rashford said. \"When Fergie was in charge, not only the principles for the first team – the whole academy set up so you could pick players from 15 years and over – that’s a full generation. And they’d all understand the principles of playing the Man United way, right?",
      "\"You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time – they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been… we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction’s always changing, you can’t expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team – you’re not there by accident.",
      "\"This is what some people forget. So yeah, we’ve been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months – what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we’ve been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet.\"",
      "The timing of this change speaks volumes. Perhaps now he is certain to not have a future at United, Rashford feels more empowered to speak his mind.",
      "He could also feel that Amorim's behaviour towards him following the Winter interview has shifted the goalposts. But, there is more than one side to every argument.",
      "Rashford is not completely faultless for the demise of his United career or, in fact, the club as a whole. He is also not solely responsible for either scenario either.",
      "However, what is clear is that Rashford has taken a shift away from keeping quiet and is voicing his opinion on United - and that suggests the relationship with the club has now undergone a complete, and permanent, U-turn.",

      "The competition was known as the Capital One Cup at the time and the result marked a dismal start to life under Louis van Gaal, who had been appointed earlier that summer to replace David Moyes. United were beginning what would prove to be a difficult period for the club as they tried to fill the void left by Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.",
      "This time, Ruben Amorim is overseeing things and he will be expecting a sharp increase in fortunes from last season's disappointing 15th place finish in the Premier League. The club were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the quarter-finals, falling to a 4-3 defeat to their eventual Europa League final conquerers Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes have been left in disagreement over Benjamin Sesko's decision to join Manchester United, with the latter adamant the club is repeating the same mistake made with Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The Slovenian international officially signed a five-year deal with the Red Devils after RB Leipzig accepted a bid of £66.4million plus £7.6m in add-ons. With the total package worth £74m, United beat Newcastle to Sesko's signature after the Magpies launched their bid earlier in July.",
      "Despite Newcastle offering the striker a higher wage package than United, Ruben Amorim's project convinced the 22-year-old to snub the north east and the guarantee of Champions League football this season.",
      "However, United legend Scholes is of the opinion that Sesko may have made the wrong decision in choosing his former club, fearing the fans will scrutinise the young striker like they did previously with Hojlund.",
      "During the The Overlap Fan Debate last week, the ex-United midfielder voiced his beliefs that Newcastle would have been a better place for young Sesko to develop. He said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed – going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",
      "However, the former England international acknowledged the potential future success at Old Trafford, but refused to budge on his thoughts that Sesko should've chosen Eddie Howe's side. He added: \"Which club are going to be successful first? Are Man United going to win the league before Newcastle – if they ever do? Of course they are.",
      "\"That's why he wants to go there, but I'm saying, from a United point of view, is it the best bit of business? I still think you're in the same boat as having Hojlund.\"",
      "Despite Scholes' concerns, another ex-United icon feels that Sesko is coming into the club with much more experience behind him than Hojlund did in 2023. Ferdinand discussed the debate on his YouTube channel, Rio Presents, and the former Premier League defender made his feelings clear about how Sesko will be successful in Manchester.",
      "Ferdinand said: \"Now we've got someone who's not as experienced but he's more experienced than Rasmus Hojlund. He's played probably almost double the amount of games as Hojlund when he came, he's two years older than what Rasmus Hojlund was when he signed.",
      "\"And he's shown that he can score goals. He hasn't gone and blitzed it and scored a ridiculous amount of goals, but he's a kid. He's young. Again, we can't expect that. I don't see him coming in and scoring 25 Premier League goals, or 20 Premier League goals.",
      "\"If he comes and scores between 10 and 15, I think that's an unbelievable return.\"",
      "When asked why he feels Sesko will have a more positive time at United than Hojlund has, Ferdinand added: \"Well, I think it's more hope at the moment. I think we've got to wait and see man. I think because you look at it and go, when Hojlund came and when Amorim came during the season, it's a new way of playing, a new style, a new environment.",
      "\"The manager was finding his feet and also you have a number nine finding his feet. So under Amorim, that's the way it's been for him [Rasmus]. So hopefully, there's a clearer picture, a clearer identity given the preseason that we've had.",
      "\"There's more goals, like I said, and players that understand the Premier League getting more experience up top, in the top end of the pitch. You'd like to think that counts for a lot going into the new season, to help a new number nine coming into the building.\"",
      "While the two United legends may be at an impasse over what they see in the future for Sesko at Old Trafford, one opinion that is the most important is the striker himself – and he definitely backs his pedigree to bring success back to the famous stadium.",
      "Speaking to MUTV, the 22-year-old said: \"For me, the team is great. It is getting better and better and that's why also there is just stuff that makes you come there, gives you this energy that you want to be part of. I think it's a great project, in general, and I can't wait to start, definitely.",
      "\"I've just been here for a couple of hours and it's already been amazing. I can already feel that we're going to be a great family and it is a pleasure to be part of it.",
      "\"It feels good, you know, the thing is it [the badge] fits well and I'm looking forward to just playing in it a lot and try to represent in the good ways possible.\"",
      "Hojlund, meanwhile, has been adamant that he will be fighting for his place at the club, despite it appearing increasingly likely he will be on his way out of Manchester.",
      "Speaking during the recent pre-season tour in America, the Danish forward said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "In the time since that trip, though, Hojlund seems to have become more open to joining AC Milan. Time will tell if he offers Sesko competition for a place in the team this season.",

      "Manchester United were warned about spending £72million on striker Rasmus Hojlund, who ultimately has struggled to ever find his footing at Old Trafford.",
      "The recent acquisition of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74m has now intensified competition for the young Danish forward. Despite previously expressing his determination to fight for his place at United, the 22-year-old now appears to be considering a change of heart over his future, with AC Milan reportedly showing interest.",
      "United, crucially, could have avoided the costly misstep completely. The Telegraph reported earlier this year that United's financial modelling suggested that Hojlund, who was playing for Atalanta in Serie A at the time, was actually worth closer to £50m.",
      "Despite this, United executives proceeded with the transfer in August 2023, with an additional £22m included in the overall fee than what their own valuation for the player had suggested. Since then, Hojlund's market value has plummeted.",
      "The Danish international, who has netted 26 goals in 95 appearances for the club, is now estimated to be worth around £30m, reports the Mirror.",
      "United's data team wasn't the only voice of caution regarding the signing of Hojlund. His former manager at Atalanta, Gian Piero Gasperini, also expressed concerns that the move to Old Trafford was premature for the young striker.",
      "The current Roma boss played a crucial role in transforming Hojlund into a force during his time in Bergamo, where the striker scored 10 goals and registered four assists across 34 appearances. However, he expressed reservations about the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I think so (Hojlund should stay one more season),\" the 67-year-old said at the time. \"Then after that it's difficult. He undoubtedly has great talent, but also great room for improvement.",
      "\"These things are visible in both senses, he must work to improve because he has the characteristics to become one of the strongest strikers in the world.\"",
      "Gasperini's reservations were mirrored by two leading scouts whilst former United manager Erik ten Hag pursued the player. One of which said: \"He's still unproven and the Premier League is a very unforgiving place especially if you're in a Manchester United shirt.",
      "\"He's left-footed, strong and powerful so inevitably there will be some comparisons with [Erling] Haaland but he's not in his league. Haaland is a generational talent. Hojlund's stats don't come anywhere near Haaland and his finishing can be erratic.\"",
      "Hojlund is only two years into a five-year deal at United, but the club decided earlier this year to cash in if they recruited a new centre-forward – something they have now done with Sesko.",
      "United had hoped to offload Hojlund on a permanent deal this summer, but Milan are seeking to bring him on an initial loan to the San Siro.",
      "Hojlund was an unused substitute in United's pre-season 1-1 draw with Fiorentina, which actually marked the first time he did not appear in any of United's five pre-season matches this summer.",
      "Yet sources close to Hojlund felt he would have to leave United should they bolster their forward line with Sesko.",
      "Ruben Amorim has also refused to give assurances that the player would stay, suggesting Hojlund's time at Old Trafford now looks to be coming to an end.",

      "Alexander Isak and Newcastle United are at a bitter impasse as the star forward pushes for a departure, but the Swede could have ended up a Manchester United player had things gone differently.",
      "The 25-year-old made his intentions clear last month when he informed the Magpies of his desire to depart, and after Liverpool's £110million offer was turned down, neither side has given ground. Eddie Howe's team remain firm in their stance that he is not on the market and will wear a Newcastle top this season, while the player is reportedly refusing to play for the club again.",
      "Since joining in 2022, Isak has taken the Premier League by storm, surpassing his debut league goal tally of 10 with 21 two seasons ago and 23 last season. It's no shock that a team like Liverpool have caught his attention, but he has had admirers in England since his time with Real Sociedad in Spain.",
      "After attracting Borussia Dortmund's attention while playing in his home country of Sweden, Isak joined the German team but moved to Spain in 2019 after struggling for game time. At Sociedad, he became one of La Liga's most respected forwards, drawing the attention of many top clubs. One of those interested was Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, reports the Mirror.",
      "Speaking in 2024, years after Isak made his Newcastle switch, Guardiola admitted: \"At Real Sociedad, we started to follow him, we were impressed. He was a target. With his skills, all the clubs around the world take a look. I think he adapted really, really well in the Premier League.\"",
      "City's rationale for not chasing Isak more aggressively? Erling Haaland. The Athletic revealed during summer 2022 that the Norwegian represented Guardiola's No. 1 choice, with Isak ranked below him, and Haaland's arrival even convinced him to sign fresh terms at the Etihad.",
      "The Catalan secured his preferred option as Haaland's £51m Dortmund release clause was triggered that July, with the striker subsequently claiming two Premier League Golden Boot awards whilst netting 85 top-flight goals since 2022, compared to Isak's 54 strikes following his arrival later that summer.",
      "City weren't the only Manchester club to appreciate Isak's talents, with cross-city rivals United reportedly tabling a 'juicy offer' to the Sweden international that summer.",
      "Mundo Deportivo claimed that prior to Isak's £63m switch to Newcastle, the Red Devils – then under Erik ten Hag's guidance – had contacted his agents, who convinced the forward to reject their advances.",
      "Sociedad never received any formal approach from United regarding Isak, and after missing out on his services, Ten Hag commenced his maiden campaign with Cristiano Ronaldo spearheading the attack, though that arrangement notoriously came to an abrupt end in November of that year.",
      "Arsenal were another club that had Isak on their radar before he signed for the Magpies, and they perhaps came the closest to securing his signature with an informal offer.",
      "The Gunners were looking to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang up front and saw Isak as the perfect recruit. However, when they approached him in January 2022, they encountered some discrepancies regarding the Swede's price tag.",
      "Mikel Arteta's team tabled an informal £56m offer, which was significantly lower than Sociedad's estimations, as they were sticking to Isak's £74.7m release clause. The Athletic reported that this fee was simply too much for Arsenal, who viewed him as 'overpriced', and Isak ended up at St. James' Park the following summer while continuing to be monitored by the Gunners.",
      "A fee of £75m would now be considered a bargain for Isak, who, after Liverpool's £110m bid was rejected, is thought to be valued at a potential British record transfer sum of £150m by Newcastle.",

      "Harry Maguire has confessed his disappointment at losing the Manchester United captaincy - but had nothing but delight when Bruno Fernandes was chosen as his successor.",
      "Maguire was appointed Red Devils captain by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January 2020, just a few months after his £80million transfer from Leicester City. His tumultuous tenure with the armband, marked by intense criticism as United floundered under both Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, came to an end in 2023 when Erik ten Hag relieved him of the role.",
      "The former United manager passed the responsibility to Fernandes, who continues to lead the team on the pitch. Despite his personal disappointment, Maguire was committed to supporting his Portuguese colleague in any way possible, demonstrating his humbleness and loyalty to his team-mates.",
      "During an appearance on Rio Ferdinand Presents, Maguire said: \"When I was captain, Bruno gave me his full support. I leant on Bruno a lot to be honest.",
      "\"Whenever I had decisions to make, I had people around me like [David] de Gea, Bruno and Nemanja [Matic]. I had good experienced pros there and I always leant on them. I built a good relationship with Bruno when I was captain.",
      "\"Obviously, Erik decided to change the captaincy because I was not playing in that first season. I really wanted it to go to Bruno if I'm being honest and I told Bruno the same. He came up to me and I spoke to him. I said, 'Look, congratulations.'\"",
      "When the iconic United defender probed Maguire for details about his conversation with Ten Hag, the England international, who has 64 caps to his name, said: \"It was a sticky conversation. The season before, I just didn't feel as important to the club as I did under Ole.",
      "\"I think if you're the captain, you need to feel important, you need to have the backing of the manager, you need to have the backing of all the team. If you don't, it doesn't work.",
      "\"Bruno was Erik's guy. Bruno is a great leader. Like I said to Bruno, I said, 'If I have to give it away to anyone - and I didn't want to give it away to anyone - he'd be the man I would want to take this club forward.'",
      "\"He's a fantastic player, a great leader and, most importantly, he puts other people first. I think that's a big trait to have when you are a captain. He cares about others, he cares about improving others, he cares about helping others.",
      "\"There's a lot of players in this game who obviously play for themselves, rightly so it takes them far. But there's also a lot of players who care about the team and making other people better and making young lads come through, feel comfortable, and Bruno is one of those.\"",
      "Fernandes is set to lead Ruben Amorim's revamped United side into their new campaign at Old Trafford on Sunday as they take on Arsenal in their opening match of the Premier League season. The only way is up after finishing 15th and delivering an uninspiring performance in their Europa League final loss to Tottenham.",
      "Amorim has primarily concentrated on strengthening his attack with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, Maguire could be set for a crucial role in the Portuguese manager's defence. He will be vying with Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui for a spot in Amorim's three-man defence.",

      "Liverpool are set to sign one of their centre-back targets imminently, but another will probably have to wait a year. Elsewhere, Barca are reaching for the Dani Olmo lever…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Dani Olmo – Barcelona to Tottenham Hotspur\nReports in Spain suggest Barca are ready to sell Dani Olmo to create some much-needed headroom on their wage bill. Olmo was only able to be registered last season due to loopholes and appeals, and Barca’s problems persist – Marcus Rashford remains unregistered ahead of their La Liga opener at the weekend. So Barca would sell, of course. Are Spurs actually interested? We’re far less certain of that.",

      "",
      "19) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Besiktas\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days but Besiktas have emerged as a possible destination for Sancho. Apparently, their fans left five million comments on his most recent Instagram post. Which is lovely but United can’t take that to the bank. Besiktas are no more likely to pay than any of the other teams who’ve expressed an interest in Sancho, so this will go close to the deadline and wherever he goes, it’ll probably be a loan with wages covered.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. It comes down to this: Brighton value Baleba at £100million. Man Utd do not. Are Brighton likely to come down? No. No they are not.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick are wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Around £67million might persuade Pep to part with the Brazilian. But 67million is a much bigger number than 42 million. Maths, that.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be at least £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out. Elliott is said to be interested in what the Bundesliga has to offer.",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed.",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City\n13) 🔼 Kevin – Shakhtar Donetsk to Fulham\nFulham face the prospect of losing Rodrigo Muniz to Atalanta but the £30million-plus they receive from the Italians looks likely to be shifted straight to Shakhtar’s account in a deal which could break the Cottager’s record spend. It’s about time Fulham got around to doing something.",

And their dithering could leave the door open for…",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",
      "MORE ON EZE: Four real and compelling reasons why Eberechi Eze might choose Spurs over Arsenal",
      "10) Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. We doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step but it seems this one is moving forward. Which would improve Yoane Wissa’s mood.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have made a breakthrough with one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs are close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "6) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Christopher Nkunku in as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. Romano reckons a verbal agreement is almost done after the two clubs were talking around the £40million mark.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nIt looks like Forest will win the race for McAtee, who has attracted interest from Germany. Reports suggest he’ll cost north of £20m having agreed personal terms with the City Ground club.",

      "We bring you the top 10 favourites for the Golden Boot according to the latest odds; we will update once the Premier League goals start going in…",
      "",
      "10) Dominic Solanke (Tottenham)\nThe odds are long at 33/1 – he only scored nine Premier League goals last season – but he is still ahead of Omar Marmoush and Liam Delap among others. Perhaps the theory is that if Thomas Frank can coach a 20-goal campaign out of Bryan Mbeumo, he might just work wonders for Solanke. One thing we do know: The Golden Boot would get him on the plane to the World Cup.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nManchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million; it feels like they may have made a familiar mistake just because he is the wrong side of 28. But he scored 16 Premier League goals last season and remains Villa’s first-choice striker (we presume), and he will be supremely motivated ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United)\nSesko was the man left standing in the Manchester United striker position when the music stopped, but he scored only 13 Bundesliga goals in 24/25 so it feels like a massive ask for him to come to the Premier League and win the Golden Boot with a club that struggled with chance creation (and everything else) last season.",
      "",
      "6=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nThe odds have come in from 25/1 to 20/1 for the most expensive striker signing of the summer, but he did massively underscore according to his xG last season for Eintracht Frankfurt. Perhaps there is value to be found in backing Ekitike here; he did score in the Community Shield, after all.",
      "",
      "6=) Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nThe stand-out player as Chelsea won the Club World Cup but it’s tricky to envision a 15-goal Premier League season becoming the 25 goals – at least – necessary to win the Golden Boot. Mind you, we do think Chelsea might win the Premier League title after that summer.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nLooked excellent for Chelsea at the Club World Cup and in pre-season, with the Brazilian seemingly ready to lead the line ahead of Delap. The Brazilian has never scored more than 10 Premier League goals before, but he has never played in the Premier League with Cole Palmer, Estevao, Jamie Gittens and Pedro Neto before.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United, for now)\nNow we hit the big boys. Isak is a 7/1 shot to win the Golden Boot despite the fact that he might not kick a ball in the Premier League until after the transfer window has closed. Will he eventually play for Newcastle United, Liverpool or (don’t laugh) Tottenham?",
      "",
      "2=) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe Golden Boot holder broke several records on the final day of last season, but the Egyptian is now 33, it’s an Africa Cup of Nations season, and he’s no longer playing for a new contract.",
      "",
      "2=) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nThe top scorer in 2024 is only being beaten in 2025 by Kylian Mbappe, but he is untested at this kind of level. The final piece of the Arsenal jigsaw? If that’s true, the Golden Boot trophy will surely come with a Premier League title win.",
      "",

      "It seems that Gianluigi Donnarumma’s sudden availability has piqued the interest of one of the Manchester clubs: the wrong one…",
      "Donnarumma is desperate for a new club after it was made abundantly clear to the Italy goalkeeper that his services are no longer needed at PSG.",
      "First, the European champions signed his replacement, Lucas Chevalier, and in case Donnarumma had not quite got the message, he was left out of the squad for the UEFA Super Cup final before which Luis Enrique explained that he preferred ‘a different profile’ of goalkeeper.",
      "Hailing Donnarumma as “one of the very best goalkeepers out there and an even better man” makes it no less bitter a pill to swallow for a Champions League winner who intended to stay in Paris if renewal terms were agreeable. No doubt Enzo Raiola used interest anticipated from the Premier League as leverage in those doomed negotiations.",
      "Now Raiola and Donnarumma are left to gauge the level of genuine interest in signing one of the world’s top goalkeepers.",
      "Reports suggest Manchester City are keenest of the clubs who could afford the salary Donnarumma, currently on £210,000 a week at PSG, would demand on top of a transfer fee in the region of £25million.",
      "For City, though, such opportunism is unnecessary. For a few good reasons.",
      "First, they have already signed a goalkeeper this summer. City took their chance to match Newcastle’s offer to Burnley for James Trafford and the England stopper was delighted to return to the club he left in 2023.",
      "Now, Newcastle have been swerved by many players this summer and the allure of going back to his roots was strong. But ahead of a World Cup he intends to be a part of, would Trafford have returned just to sit on the bench when the No.1 shirt at Newcastle could have been his?",
      "Trafford, almost certainly, will have been given the nod to say that he will be City’s first choice. If not immediately then soon enough. A lot sooner than he might hope if Donnarumma follows him though the Etihad door.",
      "Did City need a new keeper at all? Ederson might not be the perfect goalkeeper – there isn’t one – but he has been perfect for City and the way Pep Guardiola insists upon dominating opponents.",
      "After eight years between Pep’s posts, around his 32nd birthday on Sunday, there are sensible sketches of a succession plan for Ederson. It is thought that any advances from Galatasaray might be welcomed and whether it is this summer or next, there is no doubt change is coming.",
      "The prospect of Donnarumma taking City’s gloves is bound to intrigue. But it would be a change too far.",
      "Ederson and Donnarumma have featured on every list of the world’s best goalkeepers for last five years but that is one of the few things they might have in common. As keepers, they are very different.",
      "Guardiola employs Ederson as a first line of attack more than a last line of defence. Which is fine when City have been as dominant as they have been since the Brazilian was brought from Benfica. The quality of his passing – the choice, variety and range – is just as important to Guardiola, perhaps more so, as the trustworthiness of his hands.",
      "You could argue that very few keepers have the talent in their feet that Ederson possesses. But Donnarumma isn’t close enough to make a swap viable.",
      "Donnarumma’s qualities lie in the more traditional aspects of goalkeeping. There are few better shot-stoppers in the world, because of the Italian’s size, speed, positional nous, and reactions. If you are looking for a keeper to guard your goal, Donnarumma is your man. If you’re minded to pick one to ping passes in possession, he is not. Which is a large part of why Luis Enrique ditched him.",
      "For Guardiola, open-minded though he is, that is a non-negotiable. One of his first acts as City boss was to bin Joe Hart and sign Claudio Bravo. A fantastic goalminder replaced by a playmaker in mitts. It set the tone for the next nine years under the Catalan.",
      "The traits he looks for in a goalkeeper are a non-negotiable. And Donnarumma simply doesn’t possess the right mix. Trafford is a better fit.",
      "🚨 MORE ON THE SUMMER TRANSFER FROM F365\n👉 Wirtz, Gyokeres, Mbeumo: Top 10 Premier League signings of the summer\n👉 Isak goes Full Kane in Liverpool transfer saga, and you never go Full Kane\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025",
      "There is a club across Manchester, though, who would benefit from a goalkeeper of Donnarumma’s type…",
      "United certainly need a new No.1. They appear tempted to kid themselves and persist with Andre Onana in their net while they throw resources at other priorities. Sure, their impotent forward line and the gaping hole in their midfield do command more urgency during this summer reset. But no one could watch United shamble through last season and pretend Onana is the reliable presence Ruben Amorim needs in his goal.",
      "From the half-hearted interest they showed in Emiliano Martinez, it would appear that United acknowledge the problem. And Donnarumma offers a golden opportunity to fix it.",
      "Of course Amorim wants a No.1 who can play with the ball at his feet but his goalkeeping priorities are weighted differently to Guardiola. If they are not, they really should be.",
      "More than anything, Amorim wants a reliable last line, one who relishes the responsibility of digging United out of the holes they dig for themselves. Not a keeper like Onana who has spent his two seasons at Old Trafford reaching for shovels.",
      "Onana was signed in part to improve United in possession. Maybe he is the Cameroonian Cruyff but he’s too busy fighting fires – and lighting his own – to pull strings.",
      "Which highlights that, in their sticks, United need a top-class goalkeeper above all else. In Donnarumma, they have an opportunity to sign one.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma’s agent has accused PSG of ‘zero respect’ and said his client will likely move to the Premier League this summer.",

      "While the transfer plans of Premier League teams are intimately known and reported on, less publicised is how foreign sides respond to the loss of a player.",
      "These are the six biggest sales made by clubs outside the Premier League this summer – not including Victor Osimhen as Napoli had already moved on with Scott McTominay – and who has been or is expected to be signed to replace them.",
      "",
      "The Florian Wirtz replacement – Malik Tillman\nBayer Leverkusen have fulfilled their obligations as the sanctioners of a nine-figure sale, reinvesting the Wirtz money through the rest of their squad on expensive defenders, lavish forwards, a Brentford keeper and, most delightfully of all, a Senegalese defender named Abdoulaye Faye.",
      "But the fairly substantial hole left by a chief creator with 34 goals and 35 assists in the last two seasons could not be left vacated.",
      "Tillman is a slightly different sort of player, not to mention a little older and less experienced. But at £30m he will be expected to carry much of the attacking burden for Erik ten Hag, even if the new manager has described replacing their crown jewel as “almost impossible”.",
      "",
      "The Hugo Ekitike replacement – Jonathan Burkardt\nSigned around three weeks before Ekitike was sold, there must nevertheless have been a sense that Burkardt could ultimately be part of a wholesale redesign of the attack rather than a complement to Frankfurt’s breakout star.",
      "The loss of Omar Marmoush in January had already put a new forward towards the top of Frankfurt’s transfer needs ahead of a campaign in the Champions League; another expensive Premier League sale in Ekitike meant almost the entire window has been spent building their frontline back up from the ground.",
      "Burkardt is more of a natural finisher than Ekitike and indeed Marmoush, but Ritsu Doan of Freiburg can help sort the creative side. Both cost around €22m each and will be sold within 18 months for three times that.",
      "",
      "The Benjamin Sesko replacement – Fabio Silva or Romulo\nThe career of Fabio Silva remains a wonderful mystery.",
      "Since becoming their record signing in 2020 on the back of 21 first-team career games, the Portuguese has scored more goals for three of the four clubs he has joined on loan than he has for Wolves. And the five he plundered for the exception to that rule, PSV, match his total Molineux haul.",
      "Yet with a year remaining on his contract and his last appearance for the club having come in November 2023, Wolves still want around £22m for the 23-year-old and will very likely get it.",
      "Borussia Dortmund have been sniffing around but Leipzig have reportedly agreed personal terms.",
      "Yet transfer fetishist Fabrizio Romano has thrown a curveball with the revelation that a £21.6m deal has been agreed with Goztepe for 23-year-old forward Romulo, ‘the Sesko replacement they always wanted’.",
      "",
      "The Martin Zubimendi replacement – Ezequiel Fernandez or Jon Gorrotxategi\nThere has been talk of academy product Gorrotxategi stepping into Zubimendi’s shoes after an impressive loan with Mirandes, but Real Sociedad seem far more likely to go down a more proven route.",
      "The most concrete link involved Al Qadsiah midfielder Fernandez but that trail has gone cold since a €20m bid was knocked back by the Saudis in July.",

      "And now Indykaila, who first broke the news of Man Utd’s interest in Baleba, have claimed that an ‘intense board meeting’ was held on Tuesday with Amorim demanding the Baleba signing.",
      "READ: PSR? What PSR? Eight Premier League sides in 10 biggest spenders of summer 2025",
      "Getting fans of the account excited on X, they wrote: ‘It’s been a few days since we last heard about Carlos Baleba, and we know many of you are eager for updates. Well, good news is on the way! We just got word that we’ll have fresh details in just a few hours. So, mark your diary for 2pm.’",

      "Reacting to the news of Sesko signing and the Red Devils’ interest in Baleba, Man Utd legend Ferdinand wrote on X: ‘Mobility in Man United attack. Let’s gooooo! Baleba now pls’.",
      "The caption had an accompanying video, in which Ferdinand said: “The mobility in the front areas now, is something, as a defender, I’m looking at and I’m thinking differently about Manchester United’s front line.",
      "“I’d be sitting there going, ‘I’m going to have a physical presence up there, I’m going to have a physical test from all three positions and I’ve got people who can run and move up there – they’re mobile, they’re the things I was asking for, the last couple of years up there.",

      "Featuring plenty of new signings and a few players with a point to prove, here’s one from every Premier League club we’re predicting to be a surprise package in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: Noni Madueke\nMax Dowman would have been a fun inclusion, but he’s only 15. The old saying is that ‘if you’re good enough, you’re old enough,’ but we can’t see Mikel Arteta giving the incredibly talented winger significant minutes this season.",
      "With that in mind, it’s a new winger we’re backing to be a surprise success at the Emirates. He cost around £50m and joined Arsenal amid fan protests online. #NoToMadueke was trending on X. There were petitions. Deplorable stuff from supposed ‘fans’. The big cheer the ex-Chelsea man received on his first touch at the Emirates underlines the difference between match-going supporters and those who live chronically online.",
      "Still, there are big doubts over Madueke’s ability to justify his big fee, exacerbated by him being another Chelsea player that Arteta has been bizarrely happy to take off their hands. Here’s hoping those doubts cease to exist in a couple of months.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins\nVilla have been pretty quiet in the summer window and new signings are usually the go-to for this kind of feature. With that in mind, we’re plonking for Watkins. Surprised? Understandable.",
      "We think Watkins has a point to prove. He’s been overlooked by Newcastle United all summer; Manchester United picked Benjamin Sesko over him, and Chelsea, Liverpool, and Arsenal ignored him to pursue other targets. Why? Because he’s 29. With the bit between his teeth this season, Villa might get the best season of Watkins’ career.",
      "Of course, this all relies on Watkins not being sold before the window closes.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Alex Scott\nWe’re predicting young Scott will elevate his game to another level this season. He remains one of the most promising young midfielders in the Premier League but has flown under the radar since swapping Bristol City for Bournemouth in August 2023.",
      "The 21-year-old is developing at a comfortable level, but this could be the season he truly explodes.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Yegor Yarmolyuk\nThere aren’t too many reasons to be optimistic as a Brentford fan. Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and Thomas Frank have all left, and Yoane Wissa will soon follow. It’s a difficult time, but the Bees with their Moneyball approach will feel well-equipped upstairs to cope with such drastic change.",
      "One of their players destined for a big-money departure within the next two years is Ukrainian midfielder Yarmolyuk. Expectations are high but zero goals or assists in 15 Premier League matches in 2024/25 was obviously a disappointing return. He literally can’t do any worse this season. We can see a Mikkel Damsgaard-like improvement on the horizon.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Brajan Gruda\nPicking one of Brighton’s many impressive signings would be too easy.",
      "Gruda finished last season strong, bagging his first Premier League goal along with three assists in Albion’s final five matches, of which they won four and drew one, courtesy of an 89th-minute Alexander Isak penalty for Newcastle.",
      "The 21-year-old German also impressed for his country at the Under-21 Euros this summer and is one to watch in the Premier League in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "Burnley: Hannibal Mejbri\nKnown as nothing more than a wrecking-ball passion merchant during his Manchester United days, Hannibal was impressive for Burnley in the Championship, helping them gain promotion with 100 points.",
      "His energy in the middle of the pitch will be important in the Clarets’ bid for survival. We’re not confident in the slightest about their survival chances, but we think the 22-year-old Moroccan can make a name for himself…if he doesn’t get sent off three times.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Estevao Willian\nNot enough people are aware of how good this young man is. Chelsea have picked up an absolute gem, who will hopefully be more Neymar than Robinho.",
      "The 18-year-old winger is not being loaned out, and the only thing holding him back from exploding this season is the vast number of wide forwards at Chelsea. And Alejandro Garnacho is expected to join from Man United.",
      "If Estevao gets sufficient minutes, he’ll establish himself as a regular starter for the Blues. Watch this space.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Daichi Kamada\nMany people backed Kamada to be the bargain of the season when he joined the Eagles for free last summer, but he was very underwhelming until around February, when he looked much more comfortable in Oliver Glasner’s team.",
      "He was a superb player for Glasner at Eintracht Frankfurt and the Japanese international is showing signs of getting close to that level again. If he does, Palace have a real gem.",
      "",
      "Everton: Jake O’Brien\nThere is too much of a bias towards attackers and midfielders, so Everton’s surprise package will be Irish defender O’Brien.",
      "He did well playing right-back under David Moyes and we reckon his consistency levels will be surprisingly good this season.",
      "Everton could be a fun team to watch this season, with Jack Grealish joining Iliman Ndiaye. If they get Tyler Dibling, I will be changing allegiance from Arsenal…",
      "",
      "Fulham: Calvin Bassey\nOne of the more difficult teams, Fulham. Benjamin Lecomte is their only summer signing so far, which is far from ideal.",
      "As a result, we’re going rogue. Bassey will be surprisingly…rubbish. Yep, he’s the one player we’re backing to go the other way.",
      "",
      "Leeds United: Dan James\nExcellent in the Championship, James has a point to prove in the top flight. Everyone thinks he’s nothing more than a pace merchant in the big league. Time to show everyone they were wrong about you, kid.",
      "There are a few new signings we considered, such as Anton Stach and Jaka Bijol, but ultimately opted for former Man United winger James.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Conor Bradley\nOur logic is simple: Bradley will usurp Jeremie Frimpong as Arne Slot’s first-choice right-back. Frimpong as an out-and-out full-back scares us. Sure, he will have lots more attacking responsibility than defensive, but he’s more vulnerable playing there than Trent Alexander-Arnold ever was. And Trent got away with it thanks to his world-class technical ability. Frimpong has to do the same by chipping in with goals and assists for Liverpool or Bradley will seize his opportunity.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Tijjani Reijnders\nPeople don’t realise how good this guy is. Reijnders will take the Premier League by storm. Just you wait.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Joshua Zirkzee\nNobody knows this guy’s best position, but he might just stumble across it this season. He’s made for one of those ‘wide 10’ roles in Ruben Amorim’s system, and while Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have been signed, Zirkzee should get enough minutes to impress and give his head coach a real selection headache.",
      "Failing that, Zirkzee will become a more technical version of the Joelinton we’ve seen transform from a bumbling striker to an outstanding box-to-box midfielder for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Newcastle United: Aaron Ramsdale\nThe surprise of Newcastle’s summer is Alexander Isak’s desire to leave. Or being rejected by most of their top targets after qualifying for the Champions League and winning a major trophy. It’s not been fun.",
      "But watching Ramsdale should be interesting this season. He’s one of the few players Newcastle have convinced to join them this summer, yet fans are underwhelmed. Just as Arsenal fans were when they signed him. They quickly fell in love with the eccentric goalkeeper, and we think the same will happen in the north east.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Igor Jesus\nForest ended last season poorly, which cost them Champions League football. They were knackered and simply ran out of steam. That points towards more struggles this term, with the Thursday-Sunday schedule destined to take its toll. Nuno Espirito Santo needs a big and fit squad after using the fewest players in last season’s Premier League (23).",
      "With that in mind, we’re backing a summer signing to be Forest’s surprise package. Signed from Botafogo, Jesus scored match-winning goals in the Club World Cup against Seattle Sounders and European champions Paris Saint-Germain. More of the same in Our League, please.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Chris Rigg\nThe Black Cats have been busy bees this summer. At the time of writing, they’ve signed 11 players. Their most notable addition is undoubtedly former Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka, while there are high hopes for Simon Adingra, Habib Diarra and Noah Sadiki. Those three signings give us 2023/24 Burnley flashbacks, but we have higher hopes for this mob. And no, we’re not being naive. Shut up.",
      "Anyhow, the surprise star could well be Chris Rigg. The 18-year-old midfielder is destined for big things but is unlikely to be a regular starter in the Premier League, which is fine. We think that could change, with Rigg standing out in Regis Le Bris’ side, forcing the French manager to make him a key player.",
      "",
      "Tottenham Hotspur: Mohammed Kudus\nCan a £55m signing really be a surprise star? Probably not. They are expected to do well. Regardless, Kudus is our Spurs representative.",
      "Under Thomas Frank, and in a positive atmosphere after a miserable season for West Ham, we think Kudus will thrive, exceeding expectations to make Spurs both fun to watch and competent. Unthinkable, innit? Big Ange could never balance the two.",
      "Here’s a prediction that nobody asked for and unnecessarily puts our neck on the line: 12 goals, seven assists in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Jean-Clair Todibo\nAre we optimistic about West Ham this season? Absolutely not. Do any of their new signings stand out as especially exciting? Nope. Are we inspired by anyone in their squad enough to claim they’ll be a surprise star this season? Nah. Yet, we’ve somehow stumbled onto Todibo.",
      "The French centre-back flopped in his first season at the London Stadium, but the Hammers were forced to sign him permanently from Nice for over £25m, having set the incredibly low buy-obligation bar of avoiding relegation.",
      "After a difficult year, we are backing Todibo to be a much bigger success this term. He won’t become a leading Premier League defender, but we’re fairly sure his consistency levels will rise and he’ll become one of West Ham’s more reliable players.",
      "",
      "Wolves: David Moller Wolfe\nCards on the table…I don’t know an awful lot about Wolfe. What I do know is that he’s a left-back coming to the Premier League from AZ Alkmaar. Milos Kerkez did that two years ago and he turned out pretty good.",
      "Replacing Rayan Ait-Nouri will be tough, but not as tough, or as high-profile, as replacing Matheus Cunha, which Fer Lopez and Jhon Arias have been tasked with doing. It’s a big job for Wolfe, but there’s not the same pressure, which is only a good thing. Wing-back is a vitally important position these days and Vitor Pereira’s style of play should enable the 23-year-old to thrive in 25/26.",
      "READ NEXT: Cunha, Mbuemo or Sesko could be Man Utd’s Eric Cantona this season…",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is “not really worried” about the Red Devils being linked to Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins this summer.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, but Liverpool have speculated to accumulate the most expensively.",
      "Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice has hit out at the Gunners fans that criticised the signing of Noni Madueke before he even arrived at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "An ex-Arsenal striker has urged the Gunners to sign a free agent forward after sealing the £63m deal for Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",
      "Marc Cucurella has questioned the timing of Noni Madueke’s transfer to Arsenal, calling it ‘strange’ and a missed opportunity.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit."

      "",
      "Mustafa is back…\nWe talk about football like it’s a science. Systems, xG, squad depth, rotations. And yet, season after season, one truth keeps punching through the data: sometimes, one player really does make all the difference.",
      "Eric Cantona proved it. United in the early ’90s were talented but incomplete. Ferguson’s team had promise, but not inevitability. Cantona arrived from Leeds in ’92 and instantly tilted the Premier League on its axis. It wasn’t just his goals or assists – rather it was the attitude and swagger. United stopped hoping to win and started expecting to. Four titles in five seasons. That’s not coincidence.",
      "Leicester had their own catalyst in N’Golo Kanté. Vardy’s goals and Mahrez’s magic made headlines, but without Kanté’s supernatural ground coverage, they’re not lifting that trophy in 2016. The next season, he did exactly the same thing for Chelsea. Back-to-back titles with two different clubs? Try replicating that in Football Manager.",
      "Not every talisman brings a title, but the uplift can still be obvious. Bruno Fernandes didn’t win the league for United when he arrived in January 2020, but he did jolt the whole side awake. Before Bruno: hesitant, flat, predictable. After Bruno: quick, risk-taking, and suddenly worth watching again.",
      "It works the other way, too. Lose the wrong player, and the drop can be instant. United selling Jaap Stam in 2001 remains one of Ferguson’s few open regrets. The defence was never quite the same until Vidić arrived years later.",
      "City felt it when Vincent Kompany left in 2019. The squad was still stacked, but the leadership gap was obvious. You can’t measure what Kompany brought with stats alone – the calm in the chaos, the barked instructions, the refusal to shrink. His thunderbolt against Leicester in the 2019 title run-in wasn’t just a goal; it was a captain grabbing the season by the throat.",
      "Injuries and suspensions can have the same seismic impact. Cantona’s kung-fu ban in ’95 arguably cost United the title. More recently, City losing Rodri for a spell last season was the closest thing to vulnerability they’ve had in years. Without him, they dropped points and looked – briefly – mortal. When your defensive midfielder is also your tempo-setter, organiser and outlet, losing him is like removing the keystone from an arch.",
      "Which brings us to the here and now. Who’s to say one of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbuemo, or Benjamin Šeško couldn’t be that magic switch for United this season? Maybe even one-third of that trio. Football history is full of players who arrived without fanfare but altered the whole weather system of a club.",
      "And yes – for United to finish outside the top seven after the last two seasons wouldn’t shock anyone. But them winning the league? That’s still possible. All the hand-wringing and mockery after I dared to suggest it last time was fascinating. People talk like the gap between first and fifteenth is a canyon. It isn’t. This is the top tier. Everyone starts with zero points, everyone’s an elite athlete with two legs and a brain wired for competition. Margins, not mountains, decide things.",
      "Fans of clubs like United don’t watch for the comfort of ‘respectable’ finishes. We’re not and never want to be Arsenal – popping champagne for fourth place. Eww! We watch for the thrill of potential glory. For the hope that the next signing, the next breakthrough, the next moment of magic might turn a season. That’s the drug.",
      "Because sometimes it only takes one player. Sometimes it’s the swagger of a Cantona, the legs of a Kanté, the leadership of a Kompany, or the control of a Rodri. Sometimes it’s a kid no one’s talking about in August who’s a household name by May.",
      "And that’s why, even when the data, the form table and the pundits all say ‘be realistic’, I can’t bring myself to close the door. In elite sport, the difference between unforgettable and forgettable can walk into the room wearing one set of boots.\nMustafa (no-one can drink what I’m having because its not for sale)",

      "It might not all come to pass, one or two deals might fall through but even then can anyone tell me a transfer window that comes close?",
      "We may or may not win the league with the above, not because I’m lowering expectations just because integrating that amount of players in a few weeks is an impossible task. But with the above summer done and one of the finest coaches in the world at developing even average players in situ the mind boggles at what this Liverpool have become.",
      "And even if it is the greatest flop in history, no one will ever take this window away from me: it’s been like thinking you’re going to your local Tesco to get the milk, meeting Scarlet Johansson in the baking aisle and spending a weekend together in the Maldives.",

      "Liverpool haven’t so much as replaced an entire XI but it’s certainly looking a substantially different side. And I’d have said as much before the Palace loss at Wembley and before some of the mid-summer friendlies even took place because you simply cannot swap so many new faces with expectations of immediate cohesion. As new players cascaded in while others departed (via transfer or tragedy) I remember thinking to myself, Arne will have some job on his hands come August.",

      "Most probably understand the performance merits that come with teammate familiarity and a settled dressing room, which is why I’m surprised so many have installed Liverpool as easy title favorites. Pundits and mailboxers alike are so lazy in their thinking I often wonder if people are just generally getting stupider, or if social media takes away the need to procure any modicum of original thought or make one’s own analysis. Oh I’ll just say what he or she’s said in a different but louder way and be done with it.",
      "I swear this is not disingenuous sandbagging to alleviate pressure from a big spend (or potential ridicule from rival clubs’ supporters), it’s only an honest assessment from what I see taking place, and what I think will happen. And that is, simply, that I don’t believe Liverpool are title favorites.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, we’re absolutely in with a shout and I reckon we’re built now (with pieces presumably still to come, in this or future windows) to contend for many, many seasons to come. I just don’t know if I truly believe 2025-26 is our year to instantly gel and win it again at first time of asking. I say “first time of asking” because I don’t ever recall being title favorites in the prem era, full stop.",

I’d like to know how many people include players that they’ve never or rarely seen play, just because of their reputation. I’m 57 and many of the greats of the game (Best, Pele, Cruyff, Beckenbauer, Eusebio) passed me by, because I was too young and there wasn’t a lot of football on the telly back in the day. We got one first division (think Premier League but on a smaller, grainier picture) match a week, and not from the start of the season*, plus some cup matches and the big day in May when we had a full day’s coverage of the FA Cup Final (believe it or not, this was the pinnacle of the football season for most people once upon a time).",

Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires, Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry were all in that category for me.",

However, with other players, both in the Premier League and other European leagues, I can only rely on the matches that I see them play and trust that they put in similar performances in all the games that I don’t see. Maybe everyone else in the mailbox does nothing else but watch matches from all around the world and know more than I do. I judge players by what I see and the joy they bring (regardless of who they play for) not by their reputation and the hot takes of others.",

Still the greatest night of my football supporting life.\nDave AFC",

      "Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike have joined Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, respectively, meaning they are no longer headlining this ranking of the 10 best available strikers.",
      "Despite signing Ekitike, Liverpool are still in for Newcastle United rebel Alexander Isak, who has crashed into this ranking to take top spot.",
      "We also have the best available attacking midfielders, centre-backs, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Lois Openda (RB Leipzig)\nLeipzig have already lost Benjamin Sesko, but they are reportedly willing to listen to offers for Openda, who has scored 33 goals in 67 Bundesliga matches.",
      "Sunderland have, ambitiously, been linked with the Belgian, while Aston Villa chose Evann Guessand over him.",
      "",
      "9) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African striker’s move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers can’t be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football shouldn’t turn their nose at him, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",
      "",
      "8) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldn’t be ruled out either. But yes, a return to Turin feels inevitable.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping £80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but he’s only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. He’s been a colossal flop but there’s still hope for Kolo Muani.",
      "MORE: Ten players in the Club World Cup shop window for Premier League scouts",
      "",
      "7) Aleksandar Mitrovic (Al Hilal)\nMitrovic has been sitting around, watching his current employers aggressively pursuing striker after striker all summer. They eventually landed Darwin Nunez, which removes his name from this ranking and allows Mitrovic to crash in.",
      "A return to the Premier League has been mooted and there are plenty of teams that could be a lot worse. He’s scored 68 in 79 for the Saudi club, which does beg the question: Why did they want a new striker so badly? Ah well, their loss is another team’s gain. If Leeds United could pull this off, it would be an incredible coup.",
      "",
      "6) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him – it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "5) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, and the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford don’t want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning £65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting £27m for David Raya and £40m for Ivan Toney.",
      "Having broken a promise to the striker, the Bees are actively scouring the market for a replacement, so Wissa can get his move to Newcastle for around £30m.",
      "",
      "4) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nDuring his time at Leipzig, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino’s team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. Newcastle have been linked, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa. A return to Germany seems the most likely move, with Leipzig keen on a reunion.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If he’s available for under £35m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors. We have to assume he isn’t available for under £35m, because there are hardly any suitors.",

      "",
      "3) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface is the forgotten striker of the 2025 summer transfer window. He’s the third-best available one out there, yet there is nothing to suggest he could leave Leverkusen this summer.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "2) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentford’s Wissa. That’s why Manchester United picked Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Hello, Newcastle.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nThis is getting awfully messy. Isak reportedly informed Newcastle of his decision to leave last month, amid interest from Liverpool. Since then, the Reds have failed with a £110m bid, the Magpies have failed to sign their number-one target to replace him, Benjamin Sesko, Isak hasn’t featured in pre-season, is training alone, has moved out of his house, and most importantly, was not allowed any hotdogs.",
      "Liverpool have already spent over £100m on Florian Wirtz, £70m combined on full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and an initial £69m on Ekitike, but they still want Isak. After selling Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz for over £100m, we should expect a second bid. £150m should do it.",
      "Isak is one of the best strikers in world football, and his transfer stance has shocked many and rightly upset Newcastle fans, who are now dreading the loss of their talisman. The Swedish international has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances for the Magpies.",
      "",
      "Even some Liverpool fans are not happy about the Alexander Isak situation; would buy-out clauses help prevent this?",
      "You might think that Newcastle have had a ‘mare this summer but it turns out that everything is brilliant actually. Phew.",
      "Ex-Newcastle midfielder Nicky Butt has hit out at Alexander Isak over his treatment of the Magpies fans and his fellow team-mates amid Liverpool interest.",
      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney thinks Liverpool will “be unstoppable” if they manage to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle this summer.",
      "There is glee about a Proper Title Race, debate over whether Viktor Gyokeres will fly or flop, a tip for Nuno to be sacked and excitement over…Everton?!",
      "Liverpool have been told how they can ‘break the logjam’ and sign Alexander Isak this summer as Newcastle ‘still need a number of positions’."

      "1) There will be a proper title fight – Liverpool look to have spent very well, however we all know that players coming into the Prem from other leagues are not guaranteed to be successful. I also think they look a bit thin at the back, and one serious injury to a first-choice centre back leaves them vulnerable.

You can’t 100% rule out Cunha having a ‘Cantona Moment’ and ending up in the crowd with his studs deep in someone’s neck, however you also can’t rule out him being utterly fabulous. He was just born to be a United player, wasn’t he?",

      "4) Glasner will not be Crystal Palace manager at the end of the season – Clearly there are some frustrations with regards to recruitment at The Dogtrack (yes, I still miss you, Ted, Beard and Co.), and Glasner is also in the last year of his contract. A sticky start for Kompany at The Alianz, and it’s next-stop Munich for Olly G.",
      "5) Brentford could be many, many different kinds of f*cked – No explanation necessary, and still wishing you the best of luck, Keith.\nLeeds or Sunderland (or both) to stay up – I genuinely think Farke is a very good coach, and I think Sunlun’ have easily spent the best money of the three promoted teams. Given my previous comment regarding Brentord, and also with a slight worry for Wolves, I don’t think it’s out of the question one of, or even both Leeds and Sunlun’ survive (just). But what of Burnley I hear you ask, well……..",

Clearly, he also had a plan to beat Liverpool and, in something that vindicates one of my opinions if not one many others would share, it involved Virgil van Dijk. A lot of people would understandably force play away from the Best Defender in the World, but that is to buy into the hype instead of seeing with your own eyes.",
      "For the past few seasons, van Dijk has been repeatedly guilty of ball-watching and many of the goals Liverpool concede, particularly against counter-attacking sides, come as a result of this.",
      "For the first goal, van Dijk is supposed to be marking Jean-Philippe Mateta, but leaves him to lunge in at Sarr without getting the ball. There was no need to make that tackle, had he simply held his position in the line Sarr would not have been able to shoot. For the second goal, he is not the only Liverpool player suckered in. When Wharton receives the ball, van Dijk is isolated two on one by Mateta and Sarr, but is actually covering neither of them because he is only looking at the ball. Taking a couple of steps towards Wharton gives the Palace man enough time and space to realise Sarr is completely unmarked. If van Dijk holds his position in the defensive line, there is significantly less chance Palace score.",

I’ve no idea why someone would deliberately interrupt a tribute like that and can’t quite believe it has happened. There’s been very little ill will between Liverpool and Crystal Palace over the years, something underlined by those fan groups encouraging people to support the silence (and by Liverpool and Everton fans singling out Palace for their absence of poverty chants), I don’t know why you’d want to change that.",
      "* Speaking of ill will with Liverpool, we come to Notts “Nottingham” Forest. Again, it’s weird that a club without a history of being rivals with Palace should celebrate defeat at the CAS with the combined glee of winning the European Cup with Brian Clough and seeing Derby County getting relegated. Then again, despite the constant reminders in West Bridgford and beyond, we are a long way removed from that era of Forest. Towards the end of last season they were a bit like a Roy Hodgson team, blessed with some superb attacking talent but not really doing a lot of attacking, and not scoring many goals. How much longer that’s tolerated by their notoriously calm, measured and patient owner remains to be seen.",
      "Forest fans have really shown their arse the past few weeks. Smugly saying “rules are rules” throughout Palace’s legal challenge, conveniently ignoring the rules they broke in open and shut fashion over the previous couple of seasons and complained like hell about being punished for. Palace’s challenge did have merit even if it was unsuccessful, although if history has taught us anything about Forest supporters is that they aren’t that keen on standing up to the authorities, or solidarity with others.",
      "* At least now we can get on with the season, which starts away at Chelsea on Sunday. It wouldn’t be Chelsea if there wasn’t some sort of squad overhaul ongoing, but the players they do have are more than capable of winning the game. Palace meanwhile have a settled squad and a draw plus tie-breaker win over Liverpool under their belts, so it should be a fun one.\nEd Quoththeraven",

As it is surely clear to any reasonable, unbiased person, we are not one of the MCO’s that UEFA, in their rules at least, seem to be trying to prevent. The details have been well documented, but expecting Palace to have done something by that deadline when, by their own club’s setup, Textor had no decisive influence seems absurd for a club that was bottom-half and had never won anything or played in Europe before…. who then did their utmost to correct the situation and can now literally have no affect on the integrity of the competition, which surely is the whole point of the MCO rules.",

That said, since the World Class article was published, and through the myriad conversations I’ve had since, I did want to try to figure something out.",

I’ll admit, I’ve actually had my heart-rate increase this week when discussing some of the wilder takes (probably the cakes, mind but still) but on reflection, I realised the problem was that my definition of world class is about inclusion and so because of that it became personal to me that someone would think Paul Gascoigne wasn’t a world class footballer, not because I care about Gazza, (though I do, god bless him) but because I will never not feel that moments of magic are just as important as rote consistency in our game.",
      "To try to restrict who is world class, who is bargain bin, who is bang average, and who is Lee Cattermole, when definable boundaries are not clear, is to deflect yourself onto the discussion. Those that disclude goalkeepers clearly don’t value what a goalkeeper can do, but also might be fair to say are risk averse individuals… the kind who at 5 a side belts up the pitch, loses the ball then just turns and watches as his 4 mates get torn apart by his failings and shrugs. Those that want 300 players to be World Class are the intelligent ones who… I kid, obviously, but I am aware my desire to be inclusive shows a large part of my lack of standards. The fact I genuinely think the impressive careers of Milner and Barry, great as they were, haven’t left the same cultural impact on football that say, the short careers of Wilshere or Dele did… (now THAT’s a hot take.)",
      "So for my part, while I remain resolute that “my” version of World Class is one that is more inclusive of the deficiencies of football (after all, what IS a perfect footballer?*) and allowing of bad days, I do want to make it clear that I appreciate some don’t like to colour outside the lines, or hear a bum note in a live album, and I am here for it, for it is our differences that make our sport what it is.",

Using his definition of talent evidenced anywhere on the pitch, what defenders were or are world class? Maldini? Baresi? Maybe Rio?

      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 23:50, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has described Manchester United as \"reactionary\" and being in \"no man's land\" - and has called on his club to \"make a plan and stick to it.\"",
      "Rashford departed United to join Barcelona on loan for the upcoming season after a similar, successful spell at Aston Villa for the second half of last season. This was after the forward had been frozen out of United's first-team by Ruben Amorim.",
      "And now, Rashford has hit out at the club's strategy in recent years - saying the club have not begun a transition yet because they do not have a recognisable style of play throughout the club.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been: we're hungry to win, so we'll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it's reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction's always changing, you can't expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it's because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team - you're not there by accident.",
      "\"We've been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over the last six months - what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we've been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it's like the actual transition's not started yet.",
      "\"To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. So this is the thing that I feel - it's not easy. Because if it's not going well, the fans demand [change].",
      "\"But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we've had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win … you end up in the middle of - you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed which managers have been the most influential in his career - citing Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as inspirations - but he left out Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "The forward also went into detail about Mourinho's desire to win at United - irrespective of how well you played.",
      "\"They're different but because we've had so many different managers, it's impossible for me to compare [them],\" added Rashford.",
      "\"Up until Jose, I never had a manager who was so fixated on winning. Van Gaal was fixated on winning but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose didn't care.",
      "\"Of course, if he could choose, he would want you to play well, but if you win, you win and move onto the next game. He had this attitude.",
      "\"And it was confusing for me as all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style and winning in a certain way.",
      "\"And in the beginning I was angry all the time - because we had not played well and we won. But because we won and he is a manager who is just a winner, he didn't bring up the points that you know were missing from that last game. Because we've won.",
      "\"But when we lost, he would bring up the points then. After six months, I learned to respect it and reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed the importance of the move to Barcelona on his chances of making England's World Cup squad next summer.",
      "The 27-year-old was named in new head coach Thomas Tuchel's first Three Lions squad back in March - but missed the June camp due to injury.",
      "\"I try not to put too much pressure on the England set-up,\" said the Barcelona forward. \"It's clearly something I want to do.",
      "\"But you don't get that without putting in the hard work just day in, day out. And showing the hard work on the pitch. That's a knock-on effect to the stuff I'll be doing day in, day out.",
      "\"This current group of English players is extremely talented, it's going to be disappointing if we don't manage to go on and do something really special because I think we've come on a lot. For the last few years, it's been: the next step is to go on and win.\"",
      "Rashford also paid tribute to his former club Villa - saying the brief spell at Unai Emery's side went \"exactly how it was supposed to be\" after struggling at United.",
      "\"The timing of me going to Villa, now looking back, it was the exact time for me to do something like that,\" he said. \"The response and reaction of what I got from the people at the club and the fans, it was what I needed in that moment.",
      "\"Six months on, I feel like everything is completely different. Everything I did at Villa, apart from the injury at the end, was exactly how it was supposed to be. The club's on the up so the atmosphere at the club in that dressing room was positive.\""

      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 16:54, UK",
      "No 9s and No 10s have been the talk of the summer and big money has been spent in the pursuit of goals.",
      "Chelsea are hanging their hopes on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Arsenal have got all their eggs in the Viktor Gyokeres basket, while Man United have gone wild and revamped their entire forward line by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £207m.",
      "Liverpool have front-loaded, too, splashing a nine-figure sum on Florian Wirtz before pushing overall spending beyond the £250m mark with a £79m outlay on Hugo Ekitike.",
      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",
      "His versatility across a fluid frontline will nevertheless be helpful to Enzo Maresca, who could use Pedro as a second striker behind the former Ipswich target man if he so wishes - or even on the wing.",
      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",
      "Pep Guardiola professed not to want wholesale change at Manchester City midway through last season's disastrous collapse, but that appears to be what he's got. City went big in January and have invested further this summer.",
      "Rayan Cherki has drawn most excitement, not least because of comparisons with one Lionel Messi - which may have as much to do with his short stature as his impressive close ball control, but any association with the great Argentinian has got to be deemed favourable.",
      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",

      "Ready to do it all again? The 2025/26 Premier League season is here; An epic title race awaits, goals are guaranteed & newly promoted teams up for the scrap; \"The Premier League is on a completely different level to anything else in world football,\" says Jamie Carragher",
      "Thursday 14 August 2025 06:22, UK",
      "The Premier League is back and has all the ingredients in the mix for this season to have serious G.O.A.T potential.",
      "For most of us the Premier League runs through our veins. Admit it, a little part of us has been missing these past few months. It is part of the fabric of society in this country - of why we all love this game.",
      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",
      "Wayne Rooney's first Everton goal that meant his world would never be the same again. Thierry Henry turning it on against Liverpool, bewildering our very own Jamie Carragher along the way, to keep Arsenal on track in the title race.",
      "David Beckham from halfway. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. Collymore closing in.",
      "Aguerooooo.",
      "Kevin Keegan loving it.",
      "Andrea Bocelli, Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City.",
      "Well, it's time to create new moments that are stamped in our memory banks as the 2025/26 Premier League rolls into town. And all the ingredients have been added to the pot to make this season one of the greats.",
      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",
