      "Ruben Amorim's position at Manchester United is under significant scrutiny after his post-match press conference following Sunday's 1-1 stalemate at Leeds United raised more concerns than it addressed.",
      "Matheus Cunha equalised Branden Aaronson's early strike in the second period, marking back-to-back 1-1 draws against lower-table Premier League opposition. Yet it was Amorim's comments afterwards that dominated the headlines.",
      "The United manager had already hinted at discontent on Friday when discussing the club's January transfer strategy. Now, his remarks following the Elland Road draw have cast further uncertainty over his professional relationship with Jason Wilcox.",
      "Here, The Mirror provides every word from the Portuguese manager's press conference at Leeds..",
      "\"I think we did well. We improved a lot of things that compared to the last game. We controlled quite well the aggressively of the offensive from Leeds. We controlled well one against one. A really good environment, really funny environment, and they did well.\"",
      "\"We controlled more the possession, the connection, the position of the players. I think they were in the better positions to play, and that can show in the way we played. We had more chances than the opponent to score, but we need to not to think about the next one.\"",
      "\"It's really important. I think Ben improved in the connection today. Josh, the 20 minutes that he played, he was active. He was creating chances, creating spaces for us. It's important. Also, Manu [Ugarte] played better today and helped the team also to create chances. So it was better than last week.\"",
      "\"First of all, to miss the chances that he's missing he's always there, and that is the first step. He's really aggressive when the ball goes to the side. He's really aggressive when he has to fight for the first ball. Of course, when you look at the game of a striker, if you miss chances, they will say that the player did everything wrong. I don't agree. I think the right position. He just need to score one and then all the weight that he has on top of him is going to disappear and he's going to be better.\"",
      "\"Josh needs to be prepared to play in every game. All the players need to be ready. If you play 20 minutes, you need to play 20 minutes to help the team. He does that. He's a player from our team. That's it.\"",
      "\"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.\"",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club. No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",

      "Leeds have confirmed that a supporter tragically died at Elland Road on Sunday ahead of their game against Manchester United. The two teams met for a Premier League match which ended in a 1-1 draw.",
      "In a statement released three hours after full-time, the Yorkshire club said: \"Leeds United are devastated to confirm that a supporter sadly passed away ahead of our Premier League fixture with Manchester United at Elland Road, following a medical emergency in the ground before kick-off.",
      "\"The thoughts of everyone at Leeds United are with the family and friends of the supporter at this exceptionally difficult time.\"",
      "No further details about the person who died or the circumstances of their passing have been released.",
      "Leeds took the lead shortly after the hour mark, as Brenden Aaronson opened the scoring. Matheus Cunha replied for the visitors three minutes later and nothing could separate the sides before the final whistle.",
      "The result moved Leeds six points clear of the relegation zone and continued their good run of form. Man United, meanwhile, remained fifth in the table.",
      "\"First of all, I have to say I am proud of my lads because it was, of course, a tricky circumstance for us,\" Leeds manager Daniel Farke commented. \"We had to go over the line two and a half days ago, away at Liverpool to earn a hard-fought clean sheet, then several key players out and not available for today.",
      "\"Everyone tells you how big this game is. Lots of expectations and to go into this game is then tricky. So for that, I am very proud of the mentality of my players to show resilience again.\"",
      "Man United boss Amorim reflected: \"I think we played well. I think we had more control in this game than we showed against Wolves, that is also important when you prepare [for] the next week, you can run with a different message than we showed in the last game.",
      "\"I think we controlled Leeds quite well, a team that is really strong on set-pieces and with second balls, they are really quick in front and I think we controlled it well. We had our opportunities to win the game, of course, but we are losing games in the details. With the goal of Leeds, we are controlling the game and in one kick with the ball in transition.",
      "\"But we managed to get back into the game, last year it would be completely different. This year we are in control of the games more often than last year, so [it] was a good game, but of course, a little bit frustrated for us not to win.\"",

      "But the formula hasn't been a winning one, as the Red Devils slumped to their worst-ever Premier League finish last season, ending up in 15th place. Amorim also oversaw an early exit in the FA Cup and a defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "This season, United crashed out of the Carabao Cup at the first hurdle, losing to League Two side Grimsby Town. Although their league form has been better this term, Amorim remains under pressure - and not just externally.",

      "When Ruben Amorim arrived at Manchester United in November 2024, his reputation proceeded him and one aspect stood out: his rigid tactical philosophy.",
      "In the 2001 cult classic film, Mike Bassett: England Manager, the Three Lions boss coins a catchphrase: \"England will be playing four-four-f***ing-two.\" If Amorim were asked before each of his 63 matches as United manager what formation his side would play, his response would be similar, albeit less catchy.",
      "United will be playing 3-4-2-1. And that will not be changing.",
      "Amorim had massive success with the approach at Sporting Lisbon and he was hired on the understanding that it would come with him to Old Trafford. He has spent the last 14 months trying his best to make it work, but there was a telling comment on Christmas Eve.",
      "“We can play a different way to take more quality from these players because I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and need time,\" Amorim told reporters. \"I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt.\"",
      "Finally, the penny appeared to have dropped. The following game saw United claim a 1-0 win over Newcastle, in which they finished the game with Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia as a makeshift back four.",
      "But days later, a home game against Wolves, the Premier League's bottom side, Amorim reverted to type - a move Gary Neville branded 'backwards'. Joshua Zirkzee's deflected goal opened the scoring, but a drab - and injury and AFCON-depleted - side drew 1-1 at Old Trafford.",
      "Deprived of Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad, Amorim showed he was willing to adapt. And yet, when they went to Elland Road on Sunday, Amorim went with the tried, tested and turgid.",
      "In a dour first half, it was safety first for the away side against their rivals. Only when Zirkzee was introduced in the 63rd minute for Yoro did the tide turn for United as the Dutchman produced a lovely through ball for Matheus Cunha to tuck into the net and earn a point in a 1-1 draw.",
      "United's indifferent recent form owes much to an injury crisis coinciding with the Africa Cup of Nations. Amorim is working with a thin squad and has therefore opted for pragmatism over everything else. But it seems that his understanding that adaptation is needed has only come after he was told that funds will not be made available in the January transfer.",

      "The injury has also coincided with other absences. Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, while Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt are all available due to injuries.",
      "United had a thread-bare substitutes' bench at Elland Road on Sunday, with Joshua Zirkzee, Altay Bayindir and Tyrell Malacia the only three senior players amongst a group of academy players. Matheus Cunha earned United a point with a finish from Zirkzee's through ball after Brenden Aaronson put Leeds ahead.",

      "It ended honours even, with Matheus Cunha salvaging a point for Manchester United, after Brenden Aaronson had put the home side ahead. And the outcome will have left a bitter taste in the mouths of respective managers Daniel Farke and Ruben Amorim.",
      "Farke knows Leeds will have rarely had a better chance to beat bitter rivals they haven't got the better of in the league since 2002. While the point will do nothing to ease the pressure on Amorim, whose side has now failed to overcome rock-bottom Wolves, and a newly-promoted side, in their last two outings.",
      "Farke had insisted this was 'more than a game', due to the long history of vitriol and hatred which existed between these trans Pennine clubs. But animosities of the past failed to make the present, on an afternoon that will live short in the memories.",
      "Amorim was getting his first taste of one of the most explosive fixtures in football. And he appeared to have arrived at Elland Road on a mission to circle the wagons.",
      "Of the 10 outfield players he named in his side, eight of them were defence minded. While lone striker Benjamin Sesko had scored just twice in 15 league games this season.",
      "Leeds might have been without influential captain Ethan Ampadu, who was suspended, while the hosts had had 48 hours less to prepare for this clash than United had. But Farke must have taken one look at the United team sheet and thought the visitors were there for the taking.",
      "Not least because his Leeds team were bursting with confidence, having thumped Chelsea here as part of a six game unbeaten run. This was just the fifth time in 22 years Leeds had hosted United - and home supporters were determined to make the most of it. It was just a shame Farke's players didn't seem to have the same enthusiasm.",
      "The hosts were lacklustre, meaning United didn't have much of a storm to weather, to be honest. Sesko had a shot blocked and Manuel Ugarte headed just wide, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin screwed a shot off target.",
      "Calvert-Lewin also saw a glancing header come back of the right hand post, while Lucas Perri produced a superb, instinctive save to tip over Leny Yorro's header from point blank range. But the first half was memorable for how forgettable it was.",

      "Napoli's clash with Lazio in Serie A ended with three men sent-off after a mass brawl between the two teams.",
      "The reigning Italian top-flight champions, Napoli, met Lazio on Sunday afternoon at Stadio Olimpico and claimed a 2-0 win in the fixture.",
      "Former Manchester United star Scott McTominay starred for Napoli, once again. However, this time he did not get on the score-sheet to add to his tally of five goals so far this season.",
      "Leonardo Spinazzola and Amir Rrahmani scored the goals for Napoli to secure the three points for Antonio Conte's side. There was also high drama in the closing minutes of the contest.",
      "Indeed, there was a brawl between players from both clubs, which began after a flashpoint between Lazio defender Adam Marusic and Napoli full-back Pasquale Mazzocchi, who made an appearance from the bench.",
      "Marusic and Mazzocchi both began pushing each other while Lazio were in possession, with the game eventually stopped by referee Davide Massa, who had to intervene after a brawl began between players and staff from both teams. When the situation calmed down, Massa went on to hand out red cards to both Marusic and Mazzocchi.",
      "Earlier in the game, meanwhile, Lazio star Tijjani Noslin was also shown a red card after picking up two bookings. The latter of which came in the 81st minute.",
      "As a result, Lazio not only went on to lose the game 2-0, but also finished up with just nine players after having Marusic and Noslin sent off. United loanee Rasmus Hojlund started the match for Napoli - but was subbed in the 86th minute to be replaced by Noa Lang.",
      "The win for Napoli leaves McTominay, Hojlund and Co. in second place in the Serie A table and one point behind leaders AC Milan. They have won the Scudetto twice in three years.",
      "Napoli's next match will see them host Verona in Serie A on Thursday evening.",
      "Lazio are, meanwhile, ninth in the table and will face Fiorentina on Wednesday night.",
      "Recent weeks have seen speculation swirl that United could have an interest in re-signing McTominay after his impressive season with Napoli. Hojlund, meanwhile, is spending the season on loan with the Serie A giants, and there are suggestions that he could move to Italy on a permanent deal next summer.",

      "Leeds United and Manchester United played out a draw at Elland Road after the hosts failed to capitalise on their opponents' slow start. Brenden Aaronson got the wrong side of Ayden Heaven to fire Leeds in front, only for Matheus Cunha to deliver an instant equaliser.",
      "The home side had chances to restore their lead, with Senne Lammens producing a fine save to keep out Noah Okafor's acrobatic effort and substitute Joel Piroe almost hitting a winner moments after coming off the bench. In between those chances, Cunha came close to snatching victory for the visitors, only for his effort to clip the outside of the post.",
      "United had the ball in the net early on in a quiet first half, but Cunha's celebrations were cut short by an offside flag. Leeds had been victims of a flag themselves in their midweek game against Liverpool, and the man involved that time, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, had an early sniff of goal on his return to the starting XI.",
      "Neither team showed much quality before the break, and the opening exchanges were summed up when Diogo Dalot swung at an inviting ball and sent it flying over the crossbar. At the other end, Leeds had two penalty appeals brushed off in short order, one for handball and another when James Justin went down under pressure from Lisandro Martinez.",
      "It was almost 1-0 to the hosts moments after that, though. Calvert-Lewin rose highest to meet an inviting cross from the right and headed against the foot of the post with Senne Lammens beaten.",
      "It wasn't until the hour mark that the game truly came to life. Aaronson capitalised on Heaven's uncertainty at the back before confidently beating Lammens, only for United sub Joshua Zirkzee to create an instant response from Cunha.",
      "Given the scale of United's absentee list, Joshua Zirkzee's failure to earn a start was hardly a vote of confidence. If he can't get one now then one imagines he will be well down the pecking order once the likes of Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo are back in contention.",
      "Whatever United wanted from the Dutchman, it hasn't arrived with nearly enough consistency and that debut goal against Fulham feels a lifetime away. He can still offer something in an attacking sense, though, and made an immediate impact from the bench with his assist for Cunha's equaliser after a disgusted Ruben Amorim responded to going a goal behind by instantly introducing an extra attacker.",
      "There were reports in Italy earlier in the week suggesting a loan move to Roma remains possible, perhaps followed by a summer swap deal involving centre-back Evan Ndicka. After this cameo, though, he may have convinced Amorim he deserves another chance.",
      "There's been growing noise around an England recall for Dominic Calvert-Lewin following his form for Leeds. He went into Sunday's game with eight league goals to his name this term - more than he managed in any of his last four Everton seasons - at a rate of one every 142 minutes.",
      "You have to go back to the 2020/21 season for the last time he reached double figures in the Premier League. That's also the last time he was called up by England, with his most recent cap coming in the Euro 2020 quarter-final victory over Ukraine, but a first-half header against the post was another reminder he's a player with both form and confidence.",
      "Thomas Tuchel has decisions to make when preparing his England squad ahead of the summer World Cup. If Calvert-Lewin is still playing like this going into the March international break, you wouldn't be surprised to see the boss take a closer look.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been cagey when discussing Manchester United's transfer plans, hinting that it could be a quiet January. However, the threadbare nature of the bench may well remain a concern.",
      "Six of the eight United outfielders on the bench are academy youngsters, five of them teenagers, and Amorim opted not to introduce any of them on Sunday. As well as those youngsters, 19-year-old Heaven started once more at centre-back and sadly showed his inexperience to allow Leeds to break the deadlock.",
      "Heaven joined in what was a relatively restrained winter window last year but has quickly shown his worth, despite the unwelcome moment at Elland Road. The second half of the current campaign may be about Amorim improving the players he has rather than finding a quick fix.",
      "Before kick-off, you had to go back more than 20 years for the last time Leeds beat Manchester United at Elland Road. They might have been out of the top flight for a considerable period in between but that's still six league or cup encounters with five away wins and a solitary goalless draw in 2021.",
      "This felt like as good a chance as any to end that unwanted run, and they looked destined to win when Aaronson fired them in front. Had they been able to avoid an instant reply, there may well have been no way back for the visitors.",
      "Instead, though, they had to settle for a point. It's still a valuable one after weekend defeats for fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest and West Ham but it could have been more.",
      "Benjamin Sesko had support from Joshua Zirkzee in United's last game against Wolves, with the latter scoring at Old Trafford. Zirkzee dropped to the bench on Sunday, and the focus on his fellow forward didn't seem to benefit summer arrival Sesko.",
      "Despite the Slovenia star's relative youth, he's a player with plenty of top level experience. However, his first 15 Premier League outings - including nine starts - brought just two goals before kick-off at Elland Road.",
      "Some fans have pointed to a lack of service, but that hasn't been the only problem. A wayward header from Casemiro's 54th minute cross pointed to a lack of precision from the leading man, even if an offside flag made it moot, and a worse miss followed 17 minutes from time after Zirkzee's cutback.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim claimed he had dropped Joshua Zirkzee for tactical reasons after the striker became the glaring omission for Manchester United's Premier League game against Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Zirkzee started and scored in the 1-1 draw against Wolves, but has been relegated to the substitutes' bench at Elland Road, despite United being short of players. Amorim is without Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt through injury, while Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim opted to start against Leeds with six defenders and two holding midfielders. Patrick Dorgu has been pushed up the field to play as one of the No.10s in United's 3-4-2-1 formation, with Luke Shaw at left wing-back and Benjamin Sesko leading the line.",
      "Zirkzee's omission is hardly a ringing endorsement of the Dutch forward, who is one of three senior players a heavily depleted bench alongside back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and defender Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Zirkzee scored with a deflected effort against Wolves to net his second goal in 13 appearances across all competitions. He has struggled since joining from Bologna for £36.5million in 2024 and has been heavily linked with a move in the January transfer window.",
      "The 24-year-old has agreed to join Roma, according to reports in Italy. He has reportedly met with Roma's sporting director Ricky Massara and has been assured by manager Gian Piero Gasparini that he will fit into their system.",
      "However, it remains to be seen whether United would sanction the move, given their current injury and AFCON crisis. Amorim has been clear that United will not be busy in January and has vetoed an exit for Mainoo to Napoli.",
      "“The transfer window is not going to change,” Amorim said. “We have no conversation at this moment to have any change in the squad. There’s a process, there’s an idea that is going to continue.”",
      "Asked about his lack of options before the trip to Elland Road, Amorim said: “It was bad luck to lose Amad, Bryan, especially with Bruno. If you lose the three of them at the same time, any team in the world will struggle.",
      "“You have all the data and you can sense that three guys create most of the chances for us. And if you lose not one but all three at the same time, of course we are going to struggle. The important thing is to understand why we struggled in the last three games in creation and quality in the game. I think it’s clear.”",

      "Ramos previously spent two years in the French capital with Paris Saint-Germain, winning back-to-back Ligue 1 titles. Noisy neighbours Paris FC have been ambitious since coming up to the top flight, signing players including former PSG keeper Kevin Trapp and France international Jonathan Ikone, but it now looks unlikely Ramos' name will join the list.",

      "Manchester United had also been linked with the 39-year-old, who was a four-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid. Those links were quickly played down, though, with ESPN reporting in December that he doesn't fit the age profile of the kind of player United want.",
      "There were firmer links between United and Ramos in 2015, and the player addressed those in 2023 after moving from PSG back to boyhood club Sevilla. \"I stayed where I should have stayed, Real Madrid, but I was indeed close to playing for United,\" he said.",
      "\"It was not to be, but I do keep that admiration for the club, to the Premier League and the players, because the rhythm of play, the pace is different, and it's a league we can all learn a great deal from, all of us. So that was not meant to be. I was glad to stay in Madrid, and now I'm glad to be in Sevilla.\"",

      "Nice have been active already during the window, with Elye Wahi scoring on his debut after signing on loan from Eintracht Frankrurt, but any further business wouldn't involve Ramos. \"We’re working on the transfer window, we don’t have to sign big names.

The Red Devils are preparing to face Leeds United with the club in sixth position, three points from the top four and three points clear of Fulham in 12th. United have failed to be wholly convincing this term, despite having no European football.",
      "The club were linked with a move for Bournemouth ace Antoine Semenyo, but the winger is set to join Manchester City instead. The prospect of another move in January looks unlikely for now.",
      "Before his team's Sunday fixture against Leeds, Amorim was asked for greater insight into the comments he made ahead of the win over Newcastle. However, the 40-year-old did not appear entirely happy with the situation and gave little away despite repeated questioning.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3, we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" he said. \"I'm starting to understand that is not going to happen. So, maybe I have to adapt.\"",

      "Manchester United youngster Harry Amass is reportedly contemplating spending the second half of the season with Stoke City. The left-back is currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, but could end up trading a relegation battle for a promotion push with the Potters.",
      "Amass, 18, joined United from Watford in 2023 and made his debut under Amorim in March. He made five Premier League appearances last term, also playing twice in the Europa League, but was allowed to move to Hillsborough for a taste of first team football this term.",
      "The young defender hit back at comments from Amorim that he was \"struggling\", posting a photo of himself with Wednesday's player of the month award. However, he later deleted the comment as it was clarified that the 'struggling' depiction was related to the Owls' lowly league position.",
      "\"I think is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" Amorim said after Amass and fellow youngster Chido Obi reacted to his comments. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.\"",
      "He added: \"I didn't say anything wrong. I just spoke about how the luck of playing for Manchester United. Sometimes you play for Manchester United and you go see different realities and you understand that football can be so different and that you are really lucky to be in Manchester United.\"",
      "Wednesday have been hit with two separate points deductions to make relegation to the third tier all but a formality. They still have a negative points tally after seeing 18 points taken off their total after entering administration and then getting a second deduction for breaches under former owner Dejphon Chansiri.",
      "They sit some 32 points from safety ahead of Sunday's trip to QPR, with relegation all but a formality. Amass has impressed in his short time at Hillsborough, though, and has no shortage of suitors.",
      "According to The Sun, Stoke appear to be the most likely winners after a 12-way fight for Amass' signature. They report United won't be recalling the defender, though Wednesday manager Henrik Pedersen remains hopeful of keeping him for the second half of the campaign.",
      "\"There is a dialogue between the clubs and the agent, so I really hope that we can finalise something soon,\" Pedersen told reporters. \"Of course, we would love to keep him.",
      "\"He has done really, really well. He's 18-years-old, played so many games, which level he has played [at]. Of course the young guy has a lot to learn, but how he has played for us, it has been great.\"",
      "If Amass does choose Stoke, he would be joining a team with a realistic chance of promotion for the first time since dropping out of the Premier League in 2018. Stoke haven't even finished in the top half of the Championship in any of the last seven seasons.",
      "It's their first full campaign with Mark Robins in the dugout and they have the best defensive record in the league with just 23 goals conceded. They sit ninth in the table ahead of Sunday's meeting with Norwich City but are just three points adrift of the play-off places.",

      "Manchester United can spend £100million in the January transfer window without getting into financial difficulty, according to a football finance expert. With United pushing for Champions League qualification this season, a lot has been said about their need to bolster their ranks in the transfer market, which remains open until early February.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has already made it clear the club won't bring in players unless there is 'common ground' with director of football Jason Wilcox about which players can improve the squad, admitting that the pair don't always agree when it comes to new signings.",
      "United already appear to have missed out on highly-rated winger Antoine Semenyo, who is set to join rivals Manchester City from Bournemouth. For the most part, the other players linked with the Old Trafford club have been midfielders, including the likes of Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Conor Gallagher.",
      "Whether United are active in January will also be influenced by their financial situation. There has been plenty of talk about how much they are actually able to spend on new additions, given owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's status as one of Britain's richest men with an estimated net worth of £12billion.",
      "However, Ratcliffe has painted the picture of a financial crisis at United since acquiring a minority stake in the club in February 2024, worsened by the absence of European football this season. During Ratcliffe's short reign, United have axed hundreds of club employees and increased ticket prices in a bid to maintain the team's competitiveness on the field by bankrolling significant spending on forwards last summer.",
      "But United also recorded the highest EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) profit of any Premier League club, along with the second highest revenues, in 2023-24.",
      "Football finance expert Kieran Maguire insists they do not require any January sales to finance further transfers, saying they are “fine as they are” financially. He believes offloading players such as Kobbie Mainoo would only provide additional funds to decrease their overdraft debt, reported to stand at around £748million, while their transfer budget of around £100m this month would remain the same.",
      "Maguire said: “I think the broader issue is they've not got cup money coming this year, they've not got European money. Old Trafford, you're looking to make probably seven or eight million per match, because it's very noticeable that since Ineos took over, the prices have gone up substantially.",
      "“So they're squeezing the fans, and I think that's why the fans are probably a bit more demanding now than they were originally when Ineos came in, because they are being milked in order to provide the budget.",
      "“Again, from an SCR point of view, which is the new rules which are kicking in, they're spending around half their revenue on wages. So they've got huge capacity.",
      "“It's then a case of, can they spend the money? Well, yes, they've got a lot of debt but they're still well within their overdraft limit. What Manchester United tend to do is to buy players on credit. So they owe £466m in outstanding transfer fees for players that they've signed in the past.",
      "“I think that's more of an issue for the summer of 2026 rather than January. If they spend £100m in January, they'll be spreading that over three or four years. So from a cash point of view, it's not really going to make a difference.",
      "“If that's the difference between Champions League and not Champions League, they've got to go for it if it's going to improve the squad. Because a good run in the Champions League, you've got four home matches guaranteed, potentially another three. So you've got seven home matches.",
      "“If you're in the playoffs, that's eight home matches. For Manchester United, you're looking at £60m. That's just from your ticket receipts.",
      "“If you get to the quarters or semi-finals, you'll make another £60m from TV money. And then your sponsors will be paying bonuses on top of that. So there's no reason why Manchester United can't make £150m if they get to the final.",
      "“If they win it, that means they qualify for the Club World Cup in 2029. It's worth £200m. But it's Champions League or nothing. Europa League is okay for a club the size of Manchester United. The conference, certainly for the smaller clubs, they lose money in the conference.”",
      "Based on this information, it would be wise for owners Ineos, the club hierarchy and Amorim to spend well on incoming players this January if it adds quality squad depth and aids their push for Champions League qualification for next season, given the greater financial benefits on offer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United began the current season in dire form and despite suggestions that head coach Amorim could be shown the exit door, their form has improved. But within intermittent victories came a lacklustre outing at Old Trafford just before the New Year.",
      "With a trip to Leeds up next, a response is needed from the Portuguese manager's squad, but one member who won't feature is Kobbie Mainoo. The young Englishman is sidelined through injury but has also been linked with a move away from the club.",
      "Mainoo has been linked with a handful of clubs as his situation at United worsens, including Napoli, where players such as Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have found refuge.",
      "However, new reports suggest that a proposal from Turkey is incoming. Turkish outlet Sabah claims that Besiktas have made contact with Mainoo's club regarding a loan move.",
      "According to the report, this prospective move would be an 18-month proposal and as of now, it remains unclear whether United would entertain it, as well as how Mainoo may react. England star Mainoo currently has just one year left on his deal with United and at just 20 years old, he will presumably be on the hunt to play senior football.",
      "Speaking about the club's January transfer window plans this week, though, Amorim said: \"The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversation to have any change in the squad. There is a process, there is an idea - that is going to continue.\"",
      "Opening up on who could leave Old Trafford before the window closes, he added: \"No, none of them. I don't expect them to come to me to ask [to leave].\"",

      "However another name supposedly on the shortlist is Wolves star Joao Gomes. And a new update given by the Mail suggests that there has been a lot of interest in the Brazilian",
      "In a fresh report, the outlet claims that Gomes has suitors in his homeland of Brazil, as well as mainland Europe, meaning that United could face competition if they endeavor to sign the midfielder this month or in the summer.",

The Red Devils have maintained an interest in the 21-year-old since last summer, and it was claimed late on Friday night that they have explored the conditions of signing Baleba this month.",
      "But Barber has now confirmed that not only has there been no contact from anyone connected to United, but his club has no plans or desire to sell Baleba now or in future transfer windows. Speaking to talkSPORT, he said: \"No call from Old Trafford. No call from anyone connected to Manchester United.",
      "\"We have no plans or desire to sell Carlos in this window, or in any future window, but we know he's a talented player, and he's got a lot of options ahead of him in the future.",
      "\"For us right now, he's an important player in the second half of the season, and we're looking forward to getting him back from AFCON.\"",
      "United spent heavily in the most recent summer transfer window, but it appears that their big spending under Ruben Amorim is not finished quite yet. Amorim wants midfield reinforcements as his No.1 priority to rebuild his squad, and Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are all targets.",
      "Former United coach Rene Meulensteen recently told his old club to make Crystal Palace star Wharton their top target next summer. He said: \"I'm a big fan of Wharton; I think he should be the number one priority for United next summer.",
      "\"He would be the perfect player to add to their squad, but I don't think the move will be possible until next summer. He's got great feet, and he is an effective and efficient player.",
      "\"He is always looking forward when he has the ball, which is a top-quality trait to have as a midfielder. He's great in small spaces when he is being closed down quickly, and he always breaks the lines to find his unmarked teammates.",
      "\"His range of passing is second to none, and he has Premier League experience playing in the same formation that Amorim is playing at Man United. It's an absolute no-brainer for United to sign Wharton next summer.\"",
      "Asked about his club's plans for the winter window on Friday, United boss Amorim said: \"The transfer window is not going to change.",
      "\"We have no conversations in this moment to have any change in the squad. There's a process, there's an idea that is going to continue.",

      "For five minutes, Ruben Amorim's post-match press conference at Elland Road had been mundane. He had defended Benjamin Sesko and hailed an improved performance. Then, in less than 90 seconds of answers, he pulled the pin on the grenade and started a civil war at Manchester United.",
      "The question now is, where does he go from here? Amorim insisted he wouldn't quit. His comments had a back me or sack me vibe and three wins since October would make the former a surprise. The 40-year-old has begun a power struggle and calling out director of scouting Christopher Vivell and director of football Jason Wilcox made clear where the manager believes the fault lines lie.",
      "There had been talk of a rupture in the corridors of power for a few weeks and now Amorim has laid it all out in the open. He began his explosive comments by telling the media that we \"receive selective information about everything.\"",
      "So what was he talking about? It would be a safe bet to say that he had been riled by a story in the Daily Mail over the weekend that exposed concerns from Vivell and Wilcox about the playing style and Amorim's back three system. His brief flirtation with a back four in December has been shelved but where it came from in the first place is a bit of a mystery.",
      "Amorim had been so steadfast in his refusal to ever move away from a system he had used throughout his managerial career that his volte-face came as a surprise. It is telling that he has abandoned it as quickly as he rolled it out. Wilcox is concerned about United's predictability in Amorim's set-up, and it is clear that opposition teams find it easy to prepare for.",
      "If Amorim was considering meeting Wilcox halfway, then he has clearly changed his mind. Being told there would be no money in January has been the final straw. United were prepared to spend £65million on Antoine Semenyo and despite seeing the 25-year-old opt for Manchester City, they have made it clear he wasn't being signed to play left wing-back.",
      "Having missed out on Semenyo, that cash has now been put back in the safe. Amorim's grumbles on transfer business have been building for a couple of weeks. Before the Wolves game, he was asked about recruitment, and in hindsight, his comments hint at the division that was brewing behind the scenes.",
      "\"I have one idea, Jason and the board have another idea, but every decision we make, we need to reach a common ground,\" he said. \"That is really important because you don't need to make everything for the manager because the manager can change, and then you need to change everything.",
      "\"But you also need to understand that the manager understands the way of playing. If you don't reach common ground, the player would not come, so we just try to do that.\"",
      "With everything that has happened since, that line about the manager understanding the way of playing looks like the first of many messages delivered to his bosses in the last week or so.",
      "He raised the stakes on Friday with his refusal to answer why he had come to the conclusion that he wouldn't get the time or money to play a \"perfect 3-4-3\"; however, his response to his questioner, \"You are a smart guy,\" was a clear hint that the conclusion was obvious.",
      "And for those left in any doubt, Amorim shredded it all on Sunday. He was appointed as head coach in November 2024, but has now decided that the job title isn't good enough for him. He wants the power afforded to Thomas Tuchel, Antonio Conte and Jose Mourinho, despite not having the CV to match.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear,\" he said. \"I know that my name is not Tuchel, it's not Conte, it's not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United.",
      "\"And it's going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change. So that was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until the other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. And I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "\"If people cannot handle the Gary Neville and the criticism of everything, we need to change the club. No, guys, I just want to say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. And every department, the scouting department, the sports director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.\"",
      "This clearly isn't someone angling for a new contract. Amorim will see out his 18 months, but it seems he is saying that if this structure remains, he will leave then.",
      "He is unlikely to last another 18 months, however. Wilcox is right to have doubts over Amorim's tactical approach, but the uncomfortable reality for this United structure under Sir Jim Ratcliffe is that they have bet the house on the Portuguese. If he fails, where does it leave them?",
      "In a way, Wilcox, Vivell, Amorim and even chief executive Omar Berrada will now look to Ratcliffe for the next move. The minority owner hasn't been to a game since the 4-1 win against Wolves on December 8 and things have clearly changed since then.",
      "Ratcliffe can be unpredictable. He likes Amorim and admires his straight-talking approach, but there is shooting from the hip and then there is this. It was unfriendly fire.",
      "The 73-year-old billionaire showed his ruthless streak when getting rid of Dan Ashworth after just five months. That was put down to a personality clash, but Ratcliffe was frustrated that Ashworth was raising concerns about the appointment of Amorim. There is more than a degree of irony to that now.",
      "So what will Ratcliffe do next? He was talking of giving Amorim three years in October, but that now looks impossible. It's hard to see how Wilcox and Amorim can continue to coexist for much longer. It wouldn't be out of character for Ratcliffe to look to end this one way or another this week.",
      "Perhaps results will dictate what happens next, at least to a degree. Amorim will face the media at Carrington on Tuesday, and it feels inconceivable that he won't have met Wilcox for showdown talks before then. Can they come up with a New Year's truce? If they don't, then Amorim will badly need a win at Burnley.",
      "His hand isn't exactly strong at the moment, but then he has never been one to bite his tongue either.",

A poor game came to life when Leeds took the lead out of nowhere. Some slack United defending allowed Brenden Aaronson to latch on to a Pascal Struijk clearance and finish past Senne Lammens.",

      "Leny Yoro: Couple of nervy moments as we have come to expect. Can be too easy to get in behind down the right side at the moment. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: One well-timed tackle in the box when at first it had looked a reckless move. Good in possession but caught napping for the goal. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Passing was good and showed plenty of aggression when defending. Back on the left of the back three and clearly more suited to that role. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Some slack moments in possession and too casual in giving it away for the first goal. Right flank exposed at times. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: One of his best games of the season, with conditions to suit. Didn't do loads in possession but was good without the ball and set a really combative tone. 7",
      "Casemiro: Better on the ball than Ugarte and also competed well. Midfield looked like a potential weakness for United but it didn't really work out that way. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Corners were dangerous and made one excellent defensive header. Back in a position he hasn't played for several years but put up a good showing. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Being moved about all over the place at the moment and not helping him. Screwed one first-half chance just wide. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha: United's best player. Carried the fight in the first and clearly the best player on the pitch. Deserved his goal and looked lively. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Amorim on his case over hold-up play early on. Involved in the goal but poor centre-forward play to be offside for a bad header and then missed a good chance to win it. 5",
      "Substitutes",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: A rare Amorim sub that showed intent and it paid off. Good ball to set up Cunha for the equalising goal and had some good moments as a No.10. 7",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Fredricson, Kukonki, Malacia, Mantato, J. Fletcher, T. Fletcher, Lacey.",

      "This is what happens when you roll the dice, Ruben. Five days after another negative substitution angered Manchester United fans at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim showed some intent from the bench at Elland Road and got his rewards.",
      "Maybe Amorim had little option but to play the role of the gambler in West Yorkshire. He had picked a team featuring eight defensive players, and once Brenden Aaronson had given Leeds the lead, it was time to play his chips.",
      "But the speed at which Amorim did so was still surprising. Before the game had even restarted, Joshua Zirkzee was stripped and ready to come on, and Leny Yoro was trudging towards the touchline.",
      "Three minutes later, Zirkzee found a pocket of space he would exploit regularly in a lively cameo, and his pass through was rolled in by Matheus Cunha. United found the immediate response they needed - and deserved - and any danger of this assignment getting as uncomfortable as it could have done petered out.",
      "Will this convince Amorim to be more gung-ho in the future? Perhaps not. But it does feel like things are changing at Old Trafford. The head coach has mixed up his system recently, whether through his own design or orders from above, and his comments in Friday's press conference suggested unity might suddenly be in short supply.",
      "That dire draw at home to Wolves to end 2025 had certainly dialled up the pressure once again and back-to-back trips to promoted sides Leeds and Burnley had the feel of a litmus test at the start of a New Year. Amorim's resources are stretched right now and he bemoaned the misfortune of missing his most creative players at the same time before this game.",
      "That suggested this would never be a classic. And it wasn't. In the circumstances, a point isn't a bad result. At least it won't be if United win at Turf Moor on Wednesday. This was always the tougher of the two games.",
      "Lisandro Martinez attempted to defuse some of the noise by turning the teams around after winning the toss. As the inoffensive Senne Lammens made his way to the North Stand goal he was greeted with chants of \"scum\". Two minutes after kick-off, all bar 3,000 United fans crammed into a corner of Elland Road rose to their feet for a chant of \"stand up if you hate Man U\".",
      "But the temperature in the stands and on the pitch quickly dipped on a bitterly cold afternoon. It wasn't a game to keep the fires burning and chances were few and far between. Cunha's dipping volley into the back of the net from 25 yards was a rare moment of quality, but the offside flag had long since been up against Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Sesko's struggles to hold the ball up earned him a rebuke from Amorim, but United's build-up play had been neat, even if chances were hard to create. Their best opportunities came from corners, with Diogo Dalot screwing a shot over from 10 yards, Leny Yoro's header from close range being tipped over by Lucas Perri and the lively Cunha hitting a 15-yard volley over the bar.",
      "It was Leeds who came closest to breaking the deadlock. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was clearly the best striker on the pitch, and he began the move by holding the ball up before making his way into the box to head Anton Stach's cross against a post.",
      "The evidence of the first half hour suggested we could have played all day and not got a goal. Then two came along in four minutes. The opener summed up the game.",
      "Pascal Struijk's swing of the boot inside his own half was a clearance after Dalot had overrun the ball, but United were caught napping defensively, and Aaronson darted in behind Ayden Heaven to finish. Amorim reacted immediately, sending Zirkzee on for Yoro, and he got his reward for an adventurous sub.",
      "Sesko got hold of the ball and laid it off to Zirkzee, whose ball in behind was well-weighted to allow Cunha to slide a finish past Perri.",
      "The glut of goals proved to be a false dawn in terms of quality. Sesko side-footed wide from a Zirkzee cross when he should have done better and substitute Joel Piroe sent a late effort onto the roof of the net.",
      "Zirkzee was lively in his half-hour cameo despite the expectation of a departure in this window. The fact that he was the only replacement Amorim turned to showed what few options he had on the bench.",
      "Amorim is focusing on surviving while key men are missing, but three wins from 11 since October is a missed opportunity and momentum has well and truly stalled. This performance was an improvement on Tuesday, but its true context might only be revealed if United can get back to winning ways on Wednesday.",

      "Ruben Amorim backed Benjamin Sesko to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed despite the £73million striker struggling once again at Elland Road. Sesko has just two goals in 17 games since his move from RB Leipzig and missed a good chance to win the game for Manchester United at Leeds as his struggles in front of goal continued.",
      "United jettisoned Hojlund to replace him with the Slovenian striker but have watched the Dane enjoy a positive start to life at Napoli, with nine goals in 20 games since his loan move to Serie A. There are similarities between the pair, both 22 and struggling initially as they make the step up to life at Old Trafford, but Amorim is confident the new man has the profile to be a success at the club.",
      "\"Is the characteristics of the player,\" said Amorim. \"Ben is completely different from Rasmus. Rasmus had this moment here. He moved on, we bring Sesko. He will try to score goals. The pressure of being the striker for Manchester United, he's doing the right things. He needs to improve them the last moment. That is the most important moment because he did things that he did well today, he just needs to score one.",
      "\"First of all, to miss the chances that he's missing is always there and that is the first step. He's really aggressive when the ball goes to the side, he's really aggressive when he has to fight for the first ball. Of course, when you look at the game of a striker, if you miss chances, they will say that the player did everything wrong, I don't agree.",
      "\"I think he's in the right position, he just needs to score one and then all the weight that he has on top of him is going to disappear and he's going to be better.\"",
      "Sesko showed some frustration in the first-half with wing-backs Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw and it was a theme of Hojlund's time at the club that he felt the service into him wasn't quick enough, but Amorim rejected that idea and said his side were right to show patience in build-up.",
      "\"If you tell me that in the different game today, we need to have possessions, especially in this kind of environment,\" he said. \"If we are losing the ball all the time, if we are trying to be the team that we were in the past with a lot of transitions all the time, we don't want to play like that.",
      "\"We want to prepare better the way we played. We played better compared to the last week and we were very lucky. We talked two seconds ago about the chances that Ben had, so we are creating chances for Ben. He just needs to score one and then all the weight is going to go. So we are creating chances for the strikers.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha cancelled out Branden Aaronson's early opener in the second half to make it consecutive 1-1 draws against one of the Premier League's bottom-half teams. However, it was Amorim's words after the game that were the talking point.",
      "The United boss had expressed signs of dissatisfaction on Friday following his comments about the club's January plans. Now, Amorim's words after the draw at Elland Road have placed even more doubts over his working relationship with Jason Wilcox.",

      "\"We controlled more the possession, the connection, the position of the players. I think they were in the better positions to play, and that can show in the way we played. We had more chances than the opponent to score, but we need to not to think about the next one.\"",
      "\"It's really important. I think Ben improved in the connection today. Josh, the 20 minutes that he played, he was active. He was creating chances, creating spaces for us. It's important. Also, Manu [Ugarte] played better today and helped the team also to create chances. So it was better than last week.\"",
      "\"First of all, to miss the chances that he's missing he's always there, and that is the first step. He's really aggressive when the ball goes to the side. He's really aggressive when he has to fight for the first ball. Of course, when you look at the game of a striker, if you miss chances, they will say that the player did everything wrong. I don't agree. I think the right position. He just need to score one and then all the weight that he has on top of him is going to disappear and he's going to be better.\"",

      "\"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.\"",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",

No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",

      "Manchester United were unable to begin 2026 with a bang away at Leeds this afternoon.",
      "United had the chance to move to fourth with a win today. With Liverpool facing a tricky trip to Fulham and Chelsea visiting the Etihad this evening, they had an opportunity to climb the table.",
      "However, the points were shared at Elland Road. Leeds opened the scoring in the second half through Brenden Aaronson, but Matheus Cunha provided an immediate response.",
      "Ruben Amorim was frustrated when he spoke after the game, though.",
      "Recap what happened at Elland Road.",
      "Ruben Amorim has cast doubt on his future as Manchester United head coach and hinted he will walk away when his contract expires in 18 months. The 40-year-old demanded to be seen as the manager at Old Trafford, rather than head coach, even though the latter is his official title since being appointed by Ineos in November 2024.",
      "Amorim hinted at issues behind the scenes in his press conference on Friday and escalated his attack on the structure in place after United had actually played well to earn a point in a 1-1 draw at Leeds United.",
      "He was asked why he had seemed so downbeat on Friday and responded with demands for more power, suggesting he was promised that when recruited from Sporting. Amorim said ahead of the game he expected no new signings this month and during his answer at Elland Road he called on director of football Jason Wilcox to do his job.",
      "Read on here >>>",
      "This is what happens when you roll the dice, Ruben. Five days after another negative substitution angered Manchester United fans at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim showed some intent from the bench at Elland Road and got his rewards.",
      "Maybe Amorim had little option but to play the role of the gambler in West Yorkshire. He had picked a team featuring eight defensive players, and once Brenden Aaronson had given Leeds the lead, it was time to play his chips.",
      "But the speed at which Amorim did so was still surprising. Before the game had even restarted, Joshua Zirkzee was stripped and ready to come on, and Leny Yoro was trudging towards the touchline.",
      "Three minutes later, Zirkzee found a pocket of space he would exploit regularly in a lively cameo, and his pass through was rolled in by Matheus Cunha. United found the immediate response they needed - and deserved - and any danger of this assignment getting as uncomfortable as it could have done petered out.",
      "Read the full article here.",
      "Senne Lammens: Could possibly have done better for the goal but two smart second-half saves from Gudmundsson and Okafor and his distribution was sound under pressure. 6",
      "Leny Yoro: Couple of nervy moments as we have come to expect. Can be too easy to get in behind down the right side at the moment. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: One well-timed tackle in the box when at first it had looked a reckless move. Good in possession but caught napping for the goal. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Passing was good and showed plenty of aggression when defending. Back on the left of the back three and clearly more suited to that role. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Some slack moments in possession and too casual in giving it away for the first goal. Right flank exposed at times. 6",

      "Casemiro, Shaw and Cunha all have their hands on their heads as Sesko fires beyond the post from close range.",
      "Fair play to Amorim for replacing Yoro with Zirkzee immediately after falling behind. It's not often you see a change pay off that quickly, but the pass from Zirkzee to find Cunha on the box was excellent.",
      "Zirkzee replaced Yoro straight after conceding and the change worked.",
      "The Dutchman played a superb pass to Cunha, who finished well.",
      "Rubbish from Dalot and Dorgu, who lose the ball down the right side.",
      "Aaronson gets in behind and finishes into the bottom right.",
      "United just need to show they can go and win the game now. Subs could have an impact though, Leeds with a much stronger bench than United’s.",
      "Leeds have started this second half as the better side and the crowd are now alive again.",
      "Ugarte counter-attacked and brought the ball forward at speed before finding Dorgu. The defender kept hold of the ball and found Ugarte again, but his shot was sent well wide of the post.",

      "Dorgu shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Calvert-Lewin.",
      "Dalot had a chance thanks to the ball dropping to his feet from a corner but fired over.",
      "That was slick from Casemiro again. There have been some promising moments when United have threatened to build an attack, but it hasn't clicked together yet.",
      "Amorim frustrated at Sesko’s failure to make the ball stick just then. It’s a very bitty game at the moment, no real quality in it, but United certainly shading it. Ugarte had a good start, should be the type of game that suits and he has stood up to the task in that midfield. United producing the crisper passing moves when they get hold of the ball.",
      "Amorim waving his hands in frustration on the touchline as Sesko loses the header and Dorgu fails to win the second ball. The United boss wanted more from the pair.",
      "The kind of start United would have taken before kick-off. One half chance for Leeds but quiet aside from that. Cunha seeing a lot of the ball and United matched the intensity of their hosts. Not quietened it down entirely just yet, but it’s been encouraging.",
      "United will be pleased with their opening 15 minutes. Elland Road was rocking at kick-off, but the noise has dropped due to the game management. They need to keep the ball to quieten the crowd further.",
      "Calvert-Lewin had the pace to beat Martinez just there but Lammens swept up.",
      "Good link up play between Casemiro and Cunha. The latter stuck the ball into the back of the net with a volley, but the move was flagged offside. United should be encouraged by that move because it was slick.",
      "Leeds are pressing aggressively and have started quickly. There is vitriol coming from the stands. Leeds fans were just chanting \"break his legs\" when Cunha picked up the ball down the right.",
      "Martinez winning the toss and turning the teams around, so Leeds attack their Kop in the first half rather than the second half. Chants of “scum” as Senne Lammens makes his way to the other goal. Confirmation of United’s shape as well, which is as expected with Dalot and Shaw at wing-backs and Dorgu as a 10."

      "\"And then it's getting closer to having all these three players. The important thing is to understand why we struggled in the last three games in creation and quality in the game. I think it's clear.\"",
      "Amorim's in-game changes have again come under the microscope since the draw with Wolves. With the Stretford End calling for United to attack, Amorim replaced Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro with 15 minutes to go. It was another risk-averse substitution but United do have a good record for scoring late goals this season and only Arsenal and Manchester City have more than their 33 goals in 19 league games.",
      "\"The first thing you spoke about is that we are creating and scoring more than most of the teams. That is a point,\" said Amorim. \"Then I understand the team better than anyone. And sometimes you have the supporters on your decisions. Sometimes you have to do what you think. And sometimes it's hard for them to understand.",
      "\"But I know when I look at the pitch, I can understand which player is tired, which player is going to be is going to struggle a lot if there is a one against one all the time. And I just try to protect the team and just try to win games. And sometimes it's the best substitution.",
      "\"Sometimes it's the wrong substitution. But I just try to do my best. But you said that. I think there is one team that score more goals than us.",
      "\"We create a lot. We have more shots than anyone. So if we have something here completely different from last year is the way we attack. I think we need to improve the way we defend.\"",

      "Manchester United have a proud history of integrating academy stars into their first-team early, often when rivals would have chosen to be more cautious. The Class of '92 are the poster boys for this movement and have shaped the United philosophy in the years which have followed.",
      "Even as we exit 2025 and enter 2026, United are still seen as a club who give youth a chance. We only have to look back to last January and see how Ayden Heaven chose to leave Arsenal because the opportunities were readily available in the north west, to prove this theory.",
      "However, while it may be inadvertent, Ruben Amorim seems to have forged a war with the academy players which is leading to an awkward succession line. Alejandro Garnacho was a recent academy graduate who failed to see eye-to-eye with the manager and it feels a similar situation is starting to brew with Kobbie Mainoo - albeit it is nowhere near the same level yet.",
      "But even further down the pecking order, there is some worrying signs of a disconnect between the two levels. Earlier this month, Amorim felt the need to call out Harry Amass, currently at Sheffield Wednesday, and Chido Obi for sending subtle messages to him on Instagram.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids,\" Amorim told a largely stunned press conference. \"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping.",
      "\"That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement. I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled. They feel free to respond to the manager with a picture, my office is open, nobody is coming to talk to me.\"",
      "Since then, Amorim has needed to rely on the youngsters just to fill his squad. Obi made the bench alongside Shea Lacey, Tyler Fletcher, and his twin Jack, Tyler Fredricson and Bendito Mantato. Only Jack Fletcher and Mantato were brought on to face the Premier League's worst club Wolves.",
      "Fletcher and Fredricson's place as unused substitutes made sense considering they are a midfielder and defender respectively. But the decision to overlook Obi and Lacey was surprising.",
      "It left many wondering why the duo were picked on the bench if they were going to be ignored when the team needs a goal, despite being attackers. Perhaps sensing a backlash, Amorim went on the offensive post-match.",
      "\"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" the United manager said assuredly. \"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid.",
      "\"You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\" The way Amorim suggested things would go from bad to worse if he had thrown in more young players, should grate the academy stars' nerves.",
      "They should be feeling hard done by because, regardless of the lack of options, they were first-team players on Tuesday night and when the game needed attackers, they were overlooked. That should fuel something in them now to prove Amorim wrong.",
      "Like the United boss said in the middle of this month, this does not mean Obi and Lacey should take to Instagram to send subtle but immature messages to the manager. Instead, the objective should be to knuckle down and prove to Amorim he has misjudged their talents and they can actually be brought on to make a difference.",
      "While United have so many players out, Amorim will need to continue using academy players on his bench. Eventually, there will come a time when the Reds' boss bites the bullet and gives them a chance to impress and just like Fletcher has done, they need to take it.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's permanent transfer from Manchester United to Napoli is all but confirmed, according to a top official at the Italian club. The striker was loaned to the Serie A giants for the season and has made an immediate impact.",
      "Napoli have the option to make the move permanent for €50m (£43.6m) at the end of the loan spell, which will become mandatory if they secure a Champions League spot this season. However, all the signs point towards Hojlund making a permanent switch regardless.",
      "Giovanni Manna, Napoli's director, has stated that both the club and Hojlund view the transfer as essentially finalised, reports the Mirror.",
      "“We did everything we could to sign him. There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it,” Manna said in an interview with Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.",
      "“We had no doubts. Rasmus is decisive in terms of numbers, but also in how he understands the coach’s input. This makes a difference.",
      "“There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”",
      "When quizzed about whether a permanent move for Hojlund was likely, Manna responded: “As of today, I think so.”",
      "These remarks from Manna follow reports in Italy suggesting that Napoli are already preparing the terms of Hojlund's contract as a full-time player. Reports suggest the striker will have a €85m (£74.2m) release clause included in his contract in Naples - with that clause becoming active in the summer of 2027. Hojlund has netted seven goals in 19 appearances for the Serie A outfit this campaign.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Napoli boss Antonio Conte said about Hojlund’s form recently.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund signed for United from Atalanta in 2023, bagging 16 goals during his first campaign at Old Trafford before adding another ten in his second season, with only four of those coming in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim went back to his favoured back three system for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Wolves to try and counter the approach from the Premier League's basement boys. Amorim finally moved to a back four against Newcastle on Boxing Day and saw his side win 1-0, with a much more fluent attacking performance in the first half. But with winless Wolves at Old Trafford, he opted for a safety-first approach and sought to match Wolves' system.",
      "United were missing eight players through injuries or international call-ups, but produced a flat performance against a team that had taken just two points from their first 18 Premier League games of the season. Joshua Zirkzee's deflected shot gave them the lead, but Ladislav Krejci equalised before half-time and the visitors came closest to winning the game.",
      "Amorim admitted his change in system was based on his evaluation of Wolves and that he moved Patrick Dorgu back to wing-back to try and take advantage of that.",
      "\"We knew that they will play with a five, use the width, today was to do that and sometimes build up with him [Dorgu] open or close with Luke doing the opposite, we try to arrange the right situations,\" said Amorim.",

      "\"We need to do what the game was asking,\" was the beginning of Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim's staunch defence of his decision to take Joshua Zirkzee off at half time during the draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. For a man who was once cheered off the pitch by United supporters, it is now fitting for Zirkzee that his exit on Tuesday baffled everyone.",
      "But Zirkzee was not injured and Amorim was keen to defend his decision to bring on Jack Fletcher and solidify the midfield further. \"They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and with Jack we balanced that,\" Amorim continued.",
      "\"I think we recovered the ball faster in the second half. In the first half we struggled a little bit to recover the ball so I'm just looking not for their age and experience and in this moment I just look at what I can do to win the game.\"",
      "Sadly for Amorim, his excuse for hauling Zirkzee off was flimsy at best. While the Dutchman may have been fortunate to score the opener, he was at least providing a threat for United. At that stage of the match, with United still needing a goal, taking off a forward for a midfielder was not the option. The optics were terrible and while Fletcher did well when he was introduced into the game, Benjamin Sesko, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha did not muster up nearly enough going forward to win the match for the Reds.",
      "Ultimately, substituting Zirkzee at half time is a clear sign of what the future holds for United heading into the January transfer window. Amorim seems destined to allow the Dutchman to depart next month and there seems very little the 24-year-old can do to change his mind.",
      "Since the Reds invested in the attack during the summer transfer window, Zirkzee has been on borrowed time. Rasmus Hojlund was perhaps wise to jump at the opportunity to leave for Napoli upon the arrival of Sesko.",
      "Like Hojlund, Zirkzee is not a player who Amorim sees fitting the system. The glimmer of hope for the forward's United career was him being able to gain more chances while there was absentees.",
      "What Tuesday night proved is that this route is not available to Zirkzee either. It is understood AS Roma have a keen interest in bringing Zirkzee back to Serie A and a return to Italy is the best option for him, especially if he wants to make a late bid for the Netherlands national team in a World Cup year.",
      "As for Amorim and United, the pressure is on. If Zirkzee is to leave in January, they must look to replace him with a recognised striker. The United boss has spoken at length about his desire to sign players who can benefit the club in the future, not just the present. But how many of those centre-forwards are available and fit the bill in January?",
      "All the pressure is on the powers that be at Old Trafford now because if the substitution against Wolves is a sign of Zirkzee's impending exit, they will be expected to adequately replace him. Waiting for the summer is simply not an option for the Reds when the attack is wafer thin already.",

      "The Stretford End had seen enough with just under 20 minutes of Manchester United's final game of 2025 to go. \"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the cry, urging more from a team treating the visit of a side with a shot at being the worst in Premier League history with all the trepidation of a Champions League knockout tie.",
      "Ruben Amorim's response was to turn to his bench - and bring Leny Yoro on for Ayden Heaven. That teenager Bendito Mantato came on at the same time didn't stop the home fans showing their frustration at another of those changes they have come to associate Amorim with.",
      "One centre-back for another when you're chasing the game, while attacking teenagers Shea Lacey and Chido Obi remained rooted to the bench, is the kind of safety-first move that is gradually eroding the faith many of these supporters have in Amorim.",
      "Having moved to a back-four on Boxing Day, the decision to revert to a back three against a team with two points from 18 games left many scratching their heads.",
      "It allowed Wolves to settle into the game. United started quickly on Boxing Day, but approached the start of this game as if they had a belly full of mince pies and chocolates. It's so often the way in a defensive system and it felt as if Amorim hadn't learnt his lesson.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Senne Lammens: Couple of excellent saves in either half, the second of which from Krejci was a strong hand and he reacted well to claw the ball from danger. 7",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Passing radar not as good as it usually is and didn't carry the same authority as he did on Boxing Day. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: His challenge on Hwang Hee-chan led to the first goal and he was solid in the middle of the defence. Boos when replaced by Yoro showed fans are falling for him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Lots of ground to cover in the second half and tested at times, but showed his fitness is improving. Combination with Patrick Dorgu seems to be lacking something. 6",

      "That's the final whistle at Old Trafford.",

      "Yoro and Mantato ON.",
      "Heaven and Ugarte OFF.",

      "United struggling to create against this shocking Wolves side.",
      "Lammens makes a huge save and Rob Edwards cannot believe that has not gone in.",
      "Malacia, Yoro, Fredricson and Lacey have been sent to warm up.",
      "It seems Wolves goalkeeper Sa is already time wasting just minutes into the second half.",
      "Wolves fans chanted \"we've scored a goal, we've scored a goal\" before the interval.",

      "Dalot puts his arm around him as if to say 'keep going, your goal will come'",
      "Dorgu tries his luck from distance and comes close to scoring - it goes out for a corner.",
      "Wolves are in this game - that's another decent chance for Hee-chan at the Stretford End.",
      "A year to the day since Zirkzee was booed off against Newcastle. Not exactly a classic goal though and the kind of strike this game deserved. Heaven deserves all the credit for it, a tone-setting challenge to win the ball back and his run was the first bit of positive play in a while. United have been poor and way too cautious against the worst team in the league. They need to be braver than this.",
      "Zirkzee fires United into the lead thanks to a deflection.",
      "Superb work from Heaven, who won the ball and created the chance.",
      "We're almost 25 minutes into this game and it's been a really poor start from United against a team who are currently on course to be remembered as the worst ever in Premier League history.",
      "Hee-chan has a decent chance from the edge of the box but he fires it well over.",
      "That is excellent from Sesko, good run into the channel and with nothing on he creates the chance all by himself, shot deflected just wide. The kind of play we didn’t see from Hojlund last year, creating a chance out of nothing. Maybe that will get United going, because it’s been really flat so far. Amorim not happy at all on the touchline.",
      "Sesko creates a chance for himself after shrugging off his marker and forcing an opening.",
      "Amorim is becoming increasingly frustrated with United's lack of movement off the ball.",
      "Amorim has been waving his arms because he wants the ball played out quicker from the back. Wolves have just two points in the Premier League but they look well-organised tonight.",
      "Cunha just won a free-kick close to the box and the decision was... dubious from the referee.",
      "The back four has been and gone. The shiny new toy on Boxing Day but forgotten about before New Year’s Eve. Something of a surprise to see Amorim switch back to this system at home to Wolves, but the proof will be in the pudding. Dorgu excellent on the right wing and one of the benefits of that system was the number of players in support of the attackers. Not always had that in a back three. United should be dominating this game in terms of territory so chances to get players forward."

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "The Red Devils continued their inconsistent form on Sunday with a 1-1 draw against Leeds United at Elland Road.",
      "A clinical Matheus Cunha finish got Man Utd back on level terms on 65 minutes, just three minutes after Leeds attacker Brenden Aaronson took advantage of an Ayden Heaven mistake to give the Yorkshire side the lead.",
      "The nature of division means that the Red Devils are likely to finish the day only a few points from the bottom half of the Premier League.",
      "Amid reports of tension between Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox, the Man Utd boss gave a clear warning to the board.",
      "READ: Man Utd don’t lose at Leeds and that’s just fine for negative Ruben Amorim",
      "Speaking in his post-match press conference, Amorim said: “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the head coach. I know my name is not Conte, Tuchel, Mourinho but I’m the manager of Manchester United.",
      "“It’s going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change. I’m not going to quit. I’ll do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.”",
      "Reacting to his side’s performance against Leeds, the Man Utd boss said: “In the Premier League, it is hard to find a game you are satisfied with a draw, that is why it is an amazing league.",
      "“Overall, if you see the game we had more control. We created more chances, we controlled well, so if you look at the game you feel the frustration that we had the chance to win. It is a tough match in tough conditions.",
      "“The game plan was to understand what we did wrong against Wolves. We improved a lot because we were in the right positions. We improved from the last game.",
      "“It’s strange because they started a little bit better in the second half. When we are in control, we need to be focused in every detail. We know against West Ham, we are in control then one disconnection, there was a goal. We need to be connected all the time.",
      "“We managed to control our emotions and to score the next goal, and we had a big chance. I think we deserved a little better, but it’s okay.”",
      "“We had our opportunities to win the game. We are losing games on the details – the Leeds goal, we are controlling the game and then one kick of the ball in transition but we managed to get back into the game. Last year it would be completely different. This year we are more in control of the games than we were last year but we are frustrated not to win.”",
      "On the Leeds goal, the Man Utd boss continued: “Ayden and Leny are really young but it is not because of that. If you play so well during 90m minutes and you have a mistake that can happen. If you look at the game we had chances to score the second one and nobody would be talking about the goal of Leeds.”",
      "On goalscorer Cunha, he said: “Not just him but Josh [Zirkzee] played well in the 20 minutes he had, Ben [Sesko] linked the play well today, Ugarte is showing that he has more to give, and I am really pleased. If these guys play well we always have the chance to win the game.”",
      "When asked about the January transfer window, he replied: “United is one of the best clubs in the world. If you are here and focusing on a different club then something is wrong with you. Just focus on the game and prepare with the players that we have. We have more too, I expect more minutes for Fernandes and Mount, so we have more players that can help us.”",

      "Manchester United have only drawn 0-0 once since Ruben Amorim’s arrival. For an hour against Leeds United, it appeared they were heading for another, a result Amorim’s team selection suggested he would have accepted before kick-off.",
      "There was plenty of criticism of Amorim’s starting XI at Elland Road as he lined up with eight defensive players in his adored 3-4-2-1 formation. Patrick Dorgu, a wing-back, was part of a front three alongside Matheus Cunha and an out-of-form Benjamin Sesko, whose poor touches, finishing and hold-up play epitomised his difficult acclimatisation from the Bundesliga to the Premier League. To be fair to him, he’s not alone.",
      "Amorim knows Leeds don’t have incredible quality on the ball or the ability to freely play through teams, so selecting more defensive players makes a certain amount of sense. It does, however, make for an awfully dull game of football and points to a mentality problem: ‘don’t lose’ rather than ‘let’s win’. Against a newly promoted team, albeit one in good form, that feels wrong.",
      "That team selection did allow Manchester United greater control, with the back three rarely tested against Premier League form striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose first real sniff at goal came from a free header that hit the post and had half of Elland Road convinced it was in. Leny Yoro ought to have been tighter to the England hopeful and also should have put the visitors 1-0 up with a header of his own, which would have done his confidence the world of good. He needs it.",
      "There wasn’t much to report until Brenden Aaronson’s opening goal in the 62nd minute. Amorim’s XI was a contributing factor, but so too was the kick-off time, something we completely understand given the job West Yorkshire Police would have on their hands if Leeds vs Manchester United were an 8pm fixture.",
      "It was all just a bit flat. Scheduling this fixture as early as possible is understandable, but it was also a bit boring. We are not condoning drunk and disorderly behaviour by any means, but we want these two great rivals to meet in the best atmosphere possible.",
      "MORE F365 SAYS…\n* Arsenal take ‘the next step’ as Arteta pinpoints one player’s ‘personality and presence’ in huge win\n* Nuno sack sealed but West Ham have already given 47 million reasons why he must stay for relegation\n* Thomas Frank doesn’t ‘understand’ Spurs and Brentford stalemate suggests he never will",
      "Elland Road did erupt when Aaronson slotted past Senne Lammens, but the home fans were instantly silenced when Matheus Cunha equalised.",
      "Young Ayden Heaven won’t look back fondly on the American’s goal when it’s analysed on Monday morning, especially after such a solid, composed performance up to that point. Perhaps it was that very composure and confidence that caught him out, as Aaronson bore down on the lackadaisical defender, burst through on goal and finished with his left foot.",
      "Amorim’s reaction was immediate. Joshua Zirkzee came on and provided the assist for Cunha’s finish. When United needed to attack, they scored a brilliant goal and looked good value for a winner. Why couldn’t they have just done this from the start? Everyone’s day would have been far more entertaining.",
      "Zirkzee was one of United’s better players despite only playing 31 minutes, but Cunha was also impressive and scored the decisive equaliser. He was trying to make things happen from the first minute and also struck an exquisite volley that was ruled out for offside against Sesko.",
      "Aaronson’s opener could have sparked the game into life, but Cunha’s swift equaliser burst that bubble. The second half was a better spectacle and became hectic in injury time, but we were still left wanting more from Amorim’s side. A draw ultimately felt like a fair result.",
      "Leeds are now on their best unbeaten run in the Premier League since 2001, extending it to seven games.",
      "United have still only drawn 0-0 once under Amorim, against Manchester City on April 6 at Old Trafford, and 15 of their Premier League games in 2025/26 have seen both teams score. Leeds sit fourth in that particular table. Both delivered with goals at Elland Road, but it wasn’t the game we were hoping for.",

Or is it just about the best players and avoiding too many injuries? Rafa did this clever thing a few times where he set the team up to look like they were playing one formation and then once the game started they’d rapidly switch to something else. A few times in the champions league we scored a couple of early goals and then switched to shut out mode for 150 minutes.

Maybe Solanke won’t be injured forever. And maybe Kudus will carry on being the player who’s got 1 goal and 1 assist in his last 11 games. And maybe Solanke x Johnson could have been a thing again later in January when Kudus is even more knackered and looking a lot like second season at West Ham Kudus.

      "According to reports, Antoine Semenyo had an ‘agreement’ with Manchester United, but he decided to pull the plug on a move over a ‘lowball offer’.",
      "Semenyo has been one of the standout performers in the Premier League this season, grabbing nine goals and three assists in his 18 appearances for Bournemouth.",
      "The talented winger has been a key player for Bournemouth for a couple of years, but he has taken his performances to another level this term and has earned admiring glances from other clubs.",
      "In recent weeks, it has emerged that every Big Six club have expressed their interest in signing Semenyo, with this competition and his £65m release clause making a January transfer inevitable.",
      "Man City and Man Utd were said to be the leading contenders for his signature, but it has emerged that he has opted for a move to the Eithad and a deal is likely to be completed in the next few days.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Man City v Chelsea, Man United, Andoni Iraola, Rodrigao Bentinha, La Liga returns",
      "On Thursday evening, a report claimed there had been a ‘breakthrough in negotiations’ between Man City and Bournemouth, who have now reached an ‘agreement’ over Semenyo.",
      "This is a blow for Man Utd, who need to sign another quality option or two in attacking areas to provide extra competition.",
      "United are currently overly reliant on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, who signed instead of Semenyo in the summer.",
      "A report from journalist Duncan Castles claims Man Utd actually had an ‘agreement’ with Semenyo over persoanl terms, but this deal fell through as the winger ‘took exception to’ a ‘lowball offer’.",
      "“As we discussed in the podcast in September, Ruben Amorim met Semenyo in person to assess his character,” Castles said on the Transfers Podcast.",
      "“United had agreed personal terms with the player only for Semenyo to discover that their salary offer to him was significantly less than what they’d given Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“This allowed Bournemouth to persuade the player to sign a new contract with a release clause.”",
      "Castles has also revealed when Semenyo is likely to complete his move from Bournemouth to Man City.",
      "“I understand that Bournemouth expect to keep the player for the next two games,” Castles added.",
      "“The clause is valid for the first 10 days of January only, and they’re running it to the end of the clause before allowing him to go to another club.”",
      "He continued: “Pretty much all the top clubs in the Premier League have tried to exploit [Semenyo’s release clause].",
      "“Manchester United came back in. Chelsea enquired. Liverpool looked at time. Tottenham made an offer and failed again because he decided Manchester City was the most attractive club to move to.”",
      "Antoine Semenyo’s move to Manchester City is reportedly ‘agreed’, while Pep Guardiola’s side are also ‘in talks’ to sign Liverpool target Marc Guehi.",
      "According to reports, ‘three major reasons’ have prevented Manchester City-bound Antoine Semenyo from joining Liverpool in next month’s transfer window.",
      "Antoine Semenyo moving to Manchester City could set in motion a transfer domino effect that reaches as far as Liverpool and Arsenal…",
      "Man City are ‘closing in on a full agreement’ for Antoine Semenyo with Liverpool not expected to make a late move for the Bournemouth forward.",
      "Former Liverpool man Jermaine Pennant thinks it’s “really stupid” that the Reds haven’t put themselves in the position to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Bournemouth ‘expect’ Antoine Semenyo’s transfer to Manchester City to be completed within the next 48 hours, according to reports."

      "There is some significant jostling for position going on now, with Chelsea throwing a spanner in the works by axeing Enzo Maresca, who had been a relative outsider to be the next out despite his increasingly perplexing post-match musings.",
      "There is now a new frontrunner. Well, we say new – both he and his current club have already been at the head of this market in different lives this season.",
      "Arne Slot has had a few wins to get him out of immediate Mo Salah-instigated danger, but Newcastle’s failure to launch this season, Tottenham’s baffling home-away dichotomy and winless runs at Burnley and Bournemouth are all causing significant ripples.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they end 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they have somehow just about stayed in range of Arsenal at the summit.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should arbitrary position has been handed to them this week. But you still don’t want to find yourself right at the bottom of that group, do you? Having to accept that technically so far this season you’ve actually been worse than Spurs?",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",
      "But instead, they haven’t kicked on at all. Their only wins in the last six games, all of which were winnable, have come against Burnley. It’s emblematic of a season stubbornly refusing to get going and could yet prove costly for Howe.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Five wins from the last seven have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon. A second December draw against Chelsea could be the start of something, but they urgently need a win. Arsenal as the first game of 2026 isn’t ideal; Dr Tottenham straight after it absolutely is.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs. Although losing an actual Premier League match to someone as ropey as Spurs was also quite careless.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool at least showed a bit of something before hilariously running off with a point from Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just further highlighted the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff. Like beating Newcastle and then drawing at home against the worst Premier League team of all time.",
      "The fact that United’s response to the Newcastle win was to talk about Champions League pushes and even in some outlandish cases title charges just shows how little the ‘United are just stuff that happens’ reality is being understood and accepted. Even yer man waiting for his haircut was getting cocky after beating Newcastle with Wolves up next.",
      "We need you all to grasp this: what United have done in their last game or even last handful of games has absolutely no bearing on what will happen next. They have not turned a corner. The truth is they turn so many corners that they just always end up back where they started.",
      "We didn’t have to wait long for the first Big Six manager departure of 2026, and there are significant whispers that we could be in something of a London bus situation.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ends 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a growing concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question with an increasingly troubling conclusion for those of a Hammers persuasion.",
      "",
      "Thomas Frank’s Tottenham tried desperately to protect a slender 1-0 lead at home to Sunderland. What happened next will shock you.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has insisted that he will be a “manager, not coach” at Old Trafford as promised on his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "Man United didn’t lose at Leeds and Ruben Amorim will be perfectly happy with that after starting eight defensive players at Elland Road.",
      "Manchester United head of recruitment Christopher Vivell has reportedly ‘privately’ hit out at head coach Ruben Amorim over his tactics.",
      "In a particularly silly Mailbox, Arsenal have been backed to sign Alexander Isak to replace Viktor Gyokeres in a double deal after becoming champions.",

      "This is despite the Premier League side having a positive summer transfer window, during which they offloaded most of their dead wood and spent around £230m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "This business has boosted Amorim‘s side, but they are lacking in different departments. This is especially the case in midfield, with United requiring at least one new signing in this department in the coming weeks/months.",
      "Despite this, Amorim has indicated that there will be no “changes” to Man Utd’s squad this month.",

      "READ: Big Weekend: Man City v Chelsea, Man United, Andoni Iraola, Rodrigao Bentinha, La Liga returns",
      "“There is a process, there is an idea – that is going to continue. We are near places of the Champions League but we are also near eight teams behind us, so let’s focus on the next game.”",
      "When asked whether any of his players had knocked on his door asking to leave the club, he responded: “No, none of them.",
      "“I don’t expect them to come to me to ask [to leave].”",
      "Amorim has also boldly argued that the Red Devils should have more points than their current tally of 30 after 19 games.",

      "“It’s one more game, I know it means a lot to the fans but we need to go there and try to win.”",
      "“I never experienced this [rivalry]. Different environment, different culture, but the noise is going to be big. It’s hard to compare different cultures, different derbies, histories.",
      "“When you play for Manchester United you need to be ready for everything. You guys have the best league in the world, every game you see there is a lot of draws, you never understand what is going to happen at the end of that week.”",

      "We are now deep in the most Barclays period of any season, a time where games apparently take place every day and nobody actually knows who they’re playing until the game begins or indeed what day it is or why it’s a team they only played three weeks ago.",
      "It’s just games. And then some more games. Just Our League forever and ever and ever. It is the most wonderful time of the year and don’t ask too many questions about why so many of the games seem to be low-effort, low-tempo, low-quality 0-0 draws. Don’t worry about that at all, okay?",
      "We’ve double-checked the calendar and this next bunch of games definitely take place on a weekend. We’ve double-checked their size and confirmed they are large. It is with great confidence, therefore, that we present the latest Big Weekend.",
      "",
      "It already was, probably, before the Enzo Maresca business blew up. We do rather admire the man. If the rumours are true and he really did try and use reported interest from Man City to coax an improved contract out of notorious manager-killers Chelsea, then that is rather wonderful.",
      "You’ve already been there 18 months, man! Look at the history! You’re already an ancient, decrepit manager on borrowed time by Chelsea standards!",
      "Anyway, he’s gone now. We’re not sure it will make Chelsea any better or worse in the long run. He’s never really felt like he’s that important a figure there, frankly. Neither conspicuous problem nor compelling solution.",
      "Now Chelsea have to decide what happens next. Do they double-down on their unique approach to the game? Or do they abandon the experiment altogether after throwing eye-wateringly vast sums of money at it?",
      "And in the meantime, a nice soothing trip to Manchester City to keep things ticking over. That should be easy enough, shouldn’t it?",
      "City’s title-sniffing winning run is over after being held to a goalless draw at Sunderland. But all the great and good get held to a draw at Sunderland these days.",
      "There was little sense of wheels falling off, but it does leave City precious little wriggle room here. They can’t now really afford to be handing more ground to the galloping Gunners and must cash in on any confusion or lack of focus under, as far as know at this point, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane.",
      "",
      "Your man is never, ever getting that haircut, is he? After victory against Newcastle, it appeared but a formality for United’s win counter to tick along to two via a home game against a Wolves side that was losing to absolutely everyone, including 4-1 at home to Man United just a few weeks ago.",
      "But the thing we’re all coming to realise with Manchester United is that what has gone before – even if it’s only a week or three ago – has quite simply no bearing whatsoever on what will happen next.",
      "There is no such thing as good form or bad form with United. You can’t extrapolate anything from anything they do. They simply are.",
      "Sometimes they’ll play quite well and win rather impressively. Sometimes they’ll battle to a result that shows plenty of fight and spirit. Sometimes they’ll lose narrowly to a better team. Sometimes they’ll lose badly to a worse team.",
      "And sometimes they’ll fail to beat a Wolves team that had two points all season.",
      "Ruben Amorim didn’t invent this version of Manchester United. All their recent managers have been capable of confidently turning corners that lead directly down another drab cul-de-sac. Especially Erik Ten Hag, but especially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "But Amorim has now perfected the art. Instead of a buoyant United side with a couple of festive wins under their belts, this is now once again a reduced and uncertain Man United. And they must now head across the Pennines to face a Leeds side who actually have turned a corner in recent weeks and struck upon something that works in a six-game unbeaten runs featuring a win over Chelsea and now a pair of draws against Liverpool.",
      "Does feel like Leeds should probably sort Man United out good and proper this weekend. Which probably means Man United will actually win 4-1.",

      "The run of five wins and three draws in eight games (after an unfortunate opening defeat to Liverpool at Anfield before everyone knew that was quite bad) that lifted Bournemouth all the way up to third in the table now feels like a lifetime ago.",
      "It’s now been 10 games without a win since a 2-0 victory over Nottingham Forest back in October, and it’s fair to say Arsenal aren’t the side you’d necessarily choose to face to try and bring a 10-game winless run to an end.",
      "There’s better news ahead, because after that it’s Dr Tottenham and they are 100 per cent the very team you’d choose to try and bring an 11-game winless run to an end.",
      "But it does seem likely to get worse before it gets better for Iraola. And he’s also just clearly got this whole thing backwards too.",
      "Had Bournemouth started badly and then hit their stride he would be a solid favourite for all three of the either definitely or feasibly available Big Six jobs at this time. The bad run at the start of the season would have been attributed entirely to losing his entire defence in the summer and explained away far more easily than it is now this run of despair has come after he’s already proved he didn’t actually need all those brilliant defenders at all actually.",
      "With Antoine Semenyo’s departure also now imminent, it’s an odd old time for a manager who should be looking at the next step up the career ladder having done all kinds of brilliant things in his current job, but who might instead soon find himself coming under actual pressure in his current role having watched Bournemouth slip right down into and now out the back of the great fog of mediocrity that is this season’s Premier League mid-table peloton.",

      "A point at Brentford is not a bad result for anyone this season. We’re halfway through the season and the only visiting team to win there this season is Man City, and that was a tense and tight 1-0 win.",
      "The result is fine. The manner of it not so much. Most Spurs fans would have settled for a point last night; but they will not settle for playing only for that point and showing neither the Dare nor the Do to strive for anything more.",
      "That is what Thomas Frank still doesn’t grasp, and why last night’s draw might actually be his most damaging result yet. Because it highlights the gulf that exists between him and fans who spent the entire game singing for lost heroes from Dele to Christian Eriksen and Mousa Dembele. Even Eric Dier’s song got an airing as, of course, did Brennan Johnson’s. Along with more than one refrain of Boring, Boring Tottenham.",
      "The fans were clear and unanimous in their displeasure – and this is the away fans Thomas Frank has previously praised in contrast to those mean home ones who make it impossible for his players to beat even Wolves at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "But in Frank’s mind, the trip to Brentford represented a job well done.",
      "It also represented the first time since the disastrous trip to Arsenal in November that he had paired Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha in midfield, adding a layer of nonsense atop that cement-mixer of a midfield by asking a third defensive midfielder in Archie Gray to play as a kind of false 10.",
      "All three are good players. All three are perfectly valid and useful members of Spurs’ squad. They absolutely do not and cannot together constitute a viable midfield three.",
      "We’ve said before and we’ll say again that Palhinha and Bentancur specifically are an either/or proposition.",
      "But Spurs simply don’t have the numbers and their manager lacks the inclination to gamble.",
      "With Lucas Bergvall, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski, Pape Sarr and Xavi Simons all still unavailable for assorted reasons this weekend, we fully expect to see Bentinha once again in dreary harness in Spurs’ midfield against Sunderland.",
      "Except this time it’s at home. And it won’t just be 1700 travelling Spurs fans voicing their displeasure at the sheer indignity of it all.",
      "",
      "Coventry’s serene march to the Premier League has encountered a minor bump in the road after a run of two wins, three draws and two defeats in the last seven games, but the good news for Frank Lampard and the lads is that nobody else is making a compelling case of stepping up to put any pressure on the leaders.",
      "One team with lofty ambitions to do so would be Birmingham, but after a run of four wins in six games up to the start of last month it’s now seven games without a win after a painful 3-0 defeat at Watford on New Year’s Day.",
      "",
      "La Liga is back, back, back after its Christmas break, with a local derby in Barcelona the headline act.",
      "Espanyol have their own interests too – they get back under way in fifth place and two points behind fourth-placed Villarreal – but certainly won’t mind putting a spanner in Barcelona’s title-cruising works either."

We had never finished below 8th. We always challenged for the cups at least if nothing. We made a half hearted attempt at top 4. We didn’t lose to some of the worst teams to grace the Premier League. There is a period between 2013 & till Ten Hag left, and then there is this.",
      "If Amorim won his next 14 games IN A ROW, he will still be 1 win off matching David Moyes’ record at MUFC. That is an abolsutely shocking stastic. His formation is rubbish, his man management is rubbish. He is using Manchester United as work experience to learn on the job, and waste our time, effort & money. Losing to Grimsby & [drawing versus] this Wolves team in the same season is a sackable offence 10 out of 10 times. But the board will never learn. They keep hiring “up and comers” in managers, in strikers, in defense, in everything. Hoping to find a gem in a pile of horseshit, but what we are left with is just horseshit.",

But he looks so far out of his depth, that I honestly feel 90% of the mailbox, including raigbater champion Stewie would make a better manager at MUFC. It’s that bad. Chatgpt would make better decisions. The whole job of a manager is to have good tactics & plans, manage the players, have an eye for what will work. He knows none of that. He is an embarrassment to the club and just football in general.",
      "This is a manager who was so scared of what the media will say, he preferred to lose playing 3-5-2 rather than change it to 4 at the back and win. In his own words. He is so clueless from day 1 that he himself feels 75% of his decisions were wrong.",
      "These are signs of a weak, fragile & clueless man. I will always hope the manager succeeds, but I can’t help but be frustrated. We couldnt beat fuckin WOLVES!!! And they honestly had the much better chances and should have won. It’s that bad. And all the Amorim supporters say “give him time”… it’s been 60+ games!! If you wanna back him, fair enough. But let’s not be blinded by saying this is the version of Amorim that will ever succeed. He needs to change EVERYTHING about himself, his tactics, his mindset, his knowledge, his attitude and maybe then he will have a chance.

I don’t mention Boehly here (although he doesn’t seem like the sharpest knife), because all the decision making over the last 18 months seems to have been done by the brain society of E,W&L.",
      "While this ownership and board are in charge of Chelsea, the club will regress. I felt that about a month into the new owners, I feel it now.",

      "",
      "Happy new year! There appears to be a lot of face saving and revisionism from Chelsea fans now, and dare I say it a divide in the fan base, so I want to kind of set the record straight and use only facts to discuss the sacking of Enzo Maresca.",
      "David Ornstein is reporting that back in October, Maresca told the Chelsea board he was already in discussions with Man City about replacing Pep. Then he was doing the same again, a second round of negotiations in December. That is a manager who has had his head turned. Would that be accepted by a fanbase if it was a player? Let’s ask Liverpool FC supporters and Trent Alexander Arnold.",
      "So Maresca isn’t focussed fully on Chelsea at this point. And that appears to have found its way to the dressing room, where he conceivably lost the players confidence and trust. Results have been pretty good since though… no? Oh. No.",
      "Then there is the argument that Maresca wasn’t backed by the Chelsea owners/board. The facts of the matter are he asked for Man City academy products who he knew. He was behind the signings of Palmer (thankfully!), Delap, Tosin and Sancho’s loan. He also asked for Dewsbury Hall, and duly received. On top of this he was handed young players capable of developing into world class talent. Yet he has appeared completely incapable of coaching a defence or improving any individual. His greatest successes in respect of individual players are Robert Sanchez now making fewer mistakes and Reece James being injury free for a year. That’s pretty much it.",
      "There are Chelsea fans saying that Maresca wasn’t given time. He had 18 months. Maresca was the tenth longest serving Premier League manager when the bell chimed on his final minute in charge.",
      "Finally we have the “he had to rotate to keep everyone happy” argument. And Chelsea’s bloated squad is the reason behind the rotation. A reminder then, that in every single competition Chelsea play in, they are bound by the same squad size limits as every other team. They are not trying to give 60 different players minutes in the Premier League. It’s just not a thing. Chelsea have used 25 different players in the Premier League. The same number as Man United, Wolves, Brighton and Sunderland. One player more than Arsenal and Man City. Yet Chelsea have made the most changes to their starting 11.",
      "Maresca’s stubborn refusal to find/use a consistent lineup or even consistent spine ultimately led to Chelsea lacking consistency until his final breath, as it were.",
      "His greatest win is undoubtedly the club World Cup success. A genuine display of tactical awareness caught even me off guard, in a final where we out PSG’d PSG. But an end of season cup competition where Maresca could consistently play his best team, with the fewest changes to each starting line up… well, that’s there for all to see isn’t it. Consistency breeds consistency.",
      "He was given time, he was given players he asked for, he was provided opportunity and he fluttered his eyelashes at Man City at the nearest opportunity.",
      "Whilst I understand the frustrations of many Chelsea fans about the direction of the club, the recruitment policy and the continuation of Circus FC, Maresca had to go. We deserve better.\nAsh, CFC, Kent",

      "I get that Dave Tickner is a disillusioned Spurs fan but his coverage has now become so narrative driven and obtuse that even when he’s making a good point he has to dress it up in pure nonsense. So yes, it is extremely significant that spurs have sold Brennan Johnson for a reasonable price instead of holding onto an unrealistic valuation and letting his value decline over time.",
      "An article about this doesn’t need the snide The Lewis Family TM nonsense, both because it really isn’t as clever as Dave thinks it is, but more importantly because pretending the powers behind the throne have always been the same is patently false. The Lewis Family isn’t a single fungible amorphous mass but is instead made up of different people from the same family, and it is clear that the children of Joe Lewis view things very differently from their dad. That is why Daniel levy has gone, along with his chief lieutenant on the board in Donna Cullen, and there is a new CEO and a new chairman in place. Still, why let facts get in the way of a good narrative?\nPhil, London",

      "I used to watch football to be entertained by high pressing with interchangeable midfielders flooding the box and tracking back within the same breath. Fullbacks bombing and kamikaze strikers. And goals — so many goals — like a byproduct of the madness. But thankfully I’ve now evolved to understand that goals mean little, possession is king, and recycling play is how players add to their statistical values that tell you how well they will perform in a computer a year from now even if they look a bit lacking using those prehistoric inventions called eyes. A ball delivered into the box is a needless risk. A back pass is still a pass as the team aims for a thousand of them. I finally understand. I am post football. I am enlightened. 2 + 2 = 5.\nNiall, Annapolis",

      "I was reading a column reviewing the EPL so far this season and at one point it was stated that there were rumours that at least 3 clubs use AI to select the team each game.",
      "Now, as a Fantasy Football player, I have 3 teams. One, my regular team, I select using my own thoughts, gut instinct, on who is playing well, upcoming fixture difficulty, etc. Another uses some available online AI tools to suggest transfers and who to select for the current game week, and another using my own Python/AI attempt at selecting the team and transfers.",
      "Guess what? My original team is still better. The AI teams look like they are working, mostly make reasonable changes, but sometimes make bonkers ones too.",
      "You also realise just how many variables exist, with what is really a small data set of games and overall information, making it tricky to get it right. I am sure an EPL club can afford better talent and tools, but would still be subject to the same limitations of a small data set. 38 games is just not enough and as teams change dramatically each season (and half season) not sure that past data is as useful. Wondering if Chelsea and Maresca were one of the teams? Might make more sense of some of his seemingly whacky team selections. No?",
      "The other topic was the most recent pronouncement of the KMI (the body that reviews major refereeing decisions and makes a judgement on which were right or wrong.) It all sounds rather important and impactful but is ultimately another cosmetic PR exercise. No real visibility into the process or at least how any outcome of the panel might impact refereeing process changes.",
      "So yet another cul-de-sac in performance accountability of the PGMOL, it seems. Other than some fans getting more pissed when the KMI pronounced that Everton, for example, should have had a penalty in the game they lost 1-0 Arsenal. A decision that could have a huge impact on the final outcome. Certainly end of season earnings.",
      "While the commonly held belief is that these things even out over a season, as mentioned above, there isn’t enough data so it isn’t likely to be true over a 38 game season.",
      "Whether the decisions were right or wrong, those that track impact of VAR either positively or negatively in the last full season showed Newcastle at the top with a +9, while Bournemouth were at the bottom with a -7. And most would recall several times the PGMOL had to apologize to Bournemouth for their errors. So they clearly don’t even out over a season.",

      "Asked whether he still feels he has the backing of the club's board during his press conference following Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds, Amorim was keen to clarify his role at the club having recently hinted at friction behind the scenes over transfers and tactics.",
      "The former Sporting boss was unveiled as head coach when he was appointed at Old Trafford in November 2024 on a two-and-a-half-year contract which is due to expire in June 2027, but, in an apparent message to the hierarchy, he has said he sees himself as manager.",

      "Amorim subsequently fielded a back four for the first time in Manchester United's win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, but reverted to a back three against Wolves.",
      "He then gave an uncharacteristically downbeat press conference before the Leeds game on Friday which featured more cryptic comments.",
      "\"There was a clear shift in Amorim's mood at his Friday press conference and it didn't improve this afternoon. He seemed quite similar and made it clear repeatedly that he is the Manchester United manager, and that that is what he came to do.",
      "\"He referenced Conte, Tuchel and Mourinho. That can be interpreted as him saying he doesn't have the full autonomy of big-name managers, or it can be interpreted as him saying his decisions are being questioned by those higher up at the club.",
      "\"One thing that cannot be argued, though, is that there has been a clear shift in Amorim's mood in the last week or so. We felt that on Friday at his news conference ahead of this game, and it hasn't improved whatsoever after the 1-1 draw.\"",

      "Ruben Amorin's side, held by the same scoreline against Wolves on Tuesday, had to come from behind on this occasion after Brenden Aaronson put Leeds ahead when he outpaced Ayden Heaven to beat Senne Lammens in the second half.",
      "The visitors hit back quickly, however, with Matheus Cunha finishing smartly on the angle just 174 seconds after the opening goal, having been played through by substitute Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "In an apparent message to the Man Utd hierarchy, Ruben Amorim insisted he sees himself as a manager rather than a head coach after the game.",
      "The equaliser set up a frantic finale which featured chances for both sides. Cunha went closest for Manchester United when he struck the outside of the post from the edge of the box, while Benjamin Sesko fired wastefully wide from Zirkzee's cut-back.",

      "Joel Piroe then came close to a winner at the other end when he fired narrowly over with his first touch after coming off the bench.",
      "Leeds also struck the post from Dominic Calvert-Lewin's glancing header in the first half, while Noah Okafor had an overhead kick superbly saved at full stretch by Lammens.",
      "Amorim's side had other scoring opportunities too, the best of which saw Leeds goalkeeper Lucas Perri make a fine reflex stop from Leny Yoro's close-range header.",
      "Manchester United showed some improvement from the Wolves draw, after which they were booed off at Old Trafford, but the result leaves them with one win from their last five Premier League games.",

      "\"We controlled Leeds quite well. A team that is quite strong on set-pieces and second balls and really quick up front. We had our opportunities to win the game, of course. We are losing games in the details. For Leeds' goal, we are controlling the game and one kick in transition [undoes us].",

      "Cunha performed poorly in the draw with his former club Wolves but this was much more like it from the 26-year-old. He looked determined to give a better account of himself right from the start and finished the game as its outstanding player.",

      "Manchester United's transfer priority in 2026 is one or two top central midfielders; Brighton want to keep Carlos Baleba until the summer when there is expected increased interest; Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Joao Gomes are also among Man Utd's top targets",
      "By Vik Varange, Lyall Thomas, Dan Khan, Adrian Kajumba",
      "Saturday 3 January 2026 20:24, UK",
      "However, a deal is not expected to progress any further this month, with Brighton keen to keep him until at least the summer, when there is expected to be a market for central midfielders.",
      "And Brighton deputy chairman Paul Barber has insisted there are no immediate plans to sell 22-year-old Baleba, telling talkSPORT: \"We have no plans or desire to sell Carlos in this window or any future window. We know he's a talented player and he's got a lot of options ahead of him in the future.\"",
      "It is understood Man Utd's priority in 2026 is signing at least one - maybe two - top central midfielders.",
      "Baleba is on a list of top targets that also includes Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Wolves' Joao Gomes.",
      "The club are also continuing to assess forward options, with Antoine Semenyo seemingly destined for Manchester City, and are monitoring the situations of Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta and RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has suggested there are no ongoing discussions about transfers at Old Trafford, despite the January window being open.",
      "United travel to Leeds on Sunday with a threadbare squad, with up to eight players expected to miss the game.",
      "Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo are not expected to return from injury, while Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai are away on Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) duty.",
      "Asked if the club are working on reinforcing the squad this window to help move up the table, Amorim said: \"The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversation in this moment to have any change in the squad.",
      "\"There's the process. There's an idea that is going to continue. We are near the places of Champions League, but we are also near eight teams behind us. So let's focus on the next game.\"",
      "United forward Joshua Zirkzee has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Prodded further as to whether players had come to him to ask to leave the club this window, Amorim added: \"No. None of them. I don't expect them to come to me to ask for anything.\"",
      "\"It's an ambition [of mine] to be the best midfielder in the world. I just want to work hard, to take some advice, to take something from the midfielders. Not just in the Premier League, because I learned a lot from here,\" he said.",
      "\"Rodri and others, but I try to take [lessons from] outside of the Premier League. Like Ligue 1, Vitinha or Joao Neves.",
      "\"In LaLiga, Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta, [Sergio] Busquets. I try to learn every day. I'm watching them on YouTube.\"",
      "Baleba took his love for the game to France from Douala, Cameroon, with Lille beckoning. After rising through the ranks in France, a move to Brighton and the Premier League soon followed. He made the move to the Amex in August 2023 but it was his performances in the 2024/25 season that made everyone take note.",
      "Under the guidance of Fabian Hurzeler, Baleba emerged as one of the league's finest midfield prospects. But after a whirlwind summer, it's been a slower start to this campaign. The spotlight was always an ambition for Baleba but he didn't expect the speed at which his reputation would rise.",
      "\"When I see my name everywhere, I'm happy,\" he says. \"When I was a kid, it was a wish for my dad and my mum. It's a wish for me.",
      "\"I'm happy with it all. But it was overwhelming because I've done everything so fast. I've done things that some players at my age, they don't do the things like I did. But I'm really happy.\"",

      "Sunday 4 January 2026 17:50, UK",
      "Fourteen losses, 11 draws and 13 wins represent Manchester United's 2025 in the Premier League under Ruben Amorim. But nothing has been more reflective of their uncertain future under the Portuguese boss than his team selections, shape and approach.",
      "In November of 2024, a then-confident and vibrant Amorim, in his first interview with the club, explained the importance of establishing an identity.",
      "\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,\" he told the club's official channels.",
      "\"To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So, since day one, we will start with our identity.\"",
      "On the heels of Amorim's first words as United boss was the now infamous 3-4-2-1 set-up. The three defenders, two pivot midfielders in between wing-backs behind a forward line of three, instantly came to define Amorim's United. In September 2025, Amorim said \"not even the Pope\" could change his approach to the game.",
      "Up until recently, his set-up had not changed, and fans and media alike questioned the former Sporting boss' ability to adapt after the approach bore very little fruit. It was an approach new to Old Trafford and its results did very little to inspire. A 15th-placed finish in the league and a Europa League final defeat were its offerings.",
      "While in game, naturally, roles would shift and change and, match to match, there were certain nuances that added difference, the three at the back was a fixture.",
      "In December, though, it was as if a switch had been flicked. As United managed a half-decent run of games, according to Amorim, it felt like the perfect opportunity to finally adapt.",
      "Somewhat forced to relent by Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo departing for the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim rejected any notion that outside pressure was to blame for his newfound tactical flexibility.",
      "On Boxing Day, in the win against Newcastle, Amorim started with four at the back for the first time since his appointment.",
      "\"When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process,\" said Amorim ahead of Tuesday's draw with Wolves",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players, so we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.\"",
      "But against Wolves, it was back to basics for the Portuguese. A tactical reversion called a \"backwards\" step by Gary Neville as Amorim returned to a back three. But why did he change back, are Man Utd ready to move beyond the back three and what changes has Amorim made to his approach throughout this season?",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Manchester United's Premier League curtain raiser was the first opportunity fans had to see some of the new signings in action. Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha started with Mason Mount also named too.",
      "Cunha played centrally, with Mount in the left attacking midfield role and Mbeumo to his right. United finished the game with more possession and twice Arsenal's number of shots.",
      "An early set-piece and Altay Bayindir mistake was the cause of United's defeat but there were immediate signs of a change in attacking approach. United's wing-backs and a willing runner in Mbeumo were impressive as Amorim's side used every occasion they could to send the ball over the top and stretch Arsenal's defence.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.",
      "\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.",
      "\"Then the small things that we talk about in the beginning of this season when players like Cunha and Bryan can elevate the stadium in one moment. The most important thing - we weren't boring.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: After an underwhelming spell of games following the promise of the Arsenal performance, which included a harrowing loss at Brentford, an under-pressure Amorim travelled to the champions in the hope of securing back-to-back wins for the first time in his Premier League tenure.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was on the bench, despite starting the previous two and United returned to a forward line consisting of Cuhha, Mbeumo and Mount. United took the lead after just two minutes through Mbeumo. His run was rewarded as United caught Liverpool cold with an Amad pass in behind.",
      "United won through an emphatic Harry Maguire winner. But with less possession, United showed a rare staunch defence that managed to keep Liverpool out despite their mounting pressure. The win ensured a first victory for Man Utd at Anfield for almost a decade.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"Every time you play in this environment, if you [low] block well, especially in the beginning, you can feel the fans turning.",
      "\"We feel that in our stadium. All the big teams suffer from that. We tried to do that. I think we have to have more possession to help our players. They struggled in the end. But a good win, let's focus on the next one.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Amorim's first real stark deviation from his three at the back led to one of the more chaotic and entertaining Premier League clashes in recent history.",
      "The personnel said 3-4-2-1 but the positioning disagreed. Leny Yoro's role as a \"secret right-back\" as Gary Neville dubbed it saw him wider and higher than usual. In a 4-2-4 at times, United were able to flow forward freely.",
      "In the first half, United produced the second-highest non-penalty xG of 2.49, most shots (17), and joint-most touches in the opposition's box, with 30, of any side in the Premier League up to that point.",
      "United's attack came to the detriment of United's defensive performance, but it was a showing that gained real plaudits. Amorim showed a flexibility he had not in the past and it appeared to get the most out of his playing squad on the night.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"A fun game. I think we started really well. We did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"A lot of good things, but a lot of things to work on. We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five. It's the details that we need to work on, understand the momentum of the game. You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Full of confidence following on from the Bournemouth game, Amorim's tactical tweaks saw United impress again at Aston Villa. This fixture was the first without Amad and Mbeumo who had joined up with their respective nations for the AFCON.",
      "It was back to Amorim's tried and tested formation; however, United were full of energy, on the front foot and pressing high in another different take of Amorim's approach.",
      "Wing-backs Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot found great joy high and wide with Bruno Fernandes playing higher than usual too, in between Mount and Cunha, who had started in the 10s, behind Sesko.",
      "Fernandes' injury played a part, with Lisandro Martínez replacing him in midfield. That meant Manuel Ugarte stepped into the creative role.",
      "It was also one of United's more defensively secure performances of the six selected. United faced the second fewest shots on target among the selected games, winning possession the most and making the most recoveries. Unfortunately for Amorim, Morgan Rogers' sublime double, either side of Cunha's equaliser, was enough to beat United.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"I think we were the better team today. We were unlucky, even with the injury of Bruno, but during the game even without him, we were the better team. We did a very good job but no one is going to remember tomorrow because what matters is the result.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: A pragmatic Amorim had more tricks up his sleeve as United returned home to face Newcastle. So much so, Eddie Howe seemed to rely on goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale going down in order to gather some tactical thoughts.",
      "Dorgu playing on the right wing was a curious move from Amorim but given the fact he stroked home the winner, any questioning was made obsolete. In the first half, United impressed with Cunha and Dorgu causing Newcastle huge problems.",
      "But the second half was cause for concern. United held on but Newcastle finished the game matching United's 1.2 xG and having 16 shots at Old Trafford to the hosts' nine.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"In the first half, I think we showed that I felt that was the only way to create more danger - to have more opportunities was with the back four with a lot of guys inside.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: As United fell back into a three at the back, so did their predictability. After finding joy with a back four, United's lack of inspiration with a back three was telling.",
      "Amorim made just one change with Joshua Zirkzee replacing the injured Mount but United looked well off the pace. Zirkzee off the right managed to score but that would be his only highlight before he was hooked at half-time.",
      "Zirkzee was replaced by Jack Fletcher and the formation looked closer to United's 4-2-3-1 from the Newcastle win but still Amorim's side struggled to find openings. Wolves, who remain winless in the league, saw their xG trump United's at 1 compared to 0.8 for the home side.",
      "United perhaps did not get the points to show for their performances against Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle, taking just four points, but they competed. Against Wolves, it was a far cry from that, raising the question as to whether United are even ready to evolve from Amorim's approach.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"We struggled for the whole game. We had a lack of creativity but we knew that it would be a different game compared to Newcastle.",
      "\"We had a different energy during the game also. If you look at the game, we had our chances, but the fluidity wasn't there because there is a lack of connections.",
      "\"The players tried. We didn't play well and when you don't play well with the ball you struggle even without the ball. We need to recover and to go to the next one.",
      "\"We were running around trying to recover the ball. They overload with a lot of midfielders and we were struggling with that and sometimes you can attack better with less strikers. We played with three strikers, Cunha, Josh and Sesko, and sometimes it is not the best thing to attack well.\"",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across Saturday's games and is tipping BOTH Wolves and Burnley to win...",
      "Burnley's 10-game winless run jumps off the page and most will declare this a home banker at 1/2 with Sky Bet - but dig a little deeper and there are signs of life. Scott Parker has been proactive rather than stubborn, tweaking personnel and roles to try and spark something.",
      "He's found an exciting dynamic in his attack in the Marcus Edwards-Armando Broja pairing, who looked genuinely dangerous against Newcastle. Edwards' ability to receive between the lines and commit defenders gave Burnley a threat they've lacked for weeks, while Broja's power and direct can stretch a backline.",
      "Brighton look vulnerable again priced up as the odds-on favourites. They're six without a win themselves and games at the Amex have recently lacked the control and fluency that once made them so reliable. If Burnley play with the same attacking edge they showed last time out, this could quickly turn into an uncomfortable afternoon for the hosts.",
      "This has all the hallmarks of where a extraordinary run finally snaps.",
      "Wolves reaching the 20th game of the season without a win is the kind of unique run that rarely drags on forever. Football has a habit of correcting these extremes, especially when performances are starting to hint at a shift beneath the surface. And Wolves' recent displays suggest this isn't a team completely lost.",
      "The performances against Liverpool and Manchester United were quietly encouraging. Wolves competed, pressed with purpose and crucially, showed a level of bravery in possession that has been missing at times this season.",
      "West Ham are criminally soft when coming under pressure in games and Wolves may just need one moment to take advantage in what is likely to be an ugly affair. The home side to win by one goal looks a bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "It's currently impossible to build a credible case for Bournemouth against anyone in the Premier League, let alone the league leaders. Their defensive numbers have nosedived to worrying levels and the eye test matches the data. They look open, fragile and far too easy to play through. Conceding 2.25 goals per 90 across their last 12 matches is alarming on its own, but the expected goals against figure of 1.9 per 90 suggests this isn't bad luck, it's an underlying issue that has shown no signs of being fixed.",
      "Arsenal don't need many invitations to punish mistakes and Bournemouth are currently handing them out far too frequently.",

      "\"They weren't just booed off at full-time. The fans waited in the stadium to continue to boo them.\"",

      "Neville was surprised Amorim had not stuck with the back four that earned a big win over Newcastle at Old Trafford on Boxing Day, given his only change was Zirkzee for the injured Mason Mount.",
