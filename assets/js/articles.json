      "Those comments nod to the competitive spirit United have acquired, something that appears to have been missing at Old Trafford for some time. The Red Devils have fighting personalities in captain Bruno Fernandes, Lisandro Martinez, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte, but the venom that was once so synonymous with the club as a whole has long been missing.",
      "Mbeumo enjoyed a career-best return of 20 goals at the Gtech Community Stadium last season, level with Wissa as Brentford's top scorer. But it seems there's substance to back up his talent, too.",
      "Wissa added: \"It was all about finding the right balance between good competition but also fighting with each other. We are also fighting with each other, but that doesn’t mean you have to hate each other!\"",
      "That comment in particular hints at Mbeumo's drive to not only get the best out of himself but those around him as well. And the ability to deliver that message without grating on one's team-mates can be a rare quality.",
      "Mbeumo also opened up about the kind of behaviour he feels tends to optimise his play. And it's apparent Amorim and his squad may need to give their new signing the arm-round-the-shoulder treatment, rather than tough love, should he not hit the ground running straight away at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I’m someone who needs support and love to give my best performances,\" said the Cameroonian. \"I’m really lucky to have someone like Wissa, who always wants the best for me.",
      "\"I always want to give 100%, but there are some times when I’m feeling down, so having someone like him who will help and push you in the right direction is brilliant to have.\""

      "Manchester United have almost halved their demands for Alejandro Garnacho - and will now accepted £40million for the Argentine as he looks to leave the club this summer.",
      "The youngster was once seen as one of the club's future stars but his performances have dipped whilst he's also struggled to find a role that brings the best out of him in Ruben Amorim's system, which has complicated matters.",
      "Chelsea were previously linked with Garnacho, who scored 11 times last term, whilst Napoli too have been interested in the past. So far no bidders have been forthcoming but a massive drop in the Manchester club's demands may now see that change.",
      "Garnacho angered major figures at Old Trafford once the season finished as he wore an Aston Villa shirt with Rashford's name on the back whilst on holiday with the image going viral on social media. That also came after his reaction to his Europa League snub did not impressed his manager.",
      "The Argentine was named on the bench for the clash in Bilbao, which United lost. Garnacho arrived late to wam up on the pitch and was seen chatting with Tottenham defender Sergio Reguilon. Hours before kick off he also share pictures of him scoring against local rivals Manchester City during the FA Cup final win on social media, with many drawing their own conclusions.",
      "After the match the player said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Garnacho isn't the only player United will be prepared to lose millions on. Marcus Rashford is heading to Barcelona on loan with the Spanish club having the option to buy next summer. They can do so for £26m, despite the Red Devils telling Aston Villa just months ago the price was £40m.",
      "Jadon Sancho was signed back in 2021 from Borussia Dortmund for just over £70m. He's since had two loan spells away and the Red Devils will let him leave permanently for £15m. Antony joined United for £86m in 2022, but his value has also plummeted, with interested clubs now being quoted around £30m to sign him."

      "Martinez cut an emotional figure on his final home game last season, which saw many draw conclusions that he was set for pastures new. The ex- Arsenal goalkeeper has rejected the chance to move to Saudi Arabia this summer with Villa valuing him at £40million.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that over the weekend discussions were held and the Manchester outfit put the idea of landing Martinez on loan to the Midlands outfit, who quickly made it clear that would not be happening.",
      "The Villa goalkeeper's last outing ironically saw him sent-off at Old Trafford on the final day of the season. United were able to secure a 2-0 victory which meant that Unai Emery's side missed out on the Champions League, instead settling for the Europa League.",
      "After that defeat Emery was quizzed on Martinez's future potential exit and said: “I don’t know. He has a contract with us. We are very happy and we will see how the summer goes.” Pressed on if there have been discussions over Martinez leaving, Emery added: “I don’t know. You can ask him.”",
      "Doubts remain over Andre Onana, who is heading into his third season in Manchester, but he will miss pre-season with a hamstring injury and is in a race against time to be fit for the Premier League opener due to a torn hamstring. Amorim's side begin their season at home to Arsenal on August 17.",
      "The Red Devils have been linked with Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens. The Belgian club have slapped a £17m price tag on the Belgian star amid interest from the Premier League giants. On Monday they finally announced the signing of Bryan Mbeumo after weeks on negotiating with Brentford.",
      "He becomes the club's second summer signing, joining Matheus Cunha who headed to Manchester from Wolves. Mbeumo has cost United £71m, once add-ons are included, which makes him the most expensive player to ever leave the Bees as they maximised their profits."

The two new strikers both made an impression during Chelsea's triumphant Club World Cup campaign and Jackson is now considering his options.",

      "United have signed Matheus Cunha, in a £62.5m move from Wolves, and Bryan Mbeumo, in a £71m deal from Brentford, but still need a central striker. They have opened a dialogue with Jackson's agent, Ali Barat, and Chelsea would be open to selling for the right price.",
      "The Sun reports that Jackson has vetoed the idea of joining Napoli or AC Milan in the summer transfer window. The Senegal international has no desire to leave the Premier League for Serie A, but there is another potential issue with a move to United.",
      "While willing to sell in theory, Chelsea reportedly value Jackson at around £80m - a price United would struggle to stomach. Although they are close to agreeing exits for Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, the club still have Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia in their so-called 'bomb squad'.",

      "The Chelsea manager has grown frustrated with his ill discipline, having seen him sent off twice in his last five matches. Jackson was left on the substitutes' bench for Chelsea's 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final and knows he is far from a guaranteed starter now.",

Former Brentford boss Thomas Frank, now at Tottenham, knew the price his old club wanted for Mbeumo, so Spurs were prepared to pay more than United, but the player insisted he would only go to Old Trafford.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson still commands the respect of his former Manchester United players – even when he is interrupting.",
      "Ferguson left United in 2013 after 26 years at the helm of the club and his influence on the club is still huge. The 83-year-old coached hundreds of players during his time in charge at Old Trafford and to many his work was life-changing.",
      "Many of his former players are now trying to make their way as managers – and one of them was on Rio Ferdinand’s podcast recently. Michael Carrick joined his former United team-mate on Rio Ferdinand Presents for a detailed chat about their era at the club, the current crop and Carrick’s own insights as a coach.",
      "Carrick spoke about Kobbie Mainoo, Scott McTominay and Bruno Fernandes, the genius of Paul Scholes and much more, before Ferguson derailed their chat. Recording in an empty restaurant, Ferguson gate-crashed the recording and was not happy to see the cameras and microphones.",
      "Walking into the shot, Ferguson said abruptly: “What’s this? I’m not doing this podcast!” Ferdinand responded: “Alright boss? No, no, no. We’re going to talk after. You go and get a coffee, boss.”",
      "Carrick added: “No, we’re just finishing now.” Ferguson replied: “Oh, you’re just finishing?” Carrick: “Yeah, don’t worry, this is not for you.”",
      "Ferdinand: “We’re going to get a bit of food with you after. You’ve not dressed for the camera, boss, have you? You’ve not dressed up for the cameras.” Carrick: “Have a quick coffee, boss, and we’ll be with you in a sec. Did you think this was for you?”",
      "Ferguson: “I’ll go sit over here. I just want to listen to the nonsense that you talk!”",
      "After taking a seat just behind Ferdinand off-camera, Ferguson still managed to interrupt. Five minutes later, his phone rang very loudly, interrupting their conversation. But Ferdinand was clear: “It’s fine, it’s the gaffer, we’ve just got to get on with it!”",
      "That deference that Ferdinand and Carrick show Ferguson should come as no surprise, given the respect they have for their former manager. Ferguson won 38 trophies during his tenure at United, from 1986 to 2013, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups and two Champions League titles.",
      "He led his players with an authoritarian style, which some responded well to, and his workaholic nature inspired many. “He was an animal. When you look back at his age, how long he'd been at the club - his appetite for the game, his appetite for rebuilding a team, it was crazy,” Ferdinand once reflected.",
      "“Even in the last year of his time at Man United, he's coming in earlier than everyone else. Nine times out of 10, you walk out to the car and he's still there.”",

Barca will cover Rashford's wages for the loan period, with the 27-year-old - who earns £325,000-a-week at United – having accepted a 15 percent pay cut to move to the Nou Camp.",

      "Garnacho's highest market value was £70m a year ago, but his stock has fallen so low that United are willing to accept a fee of around £40m for the 20-year-old winger. It is a similar story with Sancho, signed from Borussia Dortmund for £73m in 2021, but who United are now happy to let go for £15m, just to be rid of him, although with only a year left on his contract, a loan move next season is most likely.",
      "Winger Antony joined United for £86m in 2022, but his value has also plummeted, with interested clubs now being quoted around £30m to sign him, while a fee of around £5m will be accepted for Malacia, valued at £20m a couple of years ago.",
      "In the past, United have taken on tour players who they intended to sell, most recently Sancho, who travelled to the US last summer and played, despite going on loan to Chelsea when the squad returned to the UK. Romelu Lukaku went on the 2019 tour of the Far East and Australia but did not play a minute for United, ahead of his move to Inter Milan later that summer.",
      "But the willingness of the United hierarchy to back Amorim's ruthless decision to order his exiled stars to stay behind and train, while the rest of the squad embark on a lucrative three-game tour of the States, underlines the strength of backing for the Portuguese head coach, despite last season's disastrous 15th-placed finish in the Premier League.",

      "Despite contributing to United's league triumph in his debut season, his time at the club was marred by troubles and he was replaced by Fabien Barthez. Scholes previously pinpointed Bosnich's transfer as the club's worst.",
      "Bosnich has now retaliated, insinuating that his old colleague owed much of his achievements to playing alongside Roy Keane. The 53-year-old also queried why Scholes didn't make more of an impact with England on the international stage.",
      "Speaking to former United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster on the Fozcast podcast, Bosnich said: \"Scholesy was an exceptional player but he was very fortunate, in my opinion, to play with someone like Roy Keane. Roy Keane was much underrated as a player.",
      "\"He had that hard man image, but he's a much better player than people give him credit for. I think when he [Scholes] got the right partner in midfield, he was far better. I thought he should have done a little bit more for England, really.\"",
      "Scholes didn't hold back when discussing Bosnich's poor professionalism on The Overlap podcast last September. He recalled the keeper's troubled second stint at United after first joining the club at the age of 17.",
      "Bosnich's return to the club was overshadowed by an incident involving a photographer during his stag do, which resulted in his arrest.",
      "\"I go back to the goalkeepers, when you had to try and replace Peter Schmeichel, which is always going to be difficult,\" Scholes said. \"We had a few. I was thinking [Massimo] Taibi, Mark Bosnich.",
      "\"I thought he was a good keeper at Villa, Mark Bosnich. He came to us, and he was so unprofessional. Honestly, it was ridiculous. In shooting practice, you normally have like 15, 20 shots. After three shots, he's knackered, 'Oh no, get someone else in'.",
      "\"I never realised he couldn't kick a football. I've never seen anything like it. We played Everton away, first game of the season, and none of us picked up on it. He couldn't reach the halfway line.",
      "\"There was no wind, it was a perfect day. But when you look at his feet, size 14s, honestly, he was just kicking the floor all the time. Disappointing.\"",
      "After leaving United, Bosnich became second choice at Chelsea behind Carlo Cudicini but faced a ban from football in September 2002 after a positive test for cocaine. It took him six years to return to the sport, eventually playing for Central Coast Mariners in Australia before turning to punditry.",
      "Bosnich lavished praise on United icon Ryan Giggs, naming him as his greatest ever teammate during his chat with Foster. He not only commended Giggs for his extraordinary abilities on the pitch but also highlighted his generosity off it.",
      "\"When I first met him, I was 16 or 17, and we played a game at the Cliff [training ground],\" Bosnich said. \"I remember Fergie walking up to me, and he said, 'Come and have a look at this kid at number 11.'",
      "\"It was like somebody watching Jack Nicklaus play golf for the first time or Tiger Woods and you think 'Wow'. His father was an exceptional rugby league player for St Helens so he had that wonderful balance and running. As soon as he turned up at 15 or 16, everyone's going, 'Play him, play him'.",

Carrick was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's coaching team when the Portuguese superstar rejoined the Red Devils.",
      "He has now acknowledged that the signing lifted the entire club, yet confessed he handled the global icon, who left in acrimonious circumstances in November 2022, \"differently\" compared to other players under his guidance.",
      "Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Carrick described the surreal experience of witnessing the legendary Ronaldo back at United's Carrington training ground, more than a decade after his departure to Real Madrid in 2009.",
      "\"Yeah, he was good,\" Carrick said when Ferdinand quizzed him about Ronaldo's comeback. \"I mean, there was a hell of a buzz around the place when he came back. It was an incredible kind of feeling around those games, and then him coming back. And just seeing him back around the building was weird.\"",
      "The former midfielder explained how coaching Ronaldo presented a completely different challenge, saying: \"So there's definitely then for me, from a coaching point of view, I was really conscious of then treating him very different to when I would treat some of the younger players or the ones that are really intense, trying to help a lot and trying to develop them.",
      "\"He's at the end where he is what he is, you know, and you respect what he is. And we give a few kinds of pointers for the team. You're not going to coach him.",
      "\"There's no way I'm coaching him about his runs or where to finish. But it's a totally different element of coaching to say what I was coaching with some of the other boys, where you're trying to really give them some help and advice and improve them a lot. It's just incredible what he's done.\"",
      "Initially joining United in 2003, Ronaldo went on to cement his status as one of the game's most exceptional talents at Old Trafford.",
      "He netted more than a century of goals for the Red Devils and contributed to United securing three Premier League crowns plus the Champions League, with Carrick revealing his astonishment at Ronaldo's progression during their time as teammates.",
      "\"I mean, for me, that first year when I signed, he didn't score as many goals, but it was 2006, 2007, and he played right wing. He was unbelievable. Unbelievable. And then he got a taste of scoring goals after that. And then he changed a bit.",
      "\"He scored 40-odd goals the next year. But honestly, that first season after he came back from the World Cup with him in Wazza [Wayne Rooney] when he was on that right wing as an all-round player, I've never seen... I don't think I've seen that before.\"",
      "Ronaldo's return spell, despite delivering some spectacular moments, proved disappointing for both player and club. He left United in November 2022 following his explosive interview with Piers Morgan, during which he criticised the club's condition and his handling under former United manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Yet Carrick has praised the now 40-year-old Al-Nassr star for the boost he brought and his committed attitude to fitness and preparation.",
      "\"I think it was a genuine buzz,\" Carrick said. \"But when he came back, I think everyone was buzzing to see what he was going to bring. And he had to manage himself a little bit more. He was smarter then in terms of his body and training-wise and how much he needed to push himself.",
      "\"He still scored goals. And I'm sure the boys learnt off him by just something to the times like we learnt at the time of other players. You learn by watching a lot of the time. And they don't always have to tell you things. It's more of the experience of being around him.\"",
      "Finally, when questioned if Ronaldo's apparent reluctance to track back and assist with defensive duties was ever a problem, Carrick sought to set the record straight.",
      "\"No, listen, there's obviously parts of it where it's not always an individual thing,\" he added. \"You're trying to put the team together and you've got things that you're trying to work on. But he scored goals. He was always going to score. He always has. He's continuing to do it. You know, it's what he does.\"",

      "Gyokeres, though, is Arsenal-bound unless something drastic occurs in the coming days. The Gunners and Sporting have yet to agree on the final details of a financial package for the striker, who plundered a remarkable 54 goals last season.",
      "The player may have his heart set on a move to Arsenal but Frederico Varandas, Sporting's president, continues to insist he will not leave on the cheap. “If they don't want to pay Viktor's fair market value, we're very comfortable with that for the next three years,” he said recently.",
      "\"This strategy is also making it more complicated for the player to leave. Nobody is above the interests of the club. Whoever they are. We're calm. Everything will be resolved with the market closing, a hefty fine and an apology to the group.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Emile Heskey has warned Emi Martinez that he would be joining a \"club in crisis\" should he get his wish and land a dream summer transfer to Manchester United - even if he understands the lure of such a move.",
      "Martinez, 32, has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford in recent weeks following speculation that he may be leaving Aston Villa this summer. And recent reports have indicated that the Argentina international would love to make such a move, though Villa are in a position of strength given he signed a new five-year contract last year.",
      "United endured their worst ever Premier League campaign last season and, unlike Villa, would be unable to offer Martinez European football if he joined.",
      "But while Heskey stresses that the Red Devils are in a precarious position currently, he did acknowledge that the challenge of turning things around at a club of United's stature would undoubtedly appeal.",
      "He told BestBettingSites.co.uk.: “I can see why people would say it’s a step down, but it’s interesting. You’ve got to remember that Manchester United are a huge club even now, and they’ll be massive when they finally get it right again.",
      "“They’ll be in another universe when that happens. So for Emi, I don’t think it’s a step down if he gets that move to Manchester United, but he can’t kid himself. He’d be going to a club in crisis at the moment. Does he want that?”",
      "Heskey went on to point out that few players, bar Bruno Fernandes, have handled the pressure of representing United during such a turbulent period in their history.",
      "He added: “The pressure on the players to perform now is too much for nine out of 10 players. Only Bruno Fernandes has relished it and embraced it, while others have fallen away.”",
      "While it remains to be seen if United will move for Martinez before the transfer window shuts on 1 September, there is uncertainty over Andre Onana's position following another unconvincing season between the posts.",
      "United have been linked with other goalkeepers, too, including Senne Lammens from Antwerp, who is said to be a long-term target for the Red Devils.",
      "The 23-year-old Belgian was first linked with United back in January and interest in the youngster has seemingly been resurrected, though it remains to be seen if the club will prioritise the signing of a new goalkeeper considering they have limited funds to play with this summer.",

      "They are unable to register new players until space is made in the budget for their wages and that has not yet happened for Garcia. As a result, Rashford will be in the same boat once his move is completed.",
      "The forward had been linked with a number of other clubs across Europe, but made it clear that he wanted to join Barcelona. When asked if he would like to play alongside Barcelona star Lamine Yamal, Rashford told Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz: \"Yeah, sure.",
      "\"Everybody in the world wants to play with the best. So hopefully, we'll see. (Yamal) is gonna be… it's difficult to put into words what he's doing because he's not supposed to be doing it at 16, 17. He's playing at the highest level, I don't think we've seen it.",
      "\"To have his mentality is a skill. He's not normal to be doing what he does and he will keep improving. Spain is nice, it's not too far from home. If I'm training over a long period, my family can come for a few days, it's a nice location and good weather.\"",
      "And Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has previously described Rashford as \"fantastic player\". When asked about a potential move for Rashford or Liverpool star Luis Diaz back in May, Flick said: \"This is what we have talked about with the club.",

      "United sources believe the Mbeumo deal underscores their pull in the market, despite the club reeling from their worst season in 51 years. Matheus Cunha, their first addition of the summer, also generated internet from Arsenal in January.",

Manchester United have found a club prepared to cover Rashford’s £325,000-a-week salary. It was always going to be a loan with an option to buy.",
      "Barca have admired Rashford for several years yet are signing him at one of his lowest ebbs. Villa declined the chance to buy him for £40million, Rashford had his squad number revoked and was ordered to report at United’s Carrington training complex after the first team had left this month.",

      "United have done extremely well to get Rashford off the books before August. Liverpool merit a mention. They resisted selling Luis Diaz to Barca after their prime target, Inaki Williams, signed a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Rashford is Barca’s plan C and, on paper, a substitute for La Liga's champions. He has broken double figures in only one of the past four seasons for United.",
      "High-ranking figures at United expected him to move abroad. Rashford mischievously refused to discount crossing the divide to Manchester City or heading down the East Lancs Road to Liverpool. There was no concrete evidence either of United’s rivals were interested in him.",
      "It is in United’s interests that Rashford performs in Spain. It would make him more sellable next year, when he will have entered the final two years of his United contract. While Ruben Amorim is in situ, there is no chance of United reintegrating Rashford back into their first team squad.",
      "Rashford has put in the hours over the summer. His Instagram account, almost certainly run by his brother and former agent, Dwaine, has charted a rigorous training schedule of gym-work and ball-work. Rashford spent four hours in a Salford gym last Monday.",
      "Hangers-on weighed Rashford down in recent years but his entourage on holiday in Cannes were on the grass with him. He was joined by brothers Dwaine, Dane, cousin Lois and former United academy teammate Roshaun Williams.",

He was at his zenith that season, with the caveat that Rashford's form came with his camp in the midst of contract negotiations.",
      "Have a glance at Rashford's goals tallies over the past four seasons: five, 30, eight and seven. You can pinpoint the one that preceded a lucrative salary hike.",
      "Despite that 30-goal season, privately he bristled at some of Erik ten Hag's methods and how dogmatic the Dutchman could be. Their working relationship disintegrated during Ten Hag's final year at United.",
      "Rashford was irritated to start the 2023-24 season up front while Rasmus Hojlund recovered from a stress fracture of the back. At Villa, Unai Emery regularly played Rashford through the middle. Lewandowski, 37, is not showing many signs of slowing down but he is out of contract at Barcelona next year.",
      "After Amorim discounted Rashford from selection, the player exercised some moderate PR, attending a game in his hospitality box at Old Trafford. There was polite applause from the Stretford End on his final squad appearance when he warmed up against Newcastle in December.",

      "One down, three to go for United. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Garnacho will, by hook or by crook, be gone by 7pm on September 1. United will then have a leaner, fresher and more harmonious forward line. One that has to be sharpened by a new striker.",

Of course, I was also spoken to about it a lot and when I made a save in training, it was United this, United that. Funny, I would do it the other way around too. But you can't dwell on it for too long. They are still just rumours.",
      "\"Those top clubs have so many scouts and follow so many players. So it doesn't have to mean anything yet. It will only become clear in the summer whether anything comes of it. But of course it's only positive. Especially because it's the best competition in the world and my profile – my stature and way of playing – is similar to English football.",

      "The former Man United star believes his old club is losing a 'great' player by allowing Rashford to join Barcelona.",
      "Speaking to YouTuberIShowSpeed, Pogba said: \"That's crazy, but I'm happy or him because they took his number. Manchester United are losing a great player, unlucky for them.",
      "\"It's great for Barcelona to be honest. I'm not even talking about United, because they've bought a few new players and the new manager wants to do his thing I guess. It's not really his fault, if he doesn't believe in someone. He needs to win. If he doesn't win they're going to sack him.\"",
      "Manchester United have no intention of making an offer for Gyokeres, MEN Sport understands.",
      "Ruben Amorim worked with Gyokeres during his time at Sporting but United have not made an offer to sign the Sweden international and do not intend to submit a bid.",

      "According to Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg, Jackson remains a candidate to reinfoce Man United's attack this summer.",
      "Plettenberg said: \"Benjamin Sesko is a player who says, 'Okay, if there is not the right offer this summer, I can also imagine staying at RB Leipzig.' But there are also now many, many movements in the background, and there are also talks with interested clubs to our clear understanding that Manchester United is targeting him.",
      "\"He's one of two or three candidates as a new number nine striker for United. Then the other one is Nicolas Jackson. I cannot close the door for a possible Chelsea interest. Let's see what will happen in the next two or three weeks with Benjamin Sesko ahead.\"",
      "Man United have tried to hijack a move for Viktor Gyokeres from Arsenal as the transfer saga continues.",
      "The Gunners have been in talks with the Portuguese side for some time and were optimistic about finalising a deal before their pre-season tour to Singapore. However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has remained firm on his valuation of the Swedish player.",

      "That said, MEN Sport brings you the latest updates on Gyokeres from Portugal.",
      "Galatasaray have reportedly reached an agreement with Napoli to sign Man United-linked Victor Osimhen on a permanent deal.",
      "While United are believed to be interested in signing a striker this summer, the deal taking Osimhen to Galatasaray removes one of the options they had available. United have seen their options further limited with the news that Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres looks almost certain to join top-flight rivals Arsenal.",
      "It is said that a €75million (around £70m) transfer fee will be paid in two instalments, including a down payment. The report claims that the two clubs have agreed to a €40m (£35m) upfront payment and €35m (£30m) in instalments to be paid until July 2026.",
      "The issues are at the back and up front. United have prioritised their attack over the goalkeeper and the timing of Andre Onana's injury could work in his favour ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "The more pressing matter is the striker. With Joshua Zirkzee back in Manchester nursing a minor injury, Rasmus Hojlund did not even start against Leeds United. Amorim picked a rotational XI that was demonstrably not the strongest available to him, with two auxiliary centre backs in the back three and rookie Diego Leon in from the start.",
      "After Mbeumo, it's understood that a goalkeeper and striker will be prioritised by Man United.",
      "And according to Fabrizio Romano, the Reds have made initial contact with Royal Antwerp to request information about their conditions for a potential deal to sign Senne Lammens.",
      "Sunday was a strange one with Viktor Gyokeres. Reports in Portugal claimed that United had made an approach for the striker which was higher than the fee Arsenal are said to be willing to pay.",
      "However, that was then swiftly played down by the likes of Fabrizio Romano and Ben Jacobs. He is still expected to join Arsenal.",
      "It's gone quiet on Antony's exit this summer in recent weeks but interest from Atletico Madrid could spark a move.",

      "United have reached an agreement on personal terms with Valencia midfielder Javi Guerra, according to reports.",

      "Another 'talks' rumour here but one that Man United supporters should get excited about.",

      "Manchester United are not expected to make a bid for Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson, it has been claimed. The 24-year-old has emerged as a potential transfer target for United, as Ruben Amorim tries to strengthen his attack.",
      "Reports claimed on Sunday that United have held talks with Jackson's representative Ali Barat over a potential blockbuster move to Old Trafford. The Senegal international scored 13 times and grabbed six assists in 37 appearances for the Blues during the 2024/25 season.",
      "However, he appeared to drop down the pecking order at the Club World Cup following his red card against Flamengo and the double arrival of Liam Delap and Joao Pedro. Indeed, after returning from suspension, Jackson played just 30 minutes in Chelsea's four knockout fixtures.",
      "Speculation has since increased around Jackson's future at Stamford Bridge, with United reportedly expressing an interest and holding talks with his agent. But the Reds are not anticipated to make an offer for the ex-Villarreal man, according to journalist Ben Jacobs.",
      "It's added that a lot would have to change for that to alter in the coming weeks. A deal is not considered impossible due to United's respect for Jackson, who has come up in an internal meeting with the club's board, but a possible move has been 'downplayed', as it stands.",
      "United are expected to ramp up their chase for a centre forward after getting a deal across the line for Bryan Mbeumo on Monday night. Amorim's side have paid £65million plus £6m in add-ons to secure the services of the Cameroon international, who has signed a five-year contract at the Reds.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, has become United's third summer arrival after Matheus Cunha made the £62.5m move from Wolves at the start of last month and Diego Leon signed from Cerro Porteno for £3.3m plus add-ons.",
      "Elsewhere, United want to offload several players. Marcus Rashford is closing in on a loan switch to Barcelona, while Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho and Antony are among the others United hope to shift."

      "Those words came from Marcus Rashford last month when a Spanish influencer asked whether he would like to play with supremely talented Barcelona teenager Lamine Yamal.",
      "Rashford has been fluttering his eyelashes at Barcelona, and he will realise his goal of playing for the Catalan club. Manchester United have agreed to send Rashford on loan for the 2025/2026 season and Barcelona will cover his entire wage packet throughout his stay at Camp Nou.",
      "The 27-year-old was one of five players who were told to delay their returns to Carrington after each expressed a desire to leave. United have arranged Rashford's exit with favourable terms and now must address the futures of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia to offset incomings.",
      "United have not sold Rashford on a permanent deal, but removing one of the highest earners from the books is a boost, and Barcelona are expected to trigger their option to sign him at the end of the season.",
      "It feels inevitable Rashford will show enough for Barcelona to activate their option to sign him. He may well impress and pundits will then doubtless suggest United made a mistake by allowing him to leave.",
      "The script with Rashford over the next 12 months at Barcelona is predictable, but it will be a surprise if he can sustain strong performances across successive seasons in Spain.",
      "United's attention now turns to the four other players on the naughty step. Garnacho retains the highest value and arranging his sale will unlock much-needed funds for Ruben Amorim.",
      "An initial £127.5million has been splashed on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, so selling Garnacho is now at the top of the transfer agenda.",
      "Chelsea and Napoli were interested during the January transfer window. The winger's agent attended a game at Stamford Bridge and told the world he was there by posting on social media.",
      "The suggestion is that Garnacho would prefer to remain in the Premier League, but United will try to offload him to the highest bidder because. They should be trying to get £50million-plus for a player who has proven himself in the Premier League and still has considerable upside. The only problem is potential suitors know Amorim wants rid.",
      "Antony deserves credit for creating a market for himself. The Brazilian was utterly hopeless in Manchester but looked a completely new player during his loan with Real Betis last season.",
      "If you pretend his £86m transfer to United never happened, Antony would look like a decent prospect and a permanent move to a European club is on the cards for him this summer.",
      "United must sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR loss. The club will also look to negotiate a permanent deal for Jadon Sancho and the Italian press claim Juventus are advancing.",
      "Juventus will be asked to cough up a fee for Sancho, although United will get peanuts from the last player of the out-of-favour-five, Tyrell Malacia, who looked unconvincing during his PSV loan last term.",
      "The nightmare scenario was that all five players would still be at Old Trafford near the end of the window, but United have shifted Rashford and it's hoped the floodgates will now open for the other exits."

      "The 27-year-old built a healthy and fruitful relationship with now-United boss Amorim, scoring 66 times in 68 appearances under his watch at Sporting CP, but Old Trafford chiefs have no intention to send an offer to Portugal as the forward is closing in on a move to Arsenal whilst the focus in the North West switches to offloading certain players.",
      "Meanwhile, Portuguese publication Record have published information regarding the feelings of the striker's agent towards the 20-time English champions.",
      "They claim even with United's stance towards Gyokeres, agent Hasan Cetinkaya feels 'hurt' at the current situation.",
      "The Turkish businessman's name may be familiar as he is also the representative of fellow Sweden international Victor Lindelof. The 31-year-old was not offered a new United contract this summer after eight years of service, therefore has left as a free agent.",
      "Lindelof had made 18 appearances for Amorim since the new manager took over last November with it claimed he wished to stay.",
      "Cetinkaya is therefore described as upset over the way in which his client was let go and further so over Amorim's alleged actions given that he pushed for Gyokeres to join Amorim's Sporting two summers ago.",

The Reds fly out to the US on Tuesday and will spend the best part of a fortnight on the other side of the Atlantic.",
      "Their pre-season tour will feature friendlies against Premier League counterparts West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. Each game will represent an opportunity for head coach Ruben Amorim to experiment.",

      "United face Arsenal in their Premier League at Old Trafford on August 17 and will be determined to hit the ground running after last season's struggles.",
      "Although there is still just under a month to go until their Premier League curtain-raiser, some places in Amorim's starting XI are already nailed down. The likes of Leny Yoro, Patrick Dorgu, Bruno Fernandes, Mathes Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo will all believe they are guaranteed starters.",
      "Occupants of other positions within the XI remain to be decided, with United's four remaining friendlies set to dictate Amorim's thinking.",
      "The Portuguese chief's decision to start Fernandes in the middle of midfield for the draw with Leeds felt particularly telling. Following the addition of Cunha, the feeling throughout the summer has been that Fernandes will start the new campaign in midfield.",
      "Cunha operated as the left-sided No.10 in Stockholm and Toby Collyer, much to everyone's surprise, started as the right-sided No.10. Mbemo and Amad will be the leading contenders to occupy that role come mid-August.",
      "Casemiro and Fernandes started alongside each other in midfield in Stockholm before Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte were partnered together for the second half. United were better after the break and Mainoo was a bright spark.",
      "Amorim struggled to determine Mainoo's best position last season, tasking him as either a No.8 or as one of the playmakers. On Saturday's evidence, Mainoo looks more than comfortable in midfield.",
      "However, he was playing alongside Ugarte, who is a defensive specialist, meaning the England international had the freedom to get forward and be adventurous with the ball. If he starts the season next to Fernandes, he will not have that luxury amid the latter's hunger to attack.",
      "To ensure United, who still want to sign a midfielder this summer, strike the right balance in the engine room, Ugarte and Fernandes look the best partnership on paper. Ugarte is an excellent ball-winner and his qualities compliment Fernandes.",
      "Mainoo, though, will believe he has lost time to make up for after a stop-start 2024/25 campaign. However, the prospect of him and Fernandes working side-by-side could leave United vulnerable and potentially exposed in the middle.",
      "Casemiro returned for pre-season looking leaner and fitter, meaning he will be refusing to give up hope of becoming a regular starter this season.",
      "The three US friendlies and the clash with Fiorentina in M16 next month could settle this conundrum for Amorim.",

      "More are expected to follow Mbeumo through the door, however. United are in the market for a new centre forward and also want to sign a central midfielder before the end of the summer window. Nicolas Jackson, Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins are among the strikers on United's shortlist.",

      "While Martinez is suspended for the first game of the season following his red card at Old Trafford in May, United are keen to sign the Argentine and make him their latest summer addition.",
      "In fact, according to the Daily Mail, United held discussions over the weekend about signing the 32-year-old. Although Villa value Martinez at £40million, the Reds are still expected to make an approach.",
      "MEN says: There is no doubt that Martinez is a top goalkeeper and one of the best in the world, but I don't think that United should pursue a move for him. Turning 33 in September, it's safe to say that Martinez is entering the twilight of his career and the Reds may only get him for a couple of years at his very best.",
      "While I do think United need an instant solution, I think they can get someone younger who is just below Martinez's level but has the potential to reach even higher. In this case, that would be Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens, 23, who enjoyed an excellent season in the Belgian Pro League.",
      "United are eyeing up a move for Sporting CP midfielder Morten Hjulmand, according to A Bola. Sporting are aware that Ruben Amorim is very fond of the Denmark midfielder, who has other admirers in England.",

      "The Brentford forward emerged as a key target in the summer window a few weeks ago following the capture of Matheus Cunha from Wolves. United had two bids turned down for Mbeumo, but a fee of £65 million rising to a potential £71 million was agreed with the Bees last week.",
      "The Cameroon international underwent a medical this weekend and has become the third new arrival of the summer transfer window after Cunha and youngster Diego Leon. He has put pen-to-paper on a five-year deal with the option of a sixth year.",
      "The signing of Mbeumo is not expected to be the end of the transfer business for United this summer, with the club working on more deals, both incoming and outgoing.",
      "So what could be the next three deals to happen following the capture of Mbeumo? Three of our MEN Sport writers have their say...",
      "The obvious first transfer that is expected to happen is the departure of Marcus Rashford. The forward is closing in on a loan deal with Barcelona. In a boost to United, the Catalan side will reportedly be paying all of the player’s wages, which could free up some funds for the club in the window.",
      "One of the priorities is an out-and-out striker. Having held a long-term interest in him, I can see United making another move for Red Bull Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, with Arsenal’s attention seemingly turning to Viktor Gyokeres, it opens up a pathway for United to strike.",
      "I think the third transfer will be another departure, with Alejandro Garnacho leaving the club. A move to Aston Villa has been mentioned and it’s a deal that I can see happening.",
      "The January deal that saw Rashford move to Villa on loan means that there is an established relationship between the two clubs and it could make any potential summer move for Garnacho easier to navigate.",
      "Manchester United must target a new striker and goalkeeper now that a move for Bryan Mbeumo has been confirmed. Saturday's 0-0 draw against Leeds United highlighted the need for the Reds to target a proven centre forward and one that can score at least 15, if not 20, goals in a season.",
      "They should be looking at Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson to strengthen their front line. Although the Blues value the 24-year-old at between £80m and £100m, United should attempt to bring that down and sign him for around £65m - similar to the fee they have paid for both Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "As for the goalkeeper situation, I would have a look at Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens. He kept 10 clean sheets for the Belgium top-flight side last season and has the potential to become an elite shot-stopper in the future. Instead of moving for Emiliano Martinez, I would invest and sign Lammens.",
      "In an ideal world not dictated by outgoings, Ruben Amorim would be able to add a striker, midfielder and new goalkeeper to round off his United squad - at least for now. That would just about cover all bases that needed it heading into the new season.",
      "But the reality of it is United's next three transfers must be to offload the dead weight clinging on.",
      "There looks to be positivity on the Marcus Rashford front, albeit another loan with an option to buy, this time to Barcelona. If any two of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho or Tyrell Malacia could follow on - preferably as permanent departures - then we can start thinking about the next transfers after that, as amongst those could be the new recruits that are so desperately needed."

      "The transfer has been a long time coming and fans were relieved to see the announcement on Monday, which confirmed the £65million signing, with a further £6m potentially due in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo has signed a five-year contract with the option of another year, and the forward will travel to the United States on Tuesday with his new teammates for the pre-season tour.",
      "It was important to complete a deal in time for Mbeumo to feature in the US and United got the transfer over the line in the end, despite discussions with Brentford dragging on.",
      "Some fans were concerned when Mbeumo had not signed in time for the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Stockholm, but that game was essentially a training exercise.",
      "It wouldn't have made much difference if Mbeumo had travelled to Sweden last weekend, although it was obvious why United wanted him to arrive ahead of their trip across the Atlantic.",
      "The USA tour will provide Amorim with the opportunity to intensely work with his players across the next fortnight. The Reds boss will hope to lay the foundations for a successful campaign while in the States.",
      "Mbeumo needed to be a part of that, partly because he needs to adapt and partly because discussions rumbling on for any longer could have forced United to finally walk away from the player.",
      "United have received some flak for taking so long to sign Mbeumo. However, he will feature in America, which is a huge positive, and it was important that the structure of the deal was deemed fair.",
      "Brentford will receive the fee they wanted from the start, but United did not surrender to their demands immediately, submitting two unsuccessful bids before a breakthrough, and negotiating a favourable deal structure.",
      "The London club held the aces during talks. Mbeumo had entered the final year of his contract, but Brentford had the option of extending by 12-months, which helped their bargaining power.",
      "The player indicated his desire to move to Manchester, though, which has been key during the transfer saga over the last month. He desperately wanted a summer switch to United.",
      "The Cameroon international completed his medical over the weekend and was pictured in a suit at Carrington - appearances go a long way and Mbeumo has already made a good first impression.",
      "Rival fans have questioned the transfer fee, but they only need to look at the market for home truths. Anthony Elanga (six goals) signed for Newcastle in a £50m deal, Chelsea signed Jamie Gittens (12 goals) from Borussia Dortmund for £51.5m and Noni Madueke (11 goals) signed for Arsenal for £48.5m.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League - his statistics weren't inflated by cup competitions - and also contributed eight assists, so the initial £65m fee seems like fair market value.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim believes Matheus Cunha \"showed what we need\" in his first appearance for the club.",
      "Cunha started in United's goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm, where the £62.5million signing from Wolves played 45 minutes.",
      "The Brazilian was joined in the starting line-up by fellow arrival Diego Leon, who played on the left wing before he was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time.",
      "Cunha operated as one of the two No.10s, with Toby Collyer surprisingly selected in a more advanced role. Bruno Fernandes played in central midfield and is expected to remain there when the competitive campaign begins.",
      "Fernandes was partnered by Casemiro, United's starting duo in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May. Amorim conceded United have a \"lack of pace\" in midfield.",
      "\"We suffered a little bit when we tried to press high,\" Amorim told MUTV. \"They kicked the ball with the second ball, they were dangerous in that moment.",
      "\"We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park, and you can feel that's hard to bring the ball. But we create chances, I think Matheus Cunha showed what we need, that he's the player when he receives the ball between the lines, he can be really aggressive in the direction of the opponent.",
      "\"We have a lot to do but it was the first test against a Premier League team with two different teams, so it was a big test.",
      "\"We watched [Cunha] during last season in a different team, so we expect the same thing. You can see the connection between him and Bruno (Fernandes) is still not there but it's going to be a good connection because you can put a player like Kobbie (Mainoo) there, Mason Mount there. We have to increase our quality in the final third.",
      "\"We have to understand that the kid (Leon) came from Paraguay and it's his second week in Manchester United. He did really well, he's learning things, he's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.\"",
      "United fly to Chicago on Tuesday for their three-game pre-season tour in the Premier League Summer Series. After the club's worst campaign in 51 years, Amorim is desperate to cultivate a harmonious environment as United prepare for their first fixture of the forthcoming season against Arsenal in four weeks.",
      "\"I felt the environment is really good,\" he added. \"Sometimes we are going to struggle but we struggle together, and that is the beginning of everything. And then we have to put the quality, this club is not just about the effort, you have to have the quality you have to win games.",
      "\"We need to create that bond between everybody, not just them but the staff. All the changes are stopping, so we need to leave that as a group, we have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. And we are going to improve.\""

      "Leon made his debut for the club in the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds on Saturday.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno to sign Leon and the 18-year-old will be assessed in pre-season before a decision is made on his next step.",
      "Speaking before his arrival, Leon promised to \"kill it\" in pre-season, and he has impressed coaches in training at Carrington, which suggests he could have a role to play in Ruben Amorim's senior squad.",
      "That means Dorgu could face competition from Leon for his starting role at left-wing, but the Denmark international praised his new teammate and believes he can help United this season.",
      "\"He's a top, top player,\" said Dorgu. \"He's a good player, he's good for everyone. Everyone has competition in their positions. Every player has two or three players in their position. It's just going to help the team even more. Everyone's going to be on their toes, everyone's going to give 100 per cent to the team.\"",
      "The left-back also discussed Matheus Cunha, adding: \"He's a tough player, he did really well last season with Wolves. Hopefully he can bring all the good qualities to us.",
      "\"You can see today he's good carrying the ball, he's good in the small combination play. He can score goals and that's what we need. I think everyone is excited to see him play.\"",
      "Dorgu's fellow countryman, Rasmus Hojlund, was included in the wholesale changes for the second half against Leeds.",
      "Dorgu was asked whether Hojlund could get back to his best after taking a backwards step last season and responded: \"I think most of the players had a step back last season. I think everyone wants to redeem themselves this season and I think Rasmus is the same.\"",
      "He continued: \"I have more to bring to the team, more to give. I'm just getting ready for the season, using all these pre-season games to get fit. Hopefully we'll see the best of me and the team in the first game.\"",

      "Hugill was also on target in United's final friendly before the tour last year against Rangers at Murrayfield. After an unfulfilling loan at League One side Wigan Athletic was cut short, he ended the season on the Carlisle bench as they were relegated to the National League. Hugill is now at League Two Barnet and his last 12 months could make for a power point presentation to keep every United youngster grounded.",

      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "United's best player in the first half (not saying much). 8",
      "Matthijs De Ligt",

      "Steady performance. 6",

      "The full-time whistle goes at the Strawberry Arena and United's pre-season opener ends exactly as it started.",
      "That was a chance for United to win it. Dalot cuts the ball back to the edge of the box for Dorgu, who has drifted inside, and he fires it over the top.",
      "There will be a minimum of three additional minutes at the end of this game.",
      "How have United not scored? A corner comes in, his headed back across the face of goal by Hojlund and Mainoo heads the ball against the bar. The ball then bounces around the box and Heaven is denied by Meslier.",
      "Amorim makes another alteration;",
      "OFF: Mantato",
      "ON: J. Fletcher",
      "Ramazani has been really lively since coming on at half-time for Leeds. He has just cut inside off the left and curled a low, right-footed effort towards goal that drew another save from Heaton.",
      "Amorim makes his first change since the break;",
      "OFF: Maguire",
      "ON: Fredricson",
      "The game has stopped for the second half drinks break.",
      "Ugarte has a go from range, drawing a comfortable save from Meslier, but the midfielder did not get enough power or conviction on the shot.",
      "Heaton has done his chances of starting a game in the US no harm at all since coming on at half-time. He has just made a smart stop to deny Ramazani. The Leeds winger will be disappointed not to have scored.",
      "Not for the first time, Hojlund has gone berserk at Dalot. \"F**k's sake,\" he shouted there. No progress there after San Sebastian.",
      "Heaton comes to United's rescue, denying Bogle, who was slipped in by Piroe. The United shot-stopper spread himself well to deny the Whites full-back.",
      "United have started this second half better than they did the first. They have had more of the ball and they are frequently trying to bring Dalot into play on the right. The Portuguese defender has put in a couple of teasing crosses since being introduced.",
      "Leeds boss Daniel Farke has also made a crop of changes at the break, making eight in total. Among those to have come include former United players Daniel James and Largie Ramazani.",
      "The second half is underway in Stockholm. Ruben Amorim, as expected, has made 11 changes at the break.",
      "Amorim has made wholesale changes to the team, as expected.",
      "The XI for the second half: Heaton, Heaven, Maguire, Yoro, Dalot, Dorgu, Mainoo, Ugarte, Mount, Mantato, Hojlund.",
      "Great to see Mantato on the pitch - this is a big moment for the youngster.",
      "Straw-clutching time for MUTV, as they go on about Diogo Dalot's squad number. Seeing Mark Sullivan front the coverage is a reminder that he arguably killed the televised player of the year awards when he interviewed England cricket great and United fan Geoffrey Boycott at the 2019 do.",
      "Sullivan looked like a hostage in a video as Boycott typically and bluntly took apart United's performance that season.",
      "The officials have a sick sense of humour to add another minute to that half. The players will be writing '45 minutes in the tank' with a loading emoji on their Instagram posts after that.",

      "Has put himself about. 6",
      "Fernandes",
      "Trying hard but no final product. 6",
      "Cunha",
      "Most exciting player (also not saying much). 7",
      "Obi",
      "Forced Darlow into a save and dragged one wide. 6",
      "The half-time whistle goes at the Strawberry Arena and it remains goalless.",
      "Casemiro just hit the bar and placed his hands on his head. The Brazilian has been off the pace during the first half and is set to be replaced. Amorim sent 12 players to warm-up before the interval and you would expect wholesale changes.",
      "That was the best piece of play in the half by far and Chido Obi made the wrong call. That was set up for Cunha, who you'd have backed to hit the target at the very least. He was well within his rights to rebuke Obi, whose movement was good but decision-making was not so good.",
      "Casemiro takes aim from distance on his weaker left foot and the ball goes over the top of the bar to a chorus of jeers from the Leeds fans."

      "Amorim said he needed to see whether Cunha understood the position, but that he shouldn't need to think too much\". And the first sign of teething problems came just a few minutes into the match when Toby Collyer had to urge Cunha to take up a more advanced role.",
      "Collyer only broke into the first-team last season. He made his debut against Liverpool in September and lacks experience, but it's reassuring he possesses the confidence to instruct a senior teammate.",
      "Cunha was in communication with a teammate himself, telling new signing Diego Leon to keep his width. Leon was essentially hugging the left touchline when United tried to build-up.",
      "Leeds targeted Leon's side in the opening exchanges and the dynamic Wilfried Gnoto asked a few questions, but there was a lack of quality from both sides in important areas.",
      "So much so that Amorim dished out tactical instructions to Bruno Fernandes, Amad and Cunha during a drinks interval. The pace had been mundane and the manager clearly wanted a little bit more from the players.",
      "Casemiro looked off the pace and lazily fired a shot over the bar on the cusp of the break. The 33-year-old provided value in the Europa League last season but should not be starting for United in 2025/2026.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui looked in good physical condition, which helped him to be United's best player in the first half. Cunha was the most exciting player in the first 45 minutes, although there was no competition for that prize.",
      "Cunha did provide a glimpse into what he will bring to the table, though. He executed step-overs and won a foul. Then he was fouled again closer to Leeds' penalty area. He is certainly worth buying a ticket to watch and will provide entertainment this season, along with cutting edge in front of goal.",
      "The forward scored 17 goals in a struggling Wolves side and the prospect of Cunha playing alongside Bryan Mbeumo, who will join United on their tour of the USA next week, has generated a buzz.",
      "Opening pre-season friendlies can look similar to training drills and the players who started conducted a warm down on the pitch under the guidance of Emanuel Ferro when it was half-time.",
      "Amorim replaced the entire XI at the break and gave an opportunity to Bendito Mantato who has impressed in training. The 17-year-old was deployed in the right side No.10 position, but has the qualities to excel at wing-back. The youngster was previously a left-back before being moved to the right wing by coaches.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was among those who came on for the second half and this season will be significant for the 20-year-old, who hasn't been able to nail down a regular starting place under Amorim.",
      "Mainoo's momentum was disrupted by small injuries last term and there are doubts about which position he suits best. He played in the pivot in Stockholm and perhaps Amorim will settle on an answer this summer.",
      "The academy graduate improved United and sprayed a handful of long-range passes, giving them an outlet from midfield, and Mainoo objectively looks more comfortable in those areas.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who also played the second half, looked buoyant when he received warm applause from the Scandinavian fans before kick-off. Hojlund took huge steps backward last season but looks set to stay for the new campaign. He appreciated the support in Sweden and will be hungry to bounce back.",
      "Tom Heaton made two brilliant saves to deny Leeds after the break. Heaton replaced Bayindir at the interval and should replace him as second-choice goalkeeper.",
      "Rosenborg defeated United 1-0 in Norway for the opening pre-season friendly of last summer, and it's always impossible to gauge too much from the first friendly of pre-season. Some will joke the goalless draw against Leeds represents progress after the Rosenborg starter 12 months ago.",
      "United will now fly back to Manchester and prepare for the USA tour. They travel to the States on Tuesday and will be primarily based in Chicago for the three-game schedule.",
      "Amorim will hope his players are no longer rusty by then."

      "The report says that United are open to that idea, although it is not yet a done deal, talks are said to be at the final stages.",
      "Barcelona are a club who have been liked with an interest for some time. The loan deal will see Barcelona negotiate their financial situation.",
      "Rashford has sounded out Spanish intermediaries to try and engineer a move to the Catalan side",

It’s reported that he is on more than £325,000 per-week, with Villa covering 75 percent as well as performance-related bonuses during the loan deal, with United covering the other 25 percent",
      "Villa did have the option of making the move permanent for a £40 million fee this summer, but they decided not to take up that option.",
      "Speaking about the possibility of signing a new wide man back in May, Flick said: This is what we have talked about with the club. In the last matches maybe we did not have a lot of options in that position… so we have to bring more options to the team and more quality. This is the job from Deco, is clear, and I will support him.”",

      "\"I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could do that and go and deliver performances. I hope today showed that.",
      "\"Competition for places is exactly what we want. This is Manchester United Football Club and it should be [competitive] in every single position.",
      "\"You are competing against everyone else in the world because that is the reach of this football club.",
      "\"For me, it is about performing, working every day, taking the opportunity when it comes and hopefully keep showing the manager what I am capable of.\"",
      "Heaton has not made a competitive appearance for United since February 2023, last featuring when the Reds beat Nottingham Forest 2-0 in the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final triumph at Old Trafford.",
      "He added: \"For me, the 90 minutes have been few and far between over the last 18 months, which is difficult. I know I am a bit older and further down my career than most people, but the flame of the fire doesn't stop burning.",
      "\"Every weekend, when you're trying to get in the team, it can be difficult, it is a real challenge. But I try and channel that energy every day by performing and when the opportunities come, making sure I take them.",
      "\"I repeat what I said before: I wouldn't have signed again for another year if I didn't think I could make an impact on the team.",
      "\"The manager is obviously here to pick the team and that is rightly so, but I will keep trying to do my bit.\"",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "Manchester United have had a ‘shock bid’ for Emiliano Martinez rejected by an ‘incredulous’ Aston Villa after completing a deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The Cameroon international was finally announced as the Red Devils’ third summer signing on Monday after Matheus Cunha joined in a £62.5m move from Wolves while Diego Leon arrived for £3.3m, and United aren’t at all happy with Brentford over their tactics during negotiations.",
      "Amid reports claiming Sir Jim Ratcliffe would not be ‘held to ransom’ as Brentford held out for their asking price, Mirror have revealed that Manchester United are ‘angry’ with Mbeumo’s now former club in a ‘slam’ of their transfer tactics.",
      "It’s claimed Brentford ‘put pressure on the forward to go to Newcastle or Tottenham’ over United despite the 25-year-old insisting he only had eyes for a move to Old Trafford, while putting further ‘pressure on Mbeumo to reduce his wage demands’ in order to ‘increase the size of fee they would receive’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Sources involved in the deal claim Brentford wanted a fee of £70m plus £7m in add-ons for Mbeumo, but United managed to negotiate down that final figure, with the £6m add-ons relating to a mix of team and individual performances.’",
      "Mbeumo’s delighted though, having joined the club of his “dreams”.",
      "“As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up,” said Mbeumo.",
      "“My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "“Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.”",
      "Reports suggest Amorim’s priorities are now a new striker and central midfielder, but United have also been linked with a host of new goalkeepers this summer after Andre Onana’s less than convincing second season at the club.",
      "And The Daily Mail claim the Red Devils saw a bid for Villa’s Martinez – whom Amorim ‘had set his sights on to provide the third leg of his summer rebuild’ – rejected over the weekend.",
      "The report claims that United’s loan proposal for the 32-year-old was ‘put to Villa officials but was met with incredulity and rebuffed immediately’.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United have hatched a bold plan to secure their next two signings after landing Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, and they are on course to do so…",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Bayer Leverkusen – £88m\nArmed with money from Liverpool for Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, new coach Erik ten Hag has been busy, with US international Malik Tillman coming in for a club-record fee.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Atletico Madrid – £92.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada and Matteo Ruggeri have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again.",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal – £123.7m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Including two Manchester United outcasts and several Arsenal targets, these are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "And here are the best available strikers. And attacking midfielders.",
      "10) Antony (Manchester United)\nThe Red Devils have managed to offload Marcus Rashford, who drops out of this ranking after agreeing a move to Barcelona. United-bound Bryan Mbeumo has also been removed after Brentford accepted a bid last week.",
      "Tenth place came down to a toss-up between United forwards Antony and Jadon Sancho. The latter was uninspiring during his loan at Chelsea across the 2024/25 campaign, while Antony impressed during a more productive stint at Real Betis. The Spanish club want him permanently, and the Brazilian is keen on the move. They’re a great fit.",
      "",
      "9) Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)\nThe second of United’s wide men on the chopping block, Garnacho is reportedly valued at a staggering £60million — a figure that feels wildly inflated for a player who underperformed last season. But at just 21 years old, he still holds plenty of promise.",
      "Garnacho wasn’t alone in struggling at Old Trafford; very few besides Bruno Fernandes stood out. But unless Sir Jim Ratcliffe lowers his valuation, United might be forced to keep or loan him out, risking a repeat of this summer’s dilemma in 2026.",
      "",
      "8) Maghnes Akliouche (AS Monaco)\nThe 23-year-old had a solid campaign with Monaco, regiestering five goals and 10 assists in Ligue 1. He’s earned six caps for France, which is no small feat, and was recently linked with a move to Arsenal. That interest seems to have cooled after the Gunners picked up Noni Madueke.",
      "Still, Akliouche is available…for a steep £70million. He’s not cheap, but he’s fantastic.",
      "",
      "7) Heung-min Son (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThe South Korea and Spurs captain endured a difficult 2024/25 campaign but still ended up with 11 goals and 12 assists in 46 matches, including 17 goal involvements in 30 Premier League appearances. Those numbers mask what was a disappointing season overall, with it increasingly clear that Son is in sharp decline.",
      "That being said, it could simply have been an off year, and there’s a growing willingness at Spurs to part ways with one of their greatest-ever players. His respectable output last season, combined with elite numbers in years gone by, makes Son an intriguing potential target for clubs abroad.",
      "",
      "6) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Tyler Dibling, while Gabriel Martinelli’s availability is up for debate (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed have been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was so exciting to watch at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "5) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale — meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is underwhelming. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "4) Malick Fofana (Lyon)\nLyon might be safe from relegation, but they’re still resigned to losing Belgian winger Fofana this summer. Saying that, there’s no immediate rush on Fofana’s part to leave.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a bid accepted and sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United for £55million, but Fofana wants Champions League football. Chelsea are an option but have already signed Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro.",
      "What is clear is that, at just 20 years old, he is one of the most intriguing prospects on the market this summer.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nWilliams has signed a new long-term contract at Bilbao, but the release clause still exists. Oh, and by ‘long-term’, we mean 10 f***ing years.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out — they’ve welcomed Gittens, Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer — but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How did they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight?",
      "With Grealish likely off and Jeremy Doku not fully convincing, Man City could come calling too. Liverpool would also make sense if they sell Bayern Munich target Luis Diaz.",
      "Leao’s performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act. Even after signing Madueke from Chelsea, we shouldn’t rule the Gunners out.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, is expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club — and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",

      "Arsenal and Aston Villa know they could cut out the negotiating middle man for many of their targets, who happen to come with tempting release clauses.",
      "Arsenal could deal a double transfer blow to Liverpool as they look to get serious over a potential deal for Real Madrid star Rodrygo, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal have walked away from deals to sign Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Bayern Munich defensive midfielder Joao Palhinha, according to reports.",

      "If Arsenal don’t get this Gyokeres deal done they’ll regret it for ever. He’s top class. He’d be the difference between finishing 2nd again – or winning it. Isn’t that worth an extra £10m? What are they doing?",
      "Textbook Keysey. We love the way he almost makes it sound like a threat with the sheer melodrama of ‘they’ll regret it for ever’. And the binary certainty of Arsenal’s only two possible outcomes – signing Gyokeres and winning the league or not signing Gyokeres and finishing second – is classic Keysey.",
      "Even second doesn’t exactly look nailed on, does it? In the ‘regret it for ever’ scenario? Fantastic that nothing happening at Chelsea or Man City is allowed to enter the tunnel-vision certainty of Keysey Making A Point.",
      "Anyway, having self-indulgently dispatched the wily fish hiding in that particular tweet barrel, let us remember and acknowledge that there really is a very solid point behind all that nonsense.",
      "What, in fact, are Arsenal doing?",
      "We like to think we’re ever so slightly more allowing of subtlety and nuance here, and will allow all manner of caveats about how we obviously know nothing of the behind-the-scenes difficulties that exist in the minutiae of any transfer.",
      "But come on. This is just fannying for fannying’s sake now, surely? This is a transfer that Arsenal can obviously afford, for the most final-piece-in-the-puzzle signing imaginable at any Premier League club, a transfer for which the player himself is overwhelmingly keen and to which now the only major obstacles appear to be Arsenal themselves and clown-car banter club Man United still hanging around and honking their horn as the bumper falls off the car, which despite being small is able to seat an unimaginably large collection of unwanted yet seemingly unsellable bomb squad players.",
      "Clearly, chucking unnecessary money at a transfer is not necessarily wise or the best course. But there also must come a time when stubbornly continuing to argue and haggle over the structure of a few million pounds in payments becomes self-defeating. Even if you get the deal at the price/structure/whatever you initially wanted, is it still the best deal if that player – one so obviously vital to Arsenal’s whole season plan – doesn’t arrive until deep into pre-season?",
      "The campaign is now less than a month away. It is already reason enough to stop counting every penny in a transfer of this importance.",
      "Unlike Keysey we cannot be certain that Gyokeres will prove to be the silver bullet Arsenal have been searching for. There are no certainties in the transfer game, and Gyokeres is undeniably costly for a player unproven in Europe’s top leagues.",
      "But there are more reasons to suppose he is precisely what Arsenal require. Precisely what Arsenal have required for years now. And there can be no suggestion Arsenal haven’t done due diligence. Whatever else Arsenal’s pursuit of that long-awaited and obviously-needed striker could be accused of being, let nobody accuse them of being rushed or hasty.",
      "Comparing one transfer to another is another risky business, because no two deals are the same, but it’s impossible not to notice the alacrity with which Liverpool have moved on to and apparently secured the signing of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt in their own release-clause-adjacent striker pursuit.",
      "Yes, it’s unfair to compare the two very different deals. And we’re not saying Arsenal should have gone for Ekitike either, especially with the Emirates being surely the most unforgiving place a Temu Thierry Henry could attempt to succeed.",
      "But that doesn’t mean it isn’t adding to the frustration for Arsenal fans. They were already playing catch-up and watching Liverpool address what is for them a secondary issue while Arsenal are still doing some sums on their most important bit of business since signing Declan Rice cannot be helping.",
      "Arsenal could make a ‘sudden switch’ from interest in Sporting CP’s Viktor Gyokeres to Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak, according to reports.",
      "Sporting CP have turned to Man Utd over a deal for Viktor Gyokeres after Arsenal have gone slightly cold on the deal, according to reports.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the truth over Viktor Gyokeres’ future after claims Man Utd are ahead of Arsenal for the signing.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa know they could cut out the negotiating middle man for many of their targets, who happen to come with tempting release clauses.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘most advanced’ in the race to sign Viktor Gyokeres as INEOS have offered a ‘slightly higher’ fee than Arsenal for the Sporting striker."

      "Rashford’s move is the latest headline in a chaotic summer at Camp Nou. The deal itself is understood to be a 12-month loan with a £26 million option to buy, with Barcelona covering 100 per cent of his reduced wage.",
      "Rashford is desperate to revive his career after falling out of favour at Old Trafford. The academy graduate spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, where he managed four goals and six assists in 17 appearances.",
      "Despite glimpses of form, Utd made it clear he was no longer part of Ruben Amorim’s plans.",
      "In order to make the move possible, Rashford has agreed to a sizeable pay cut. The 27-year-old was earning over £300,000 a week at Old Trafford, but his salary at Barca will reportedly drop to around £8.6 million gross for the season.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Cole Palmer – Chelsea to Manchester City\nApparently, Pep Guardiola is ‘determined’ to bring back Palmer at all costs and a £147million offer is on its way to Chelsea. It’s not, though, is it? Next.\n19) Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan are looking into the feasibility of signing Hojlund as they search for a striker and the player’s agent is pushing him back towards Serie A. But United paid Atalanta £72million two years ago and the Rossoneri would struggle to give the Red Devils half of their money back. So this feels like a non-starter.",
      "",
      "18) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nBack here again, are we? Apparently so, according to reports in Portugal. The stories go that United are close to an agreement with Sporting, which sounds very convenient for the Portuguese club, but its is a tactic that has already failed, so we cannot see why they would flog that particular dead horse if there was nothing in it. Gyokeres has made clear his intention to move to Arsenal, but he, like us, must be close to losing hope. If he did go to United now, the Arsenal meltdown would be spectacular.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Conor Gallagher – Atletico Madrid to Tottenham \nThis all sounds very tentative and driven by the players’ representatives seemingly exploring the midfielder’s options should he return to the Premier League amid expectations that he might not get the same playing time this season. Spurs are said to appreciate Gallagher and Newcastle are sniffing too. If anything happens here, it won’t be for a while yet.",
      "",
      "16) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko is back in the 20 after losing out to Gyokeres in Arsenal audition but, apparently, United are ‘serious’ about signing the Slovenian. Maybe they are, and Christ knows they need a striker, but they will have to start selling sharpish if they are to afford what Leipzig are demanding.",

Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "14) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seemed as though Liverpool were taking Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead doused our initial suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak. But it all seemed a bit weird on Saturday when Isak was sent home from Glasgow ‘due to the speculation around him’ and Eddie Howe sounded less convincing that the Swede would remain with Newcastle beyond the end of the window. Maybe this one isn’t done?",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "11) Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags. Man Utd seem to have finally got their mitts on Bryan Mbeumo, which makes it less likely the Bees will entertain interest in Wissa too.",
      "",
      "10) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao but the sales of Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah will allow the Old Lady to sign Sancho too. Agreements are said to be in place with both United and Sancho, who should be thanking his lucky stars even if he’s halving his salary.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nWe all assumed Newcastle would pull their finger out after their initial bid of £27million inclusive of add-ons was rejected last month. Since then, though: nothing. Leaving City to swoop in for the England Under-21 keeper. Reports suggest City are trying to secure a discount on the £40million buy-back clause they hold for their ex-goalkeeper but with the increased noise around Ederson departing, it’s hard to envisage the Citizens allowing Newcastle back into the race.",
      "",
      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement. Lord knows they’ve been discussing it for long enough.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nThis seems to be reaching its inevitable conclusion sooner than we thought. We knew Rashford would go on loan, probably to Barca, but we thoroughly expected United to drag it out. It’s almost to their credit that they haven’t, even if the fact they can’t sell Rashford for actual money is a mess largely of their own making. It seems the only sticking point is how much the buy option would be at the end of a season-long loan. Whatever it becomes, Barca probably can’t afford it. But that isn’t stopping them from covering his entire salary, for which United should be grateful.",
      "",
      "4) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nArsenal have missed Arteta’s deadline for Gyokeres to be on the flight to Singapore and some reports in Portugal suggest the deal could be jeopardy, with add-ons still to be negotiated and solidarity payments to be sorted. Gyokeres’ agents are working their nuts off but they don’t seem to be having much joy. To the contrary: the player’s father is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ while Gyokeres himself is distancing himself from London. We genuinely thought this one was done, but it’s a saga that’s had more fake endings than Lord of the f*cking Rings. For all the good work Arsenal have done this summer, if they screw this up…",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. But with Fabrizio Romano now giving this one the ‘here we go’ treatment it appears only a matter of time before Ekitike joins Liverpool’s big list of summer signings. Certainly, personal terms should pose few problems given the player himself seems unsurprisingly enormously keen.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nThis is done, apparently, with images leaked of the defender in his Arsenal training kit. The paperwork is still being ratified, but the delay between medical and confirmation is a pattern with Arsenal this summer.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nWe have a deal! United have spent weeks haggling, only to pay more than Brentford’s initial asking price. But a medical is set to take place over the weekend before Mbeumo flies off to the United States with his new team-mates. Now for a striker. And some sales."

      "Rashford fell out with Ruben Amorim last season with the Man Utd boss claiming he’d rather play his goalkeeping coach than the England international.",
      "The Man Utd forward was allowed to join Premier League rivals Aston Villa for the second half of the season and had a pretty successful loan spell at Villa Park.",
      "And he has been allowed out on loan again, although there is still no official confirmation, after transfer expert Fabrizio Romano gave his ‘here we go’ to the transfer.",
      "Romano wrote on X on Saturday: ‘BREAKING: Marcus Rashford to Barcelona, here we go! Verbal agreement in principle between all parties involved with Barça planning for medical tests next days. Loan deal with buy option, details being finalised today then Man Utd will authorize his travel to Spain.’",
      "READ: The super secret transfer release clauses Forest and other clubs might sue us for revealing",
      "That led to Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand to give his reaction to Rashford’s departure on his YouTube channel over the weekend, he said: “There must have been so much going on behind the scenes that we’re just not aware of. And Marcus isn’t someone who really wants to talk and do interviews, so you have to respect that.",
      "“But I’m sure it’ll come out in the wash at some point. Is it because of a lack of form? A lack of confidence? Mismanagement? Have the club failed him? Or is it down to him? Is there injuries we don’t know about? Has he lost that desire? That form is gone and he can’t rekindle it and can’t get it back?",
      "“What are the issues that have led to a young kid that’s a graduate of the academy at Manchester United, which is famous for all of the great players that have come through there, that he says he wants to leave?”",
      "And now Pogba insists that Man Utd will be the party losing out on the deal as Rashford is a “great player” who will have an impact at Barcelona this season.",
      "Speaking to YouTuber IShowSpeed, Pogba said: “That’s crazy, but I’m happy or him because they took his number. Manchester United are losing a great player, unlucky for them.",
      "“It’s great for Barcelona to be honest. I’m not even talking about United, because they’ve bought a few new players and the new manager wants to do his thing I guess.",
      "“It’s not really his fault, if he doesn’t believe in someone. He needs to win. If he doesn’t win they’re going to sack him.”",
      "Paris Saint-Germain forward Ousmane Dembele has been in amazing form over the past season and Pogba reckons his compatriot must win the Ballon d’Or this year or lose his chance forever.",
      "Pogba added: “The Ballon d’Or? For me, Dembele will always be ahead of Yamal! I support Dembele 100%. He won the Champions League, he was very important this season. If he doesn’t win it this year, he’ll never get it. Hakimi and Vitinha were very good too. But Dembele is the favourite for the Ballon d’Or.”",
      "Man Utd’s Marcus Rashford faces a nervy wait to finalise his loan move to Barcelona amid a summer of issues for the Catalan club.",
      "Marcus Rashford was ‘almost scuppered’ in his mission to join Barcelona from Manchester United because of a slight delay from back-up airport of choice.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has pondered whether Manchester United have “failed” Marcus Rashford as he looks to be on the way to a move to Barcelona.",
      "Man Utd have slashed the permanent transfer option fee for Marcus Rashford to force through his transfer to Barcelona this summer.",
      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly sanctioned a gargantuan pay cut to facilitate his loan to Barcelona, who have a ‘verbal agreement’ with Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona are ‘advancing’ to sign Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford, with David Ornstein revealing two key details."

      "A former Man Utd midfielder has questioned whether the current goalkeeper has the presence needed to lead a side with serious ambitions, while also encouraging the signing of an energetic midfielder.",
      "Gordon Strachan, who also won 50 caps for Scotland, believes Andre Onana is still “at war with himself” and that Man Utd’s midfield lacks the physical profile required at the top level.",
      "“When I’ve been successful anywhere, I’ve had goalkeepers with personality and presence,” he told OLBG. “Whether it’s a physical presence, a personality presence, that is always needed in the team.",
      "“When they walk down the tunnel and they see a goalie in front of them with a physical presence, a personality presence, then you think, thank goodness he’s there.",
      "“The goalkeeper there now, I don’t think he’s got either of them. I don’t think he’s got a physical presence, and I don’t think he’s got this personality presence.",
      "“He looks like he’s constantly at war with himself, worrying about making a mistake, and that he might have to go somewhere else to get that confidence back.”",
      "Strachan compared the situation to when Peter Schmeichel joined the club. “When Peter Schmeichel went to United, it was one of the best things that ever happened to the club. There is a lot of talk about other players, but Schmeichel was huge.”",
      "He also addressed the midfield, where the likes of Casemiro, Eriksen and Bruno Fernandes were regulars last season, and argued that Utd need more than just quality on the ball.",
      "“They don’t need a bit more bite, they need legs—real legs, real closing down,” he said. Conor Gallagher is among the suitable midfielders linked in previous seasons.",
      "“Can Conor Gallagher do that? Yes, he can, he’s definitely got legs, he’s a good teammate.”",
      "Strachan admitted Gallagher may not offer the same creativity as others in the squad, saying, “Gallagher has the legs and energy—but not the Bruno flair,” but said that pairing energy with imagination could be the solution.",
      "“Has he got enough imagination? I don’t know. But if you have people like that with legs in there and have imagination around them, then he’d be a good signing.",
      "“A Christian Eriksen of 10 years ago could have done that in the game that is now as frantic as PSG are now playing with their level of fitness.",
      "“So the days of the luxury player, if you want to be a top side, are gone. Conor Gallagher has definitely got the legs. He’s got the robustness. Has he got goals? Has he got that flair? These players are hard to come by.",
      "“Would I take him compared to some of the players that have played over the last couple of years at Man Utd? Yes, I would.”",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘ready to step up’ their interest in a Belgian goalkeeper amid concern over an injury to No.1 Andre Onana.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘frustrated’ at how this summer transfer window is going for Manchester United after making two ‘priority demands’.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United’s ‘surprise’ move for Atletico Madrid and England star Conor Gallagher ‘will be accepted’ amid two key factors.",
      "Man Utd could have a chance of signing Emiliano Martinez this summer as Aston Villa prepare to announce a new goalkeeper signing, according to reports.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Andre Onana only joined Untied two years ago but already looks to be heading out the door if the club get their way."

      "READ: The super secret transfer release clauses Forest and other clubs might sue us for revealing",
      "“So, Hojlund would really hope and love to stay at Manchester United. The only possibility for Hojlund to go is if Manchester United decide to let him go, to sell him, to make profit with him, and all these kind of things.",
      "“If Man United decide for him to go, Hojlund has to go. Otherwise, if it’s for Hojlund, I’m hearing that the player would be keen on staying at Manchester United and would love to stay at Manchester United.”",
      "However, Caught Offside claim that Milan have ‘asked about signing’ the Denmark international, while another Serie A side, Roma, have ‘also showed interest’ but ‘can only offer a loan deal with a chance to buy later’.",
      "Man Utd are ‘holding out for a fee of around €45 million and only want a full sale, not loans or swaps’ and it is understood that Hojlund’s ‘agent believes returning to Italy would be good for his career and is “talking to clubs” in Serie A’.",
      "The Red Devils have already got a ‘replacement’ lined up if Hojlund does leave with Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins their top target and the England star ‘could prove to be a major upgrade on the Denmark International’.",
      "Former Man Utd midfielder Gordon Strachan said at the end of the season that it is time for Hojlund to move on for the good of his career.",
      "Strachan said at the end of May: “There’s a point when you look at a player and think, ‘I really do feel sorry for you’, and that’s how I feel about Rasmus Hojlund at the moment. I went through something similar when I was at Aberdeen – for a year I was absolutely horrendous and it really gets to you, you almost lose your power to run and you feel debilitated.",
      "“There are some clubs in the world like Manchester United where everything is too much for players, and it drains big signings rather than galvanising them. I think Hojlund is in that position right now.",
      "“Do I think a loan move would help him? No – I think what’s best for him as a young man is moving somewhere else permanently. Everything seems to be too much for him and I think he’s in the mindset where he’s letting everyone down, which is a horrible place to be in.",
      "“He definitely tries a lot, but is he good enough to be there? He hasn’t got long now to find out, because you can’t wait around for people at Manchester United.”",

      "Mbeumo will join Matheus Cunha, who arrived from Wolves in a £62.5m deal earlier in the summer, and Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon at Old Trafford as their first three signings.",
      "And there have been rumours over the weekend that Man Utd are now seriously interested in hijacking Arsenal’s deal to sign Gyokeres from Sporting CP this summer.",
      "Arsenal have so far struggled to get a deal over the line despite weeks of negotiations and a report on Sunday claimed that the Red Devils are now the ‘most advanced’ club in the race for Gyokeres.",
      "But Romano now has an update on the Sweden international’s future and addresses the rumours about interest from Man Utd, he said on his YouTube channel: “I want to clarify something about Man Utd and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "READ: The super secret transfer release clauses Forest and other clubs might sue us for revealing",
      "“Some very important outlets in Portugal are reporting that Man Utd have been working on a deal for Gyokeres in recent days.",
      "“Earlier this week, I told you that Man Utd will sign an important striker this summer. Not that Cunha and Mbeumo are done, the focus for them is the striker and many agents in the market are aware about this.",
      "“For example, someone internally at Eintracht Frankfurt expected Man Utd to try to enter the race for Ekitike when the deal collapsed with Newcastle. Man Utd were calling to be informed on the situation with Ekitike, but the player decided to go to Liverpool and there was no chance to enter into the deal.",
      "“What about Gyokeres? I’m not aware of an official bid from Man Utd and I’m not aware of club-to-club talks. Despite intermediaries suggesting the opportunity for Man Utd to enter into the deal for Gyokeres, it’s very clear that Gyokeres wants to go to Arsenal. He is only convinced about the Arsenal project and he agreed personal terms with them two weeks ago.”",
      "Man Utd have also been linked with a move for Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson and Romano has touched on that as well as other transfer talking points at Old Trafford.",
      "Romano added: “I told you earlier in the week that Nicolas Jackson is an option for Man Utd. At the moment, I’m not aware of talks ongoing with Chelsea, but Man Utd are informed about the situation of Jackson. They know that the player is not untouchable at Chelsea and so they are aware of the eventual conditions for his exit this summer.",
      "“While at Chelsea there is still an appreciation for Alejandro Garnacho for example. So maybe that could be a scenario, but at the moment there is not a negotiation. At the moment there is no club-to-club talks about that.",
      "“But, Man Utd are expected to go for a striker and one of the names being mentioned internally in the recent weeks is also Benjamin Sesko, another player who is well known at Manchester United. But before entering into concrete negotiations, we have to wait and see what’s going to happen internally at Man Utd in terms of outgoings.",
      "“Marcus Rashford is going to Barcelona, but then there is Jadon Sancho, there is Antony and there is Alejandro Garnacho, so that’s going to be really important.”",
      "Arsenal could make a ‘sudden switch’ from interest in Sporting CP’s Viktor Gyokeres to Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak, according to reports.",
      "Sporting CP have turned to Man Utd over a deal for Viktor Gyokeres after Arsenal have gone slightly cold on the deal, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are mucking about over minor details of the most final-piece-in-the-puzzle signing imaginable as the clock ticks louder and louder.",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa know they could cut out the negotiating middle man for many of their targets, who happen to come with tempting release clauses.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘most advanced’ in the race to sign Viktor Gyokeres as INEOS have offered a ‘slightly higher’ fee than Arsenal for the Sporting striker."

      "However, Onana doesn’t look likely to be going anywhere, but he has now been ruled out for the next six weeks. That saw Altay Bayindir play in a friendly against Leeds on Saturday, and means Onana will be out until the end of August.",

      "Whether Lammens would be able to displace Onana once and for all when both are fit remains to be seen, but that the incumbent is injured at the start of the season will mean for an interesting situation.",
      "Indeed, if United are willing to change starters when Onana is fit, as has looked likely over the summer, then if Lammens performs well at the beginning of the campaign, he might well be able to keep the No.1 spot.",
      "The Belgian, 23, kept 10 clean sheets in all competitions last season, which is one fewer than Onana, though Lammens has a far better save percentage from last season, and if he could continue that in the Premier League, he’d be a better asset than United’s current keeper.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 07:15, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Jackson also has potential suitors in Europe and in Saudi Arabia; Chelsea are under no pressure to sell the striker who has eight years remaining on his current deal at Stamford Bridge; Should Jackson leave, Blues may opt to sign a wide player to replace him",
      "Monday 21 July 2025 17:50, UK",
      "Chelsea value Nicolas Jackson at between £80m and £100m, with Manchester United among Premier League clubs keeping an eye on him.",
      "The 24-year-old is also subject to interest from clubs in Europe and Saudi Arabia; however, Chelsea are under no pressure to sell as he has eight years left on his contract.",
      "If the Senegal international was to leave, the £79m Liverpool are paying for Hugo Ekitike would be used as a benchmark for any potential deal.",
      "It is understood that Chelsea feel that Jackson has a better scoring and goal involvement record over the past two seasons in a higher standard league.",
      "Jackson has 34 goal contributions over the last two Premier League campaigns, while Ekitike has 29 in the last season for Bundesliga side, Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Jackson's Chelsea was plunged into uncertainty after he played a bit-part role in his side's Club World Cup-winning campaign.",
      "Promising starts from new signings, Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, who both play in Jackson's position, meant his involvement in the competition wore thin as his side progressed to the final.",
      "Any incomings at Chelsea continue to be exit-dependent. Chelsea would ideally like to start the season with three high-quality players who can play in the No 9 role.",
      "With the additions of Delap and Pedro, if Jackson were to leave, they may sign a wide player instead of another No 9 because Pedro Neto can also play through the middle.",

      "Report as Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against Leeds; Matheus Cunha made his debut but United failed to show much attacking improvement; Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar, but Leeds had good chances through Largie Ramazani",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 21:51, UK",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "After Ruben Amorim's side recorded their worst-scoring Premier League campaign last term with 44 goals, there were little signs of improvement in front of goal despite starting new £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha, who played the first half.",
      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",
      "Man Utd then had the best chance of the afternoon as the clock ticked into 90 as Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from a corner from just two yards out, with Ayden Heaven finding Meslier on the rebound from a similar distance.",
      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is on his way to complete a £71m move to Manchester, but there is still a lot left to be desired about Amorim's attack on the basis of this showing.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim to MUTV:",
      "\"It was a pre-season game. The distances between the sectors were really big sometimes. We suffered a little bit when we tried to press high, they kicked the ball high and won the second balls. They were dangerous in those moments.",
      "\"We have a lack of pace. Especially in the middle of the park, you can feel it's hard to bring the ball. But we created chances. We have a lot to do, but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams. A good test.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team [Wolves]. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",
      "On Diego Leon's debut at left wing-back: \"We have to understand that the kid came from Paraguay. It's his second week at Manchester United. He did really well, he's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.",
      "\"The environment is really good. Of course sometimes we are going to struggle, but what I felt in the first moment is that if we are going to struggle, we will struggle together. That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",
      "\"We need to create that bond between everybody [on the United States tour] - not just between the players butthe staff. All the changes are stopping. We need to leave that as a group.",
      "\"We have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. We need to improve.\"",
      "Manchester United, it's almost like you never left.",
      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",
      "Obi taking the ball off Cunha's toes and Amorim admitting his relationship with Fernandes \"is not there yet\" meant it was a slow start in his new colours.",
      "And Hojlund's display showed more frustration - falling over the ball at one stage in the box and then getting in the way of a late Dorgu strike.",
      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
      "Amad Diallo also looked sharp at wing-back - which is important in the context of Mbeumo coming into the team.",
      "But United need a lot more than the Brentford man to improve this attacking set-up. There's still a need for a new striker, plus more clarity in midfield and out wide.",
      "There's now less than a month to go until United's Premier League opener with Arsenal. An awful lot still needs to change on the pitch if Amorim's project is going to take off.",
      "Leeds manager Daniel Farke has announced that Patrick Bamford is no longer in his plans for next season.",
      "Farke said on Bamford's future: \"I had an honest communication with him.",
      "\"For me, at this stage he needs to be the main man, he needs the backing, the arm around the shoulder after difficult years to rebuild his confidence.",
      "\"After the last two seasons, I wasn't willing to take him on right now as the main man in the Premier League.\"",

      "Man Utd made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, and have been pursuing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 12:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.",
      "Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, with agreement having now been reached over a £71 million deal for the Cameroon international.",
      "On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.",
      "But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson, Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko are the other situations United are monitoring.",
      "While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",

      "Juventus have begun to explore the conditions of a potential deal for Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford; Barcelona are keen, but have made no approach for the 27-year-old; Rashford is among five Man Utd players who can explore a potential move away",
      "Thursday 17 July 2025 12:32, UK",
      "Juventus have enquired about Manchester United's Marcus Rashford.",
      "The Italian giants have begun to explore the conditions of a potential deal for the forward amid uncertainty over the future of Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "Juve's priority at centre-forward has been the return of Randal Kolo Muani, but if Vlahovic leaves, the club may look to sign another striker and they have been asking for information about Rashford.",
      "Barcelona are also keen but have made no approach at this stage.",
      "The forward has returned to Carrington despite being offered extra time off and is training away from the first team, using the medical and rehab facilities.",
      "The 27-year-old is among five Man Utd players who can explore a potential move away after expressing a desire to leave.",
      "Matheus Cunha has taken the No 10 shirt from Rashford, who said he wanted a \"new challenge\" before joining Aston Villa for the second half of last season.",
      "There have been no official offers for Rashford after he returned from his loan at Villa.",
      "Juventus are pushing for Manchester United's Jadon Sancho.",
      "Talks are open between Juve, United and Sancho's representatives as the Italian club look to have both Sancho and Porto's Francisco Conceicao on the wings.",
      "Juventus are currently finalising a permanent deal for Conceicao, who was on loan there last season, worth almost £28m (€32m) and paid in four instalments.",
      "It is thought there would have to be departures at Juve to fund a move for Sancho, and both Timothy Weah and Nico Gonzalez could leave the club.",
      "Marseille are in talks to sign Weah, who turned down Nottingham Forest earlier in the summer, while Atletico Madrid and Inter are both interested in the Argentina international Gonzalez.",
      "Juve have been interested in Sancho throughout the summer window so far and United value him at £25m.",
      "Inter Milan have also been mentioned with Sancho in the last 24 hours, but only if they are unable to sign Ademola Lookman, while Napoli had been interested in earlier in the window.",
      "Teddy Sheringham does not believe Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford deserves to join Barcelona after what he feels has been a \"soul-destroying\" episode.",
      "\"If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you're there, you appreciate it,\" the ex-United player told Sky Bet. \"You don't throw it away and say you want to leave.",
      "\"I find the whole episode very soul-destroying, compared to the way I was back in the day and how I strove to get the privilege to play for such a huge football club.",
      "\"To hear someone talking the way he is talking, saying he wants out - I didn't like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doing that at Arsenal, I thought it was soul-destroying, and I hope Rashford doesn't get the move that he's hankering for.",
      "\"From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that's a step up that he hasn't deserved.\"",
