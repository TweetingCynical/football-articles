      "Micah Richards reckons that Ruben Amorim must sort out Manchester United's midfield woes - or risk losing his job - after Sunday's crushing 3-0 defeat at Manchester City. United were outclassed in devastating fashion at the Etihad Stadium, as Phil Foden put City ahead in the 18th minute before Erling Haaland struck twice in the second half to put the Red Devils to the sword.",
      "The defeat has cranked up the heat on Amorim, who has managed just eight victories from his 31 Premier League matches since taking over from Erik ten Hag as manager, last November. With four points from their opening four fixtures this season, United have endured their most dismal start to a Premier League campaign since 1992/93.",
      "They also suffered an astonishing Carabao Cup second round elimination to Grimsby Town, with the Red Devils crashing out 12-11 on spot-kicks after a 2-2 stalemate in regular time. Talk surrounding Amorim's future is intensifying and former City right-back Richards has provided the Portuguese boss with some crucial guidance to remedy United's troubles.",
      "\"From the studio, you have a bird's-eye view so you can see all the positions and, in the first minute, Haaland gets his chance. United grew into the game a little bit. A little bit of confidence.",
      "\"I remember saying after the United vs Arsenal game; 'I can see an improvement'. I actually thought, in aspects of the City game, Man Utd did good things. But what is crystal clear, in the middle of the park, they need more legs. I can see that, all the fans can see that, but the manager is sticking to his guns and I just don't understand it.",
      "\"Every manager should be able to adapt. You got Rodri, who actually in the first half, I didn't think he played too well, he gave the ball away too easily, but you have got legs with [Tijani] Reijnders and you got Foden playing off Haaland. You got [Jeremy] Doku coming into little pockets and you got Bernardo Silva.",
      "\"So, when you see them playing with [Benjamin] Sesko and [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Amad] Diallo, they're forward-thinking players, so they can give you what you need in terms of the start of the shape you're trying to do.",
      "\"They're thinking about getting the ball forward as fast as possible and doing what they do best. So, it works when the game's really tight but, as soon as the game opens up, you're asking forward players to do the midfield players' job. It just doesn't work.",
      "\"If I was playing in that back three, back five, whatever you want to call it, it's virtually impossible at times because Bruno [Fernandes' is their best player, playing as a No.6 - he doesn't track runners, but then the back three are not pushing up. They're getting overrun in midfield and then in behind, as well. It was just a disaster... Absolute disaster.",
      "\"They need to sort it out ASAP (as soon as possible) because if they carry on playing that way, they're not going to get any better.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim is fighting to retain the confidence of his Manchester United players following their derby debacle.",
      "United's 3-0 defeat at Manchester City piled the pressure on Amorim, with the Portuguese head coach fighting to save his job. It is understood some of United's senior players have been left frustrated and confused by Amorim's refusal to change his tactics and system.",
      "Amorim's rigid 3-4-3 formation and his refusal to adapt to any other set-up is said to have caused huge concern among key members of the squad. Some United players are said to feel Amorim is undermining them by repeatedly asking them to fit into a system they are not equipped to play.",
      "Pressure is mounting on Amorim to turn United around after their poor start to the season, which has seen them take four points from as many games. United sources insist \"nothing has changed\" in terms of their support for Amorim and that he retains the full backing of the club hierarchy.",
      "But United supporters were left stunned by their side's meek capitulation at the Etihad Stadium, with many feeling they got away lightly by only losing 3-0.",
      "United have won just one game this season – needing a 97th-minute penalty to beat newly-promoted Burnley – and crashed out of the EFL Cup to League Two Grimsby. After United finished 15th last season, their lowest place for half a century, Amorim needed a strong start to the new season but has failed miserably.",
      "He has won just eight of his 31 Premier League games in charge, while United's four point haul is their worst start to a season since 1992. Amorim has been backed in the transfer market this summer, with United spending almost £236million on strengthening his squad.",
      "But the new additions of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens have so far not had the expected impact, while Amorim is refusing to compromise on his style of play and formation.",
      "United legend Wayne Rooney claimed the team have got worse since Amorim replaced the Erik ten Hag 10 months ago. “It's hard to see how it continues,” Rooney told BBC Sport. “I don’t think anyone can understand and comprehend what's going on. Frankly, it's not good enough.",
      "\"I want to be as supportive and positive as I can be on the manager and the players. But it's very difficult to sit here and say we're seeing progression and at least we're seeing things that will get results in the near future.",

      "Manchester United are three times more likely to be relegated than they are to qualify for the Europa League - according to a supercomputer. The Red Devils have endured a horror start and four games in have been given a lofty 10.95 per cent chance of going down.",
      "Following defeat in the Manchester derby Ruben Amorim's side lie in 14th with four points from their first four games - their lowest total since 1992/93. It follows on from their worst ever Premier League season, which saw them finish 15th, and now even further depths are being discussed.",
      "Once a team who won league titles annually, over the past decade top-four has been the remit. But the stats at Opta have suggested that United has a 4.18 per cent chance for landing a Champions League spot and just a 0.18 per cent chance of winning the Premier League.",
      "Relegation would be scarcely believable for those at Old Trafford, especially after they yet again spent more than £200million this summer on the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. But those behind all the stats insist of all the major outcomes that could happen on the red side of Manchester relegation is more than twice as likely than any qualification for European football - which is a damning reflection of the club at present.",
      "Amorim is nearing his year anniversary in the job and he has shown no sign of taking the club forward. Even in his opening few months in charge, after a December that saw United lose five times, he was forced to admit that the Red Devils were in the midst of a relegation scrap.",
      "After a loss to Newcastle last term he confessed: \"That is really clear [United are being dragged into a relegation battle] so we have to fight. It is a really difficult moment for us, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty.\"",
      "United will not be addressing any potential relegation fears four games into the season, even if their only win of the season came courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes penalty in stoppage time against Burnley. The loss to Manchester City gives Amorim's record more of a grim reading - and he admits it is not good enough.",
      "\"I won't change my philosophy,\" said the Portuguese coach. \"If they [United hierarchy] want it changed, you change the man. I am not going to change my philosophy. I will play my way until I want to change. Guys, I understand [the questions] and I accept it is not a record you should have at Man United. But there are a lot of things that you have no idea about what happen in the last months.",

      "It was a scene reminiscent from Manchester derbies past. Phil Foden and Erling Haaland have so often been Manchester United's tormentors-in-chief on derby day, and they proved to be so yet again on Sunday as Manchester City swatted their rivals aside without ever really hitting top gear.",
      "Haaland has been an imperious force ever since he arrived on these shores in the summer of 2022, plundering goals at a remarkable rate. But even the Norwegian's outrageous returns have not been enough to maintain City's invincibility over the past 12 months, with Pep Guardiola's formerly unformidable side now mortal.",
      "City's malaise has coincided with a difficult period for Foden, the most influential figure in their title triumph in the 2023-24 campaign. The attacking midfielder was back in full flow, though, in a fixture he has revelled in down the years.",
      "And his seventh goal against Manchester United in as many games could turn out to be the most substantial yet if it acts as the prelude to a renaissance for the Manchester City academy graduate.",
      "If anyone knows that, it's Haaland. It was just 18 months ago that Foden was coronated as the Premier League's Player of the Season after driving City to a history-making fourth consecutive domestic crown. He struck up a formidable partnership with Haaland, who crowed about City's homegrown superstar after the derby. \"We need him so much,\" the striker stressed.",
      "The Foden we saw on Sunday was reminiscent of the diminutive magician that left the Premier League spellbound during City's march to four-in-a-row. When Foden is in full flight, few can match him. Even fewer can stop him, which is something Manchester United know only too well.",
      "Much has been made of how Liverpool and Arsenal have strengthened this summer while talk of City mounting a serious challenge to reclaim their crown has been subdued. But do any of their new recruits rival Foden in his pomp? If Haaland and City can continue to support Foden and coax more magic out of those boots then there's an argument that a revitalised Foden would surpass them all.",
      "“We cannot forget two seasons ago when we won the last game against West Ham. He was the key player to win the Premier League,” was the reminder from Guardiola as he waxed lyrical about Foden on Sunday.",
      "Injuries prevented him from stepping up to the mantle as City's new kingpin last season with Kevin de Bruyne abdicating the throne long before his exit was finally signed off.",
      "Foden has long been considered the natural heir to the Belgian maestro. And if that does come to pass in the coming months, then it will be far more significant than any signing Manchester City could make.",

      "Gary Lineker has expressed his concern over the treatment of Kobbie Mainoo at Manchester United - admitting he's \"baffled\" by the youngster's lack of playing time under Ruben Amorim. Despite impressing in his brief cameo during Sunday's defeat to Manchester City, Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League match so far this season and was once again named on the bench for the clash.",
      "The England international made an impact when he was brought on in the 62nd minute, recording a 100 per cent pass success rate from his 17 attempts. He also won all three of his duels and made one successful dribble.",
      "Following his performance, some United supporters have urged Amorim to give Mainoo a starting berth against Chelsea on Saturday as they seek out only their second victory of the campaign. The Stockport-born prodigy has played just 73 minutes of top-flight football this term, having been an unused sub against Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Ex-Leicester City and Tottenham star Lineker has now shared his thoughts on Mainoo's predicament, expressing worry about his inability to break into the United first-team. Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Lineker voiced his concerns: \"It really worries me the way Kobbie Mainoo has been kind of almost dismissed, he's such an incredible young talent, local boy as well doing really well.",
      "\"I mean, I thought when he came on, he did really quite well. I don't get it. I don't know whether there's something that we don't know about or something like that, but it's slightly baffling to me.\"",
      "United were soundly defeated at the Etihad Stadium, with Erling Haaland netting twice in the second half to seal the victory for City. That came after Phil Foden's 18th-minute opener.",
      "\"They just looked so poor,\" Lineker added on United. \"One thing I would say, and in a way he knows how he wants his team to play, he might not have the players, but the one thing I would say, if you constantly tell everybody you're going to continue playing the same way, does that not make your team very easy to plan against? So, City outnumbered them in midfield. They had too many bodies for them. They couldn't cope.\"",

Amorim arrived at Old Trafford last November and quickly implemented the 3-4-3 formation that had brought him huge success with Sporting CP.",
      "It has become apparent many of his United players cannot get to grips with his demands, whilst their personnel still doesn't suit certain roles. Nevertheless, the Portuguese boss has defiantly stuck by his beliefs.",
      "He's continued to state that if United want to play a different way, they will have to sack him because he will not change. He said: \"I understand and accept it is not a record you should have in Manchester United.",

      "His stance is likely to ring a chord with Conte, who delivered Premier League glory in 2017 with Chelsea in his first year. The Italian veered away from his 3-4-3 system in the opening weeks, but saw the Blues lose successive games before going back to his plan, which set them on a then record-equalling run of wins.",

      "Phil Foden’s header and two clinical finishes from Erling Haaland saw City ease to victory at the Etihad Stadium and claim the bragging rights. United were completely outplayed and couldn’t take some gilt-edged chances of their own to score a consolation goal.",
      "Pressure is ramping up on Amorim, who is coming up to a year in the job and has still not succeeded in stamping his identity on the team. United spent over £200million in the summer transfer window to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens but are not seeing the benefits yet.",
      "Those results are merely a continuation of last season’s form, when United finished 15th. Four points from four games makes it the club's worst start to the season since 1992/93 and Amorim is statistically the worst manager in the Premier League since he joined on November 24.",
      "Statisticians Opta have created a league table of the 17 clubs who have been in the division since then and United sit bottom with 31 points from 31 games. That is level with Tottenham, but Spurs have a goal difference of -4 to United’s -13, putting them rock bottom.",

      "Marcus Rashford has delivered a five-word message after experiencing his best moment in a Barcelona shirt since his season-long loan switch from Manchester United. The 27-year-old joined Barca during the summer but had suffered a challenging start to life in Catalonia, failing to notch a goal or provide an assist in his opening three outings.",
      "Nevertheless, Rashford rose to the occasion on Sunday, delivering a superb display during Barcelona's 6-0 thrashing of Valencia. After Fermin Lopez gave Barca the lead, Rashford crafted his side's second goal, delivering a sublime cross for former Leeds United forward Raphinha to convert at the far post.",
      "It was a delivery that United supporters had grown accustomed to witnessing from Rashford, who shone against Valencia before being substituted in the 68th minute. He managed 46 touches, fashioned three opportunities, attempted two efforts, completed four ball recoveries, earned one foul and achieved an 88 per cent pass completion rate.",
      "Lopez and Raphinha both secured braces on Sunday night while Robert Lewandoski came off the bench to score twice. \"From the beginning, we showed what we wanted to do, and that's what we've seen,\" Barca manager Hansi Flick told Movistar post-match.",
      "\"Not just Fermin, everyone has fought and had fun on the pitch.\"",
      "\"The team has been fantastic in every position. The three points are perfect, and for me it's great to have to choose between Ferran [Torres] and Lewandowski.\"",
      "Rashford's success with Barcelona came just hours after United suffered another defeat to rivals Manchester City. Ruben Amorim's difficult first 10 months in charge at Old Trafford continued with Phil Foden opening the scoring and Erling Haaland bagging a brace.",
      "The 3-0 result means United are experiencing their worst start to a season in 33 years. Since arriving at Old Trafford, Amorim has won just eight of his 31 Premier League games in charge.",
      "Barcelona are next in action when they travel to Newcastle United in the Champions League on Wednesday. Rashford will be hoping to continue his fine form against the Magpies with him having five goals and four assists against them.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville paid an emotional tribute to former boxing world champion Ricky Hatton. The 46-year-old was found dead at his home over the weekend.",
      "Following the news on Sunday, tributes from the world of both boxing and the wider sporting family poured in. There was a minute’s applause ahead of the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium, with both clubs putting the rivalry aside and showing their respects, with Hatton having been a big Manchester City fan.",
      "His beloved team ultimately won the game 3-0, and speaking after the derby, Neville took time to send his own touching tribute.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville podcast, he said: “The only smile you could possibly have is around Ricky Hatton, thinking that he’s somewhere watching this game and his beloved Manchester City have won this match.",
      "\"Because to me today, I feel sick in my stomach, from the moment this morning, late morning, when that news broke through, that’s the only thing really that’s taken my mind today.",
      "“Someone who is an unbelievable Mancunian, someone who carried Manchester all around the world, to America in massive fights, he lit up the city and the arenas of the city with his boxing, someone who went in and literally fought like everything hung on it every single time, a warrior.",
      "“When you talk about football players and do they care? You never doubted that about Ricky Hatton when he went into the ring.",
      "“I met him a number of times in my life, grounded, earthy, a family man, someone you’d say, ‘What a good lad.’ I remember two or three years ago it was our Christmas party, and Ricky turned up, he wasn’t invited.",
      "\"I remember having a drink with him, that was the sort of lad he was, whether you were blue or whether you were red, he cared about Manchester a lot and he cared about his country.",
      "“Today is a devastating day, when you think of the love that he had for this club and the support that he gave to this football club, he would have absolutely loved this afternoon, he’d have been out tonight in Manchester with his mates having a beer, having a laugh and to think that’s not going to happen again it’s heartbreaking it really is.”",
      "Neville added: “I’m a United fan, I wanted United to win, but the only potential sort of smile you could give that result is that Ricky would have enjoyed today. 46 years of age is no age and it will take quite a bit of time for the city to get over that news because he was a very, very popular man.",
      "“He was someone that United fans loved, someone that City fans loved, all Mancunians loved and he did an awful lot for the city. He was a champion, a champion in the ring and a champion out of the ring.”",
      "The news of Hatton’s death comes not long after it was announced that he was due to return to boxing.",
      "He was due to take part in an exhibition fight with United Arab Emirates’ Eisa Dah in December, and has recently posted updates on social media showing him preparing for the bout.",

      "At the end of derby day, Manchester was blue. And you could probably use the same word to describe Ruben Amorim as the Manchester United head coach reflects on another sobering afternoon in the Premier League.",
      "United were comprehensively beaten 3-0 by Manchester City at The Etihad courtesy of goals from Phil Foden and Erling Haaland, who scored twice to clinch the derby day bragging rights. It's a result which means United have made their worst start to a season in 33 years after collecting just four points from their opening four Premier League games.",
      "I find it amazing just how easy a ride Ruben Amorim has had at Manchester United. From fans, pundits, the press - everybody.",
      "Any of his predecessors would have been quite rightly out on their backsides by now. Jose Mourinho, Louis van Gaal, Erik ten Hag and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer were all moved on for less.",
      "Yes - he walked into a mess. A mess that shows no signs of abating behind the scenes. But even so, the tools at his disposal are better than a 15th-placed finish and better than we have seen so far this term. But for a last-gasp win over Burnley, United would be sat on two points and marooned in the bottom three, and frankly their performances show that's where they deserve to be.",
      "They will have to stick with a manager at some point, and I can see why they want it to be this one. But he should be put out of his misery and make way for the next man to take on what is quickly becoming the most poisoned chalice in English football.",
      "I've advocated for Manchester United sticking with Ruben Amorim previously and it's clear the issues at Old Trafford go beyond their head coach. But we're surely now fast approaching the point of no return with Amorim, if we're not already there.",
      "His record of eight wins from 31 Premier League games is absolutely ghastly. Yes, he was dealt a tough hand. But he's shown little to suggest that he is, in fact, the right man to take Manchester United back to where they belong and is absolutely killing himself with his refusal to deviate from his preferred system.",
      "United will probably back him for now and part of me thinks that stance is admirable. And fans deserve credit for sticking with him. But the fact of the matter is Amorim and United are simply not working and the latter needs to make a change sooner rather than later.",
      "United are backing Amorim and they have to after the disaster around Erik ten Hag. After backing him in the summer, it would be rash to act now, but something has to change from within.",
      "Amorim did well, I thought, to play down talk that the system is the problem. When it works, it is difficult to break down and provides a threat good enough to beat teams. The problem he has is he is selecting individuals who either don’t fit the roles being asked of them or just aren’t up to scratch. The obvious one of using Bruno Fernandes deeper and keeping Kobbie Mainoo out.",
      "Amorim has to find a solution before he’s sacked. One of them could be a change in personnel. Putting Mainoo in midfield and pushing Fernandes into one of the No.10s with Bryan Mbeumo or Matheus Cunha playing through the middle would provide more security that could be key in the turnaround.",
      "If he continues to play Fernandes out of position and leave his defence exposed by the lack of midfield, he could be made to pay for it. After Chelsea, they have Brentford and Sunderland, two games they should be earning wins in.",
      "I think United should sack Ruben Amorim now and give a potential new manager the best chance of saving their season. The Reds have been dire so far and I don't think it's going to get better anytime soon.",
      "Yes, United have signed and offloaded players to suit Amorim and his 3-4-2-1 system, but do I believe that someone else can get more from that group of players? I definitely think so.",
      "For example, Kobbie Mainoo SHOULD be in that starting XI, it's as simple as that. A midfield three of him, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte need to be the base for the Reds going forward, if they want to be successful from now until the end of the campaign. Unfortunately, Amorim will not do that.",
      "I would bring back Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and look to get the feel-good factor back to Old Trafford for the rest of the season and next summer look to bring Oliver Glasner to Manchester.",
      "Since moving to United from Sporting last season, I think it’s fair to say that Amorim has not had the impact that the club would have hoped. Last season, he had the excuse that the squad wasn’t his own, and he was working with a group of players low on confidence after a poor start to the season.",
      "But he has been backed by United in the summer window. A total spend of around £200 million has seen the arrivals of the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. It’s because of that, I feel that Amorim should be given more time. Sacking a manager just a matter of weeks after spending that money in the transfer window feels like taking another major step back.",
      "It does feel like Amorim needs to be a bit less stubborn to change United’s fortunes, but if he can successfully bed in the new signings, it could help him to turn the season around. However, If things don’t change around Christmas, then that’s when the club may have to take another look before the January window.",
      "Square peg, meet round hole. That's what Ruben Amorim's Manchester United have looked like for much of the past 10 months.",
      "The Portuguese has comfortably been United's worst permanent manager of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. But he's probably been dealt the toughest hand.",
      "I'm torn over whether I think he'll be a success. On one hand, I admire his disciplined approach when it comes to the likes of Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, which suggests to me there's more to the Kobbie Mainoo problem. You can't be leaving a player of his quality out of a dysfunctional midfield without good reason.",
      "But his system isn't working. It's the kind that can function when you have the league's best players (like at Sporting Lisbon) but not with such stern competition as the Premier League. Right now, I'd stick with him, hoping he can change and stop United from throwing away another season.",
      "In season nine of The Simpsons, Krusty the Clown’s announcement that he is quitting showbusiness is met with a question of ‘Why now? Why not 20 years ago?’.",
      "Just say, for one second, that Manchester United decide to cut ties with Ruben Amorim after losing 3-0 to Manchester City. What’s special about this reverse to give it final straw status?",
      "You’d like to think United knew what the deal was when they chose to appoint Amorim in November last year. The hire was meant to be a move away from an overnight fix and towards more of a project, similar to Arsenal’s move from Unai Emery to Mikel Arteta. This isn’t a Jose Mourinho or an Antonio Conte, someone who teams turn to when they aggressively target instant results at the expense of longer-term stability. Equally, though, that doesn’t mean Amorim should be considered safe no matter what.",
      "Even during the low moments in the league, there was progress in Europe last term. Now, after that early Carabao Cup exit, there’s nowhere to hide. Losing to an expensively-assembled City side, still just 16 months out from a title win, isn’t the result which should spell the end for Amorim. There was an argument for it last season, even if it’s one you might not agree with, while there may well be further arguments in the coming weeks. But why now?",
      "Ruben Amorim currently retains the support of the Manchester United hierarchy despite the club's worst start to a season in 33 years. However, one thing is for certain: what is happening on the pitch can not go on.United are a mess. And it looks like it is going to be another tough season for them already; any hope of getting back into Europe, let alone the Champions League, already appears gone. The 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday leaves Amorim with a horrendous record of eight wins from 31 Premier League games. That is not good enough for any club in the top-flight, let alone United.For me, I feel like Amorim has the next three games to save his job. If United can’t pick up at least seven points against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland, then Amorim could be sacked at the start of the October international break.There is no ideal time to sack your manager during the season, but if you are going to do it, then doing it at the start of an international break is probably the best time.",
      "Manchester United have proven in the past that sacking managers left, right and centre doesn't get them anywhere. While the outlook now is gloomy, there is a cycle that the club seems to follow when things aren't going well. If they sack Ruben Amorim now, then all the current players are signings of his or disgruntled stars who have fallen out of favour with the Portuguese boss.",
      "It will take until the next transfer window in January for a new manager to get any sort of rhythm out of a team that is not is, and implement yet another style that the players aren't used to. Then, this new boss will bring in some of his own transfers and boot out others who have yet to showcase their full potential under any management.",
      "This cycle will repeat until the club realises that it is taking one step forward and three steps back. Therefore, it is in the club's best interests in the long run to stick with Amorim for longer than a year to give him half a chance of getting the team into a consistent form.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo made a swift impact for Manchester United in their defeat against rivals Manchester City. The midfielder earned plaudits from fans with a tenacious tackle just moments after coming on.",
      "The Red Devils faced a challenging journey to the Etihad on Sunday and found themselves trailing 1-0 within 18 minutes, courtesy of a Phil Foden header following a dazzling run by Jeremy Doku. The score remained unchanged until half-time, but just eight minutes into the second half, Erling Haaland confidently doubled City's lead.",
      "In response, Ruben Amorim called upon his bench, introducing young midfielder Mainoo, whose loan request over the summer was turned down by the Portuguese manager. Despite expressing his wish to leave Old Trafford, the 20-year-old demonstrated an immediate grit upon entering the pitch that impressed supporters.",
      "Mainoo joined the action 62 minutes into the game, and within seconds, United had won a corner. However, they lost possession from the set-piece, and City began to launch a lethal counter-attack.",
      "Despite only starting one match this season, United's Carabao Cup loss on penalties to Grimsby Town, and making a brief appearance during the 3-2 victory over Burnley in the Premier League, fans are clamouring for more of young talent Mainoo.",
      "One supporter was quick to praise his performance against City, stating: \"Mainoo on the pitch for 20 seconds and already made a successful tackle!\" Another fan echoed these sentiments, adding: \"Immediately Mainoo wins the ball before City can transition!\"",
      "A third fan criticised head coach Amorim, writing: \"Mainoo has been on for six seconds and already making an impact. At this point, this manager is the worst.\"",
      "Meanwhile, another supporter chimed in: \"Mainoo is in and already intercepting passes. Proper centre-mid.\" A fifth continued: \"Kobbie 'can't defend' Mainoo with a tackle to prevent a counter already. But he 'can't run' like [Manuel] Ugarte.\"",
      "However, United's manager remained resolute after the defeat, insisting that he would not alter his footballing philosophy despite a disappointing start to the season.",
      "\"The performance was not good,\" began Amorim. \"I'm trying to be rational. I see the record. I understand the frustration and I understand the decisions that come with that. I take the critics. That's it.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.",

      "During Manchester United's summer tour of the US, Ruben Amorim admitted he had used up any credit he had in the bank last season.",
      "Despite leading United to 15th place, their worst Premier League finish, and losing the Europa League final to miss out on Europe, Amorim retained the backing of the United hierarchy and the club's fans.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim knew he could not afford a poor start to this season. But four points from four games and a chastening 3-0 defeat at Manchester City in Sunday's derby has added credence to the growing belief that Amorim's time at United may soon be up.",
      "Amorim, who refuses to change his controversial 3-4-3 system, despite the failure of his players to adapt to it, has won just eight of his 31 Premier League games since taking over from Erik ten Hag 10 months ago.",
      "On that evidence alone, his appointment has been an unmitigated disaster, with the continued backing from those in charge at United now looking like it is founded in hope, rather than any firm expectation that the Portuguese head coach will, in time, turn the situation around.",
      "We have been here before, of course, with United's current football leadership team publicly backing a manager, only to renege on that stance and sack him weeks later. A year ago, chief executive Omar Berrada gave Ten Hag his unequivocal backing in the Old Trafford boardroom, hours before United hosted arch rivals Liverpool in the league.",
      "United were humiliated 3-0 by Arne Slot's side that day and Ten Hag was gone less than eight weeks later, proving Berrada's verbal backing was worthless while the team continued to regress, just as they are doing under Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese head coach insists United are getting better, but there was no evidence of that in their meek capitulation at City on Sunday. Up next for Amorim and his players are world champions Chelsea, who will travel to the Theatre of Dreams on Saturday smelling blood.",
      "How much longer the United hierarchy are willing to stick with Amorim, when the team's performances and results show no sign of progress, only they know. Berrada's problem is that he drove the appointment of Amorim to such an extent that to have to sack him would represent a humiliating personal failing and raise legitimate questions about his judgment going forward.",
      "But with every lame, error-strewn performance and lamentable result, the prospect of Amorim emerging from this current crisis, to lead United back to the top, seems increasingly fanciful, with match-going fans who once backed him irrevocably now starting to have serious doubts.",
      "After Chelsea, United travel to Brentford and then host Sunderland, before the next international break, their first game back after that a trip to Liverpool, to face the champions, who have taken maximum points this season and already look on course to win a 21 st title to usurp their fiercest rivals as England's most successful club.",
      "Whether Amorim is in the Anfield dugout on October 19 depends on how United fare in their next three games before the international break, traditionally a time for struggling clubs to take stock and change their manager if they feel a new voice is needed in the dressing-room and on the training pitch.",
      "Amorim, who twice offered to quit last season, knows he is in trouble and that only an immediate upturn in performances and results will spare him from the same fate suffered by his United predecessors, none of whom could survive managing in the shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson in what continues to be the impossible job.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim set himself a two-year ultimatum to prove he is the right man for the job when he took over from Erik ten Hag. The Portuguese finds himself under pressure less than a year in, having taken just 31 points from 31 games.",
      "On Sunday, Amorim's United underwhelmed in a 3-0 defeat away to Manchester City. Questions continue to be asked about the former Sporting CP boss, and his comments from the week he took charge have now come back into focus.",
      "“In two years you will understand if I am the right man to be in this process,\" Amorim said in November 2024. “In two years you can understand if you want to continue on this path or you want to change.",
      "He urged patience at the time, adding: \"I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it's a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try to win the title.",
      "\"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take,\" he said, and at the time was some weeks out from his first transfer window at the helm.",
      "There were some positives in Amorim's first season, not least the run to the final of the Europa League. United fell short in Bilbao, though, meaning they have to do without European football this term.",
      "He has been backed in the transfer market, adding £200million worth of attacking talent in the form of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, after defeat at the Etihad Stadium left his side with four points from four games, he insisted he won't move away from his principles and recognised the final say on United's managerial situation isn't down to him and told the higher-ups that - if they want to change the style of play - they'll also need to appoint a new manager.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man,\" Amorim said. \"We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim retains the support of the club hierarchy despite overseeing the worst start to a season in 33 years.",
      "United were beaten 3-0 by neighbours Manchester City on Sunday leaving Amorim's side with four points from their opening four games. The 40-year-old has overseen a record of just eight wins from 31 Premier League games since taking charge in November 2024.",
      "Sixteen of those matches have ended in defeat while United splashed our more than £225million over the summer but have won just one of their opening four league games, scoring just once from open play in six hours.",
      "United were also knocked out of the League Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town earlier this month and a source close to Amorim admits it is \"incredible\" that his position is not under genuine threat.",
      "Amorim reiterated in the wake of the derby defeat that he would not change his 3-4-2-1 system, saying that if United wanted to alter their formation they would have to change the manager.",
      "\"Guys, I understand that and I accept,\" Amorim said of his league record. \"It is not a record you should have in Manchester United. There are a lot of things - you have no idea what happened during these months - but I accept that. I am not going to change.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.",

      "The loss leaves United 14th in the Premier League with just four points from four games and confirmed their worst start to a season since 1992/93. It also means Amorim has managed just eight wins from his first 31 league games in charge.",
      "Questions were asked immediately after the full-time whistle at the Etihad about Amorim's future. And there continues to be raised eyebrows at the use of Bruno Fernandes in the middle of the park while Mainoo struggles for minutes.",
      "Amorim has persisted with using his captain as a deep-lying playmaker alongside another central midfielder.",
      "Many have called for Mainoo to start but the United boss has insisted the England international is competing with Fernandes for one of the spots in midfield.",
      "Mainoo, who is yet to start a Premier League match this season, came on in the 62nd minute and delivered an impressive cameo.",
      "Ex-United midfielder Hargreaves has made clear he believes Amorim must find a way to fit Mainoo into his struggling team.",
      "\"Where do you start? There are a lot of issues,\" Hargreaves told Premier League Productions. \"How Kobbie Mainoo doesn't play in this team I'll never know.",
      "\"He came on for that game and in half hour he was probably their best player, by a country mile. So first of all he's got to play. [Benjamin] Sesko is not ready. He scored lots of goals in Germany but he didn't look ready today.",

      "Andre Onana endured a mixed debut with Trabzonspor after failing to cover himself in glory during the decisive moment in their 1-0 defeat to bitter rivals Fenerbahce on Sunday.",
      "The Cameroon star, 29, finalised his loan move to Trabzonspor last week after being given the green light to leave Manchester United for the season. He departed Old Trafford having fallen behind Altay Bayindir in the pecking order following another erratic season in goal with Senne Lammens also brought in from Royal Antwerp on deadline day to bolster Ruben Amorim's ranks.",
      "Onana was subsequently thrust straight into the action for his new team this weekend as they travelled to Fenerbahce in a big Turkish Super Lig clash. And while his overall display earned positive reviews, the 'keeper could have done better with Youssef En-Nesyr's winning goal.",
      "Onana thwarted former Manchester United midfielder, Fred, in the build-up to the goal but could only push the ball straight back into danger, where En-Nesyr was waiting to take full advantage. Trabzonspor played the majority of the game with 10 men after Okay Yokuslu was sent off after just 20 minutes with Onana making no less than eight saves to keep the score respectable, though.",
      "The hope is that Onana will rediscover his best form in Turkey after a challenging three years in the Premier League with United. And Cameroon coach, Carlos Kameni, reckons Onana will silence his critics and could even earn a big move off the back of a positive season with Trabzonspor.",
      "“It’s a good choice [to join Trabzonspor]. Andre was struggling at Manchester United,” he said to Africa Foot. “Last season, he was heavily criticised, and since the start of the season, he’d barely played and everyone, including him, understood that he was likely to spend a lot of time on the bench or in the stands.",
      "“I told him he was right. It’s a good choice. It’s better to be a starter at a very good club in a good league than a substitute at a big club in a big league, right?",
      "“In Turkey, he’ll certainly be watched, because he’s a very good goalkeeper, but I think he’ll be under a little less pressure than at Manchester United.”",
      "When he was asked if Onana would soon be back with a top European side, Kameni added: “Yes. He hasn’t lost his qualities at Manchester United. As can happen to all great athletes, he may experience a more complicated spell for a few months. Andre Onana is very professional, he remains a reliable player, and if he has a good season in Turkey, he’ll be in demand next summer.”",

      "Guardiola won his first Old Trafford derby against United in 2016 before leading his team to a goalless draw in the reverse fixture. They had won 14 of their first 15 games when they returned to the home of their neighbours in December 2017, when Nicolas Otamendi's winner secured them all three points.",
      "After the game, United boss Jose Mourinho felt City went too far with their celebrations. He exchanged words with City keeper Ederson, while the fallout from the game saw a fracas involving players and staff, with Mourinho having milk thrown at him and Mikel Arteta, at the time part of Guardiola's coaching staff at City, getting cut by a drinks container.",
      "In total, up to 20 players and staff were reportedly involved in the post-match fight. Arteta was seen bleeding, and covered his face when snapped arriving at City training the day after the game.",
      "The noise made during the City celebrations had clearly angered Mourinho. An apology did arrive from Guardiola, even if he didn't appear to feel his charges were in the wrong.",
      "\"We have to enjoy those moments. If the people cannot understand that then I'm sorry. We won a derby,\" Guardiola said, explaining he apologised if his squad's behaviour offended United as a whole rather than Mourinho or any other person individually.",
      "\"If we were not correct than I apologise to all of Manchester United. Our intentions was not that. It was to celebrate inside the locker room.\"",
      "Speaking two days after the game, Mourinho argued the derby discussion took away from United's following fixture against Bournemouth. \"He says, he says,\" the Portuguese said of Guardiola.",
      "\"I'm not here to comment on his words. The only thing I can say is that for me [it] was just a question of diversity, diversity in behaviours, diversity in education, just that and nothing more than that.",
      "\"This press conference is pre-Bournemouth, it's not post-Manchester City, that was already done, and this press conference is pre-Bournemouth. I know but I keep saying this is pre-Bournemouth.\"",
      "On the pitch, City's win took them 11 points clear of their rivals before the turn of the year. They won their next three league games as well, scoring 12 goals in the process, and ended the season with a Premier League record 100 points.",
      "They lost just once at home all season, but that was against Mourinho's United in April when the visitors came back from 2-0 down to claim all three points. City made no mistake the following season, though, winning home and away in what would prove to be Mourinho's final season as United boss.",

      "Schmeichel admits he'd held discussions with Donnarumma in the past and told him to head to the red side of Manchester – only to see him turn to the blue half.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim defended his decision to play Bruno Fernandes in central midfield for the fourth game running at Manchester City.",
      "United lost 3-0 at the Etihad to leave them with four points from their first four Premier League games, their worst start to a season since 1992-93.",
      "Fernandes has dropped back into midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who had occupied the two playmaker roles before Cunha suffered an injury against Burnley two weeks ago.",
      "Amorim picked Amad alongside Mbeumo behind Benjamin Sesko while Fernandes was partnered by Manuel Ugarte, having started alongside Casemiro in the previous three league outings.",
      "United only have three out-and-out central midfielders in Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, with the latter yet to start in the league this term.",
      "\"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",
      "\"I am trying to do different things, trying to imagine the game. And then when you don't win, it doesn't work, you take the critics. But that's it.\"",

      "Erling Haaland scored early in the second half and then added another with just over 20 minutes remaining to take the game away from United.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Bayindir's confidence is shattered",
      "Altay Bayindir wanted the ground to swallow him up when he conceded the third goal. Haaland finished with ease to net his second of the game and a desolate Bayindir stared at the turf.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted on the halfway line trying to get Bayindir's attention. Mbeumo was screaming at his goalkeeper, trying to tell him to keep his head up, and he eventually got the message across.",
      "Ruben Amorim confirmed at his pre-match press conference that Bayindir would start, despite making mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. That backfired because Bayindir was shaky from the first whistle.",
      "He was a bundle of nerves and went down to the ground far too easily for Haaland's first goal. Mbeumo sensed he was low on confidence after conceding City's third and tried to encourage him.",
      "It feels like only a matter of time before Senne Lammens is the first choice goalkeeper.",
      "City fans do the Poznan",
      "City fans brought out The Poznan after going three goals ahead. The fans in front of the press box turned around in glee to face journalists and the dance spread around the entire lower tier.",
      "United only trailed by a goal at the interval and could have found a way back into the contest, but they capitulated in the space of 15 minutes and a lot of fans in the away section started to leave early.",
      "Amorim has overseen some humiliating defeats and a 3-0 loss to City will be added to the catalogue.",
      "The terrace exchange",
      "Former City director of football Txiki Begiristain was shown on the big screen. He received warm applause from the home support, but United fans responded: \"You cheating b*******, you know what you are.\"",
      "There was another rendition of the chant just minutes into the contest, but City fans fired back after taking the lead through Foden, singing their own version of the Amorim chant.",
      "\"Crying from the Stretford End... He'll turn the Reds around,\" they taunted before reverting to \"Old Trafford is falling down, Amorim is a f****** clown. Glazers staying 10 more years\".",
      "There was a debate on a radio station about whether United and City are still proper rivals, but you only need to listen to matchgoing fans to know that was a stupid suggestion.",
      "United fans who work with City supporters will dread going to work this morning.",
      "United need more leaders",
      "Noussair Mazraoui went down with an injury just outside the City box at the start of the second half and Doku approached him to gesture that he was exaggerating the extent of the issue.",
      "City fans whistled at Mazraoui while he took his time to get back to his feet. Leny Yoro began to make his way over, seemingly looking to protect his colleague from Doku's rant.",
      "Yoro was the only United player to offer protection to Mazraoui. The dressing room needs more characters like Yoro.",
      "The midfield is a problem",
      "The decision to start Ugarte raised eyebrows. The midfielder had been hooked at half-time against Grimsby Town after failing to track back for their first goal and was an unused substitute against Burnley.",
      "Amorim was expected to continue with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but he handed another chance to Ugarte because he felt the 24-year-old's pressing ability and energy would be valuable.",
      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",
      "The midfield is a problem for Amorim, but United didn't believe that area was a priority in the summer.",
      "Beautiful tribute for Hatton",
      "The death of legendary boxer Ricky Hatton was announced on Sunday morning. Hatton was a lifelong City supporter and was expected to attend Sunday's derby.",
      "There was a minute's applause held for Hatton prior to the game and the players wore black armbands. Both sets of fans joined in with the tribute and chanted together: \"There's only one Ricky Hatton.\"",
      "Hatton was a proper Mancunian icon and it was heartwarming to hear City and United fans sing his name together.",

      "Micah Richards has claimed that Ruben Amorim must fix Manchester United's midfield if he wants to keep his job, following Sunday's thumping 3-0 loss at Manchester City.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football, Richards said: \"That’s exactly right, and that's what I've been saying on Sky after the game. From the studio, you have a bird's eye view so you can see all the positions, and in the first minute, Haaland gets his chance. United grew into the game a little bit. A little bit of confidence.",
      "\"I remember saying after the United vs Arsenal game, 'I can see an improvement'. I actually thought, in aspects of the game today, Man United did good things. But what is crystal clear, in the middle of the park, they need more legs. I can see that, all the fans can see that, but the manager is sticking to his guns and I just don't understand it.",
      "\"Every manager should be able to adapt. You got Rodri, who actually in the first half, I didn't think he played too well, he gave the ball away too easily, but you got legs with [Tijani] Reijnders and you got Foden playing off Haaland. You got [Jeremy] Doku coming into little pockets and you got Bernardo Silva.",
      "\"So, when you see them playing with [Benjamin] Sesko and [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Amad] Diallo, they’re forward-thinking players, so they can give you what you need in terms of the start of the shape you’re trying to do.\"",

      "Speaking to Racing Tipster, Hamman said: \"I think Ruben Amorim has got to turn things around quickly. There was a case to be made last season to change the manager in the summer, but they decided against it. They spent money again, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko. At some stage, you want to see improvement.",

      "\"In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton. For me, he stabilised the club, at least he's going to put structure in there.",
      "\"Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have. I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, 'he said Sean Dyche', no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.\"",

      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Shearer delivered his verdict on Sesko and expressed his concern about how United used him. \"I look at Sesko, because I've obviously been in that position, and he had that one shot very early on in the game,\" Newcastle legend Shearer said.",
      "\"Other than that, he must be thinking, 'Any danger? Any chance of giving me something here?' Something to go after, some crosses.\"",
      "Ex-Leicester City and Tottenham forward Lineker added: \"He was absolutely starved of any real service. He went through once where he broke the offside trap and the keeper blocked his shot.",
      "\"But he does look quick for a big guy, and I watched him specifically for a lot of the game – as much as you can when you’re watching TV rather than being at the game – and his movement, he's making darting runs, but I felt for him a little bit. It's tough when you're not getting any service.\"",

      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Lineker said: \"It really worries me the way Kobbie Mainoo has been kind of almost dismissed. He’s such an incredible young talent, local boy as well doing really well.",

      "\"Therefore, we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance,\" Hurzeler continued. \"But he's a young player and I think that's something we have to accept, that young players don't always have the face we want to see.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim must show improvement or he will be sacked by Manchester United before Christmas, according to former Manchester City and Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann.",
      "With four points from their opening four matches, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also suffered a humiliating Carabao Cup second round exit to League Two side Grimsby Town, with the Reds losing 12-11 on penalties following a 2-2 draw after normal time.",
      "It comes after United recorded their joint-worst Premier League finish (15th) with their lowest-ever points tally (42) and most defeats (15) since the competition began 33 years ago.",
      "During his time at United - after replacing Erik ten Hag as United's new head coach in November 2023 - Amorim's record is miserable. Indeed, Amorim has won just eight of his 31 top-flight matches in charge.",
      "While his overall record is inflated due to United's Europa League record last season, he still has just a 36 per cent win rate from his 47 games at the helm, drawing 12 and losing 18 of them.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Hamann, meanwhile, believes that United's stance on Amorim will change if results do not improve in the near future. In fact, Hamann has claimed that the former Sporting CP manager may be out by Christmas if he fails to turn United's fortunes around.",
      "Speaking to Racing Tipster, Hamman said: \"I think Ruben Amorim has got to turn things around quickly. There was a case to be made last season to change the manager in the summer, but they decided against it. They spent money again, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko. At some stage, you want to see improvement.",
      "\"So far, it hasn't happened. If it doesn't happen by Christmas, I'm not too sure whether he'll still be in charge.\"",
      "City ran out comfortable winners in the end at the Etihad Stadium, with Phil Foden opening the scoring in the 18th minute before Erling Haaland fired in a second-half brace to finish the Reds off.",
      "Delivering his verdict on the game and his Premier League record since taking charge at United, Amorim said post-match: \"It's not a record that you should have in Manchester United.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. But I'm not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change.",
      "\"If not, you have to change the man. So, we'll talk about that every game, every game that we lose. 'I don't believe in that, in the system', or whatever. So, I play my way and I'm going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"If you look at the goals, we can avoid that kind of goals. With [Jeremy] Doku, we have almost everyone behind the ball, and we could be more aggressive.",
      "\"The second goal, in the moment of the game that we are pressing City, we suffer a goal from the throw-in. When we want to recover the ball, instead of covering the space and then [going] to win the ball, we let two players of City [go] one against one. The approach that we had in that play, we can avoid, and we can close our goal.",
      "\"And then the third goal, [Erling] Haaland has all the space, confusion with our players, and then he has all the space to play. So, in these moments, I felt that if you look at the goals, those moments, we could avoid.",
      "\"And that is the key of the games, to take advantage of these moments and they took it, in transitions. In those moments, they were better than us.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes is Manchester United's best player and Ruben Amorim isn't getting the best out of him.",
      "Fernandes has been permanently deployed in the deeper midfield role this season and has struggled with the position's intricacies, which is a problem that must be addressed.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Luke Shaw were both culpable for Manchester City's opening goal on Sunday, allowing Jeremy Doku to burst into the box, but Phil Foden was unmarked and Fernandes failed to track his man.",
      "Fernandes looked at the 'danger' when the real threat was behind him. He glanced at Foden for a moment before turning away, which provided the City midfielder with a chance to break free into the box.",
      "The same thing happened against Fulham at Craven Cottage. Fulham's equaliser could have been prevented in the build-up, but Fernandes was closest to Emile Smith Rowe and lost his man.",
      "Speaking after the City defeat, Amorim was pressed on his decision to play Fernandes in the pivot and said: \"Guys, I understand how football is. The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team?",
      "\"Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",
      "\"I am trying to do different things, trying to imagine the game. And then when you don't win, it doesn't work, you take the critics. But that's it.\"",
      "Amorim is asking Fernandes to operate in a role that doesn't play to his strengths and he is struggling with the nuances of the position, particularly the defensive aspects.",
      "United's head coach was right to suggest Fernandes had a decent game against Arsenal, but United still lost that match and his subsequent displays have been below his high standards.",
      "The problem is there isn't a perfect position for Fernandes in Amorim's system. Fernandes is a central playmaker and the No.10 roles in Amorim's formation have slightly different demands. The deeper midfield role requires Fernandes to track runners, which isn't something he is comfortable with.",
      "However, the evidence this season suggests United would be better off with Fernandes higher up the pitch, albeit he would have to rotate with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Fernandes' work ethic, ability to win possession and eye for a pass mean that he can play in the deeper midfield role, but he can't produce his best performances when he operates there.",
      "Amorim raised eyebrows when he said Kobbie Mainoo is competing with Fernandes for a starting role in the team. Fernandes has started every Premier League this season game in that role, despite making a poor start to the campaign.",
      "The midfield is a big issue. When the transfer window closed, club sources said strengthening the midfield was never a priority due to the versatile and strong options in the squad.",
      "United are four games into the Premier League season and overlooking the midfield as a priority already feels like a mistake. However, Amorim must make do and get the best out of the players he has.",
      "Relocating Fernandes to a more prominent midfield position is probably a good place to start.",

      "Defeat for United has increased the pressure on Amorim, who has won just eight of his 31 Premier League games since replacing Erik ten Hag as head coach last November.",

They also suffered a humiliating Carabao Cup second round exit to Grimsby Town, with the Reds losing 12-11 on penalties following a 2-2 draw after normal time.",
      "Speculation regarding Amorim's future is rising and ex-City right-back Richards has offered the Portuguese a word of advice to sort United's woes out. Indeed, Richards believes that Amorim must fix his midfield.",
      "\"I remember saying after the United vs Arsenal game; 'I can see an improvement'. I actually thought, in aspects of the City game, Man Utd did good things. But what is crystal clear, in the middle of the park, they need more legs. I can see that, all the fans can see that, but the manager is sticking to his guns and I just don't understand it.",
      "\"Every manager should be able to adapt. You got Rodri, who actually in the first half, I didn't think he played too well, he gave the ball away too easily, but you have got legs with [Tijani] Reijnders and you got Foden playing off Haaland. You got [Jeremy] Doku coming into little pockets and you got Bernardo Silva.",
      "\"So, when you see them playing with [Benjamin] Sesko and [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Amad] Diallo, they're forward-thinking players, so they can give you what you need in terms of the start of the shape you're trying to do.",
      "\"They're thinking about getting the ball forward as fast as possible and doing what they do best. So, it works when the game's really tight but, as soon as the game opens up, you're asking forward players to do the midfield players' job. It just doesn't work.",
      "\"If I was playing in that back three, back five, whatever you want to call it, it's virtually impossible at times because Bruno [Fernandes' is their best player, playing as a No.6 - he doesn't track runners, but then the back three are not pushing up. They're getting overrun in midfield and then in behind, as well. It was just a disaster... Absolute disaster.",
      "\"They need to sort it out ASAP (as soon as possible) because if they carry on playing that way, they're not going to get any better.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Questions are being raised about the former Sporting CP boss, and his remarks from his first week in charge have resurfaced. \"In two years you will understand if I am the right man to be in this process,\" Amorim stated in November 2024. \"In two years you can understand if you want to continue on this path or you want to change.\"",
      "At the time, he called for patience, saying: \"I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it's a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try to win the title. We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don't know how long it will take,\" he said.",

      "Nevertheless, following the setback at the Etihad Stadium that left his team with just four points from four matches this term, he maintained he wouldn't abandon his core beliefs.",

      "My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest (on whether United change manager). Until I am here, I will do my best. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.\"",

Haaland ended the game as a contest midway through the second half as he raced clear of the United defence and slotted home.",
      "Here are how the players rated at the Etihad Stadium:",

      "Leny Yoro",
      "More than kept up with Doku, who switched sides to create the opening goal. Came off for Harry Maguire to improve United's goal threat. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Battled competitively with Haaland until the Norwegian got between De Ligt and Luke Shaw to make it 2-0. A dodgy pass almost resulted in a goal. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Did okay in the first half but was made to look like the auxiliary centre back that he is when Haaland bulldozed past him. Sloppy for the third goal, too. 4",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "A confident return on his first start since the Europa League final until he was found to be off the pace for the second goal. Substituted just after the hour. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "A striking recall yet Ugarte was United's best player in the first half and operated at a level that was the polar opposite of his 45 minutes at Grimsby. Unable to halt City's second-half charge. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Guilty of failing to track the runner for another goal that United conceded three weeks after Emile Smith Rowe evaded him at Fulham. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Could have intercepted the switch of play which eventually led to Foden's goal. Had chances to service Sesko but his crossing was abject. 4",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Had plenty of the ball without having any impact in the first half before he was denied by a great save by Gianluigi Donnarumma. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Played on the left of the two No.10s for probably the first time and miscued a volley. Nowhere near as influential as he was here last season. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Asked an early question of Donnarumma and had United's only attempts at goal in the first half. Quieter in the second half. 6",
      "Subs",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Came on essentially to improve United's goal threat. 5",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "No impact. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Same as Mainoo. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Replaced Ugarte to provide balance and missed a good chance. 5",
      "Manager",
      "Ugarte's improved performance rendered Mainoo's absence from the starting XI moot but Shaw and Fernandes in unfamiliar roles led to goals. 5",

      "“This was before the takeover - Man City weren’t what they are now - and for him to take the time and effort, multiple times with beers with him just talking about football and life, he was a deep person.",
      "“Very deep. He overthought a lot of things and the news is just devastating. It’s ruined my mood for the whole day. He’d be here today celebrating.",
      "“He’s had a box here many times. To get this news now feels surreal. For someone so young for it to happen now, it’s devastating.”",

      "A new screen is already in place in the south-east corner of the stadium that will mainly be to the benefit of those in the north stand, while there have also been improvements to the concourses.",
      "Work on the North Stand is expected to be completed in early 2026, with the hotel and other aspects of the £300m renovation expected to be completed at the end of that year.",
      "The result will be a capacity of more than 60,000 at the Etihad while there will also be a new fanzone, museum, City store, hotel and a range of food and drink outlets.",
      "The stand will open first, with the rest of the project set to be completed later in 2026. The new facilities will then sit alongside Co-op Live to complete a significant overhaul to that part of east Manchester.",

      "The Blues trailed 1-0 at the interval following a superb strike from Kevin Schade but appeared destined to return to Stamford Bridge with maximum points and local pride intact after strikes from Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo, with the latter firing home a thunderbolt from the edge of the area in the 85th minute.",
      "However, the unmarked Carvalho emerged in the dying moments to poke home a leveller and deflate the Blues' hopes following a lengthy throw-in.",
      "\"What happens as it develops is this is the key battle. Garnacho has a job to do, he's got to mark Carvalho,\" Redknapp explained, identifying the winger and Carvalho on screen.",
      "\"That's your job. Simple as that. Don't lose him, you're now one of the defensive players in here. If he gets in behind you, it's on you.",
      "\"Everybody else is trying to win that first contact; it's not easy, Brentford have got some big guys. But Garnacho just falls asleep at the vital moment. Ball comes in, Garnacho's not concentrating, they get that contact and there [Carvalho] is at the back post.\"",
      "Garnacho switched to Chelsea from Manchester United in a £40million transfer and had previously celebrated his debut appearance in a Blues jersey by setting up Caicedo for his stunning late strike.",
      "When Enzo Maresca was questioned about whether he believed his team had done sufficient to secure victory, he responded to journalists: \"I think so, yeah. I think in the second half, we scored twice.",
      "\"We could have scored two or three more goals. Cole had a chance, Pedro [Neto] had a chance. So I think we did enough. Unfortunately, we lost two points just in the last two or three minutes.\"",

      "The main reason for ‘player frustrations’ at Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim confirms Roy Keane’s “worry” about the head coach…",
      "Ten months ago, Amorim was put in an incredibly difficult position when he replaced Erik ten Hag at Man Utd.",
      "He even acknowledged this himself by indicating that he would have preferred to join Man Utd in the summer, thus avoiding a huge overhaul in the middle of the season.",
      "Therefore, Amorim was largely let off the hook for Man Utd’s dire slip to an embarrassing new low last season, as they finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to win a trophy.",
      "Still, the manner of Man Utd’s performances raised alarm bells as there was no real sign of improvement and Amorim desperately needed a strong start to this campaign to restore faith.",
      "But this is yet to come to pass as it’s been difficult to find any positives from Man Utd’s start, which includes only one win in five matches.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim sack; Emery, Maresca struggle; Arsenal, Woltemade shine",
      "Now, Amorim, who is the second favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, has 17 wins, 12 draws and 18 defeats from his 47 games in charge of Man Utd across all competitions. As much as the head coach has tried to clutch at the thinnest of straws to find positives from his 3-4-3 system, the brutal truth is that it’s not working and likely never will.",
      "Even following £230m summer arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens, Amorim’s formation is equally as ineffective as last season, and we are yet to see this formula improve any of Man Utd’s players.",
      "The latest exposé of Man Utd took place at the Etihad on Sunday as Amorim’s side lost 3-0 to Man City. Speaking post-match, Keane revealed his “worry” about the squad’s reaction to the 3-4-3 formation.",
      "“My worry is with the players now, maybe the players haven’t got that much faith in [Amorim’s formation].",
      "“So as much as the manager’s going ‘this is where we’re going lads’, and at the start you’re probably going ‘new manager, new ideas, something different’…but as the results don’t come and you keep getting beaten and you’re struggling against the better teams … it’s like they’re going around in circles.",
      "“If some of the players are now starting to doubt that – and I’m not saying they are, but you see the goals they’ve given away – and you’re going ‘are some of the players fully on board with this manager?’.”",
      "And a new report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk has confirmed Keane’s “worry” by revealing ‘player frustrations’ at Man Utd.",
      "‘The dressing room, while fond of Amorim’s charisma — he famously shattered a monitor after a 2-0 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion — shows signs of unrest.",
      "‘Players question his refusal to pivot mid-match, with his tactics struggling against the Premier League’s relentless pace. “They back his passion, but the lack of in-game adjustments is frustrating,” a source disclosed.’",
      "As soon as internal leaks from Man Utd start to surface, it is a sign that their current head coach is on the exit ramp and we appear to have reached this stage of Amorim’s tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim may copy Vincent Kompany in sticking to his guns en route to landing a big job elsewhere, but he is going about it the wrong way if he wants to succeed at Man Utd, as his refusal to adapt will be looked back upon as the starting point of his road to be their latest post-Sir Alex Ferguson manager to be sacked.",
      "Former England striker Gary Lineker is “really worried” about the future of Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo after being “dismissed” by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man Utd have identified Unai Emery as the best candidate to replace Ruben Amorim as pressure builds on the Red Devils boss, according to reports.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Arsenal have exposed problems at Chelsea, Liverpool look great and Nick Woltemade is fun. But Ruben Amorim needs to be sacked if he is doing ‘everything’.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Premier League Sack Race. But who will be next? Not much cover for Ruben Amorim now…",

      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £53.1m",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "=1st) Liverpool and Nottingham Forest (8 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £6.64m in 2024/25",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Brentford, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United (7 games) – worth around £5.81m",

      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",

      "Ruben Amorim is experiencing deja vu with one Manchester United summer signing, while his predecessor shines away from the ‘graveyard’…",
      "“[Manchester United has] become a graveyard for coaches and players – it’s not too strong a term.”",
      "These were the words of Man Utd legend Gary Neville around two years and it remains true to this day as successful signings are still few and far between under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is yet to oversee a positive overhaul of the culture at Old Trafford.",
      "This has been proven over the past year, as Marcus Rashford and Antony enjoyed dramatic returns to form almost instantly following their loans to Aston Villa and Real Betis from Man Utd in January.",
      "Napoli cult hero Scott McTominay is another example of a player who has taken his game to a new level after leaving Man Utd, and Rasmus Hojlund could be the next.",
      "Hojlund, who joined Man Utd from Atalanta in 2023 in a deal worth up to £72m, suffered a huge fall from grace after his 16-goal debut campaign at Old Trafford as he was widely slated for most of last season.",
      "Amorim followed Hojlund’s many critics in writing off the 22-year-old, insisting on his exit as he omitted him from squads en route to his loan-to-buy move to Napoli.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim sack; Emery, Maresca struggle; Arsenal, Woltemade shine",
      "Hojlund’s exit became a formality as soon as Man Utd beat Newcastle United, as they did with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, to sign Benjamin Sesko for around £74m from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko is very much a like-for-like replacement for Hojlund, as he is also a 22-year-old with great physical attributes and potential to grow into a well-rounded No.9.",
      "However, the trajectories of each striker have gone in opposing directions at the start of this season; Sesko has been ineffective and is goalless in five appearances, while Hojlund immediately got off the mark with a goal in his Serie A debut for Napoli.",
      "This is typical of the mess Man Utd have created in many a year post-Sir Alex Ferguson, though it was always bound to happen.",
      "Last season, Hojlund’s general play was really poor and he was rightly criticised, but it was no wonder he was so short of confidence, given the severe lack of service from the supporting cast.",
      "Hojlund was feeding off scraps for most of the 2024/25 campaign and his game had not developed enough to ensure he could score from his one or two chances per game.",
      "Now, Hojlund is one game into his career at a new club and already looks a far stronger prospect through operating in Antonio Conte’s well-drilled 4-1-4-1 formation rather than Amorim’s flawed 3-4-3 system.",
      "At Man Utd, a supposed summer of change is yet to make much of a difference as most of last season’s issues remain, including their toothless attack.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been a bright spark in the No.10 position, but Man Utd’s overall attacking unit are still failing to get their No.9 into the game as Sesko has been on the periphery in his minutes so far.",
      "It is already being reported that Man Utd ‘regret’ signing Sesko, but it is too soon to throw out such suggestions as he is only partly to blame for his early struggles as Amorim’s naive insistence on playing his formation is undermining the striker’s integration.",
      "Until there is a change, either via a sacking or Amorim altering his methods, Sesko faces following in Hojlund’s footsteps as an underutilised striker being held back in the “graveyard for coaches and players”.",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "Man Utd legend Peter Schmeichel reckons the Red Devils could have saved £73m by keeping Rasmus Hojlund and not signing Benjamin Sesko.",

Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone, but it was an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",

      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",

      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",

      "Gotta hand it to Manchester United. In recent years, they’ve truly become the gift that keeps on giving. Rival fans used to have to work for a laugh — now all it takes is a glance at the back pages or a scroll through social media. I mean, was it ever this bleak for their supposed rivals? One went 30 years without a league title, the other nosedived to League One, and still neither descended into the meme-fodder pantomime United have mastered in the post-Fergie era.",
      "Which brings me to Ruben Amorim — or should I say, Agent Amorim?",
      "Now, we’ve all made jokes about certain managers being double agents, sent by rival clubs to sabotage from within. Usually tongue-in-cheek stuff. But with Amorim? Honestly, I’m not so sure anymore. The man’s a masterpiece of incompetence — or covert brilliance, depending how you look at it.",
      "People are piling on the poor guy, but let’s be fair — if a man this determined to get sacked still hasn’t been sacked, then maybe the problem isn’t just the manager, but the clowns upstairs running the circus.",
      "Let’s review the evidence:",
      "Eight PL wins in 31, a goal difference deeper in the red than their balance sheet. That gets you sacked in Sunday league. But at United, it’s just another chapter in the long, miserable saga of delusion over direction.",
      "Every week, the same tactical car crash — not because he doesn’t know better, but because it works… at delivering defeats.",
      "Persistently selecting the same underperforming players week after week, ensuring fans enjoy that sweet, familiar taste of failure.",
      "They didn’t even qualify for Europe this season, so there wasn’t even the dignity of a Thursday night humbling in Moldova to cling to. Instead, they crashed out of the Carabao Cup courtesy of Grimsby Town, and are now left with just one competition to “focus on” — which, hilariously, doesn’t even start until January.",
      "All this after spending over £200 million in the summer — the fifth-highest spenders in Europe — yet somehow forgetting to buy a single competent defender. It’s like going shopping for a winter coat and coming back with five pairs of sunglasses!",
      "And in the middle of it all? Amorim, sat on the bench fiddling with his tactics board, like some abstract artist in the middle of a nervous breakdown. The pièce de résistance? Throwing Harry Maguire up top and calling it a “plan.”",
      "And when the tactical disasters and limp performances weren’t enough, he went full kamikaze in the post-match press conference — all but daring the board to sack him, saying, ‘You can’t change the system, you need to change the man.’ That’s not analysis — that’s a resignation letter read aloud, and they still didn’t take the hint.",
      "I mean… what more does a man have to do?",
      "He’s tanked the derby, served up dross weekly, mugged off his own board on live TV — and yet there he is, still on the payroll. If that’s not a metaphor for United, I don’t know what is.",
      "When Amorim finally gets his marching orders — and let’s be honest, that could still take a while — I, for one, will miss him deeply.\nMr K – God bless you, Ruben. Your services to Manchester City Football Club will never be forgotten",
      "You can see it in his eyes. In his body language. In his stubborn insistence on that formation. He allegedly tried to quit last season when he saw the scale of the rebuild. He didn’t even want to come mid-season. He can see his reputation as a bright young thing disintegrating before his eyes. Why didn’t he do another couple of years in Portugal, maybe off to PSG or Bayern.. Let him go. There’s hope for him, Sir Jim. Don’t make the captain go down with the ship..",
      "Seriously though, I’ve never seen a manager so clearly unhappy with his job. Nuno for instance would turn Man United around within a month or two, even with that squad. Play four at the back, three solid defensive mid, then 3 of Bruno, Amad, Mbuemo, Cunha, Sesko up front. It doesn’t even seem that hard. Is Amorim trying to be sacked?\nDan, London",
      "",
      "I am unsurprised by United fans calling for Amorim’s sack. But the real question is who do you want to replace him?",
      "Part of Amorim’s allure was he was a young manager, and he has now basically ruined his reputation with his managing of United. If I was an up-and-coming manager, I wouldn’t go anywhere near that club. It is a basket case. Also, your fans do not have the patience for young managers.",
      "So do you go for an old head? Someone who’s been around the block, but who is an old head and couldn’t see that they’d be inheriting a poison chalice?",
      "TBF there are some good managers available. But even though Poch or Zidane are available I’m guessing Ratcliffe et al will go for either Oliver Glasner, Irola or most likely Gareth Southgate.",

      "We are nowhere near completing the “open heart surgery” and it is painfully obvious that Shaw, Dalot, Casemiro, Ugarte, Maguire all either lack the athletic ability and/or the brains to do what is required. And Bruno is the epitome of everything wrong with the team.",
      "Amorin has said he will need at least a couple of transfer windows. Cunha and Mbeumo were bought as stop gaps until the next generation mature and the toxicity has been drained. Until then, we are a bang average team who will be lucky to finish 10th.

      "Take Liverpool.",
      "If you line up against them with 3 ctr backs who are they marking? Shaw would play left side and mark Salah. Yoro would play right side and mark Gakpo. It’d leave De Ligt in the middle on his own marking say Ekitike, so you cant do that. So who marks the wide forwards? Your wing backs, Dorgu and Diallo or Mazroui are taksed with defending and are pretty much nullified as a forward threat. So you’ve got 5 at the back with 3 ctr backs now marking 1 central striker. And still shipping 2-3 goals every game (bar Fulham).",
      "We need to play 4 at the back, let the full backs mark their wide forwards, 2 ctr backs marking a striker, you then go man for man in the middle and have your own wide forwards pinning their full backs back…..",
      "31 points from 31 games is truly awful and proof Amorim’s system, ideas, formation is not working. He won’t change and will be sacked before November. Who’ll touch him after that? Anyone wanting this shite formation? It’ll be really interesting to see who offers him a gig based on what he’s achieved at United because he doesn’t deserve / hasn’t earned anything at all. He’s going to fall on his own sword because he’s stubborn and somehown STILL !! Believes this is the way to play to the point it’s laughable now.",
      "We couldn’t get Donnarumma or Martinez over the line to boost the GK department and bought an unproven Belgian only to stick him on the bench because he’s not ready…..I’m sorry but if he’s not ready or trusted to be thrown on why have we bought him?",

      "Let’s take a look at his suggestions:",
      "A four man defence of Shaw, Yoro, De Ligt and Dalot. So far so conventional. Yawn.",

They spent over £100m on a lightweight Bundesliga playmaker who looks well out of his depth. The two fullbacks – Kerkez in particular – look suspect. Ekitike looks a bit meh as well. And it’ll interesting to see how robust Isak’s fitness is.",
      "It’s funny because in days gone by we’d be happy to give players time and let them settle, but we live in a culture these days that sees Gyokeres at Arsenal – who cost half as much as Wirtz – getting stick after an hour against United. Yet there’s barely been a mention of how mediocre Slot’s signings have looked so far. Why the protection for Liverpool?",
      "Liverpool have looked more than a little lucky at the start of this season and there’s no guarantees that they’re just going to click. To me it looks like Slot/Liverpool are burning through their magic beans a little early.\nSPT (pray for Van Dijk’s hamstrings)",

      "I put the prop bet in at the beginning of the season that Madueke would end up being so good it would allow Arsenal to reevaluate where we played Saka, and with Odegaard struggling for fitness, I could imagine a world where a three behind the striker of Eze, Saka and Madueke interchanging actually happens in games this year.",
      "The idea Saka would play anywhere other than the right when he was so devastating there always seemed daft, but the tools he has to play 10/second striker are all there.",
      "Much like Messi gravitated to the place on the pitch that he could do the most damage having started wide, Saka’s intelligence, close control and finishing would be a dream behind Gyokeres/Havertz.",
      "Madueke may not offer the elite production from wide, but he clearly has the take on/player beating ability to draw men out to him we could take advantage of in the centre and if he keeps this up, he is making himself undroppable.",
      "I understand that people are saying the best version of Liverpool hasn’t been seen this season, but I think that is definitely the case with Arsenal now too and I am going to make the second outlandish prediction now I think Arsenal will score the most goals and concede the fewest this season.",
      "Will this win us the Premier League? I think so, but I can also see us and Liverpool topping 90pts and I cannot contest the level of game winners they have in the biggest moments, so it could be them winning at the death. There will be less than 3 points in it at the end of the year.\nTom, Leyton",

      "“So how long do you keep waiting? We keep making excuses, but at some stage you go ‘When are we going to see the signs?’”",
      "The questions are obvious, the answers not so much. Because there really is nothing at the moment. Nothing to cling to that suggests thinking Ruben Amorim is suddenly going to crack it, that something is about to just click into place, is anything but a fantasy.",
      "We still see nothing from this United team that makes us think this is going to work out in the end.",
      "And we still hear nothing from Amorim that suggests he’s remotely interested in trying out some different shapes with his little magnets and/or actual footballers.",

      "“I am not going to change my philosophy. I will play my way until I want to change. Guys, I understand [the questions] and I accept it is not a record you should have at Man United. But there are a lot of things that you have no idea about what happen in the last months.”",
      "At this point it’s hard to see this as anything other than Amorim trying to at least escape from a miserable few months with a hefty pay-off. He’s now actively goading United into doing what really does look increasingly like the only way out of this latest mess.",
      "Another ruinously expensive mess into which hundreds of millions of pounds have been poured even as Sir Jim Ratcliffe goes around the rest of the business behaving like the broadest, most cartoonish billionaire villain.",
      "Because it just isn’t working. And doesn’t look like it ever will work, not in any reliable and consistent way that will suffice when this is after all Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "It appears obvious that something has to change and the manager has again made it plain the only way for that to happen is via his removal.",
      "But it’s never that simple. The quite possibly unsolvable equation United have to puzzle out now is whether they can afford to write off another few hundred million quid and start again, along with the even more vexing flipside of that particular equation: can they afford not to?",
      "The numbers now are just beyond stark. This is not a kneejerk reaction to a disappointing start to the season. After a painful Manchester derby defeat United have four points from four games this time around, which has maintained Amorim’s record at precisely one point per Premier League game.",
      "Go back before the last couple of seasons and their catastrophically ill-prepared and ill-equipped promoted teams, and you have a manager delivering what is now very nearly a season’s worth of relegation form.",
      "And the fact the promoted teams last season were so poor only exacerbates that fact, because three of the mere eight Premier League wins he’s managed at United came against those three historically, record-breakingly weak Premier League clubs. His only win this season came by the skin of his arse against another newly promoted and likely-to-be-relegated team.",
      "Against established, settled, solid Premier League opponents he has managed four wins from 26 games. And not only does he not appear to know how to address this problem, he appears at best dimly aware that a problem exists or that locating a solution is within his purview.",
      "The system just isn’t working. Even after a summer of huge investment, the squad just still isn’t in the shape required for Amorim’s methods.",
      "Much of the focus has been on the back three, and with some reason, because all too often United appear to have the requisite numbers back in defence but find themselves played through and around with embarrassing ease, all while making that same task against fewer defenders look impossibly difficult at the other end.",
      "United are pot-committed to a system where they cannot create clear chances at one end or prevent clear chances at the other. And yet the biggest mess of all, the root of those problems at either end of the pitch, lies in midfield, where Amorim is still trying to play the football he played at Sporting while having nothing like the profile of agile, mobile midfielder that made it all possible.",
      "Manuel Ugarte still hasn’t cracked it, Kobbie Mainoo has had his confidence shredded, selling Scott McTominay continues to look in hindsight like one of the greatest transfer blunders of all time because he would be absolutely ideal in there, and worst of all Bruno Fernandes is being deployed as the ultimate square peg in a round hole in a midfield role that makes both him and the team markedly worse.",
      "It’s not in any way the only problem for United, but the fact almost a year into the Amorim project their best player is still one who has no obvious natural place anywhere in the manager’s system is damning and maddening.",
      "Amorim has fallen out with countless players, and fallen out hard. Those that leave almost always seem to find themselves rejuvenated elsewhere – Andre Onana the latest after a starring role on debut for Trabzonspor.",
      "Meanwhile players come in having starred elsewhere and almost instantly become shadows of their former selves. There’s a reverse alchemy at play with United right now that is sinking the club and its players. And most of all its manager.",

They are the poorest team in the league. It’s like there’s a curse on the club. They were beaten by a City team that was only stirring from its slumbers, like United weren’t even there. It was a nothing of a performance. There, but somehow absent. And no one cared at all. In fact, they gave a good impression of not giving a damn.",
      "Clearly having a clueless airhead in the boardroom who doesn’t know sh*t from sugar but is deluded into thinking he does – despite proof to the contrary – does not help. And these players might not be elite but they must be better than this to even be professionals. And the manager, while seemingly helpless, can’t be so very bad. No, it’s more existential than that. It’s like a corrupting gas that all who breathe are brought low by. Every player, every signing, every manager.",

      "They are the Brutus 28″ flares in the era of skinny jeans. The team just plays on without structure, inspiration or skill, oblivious or unconcerned with greater football philosophies. Confused, ineffectual and downright ugly, looking like an old man who still thinks computers are modern which run on Windows 95.",
      "Signs of this confusion were on display in the Manchester derby again. They have got worse under Amorim. The stats prove it. They had the whole team in the defensive third for the first goal but they might as well have not bothered, Bruno Fernandes just watching Phil Foden have a free header. His favourite system, such as it is, can’t be said to be especially complicated or hard to learn but it still just looks like a total mess. I don’t believe they understand it. They’re all over the place, as though they are strangers. They’re absolutely stealing a highly waged living by playing like this.",
      "It may be down to players’ inability to adapt to the system, or has he failed to tell them how to play it? That seems unlikely because what else has he got to do with his time? Results suggest the players have no idea what to do and are far too stupid or unwilling to learn. What else could it be? They are making a fool out of him. Why stick with something that manifestly doesn’t work? Then again, there’s no evidence they’d be any better in any other style. They look weak and disorganised, whatever players start.",
      "After there was the usual pathetic, simpering, sorrowful, in-the-headmasters-office-style Bruno Fernandes interview after yet another hapless loss confirming the weak. spineless nature of the whole club. That someone so lacking in spirit or resilience is the captain, speaks volumes. Fancy giving such wet flannel an inspirational role, let alone an organisational one when their organisation is repeatedly poor.",
      "He actually said we need to score more goals and concede less! Duh! Everything he always says they must do, they never do. And I don’t believe any of them care anymore. In his post-game interview he referred to United as a big club. That’s part of the problem. There’s a cognitive dissonance between their position and reputation.",
      "Eight wins from 31 games and a 25% win ratio is some shade of terrible for any side. 31 points from 31 games. Bottom of the 17 sides in the league since his arrival.",
      "Whatever the nature of the club actually is, it all must be forced to change. Until it does they’ll be stuck in purgatory as one of the worst, most unattractive teams in the league and the only way it can change is to be relegated, jettison the idiotic, clueless and hated Worzel Gummidge and the undead greedy be-wigged Glazer family. Clear the decks of every leech and undeserving player.",
      "Just hanging on, endlessly wasting fortunes, is getting nowhere. Embrace failure, accept you’re no good and start again with low-profile players and a low-profile manager. It won’t happen of course. They club is too self-regarding and cowardly. So while it’s just a phase, it’s set to be a long one.",

      "Four games into the season, against 2 of the Big 6, no reason to panic just about now. There were signs of promise against Man City, but ultimately the defense let the team down. Amorim got the attackers and GK he wanted, but now needs to be backed in the window with the center backs and center midfielders he needs so that Captain Bruno can play higher up. That is when we will see Amorim’s plans falling into place.",
      "Against Arsenal, United really should have won, and if not for the referee interrupting Captain Bruno’s penalty routine (which he still hasn’t apologized for), United would have won 3 out of 4, and be 2nd or 3rd. Please continue to keep faith with Amorim and I believe with a few key signings in Jan (defender and center mid), United would fly up the table and compete for top 4 without any European distractions.",

      "Honestly Amorim is most likely out of his depth, not necessarily his fault given the club toxicity and lack of ambition, but he’s way too inexperienced and looks like a lost puppy dog half the time.",
      "He keeps hinting that he wants to get sacked with the press, which makes you think he regrets moving from Sporting, but also makes you think he’s just gone to United for a big fat payout too. Way too open and honest with the press and his ego is probably going to get him sacked soon. Why did he come in the first place given he’s so inexperienced?",
      "He is working with some appalling players though that are just bottling some league games week by week, over and over again, but he’s gotta coach them to find some form of improvement. I don’t have much sympathy for him in the fact he’s starting Shaw each match, but doesn’t start Mainoo or Heaven. The team needs some bloody energy, and he starts Casemiro and Shaw most matches who are the opposite of fitness and energy. I can’t get my head around how he’s starting Shaw, especially after the Europa League loss last year. Martinez is needed but unfortunately made of biscuits.",
      "Amorim has averaged a point a game in the Premier League since he arrived. 31 points in 31 games is highly concerning and just overall really crap. Are we gonna sack another manager midway through the season? He should change formation and drop some big names from the lineup if he wants to see some form of change, as it’s looking worse and worse rather than slightly improvements.",
      "Oh and well done to United for signing another inexperienced striker. The fact that Sesko and Zirksee are United’s two number 9 strikers is actually so bad. Hoijland will smash it at Napoli under Conte given he is gonna be managed properly, and honestly we are probably gonna finish between 12th to 15th in the league again. An incompetent team will a scared manager, what a great combination!\nRami, Dubai (Times under Ole don’t look so bad now do they?)",

      "That said. We could try a 4-5-1 formation starting at the back with Shaw Yoro De Ligt Dalot. It’s not like we have much options anyway.",

      "The great Fergie also moved over to using three in midfield when a lot of teams in Europe were using that to not get overrun in midfield. And of course to help Keane’s aging legs. Nothing wrong with ensuring the midfield is setup strong to control the game better. Most managers will get a lot more out of this team with a midfield trio of Casemiro/ Ugarte / Mainoo; Mount/Cunha/Fernandes can be back ups for the Mainoo position. Put a defensive midfielder with legs from the academy as a backup to Casemiro/Uagrte. Surely it can’t be worse than this.",
      "If you insist on playing five on the back (to provide width), play 5-3-2. Play Cunha/Sesko/Fernandes/Mbuemo in the best combinations upfront. Don’t mean to tell a professional manager what to do cause I don’t know much really but ffs do something else! Us Man Utd fans are desperate (maybe not all but most I guess).",
      "What does Luke Shaw do if it’s not crossing with his left foot (his best asset). What is the point of having Mainoo on the bench? What did Heaven do wrong to not get back into the team immediately. He looked really good as a left CB. Why is Bayandir still in goal? What more proof do you need that he’s not good enough? Lisandro Martinez looked probably the worst since he signed as a left CB in a back three. He was caught away from goal far too often. Even Ten Haag was better than this.",
      "Project 2028 seems to be to get this team relegated. City has paid Berrada to make this mess worse it seems. Why does Ratcliff talk so much in the press. Learn from the Liverpool owners and shut the f*** up and keep a low profile. Don’t talk about things you can’t do. This team isn’t that bad. There is enough quality to compete at the top. Do United have a sports psychologist? Maybe start with the manager and coach some stability. He’s like a child and saying I’ll accept if I’m sacked is so defensive. It’s not courageous or honest really. I was expecting to get sacked anyway – he’ll say.",
      "Sorry for the rant but I’m so desperate for this team to play better. Forget about challenge for anything but just play better. Please don’t get a new manager who cannot get the best out of these players before starting the process again. That should be the most important requirement for the next manager.

      "…- That definitely is Amorim gone. He should simply be let go for bringing on Maguire for Yoro who then went on to give the ball away and couldn’t catch Haaland for the third goal. That he brought him on when we were taking a corner shows his mentality at this point. Why Yoro when the other 2 CBs – De Ligt and Shaw, could have easily been withdrawn given they were at fault for the first 2 goals.",
      "– Why bring on Mainoo after we concede 2 goals and move Bruno forward? Why not start him as it was clearly visible he’s better than the other Midfield options we have. Is he worse than Ugarte and Case that he doesn’t merit a start?",
      "– The best formation is the one that yields results. Play 343, 352, 3412, 532, 541, heck play 10 behind the ball but get results. He should have been let go during the international break. I like him I still believe he will do wonders somewhere else where there is less pressure. He simply hasn’t adapted to the league. 8 wins from 31 games is just unbelievable.",
      "– People who back him and pointing to the summer transfer window that we didn’t get a midfielder should understand that even with Baleba or any other midfielder, Ruben is not going to get the right results. Still he will expect Dorgu or any wingback for that matter to be the man to create all our chances.",
      "– He will(should) go during the next Intl’ break. The longer he stays the worse it is for our league position as it is with fear that we as fans approach every game. The only winnable fixture in the upcoming games is Sunderland at home as far as I see. By then we could’ve lost or not won in 3 on the bounce.",
      "I’m sorry but I just don’t see Amorim turning things around for us. It’s just that his benchmark is too low that 2 wins on the bounce will be a turnaround as far as his tenure is concerned.\nVasanthan Coimbatore, TN, India",

      "No one ever won anything without a decent defence, and defence starts in midfield.",
      "Another for the very long list of reasons why Bruno can’t play CM if we ever hope to be successful, along with classic ball watching for the first half goal. It’s not his fault, he’s not defensively aware. So don’t pick him there FGS. Mainoo eventually comes on and immediately makes a better more defensively aware partnership with Ugarte, while making driving runs. Who’d have thunk.",
      "Shaw is also not a regular CB, a fill-in at best. If he can’t play LWB, then get rid or keep as cover. He’s a capable tackler and passer but he switches off and always has. Just play Heaven or Fredricson. Give them minutes to develop. As for Maguire, he remains barely a footballer. He’d be embarrassed in the Championship. 2 chances given up in 12 minutes after coming on fresh. Impressive work! It is quite funny watching him try to run though. I’ve seen grannies move faster at bingo.",
      "At least Mbeumo looks handy. I feel sorry for the guy. Sesko too, who inevitably lacked service while taking up good positions.",
      "Modelling of the season based on current set up and players suggested that the best we’ll do is 9th and worst 11th. Literally couldn’t get more midtable. No club with aspirations should accept that and no amount of “trust the process” should change that.\nBadwolf",

      "“We’re seeing none of that, and it is very difficult. There was an image towards the end of the game where I saw the Manchester United fans leaving.",

      "Ruben Amorim and Manchester United continue to dominate the agenda, but who would take over from the Portuguese?",
      "Ruben Amorim is under immense pressure at Manchester United, and Fabrizio Romano’s new update on his future has hinted that he is quickly losing support…",
      "How long can Man United afford to wait and hope something just clicks for Ruben Amorim? Is it time to just write off another post-Fergie project?",
      "Manchester United are like a corrupting gas that all who breathe are brought low by. Every player, every signing, every manager."

      "There was to be no repeat of last season’s late nonsense as a good-enough Manchester City were able to turn victory into a procession against a bad-enough Manchester United.",
      "It was a game that offered a glimpse of renewed joie de vivre for Phil Foden and Erling Haaland but which left all the longstanding questions about Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United getting only louder and more urgent.",
      "How long can he and they go on like this? It really shouldn’t be this easy to play against United. Should it?",
      "",
      "1) An uncomfortably large game for Manchester City at this early stage of the season became a comfortably routine one, with Manchester United remaining thoroughly committed to being their own worst enemies.",
      "Liverpool’s latest late show had left City staring down a barrel. Lose another home derby, and they’ve lost an awkward number of home derbies given the general relative standard of both teams over recent years, and they would find themselves nine points adrift of the title favourites and facing the prospect of falling the same distance behind the second favourites when taking on Arsenal next weekend.",
      "There really shouldn’t be such a thing as a must-win game in mid-September but on the back of a 24/25 season that did so much to shatter the aura of Pep Guardiola’s four-time defending champions, this really did feel like it might be precisely that.",
      "",
      "2) Ultimately this would turn into a procession. The awkwardness and unfamiliarity that defined the alarming defeats to Spurs and Brighton was washed away.",
      "This is a City thing trying to do things a little differently and it’s clearly not yet reached its final form. But there were clear glimpses here, just as there were in a 4-0 opening win at Wolves that now feels like it happened several months ago, that City can go again this season. Whether they are capable of the consistency of performance required to compete with the top two is still a question with no definitive answer, but get this game wrong and there might have been it.",
      "Or, put another way: City couldn’t play themselves into a title race here, but they could have played themselves out of one.",
      "",
      "3) That never truly appeared likely from the moment Phil Foden put them in front and celebrated with the joy of a thousand frustrations being expunged at once.",
      "In the previous 58 Premier League games at the Etihad when City had scored first they had won 50 and drawn seven. The fact the other one was this fixture last season felt of only passing trivial relevance.",
      "City had, though, been largely second best up to that opening goal. There had been a half-chance from a tight angle for Erling Haaland inside the first 20 seconds, rudely interrupting Peter Drury’s painstakingly prepared opening soliloquy, but United had more than held their own in the opening exchanges.",
      "Right up until they didn’t, Jeremy Doku dancing past a static Luke Shaw in wonderful style before showing the wherewithal to take advantage of his good fortune when his initial cross was blocked straight back to him.",
      "He did all he could in that instant and helped the ball into a useful area, where Foden was arriving to plant a tricky header into the far corner from a cross that had no pace on it to work with.",
      "",
      "4) It was a fine goal from City’s point of view but another in the long list of United catastrophes. Shaw, as Roy Keane put it, basically threw in the towel at the first sight of Doku’s snaking hips, while Bruno Fernandes’ long-standing shortcomings as part of a midfield two were highlighted yet again by the ease with which Foden was able to run beyond him unfollowed and seemingly unnoticed.",
      "The free nature of the header certainly helped lower the difficulty tariff significantly.",
      "",
      "5) And that just feels like a recurring theme with Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United. They are seemingly stuck with a system and a method where creating clear chances of their own is agonisingly, painfully difficult, requiring Herculean effort and a series of events all to fall into place perfectly, yet their opposition is able to simply pick a path through time and again with seemingly very little hard labour.",
      "United had their share of 4v3 and 3v2 moments, yet never did any of them really seem to amount to anything. Never was the end result a clear and obvious chance.",
      "Yet for City it seemed so straightforward. All it took for United’s defence to be pulled entirely out of shape was for Doku to pop up in an unexpected position and Foden to make a run he’s made a million times before, and which dozens of players have now made to take Fernandes out of the game as a defensive obstacle.",
      "",
      "6) You really do wonder what United should or even can do about this. Until the second goal, at which point the wind went from the sails entirely, United had been firmly in the game. Haaland had spent more time playing as a centre-back in the first eight minutes of the second half than as a centre-forward, admittedly a course that would be corrected across the subsequent 15 minutes.",
      "And yet still the thought remained: how, exactly, were United going to – or even really planning to – to turn any of this vaguely encouraging football-adjacent activity into a clear chance of forcing an equalising goal?",
      "",
      "7) It’s a question Ruben Amorim must answer more generally. How are United actually trying to score goals? Because it really does feel for long periods that they are simply relying on somehow having some tidy possession in nominally encouraging areas will somehow magically turn itself into goalscoring chances.",
      "And that’s not happening. Amorim now has 36 goals and 31 points from 31 Premier League games. Of his eight wins as a Premier League manager, three came against last year’s historically bad relegated trio and another against newly promoted Burnley this season.",
      "The body of evidence that this simply isn’t working against seasoned and settled Premier League opposition grows and grows.",
      "What are he and United actually trying to achieve here? And just how many players must come and go at vast expense in pursuit of what really is starting to look like an impossible dream?",
      "",
      "8) But while existential dread feels like a reasonable response for United here, at City a renewed sense of what life was like before last season’s (relative) unpleasantness.",
      "The fact Foden and Haaland were the key architects should not be lost on anyone. Jack Grealish had to leave City altogether to begin Looking Like He’s Enjoying His Football Again. Foden and Haaland have taken the other route.",
      "This was the most eye-catching appearance from Foden in such a long time even without his goal, while Haaland too had been engaged and present throughout, from that Drury-scuppering early chance to his expertly taken goals via enterprising build-up play and defensive contributions at 1-0 that really should not be forgotten with the game still then feeling like it was in the balance.",
      "",
      "9) Having helped protect City’s advantage, the manner in which Haaland would extend it to a position of total safety was entirely on brand. Up to an including the absurd but seemingly mandatory easy chance missed in between the two far harder chances he actually scored.",
      "One can only marvel at just how many goals Haaland might score if he wasn’t seemingly contractually obliged to miss the easiest chance he has in any given match.",
      "Quite how or indeed why he contrived to slide the ball directly at the post when presented with an entire goal to aim at from two yards out is a mystery man is perhaps not meant to solve.",
      "",
      "10) Let’s focus on the goals he did score, because they were lovely things. Apart from the United elements, which we’ll get to in due course.",
      "The first was created once again by Doku, who spun Leny Yoro before playing Haaland in. Shaw, who had been so bamboozled by Doku in the first half was now reduced to having his presence barely even acknowledged as Haaland simply barrelled past him before clipping the ball beyond the onrushing Altay Bayindir.",
      "This was a goal that highlighted the two contrasting skills that make Haaland such a menace. The sheer uncomplicated and at times seemingly unstoppable speed and strength that get him into these positions, and the guile and craft and surgeon’s touch he possesses once he’s muscled his way through.",
      "",
      "11) The third goal arrived soon after that astonishing miss and said something else about Haaland: how little that kind of miss affects him when he’s in the right frame of mind. The unerring inevitability with which he thumped home a far tougher chance from a far tougher position was striking.",
      "What was also striking was just how utterly United had lost the run of themselves by this point. Yes, they were chasing the game, but if the first two City goals were stories of how alarmingly easy it was for City to pick their way through and around seemingly well-populated defences, the third was alarming for just how quickly United’s back three entirely disappeared. One misplaced United pass and one well-weighted City one were all that was required for Haaland to find himself as both the closest man to Bayindir on the pitch while also still being two yards inside his own half.",
      "A ridiculous situation and just a maddeningly easy chance to give up for a team that finds creating their own such hideously hard work.",
      "",
      "12) While United lacked inspiration throughout, the lack of perspiration in those key moments was another concern. Bernardo Silva was the latest victim required to offer his half-time thoughts to the Sky cameras and he suggested that United were clearly a better team this season than last.",
      "We suppose it would take a brave player indeed to risk hostaging himself to fortune in a match only half finished, but it was also pretty hard to spot what, precisely, he might have spotted to have reached that conclusion.",
      "Because this really did seem like a United performance we’ve all grown accustomed to seeing time and again under Amorim, a team collapsing in on itself under the weight of a system that at this point starts to look like it’s actively been designed to highlight and exacerbate weaknesses while minimising strengths.",
      "",
      "13) The speed with which even known, proven Premier League talent can be reduced to mere shadows of their former selves by this club is really quite something. Bryan Mbeumo is not the player we know from Brentford. The absent Matheus Cunha is not the player we know from Wolves.",
      "The players Amorim has felt it necessary to bomb out all seem to rediscover themselves the second they escape Old Trafford.",
      "You really do have to start to wonder if there is an actual number of new signings that can fix this football club, or if it’s all now a case of good money after bad.",
      "",
      "14) Mbeumo did have one standout moment, but even that was one that only served to highlight United’s failings.",
      "One quirky storyline coming into this game was not knowing with any real certainty who would be in either team’s goal, both clubs having made late moves for a new goalkeeper as the transfer window closed.",
      "United opted to stick for now with Bayindir, who was largely blameless for the goals he conceded, while City did hand a debut to the reassuringly enormous Gianluigi Donnarumma. He had been as good as he’d been required to be in dealing with lot little United could throw at him, but served notice of his top-tier shot-stopping ability with a fingertip save to deny what looked for all the world like being a goal that would have given United a potential foothold in the game and a huge boost to Mbeumo at this tough early stage of his United career.",
      "There will be tougher games ahead for Donnarumma – both in how they test his strengths and his perceived weaknesses as a Pep Guardiola keeper – but the chance to make a really significant contribution on debut was expertly taken having looked like it probably wouldn’t arrive.",
      "",
      "15) We’re big fans of Jeremy Doku and it was nice to see the fun and trickery that he has simply refused to have beaten out of him by the City Machine earn tangible rewards in a big game.",
      "There is a sense here that he has become the Manchester City player Jack Grealish somehow could not. That his ability to be their game-breaking ace in the pack while operating outside the Pepball norms is tolerated and even encouraged in a way it never quite was for Grealish.",
      "The focus will inevitably and understandably fall on the goalscorers, both of whom had their struggles last season even if Haaland’s version of struggling still results in what are on paper still startling returns.",
      "But it did feel like this could be the start of something quite big for Doku in a City team built slightly different and perhaps more to his liking.",
      "",
      "16) United, meanwhile, have now even broken Gary Neville. Previous United defeats have made him sad or angry or angry and sad, yet here he was struggling to feel anything at all. He felt nothing about a nothing performance.",
      "When you’ve even managed to crush Neville’s gentle spirit, you really should be ashamed of yourselves.",
      "Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot were in agreement about Arsenal, Liverpool and magic moments. Gary Neville and Gabriel Martinelli gave us plenty more to go at.",
      "Newcastle were as good as Liverpool were bad, but Anthony Gordon and Rio Ngumoha combined to deny us all some Alexander Isak justice…",
      "Bryan Mbeumo humbled Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres in the war of the debutants but Manchester United may be reconsidering that £100m Bruno Fernandes call.",
      "England have done it again. Here’s 16 conclusions on Sarina Wiegman’s genius, the wall that is Jess Carter, Chloe Kelly being Chloe Kelly and an actual broken leg…",
      "Spurs should not be blamed for reconsidering the future of Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United really ought to give Ruben Amorim another think."

      "Monday 15 September 2025 13:58, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has promised he won’t change his footballing philosophy and his bosses at Manchester United have no plans to change the head coach.",
      "The club has a long-term plan and while there is obvious and growing frustration with results, there will be no knee-jerk reaction or regular reassessment of the head coach's future after every defeat - however loud the noise grows from outside.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago, there have been two caretakers, and eight 'substantive' bosses. There is no desire to start afresh with a ninth.",
      "With four points from their opening four games, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also went out of the Carabao Cup - one of only three competitions they had the chance to win in 2025-26 - against Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "This, after last season which saw their lowest ever Premier League points tally (42), and their most Premier League defeats (15).",
      "It is painful to watch. Amorim acknowledges and understands the supporters are hurting, but he says he is suffering still more as he battles to turn things around.",
      "He knows that his bosses are patient, and that they are realistic in their assessment that there are no quick fixes at Old Trafford. But there is also a recognition on all sides that currently things are far from good enough.",
      "There is no doubt Pep Guardiola's team definitively deserved the victory, and there is dismay at the three goals United conceded - with Erling Haaland's second a particularly tough one to swallow after the visitors vacated their entire defensive half to allow the Norwegian striker to run through unchecked.",
      "But there is pragmatism in the Old Trafford boardroom too recognising that, had Bryan Mbeumo's wondrous volley not been met with an equally wonderful Gianluigi Donnarumma save when the score was 2-0, or had Casemiro not missed a sitter at the back post later on in the game - there might have been a better gloss to the result.",
      "Amorim and the United hierarchy feel they are losing out on the fine margins right now.",
      "There are other mitigating circumstances too - the injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are particularly damaging, especially because United's squad doesn't have the strength in depth of any of the other \"Big Six\" clubs right now.",
      "It will take several transfer windows and clever recruitment before that is a reality. Mount and Cunha should both be back available soon.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is still adapting to life in the Premier League, but there is optimism that he is beginning to feel more comfortable - albeit with very limited service. That was his first Premier League start for United on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness over his playing system - with a defiant three centre backs - is very much a live debate. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change,\" the manager said on Sunday evening. \"If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is not the first time that he has effectively said \"back me or sack me\" in front of the media. But when Amorim was appointed in November last year, the United hierarchy knew what they were getting, and the specific way in which the Portuguese coach chooses to play.",
      "There remains a belief, beyond Amorim's coaching staff, that the system can be a success.",
      "But there is some consternation that, with United's midfield struggling to hold its own so far this season, Amorim is repeatedly overlooking the talent of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The midfielder looked bright when he came off the bench for the last 30 minutes against City, and that again has prompted many a United fan to ask why he is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "What is clear is that Amorim doesn't think he is the finished article and that, at 20-years-old, he still needs to develop. The United boss is working hard and personally with Mainoo behind the scenes, but rightly or wrongly - Mainoo's involvement will be managed. He is not currently in Amorim's first-choice line-up.",
      "For the Manchester United bosses, they feel little has changed after this weekend's game against their bitter rivals. That is not to say they will wait for change indefinitely. Rather, they accept that correcting United's malaise is a long-term project.",
      "And there is little or no desire to rip up the current plan, change the man in charge of the football team, and start (again) from scratch.",
      "Club legends are lining up to say enough is enough - Wayne Rooney, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more among the voices saying the pressure on Amorim is mounting, and things have to improve quickly.",
      "That is true. And no one knows it more acutely than Ruben Amorim himself."

      "The Debrief column this week focuses on Patrick Dorgu's ineffectiveness despite getting in good positions for Manchester United and what that says about Ruben Amorim's system. Plus: Jeremy Doku's creativity and Brentford's long throws...",
      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "Being in Ruben Amorim's press conference after Manchester United's 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday, it was striking once again just how open that he is about his team's ongoing struggles. More than that, he is aware of what he calls the narratives.",
      "There were more questions about Bruno Fernandes, while Amorim himself referenced the debate about Kobbie Mainoo. But more troubling for the United coach is the growing feeling that even if he succeeds in shaping this side in his own image, it might not work.",
      "Patrick Dorgu's role in the derby was fascinating. He had more touches in the opposition penalty box than any other player on the pitch. In fact, with 12 touches there, he became the first United player to hit double figures in the area so far this season.",
      "So often the space was his. But he was not particularly effective. There was one completed dribble. Crosses were looped in. But even late in the game, with City having long since sealed the points, there was a toothlessness to United in the final third.",
      "It seems extraordinary to think that this is by design but that is how it can feel with Amorim's United. So much depends on the quality of the wing-backs in this system but even though Dorgu is seen as a specialist in the role, does he have the tools required?",
      "Two seasons ago, the player to find themselves in the most one-on-one situations in the Premier League was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka. Last season, it was Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. This suits those teams. Get your best player isolated against the opposition.",
      "The United player to have found themselves in the most one-on-one situations is Dorgu. If that is the plan with Amorim's 3-4-3 then it is a concern because on Sunday that is probably the United player Pep Guardiola would have wanted to have the space.",
      "Any system that compromises the strengths of your most talented players and highlights the deficiencies of your most limited ones is surely doomed to fail. For Amorim, the wing-backs are key. And Manchester United's are not good enough to make this work.",
      "For proof that isolating a wide player against the opposition defence can be effective, look no further than the other end of the pitch and a hugely impactful performance by Jeremy Doku who provided assists for Manchester City's first two goals of the game.",
      "Jack Grealish's improved end product has been a feature of the Premier League season, racking up four assists already since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City. But Doku's impressive display in the Manchester derby was a reminder of his talent.",
      "The Belgian forced himself ahead of Grealish in the mind of Pep Guardiola and certainly justified his inclusion against Manchester United. It was Doku's skill that opened up the defence for Phil Foden's opening goal, dancing past two opponents to set it up.",
      "Guardiola has described the winger as the best in the world over five metres and that explosivity was the key factor in that goal but the City boss has urged him to improve other facets of his game and there was some evidence of that with his second assist.",
      "It was his measured pass through to Erling Haaland that ended any hopes of a United comeback. It is the first time that Doku has registered two assists in a Premier League game since producing four of them in one game against Bournemouth in 2023.",

      "The return of the long throw remains a big talking point in this Premier League season but after Crystal Palace found the net as a result of one against Aston Villa before the international break, it was time for the masters of it to make their own statement.",

      "Speaking recently to Thomas Gronnemark, the renowned throw-in specialist who has worked with Brentford for the past three seasons, he believes that this is inevitable because paying attention to the importance of this set piece just makes sense.",

      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "This is as bad as it gets unless you were watching Man Utd in the 1970s when they were relegated.",
      "Here's the thing, though, United fans who were there have great memories of that 1974/75 season in the Second Division. Tommy Docherty was in charge and there were new grounds to visit.",
      "The team still had players you could look up to like Stuart Pearson, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy and Brian Greenhoff. Despite playing in the second tier United still had the highest average home attendance in England.",
      "After an instant return to the First Division, United also denied Liverpool the Treble a year later by beating Bob Paisley's side in the 1977 FA Cup final.",
      "Even in the 1980s when United went through long dark periods, they still had teams full of club legends like Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Mark Hughes and Paul McGrath.",
      "In recent years there have been so many changes at every level of the club that it's difficult to put your finger on what makes United that special anymore.",
      "Of course, there is the history and the trophies and the fans. More than 2.2m of them watched games at Old Trafford last season. There wasn't much to celebrate with United finishing 15th in the Premier League, but that made them the best supported team in Europe.",
      "Many of those fans will not have been around in the 1970s and 1980s so for them this is definitely as bad as it gets. And that's a view that would probably be shared by at least some of the older fans who were there in those days.",
      "Ruben Amorim was defiant in Sunday's post-match press conference after his side's 3-0 defeat to Man City, and made it clear, again, that he is not going to change his philosophy.",
      "No matter how bad things get, it seems he will carry on playing three at the back even though it is pretty obvious to everyone that the system is not working and it does not suit his players.",
      "If nobody at United can convince him to be more flexible, then they just have to hope the players will eventually look at home playing the way Amorim wants them to play.",
      "The only other option is to replace the head coach, but that it is a road United have been down too often since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down 12 years ago.",
      "You could make a pretty good case that United would be in a better state if they had stuck with any of the managers who followed Ferguson: David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Although, judging by the fact that they wasted so much money in the transfer market when Ten Hag was in charge, perhaps it was the right decision to sack him nine months ago, when United were 14th - exactly where did they are today.",
      "Even Ten Hag, though, could point out that since Amorim's first game in charge, no ever-present Premier League team have performed worse than United - 31 points from 31 games means United are bottom of the table.",
      "Not if he only has one way of playing.",
      "The Premier League is ferociously competitive and United are too easy to play against at the moment. Opponents know exactly what to expect when they face United and the fear factor has totally disappeared.",
      "It used to be a shock when United lost; now it is a shock when they win. So-called smaller clubs are better run, have better balanced squads and can spend tens of millions of pounds on players every summer.",
      "United have been left behind and Amorim has a massive job on his hands. He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and comes across as extremely honest and transparent in all his dealings with the media. That is a breath of fresh in one sense, but it can also diminish his status as a strong leader.",
      "Managing Manchester United is like managing Real Madrid. Everything you say is going to be a headline. United are back-page news every day.",
      "Perhaps the ideal United head coach is someone who wears a suit and tie and gives little away. It worked in the old days, but these are not the old days any more.",
      "It is too early to answer that question properly because the window closed only two weeks ago.",
      "United focused their spending on buying a new forward line when many outside observers would have thought that the money would have been better spent on a new spine for the team. They also had the option of selling Bruno Fernandes for a big transfer fee to Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The captain stayed and his new team-mates Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo need to be given more time to show what they can do. Senne Lammens could also turn out to be an exceptional goalkeeper if he lives up to expectations and adapts to English football.",
      "There is a nagging feeling, though, that a club the size and stature of United should be going all out to buy the best players in the world - players like Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Not being in the Champions League and cutting the wage bill means United fans have to get used to a new reality, a new reality which means the very best players going to their rivals for the time being.",
      "Even the fact that United managed to move out so many players this summer who were surplus to requirements was not a cause for celebration. United have taken a big financial hit on the transfer fees paid for the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony but at least they were able to get their wages off their books.",
      "United were sixth in the table when INEOS completed their deal to buy their minority stake and take over sporting control in February last year.",
      "There has been very little to get excited about on the pitch, apart from a shock FA Cup final win against Manchester City, which earned Ten Hag a new contract but left United counting the cost - some £13m - when they fired him just five months later.",
      "There's no point going through all the statistics and defeats here - there are too many losses - but it is safe to say that this has been one of the worst periods in the history of the club.",
      "INEOS have put their own money in and are making big changes off the pitch, including redeveloping the training ground, but there have been just as many mistakes as good decisions. With the benefit of hindsight, flying to Ibiza to give Ten Hag a new deal was absolutely the wrong decision and hiring and firing Dan Ashworth was another costly mistake.",
      "At least INEOS have a plan. The plan changes from time to time as all plans do, but they do have a plan and they have put their own money on the table. It is just extremely unfortunate that the plan has also meant so many people losing their jobs and a new controversial ticketing policy.",
      "The Glazer family also had a plan and if you wanted to start an argument, you could whisper very quietly that the results, league tables and trophies, taken in isolation, show that United were better off when the Glazers and executives like Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold were in charge.",
      "The priority has to be getting back into the Champions League or any European competition at the very least.",
      "The League Cup is already gone thanks to that calamitous night in Grimsby and you can get odds of 100/1 on United to win the title so, trophy wise, the FA Cup is all United realistically have to play for.",
      "Winning the FA Cup would mean a place in the Europa League, but the Champions League is where United have to be. The commercial benefits of being back in the expanded top-tier European tournament are huge and it would make it easier to sign the best players in the world.",
      "Finishing in the top five is likely to mean Champions League qualification but United are a long way off that standard at the moment. At least the lack of European competition this season means Amorim has more time to work with his players in between league games. It is not much of a silver lining, but it is something at least.",
      "United's next game is against Chelsea next weekend. Luckily for them, Chelsea have a terrible record at Old Trafford - no league win for 12 years - and they were not particularly convincing in their 2-2 draw with Brentford on Saturday night.",
      "The six teams below United at the moment are all capable of beating them but that is not to say United are in a relegation fight - yet.",
      "If they carry on the way they have started, they will probably end up where they finished last season - in the middle of the bottom half of the table.",
      "And if that is the case, it is likely that INEOS will make a change at the top - just as they did last October when United were 14th."

      "Ruben Amorim said he accepts \"any decision\" taken in the wake of Manchester United's latest punishing defeat, this time in the Manchester derby, as his record at the club took another significant hit.",
      "United's four points from as many games this season means the club have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years, while Amorim himself now has the unenviable record of the worst win percentage of any Man Utd boss since the Second World War.",
      "To make matters worse, and illustrate the situation most starkly, since Amorim was appointed last November, United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference.",
      "\"The performance was not good,\" he said after a 3-0 defeat to Man City. \"In the important moments, they were better than us.",

      "Much of the criticism levelled at Amorim involves the rigidity of his 3-4-2-1 system, and his vow never to deviate from a framework that, so far, has served his players poorly.",
      "Both balance and consistency are proving tough to come by, but the Portuguese was resolute in defence of his style once again after the derby defeat.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.",
      "\"And we talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that in the system or whatever. So I play my way and I'm going to play my way until I want to change it.",

      "Four games into his fourth season in English football, there is already no player to have scored more Premier League derby goals than Haaland. It is eight for him against Manchester United in the competition and five goals in four games in total this season.",
      "On the day that some eyes were cast down the road towards Turf Moor in the hope of a glimpse of Alexander Isak, increasingly heralded as perhaps the best striker in the Premier League, this was a reminder that he is not even the best Scandinavian striker.",
      "While Isak was made to wait for his Liverpool bow, Haaland took centre-stage against United with a marauding performance that took the game away from their great rivals in the second half. Haaland scored two with only the post preventing a hat-trick.",
      "His two finishes were different but equally emphatic. Fresh from putting five past Moldova for Norway, he looks sharp again, showcasing the sort of firepower that took City to two titles. With Phil Foden also impressing, it was a reminder of their prowess.Adam Bate",
      "Four games in, and this Liverpool team can be interpreted in different ways. Some say their late heroics are the sign of champions. Others would claim they are papering over the cracks of some unconvincing displays.",
      "It is the same with their transfer window just gone. Adding the likes of Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz looks attractive on paper. But has revolutionising the full-back, left wing and striker positions meant a huge rebuild as well?",
      "So far this season, Liverpool have either looked unconvincing in attack or have been shipping goals at the back, but they've still won every Premier League game after losing the Community Shield to Crystal Palace on penalties.",
      "It's a frightening prospect - Liverpool are still winning despite Arne Slot saying they will get better from here. But there are no guarantees of that.",
      "First of all, Liverpool's fixture list is getting more condensed and no less difficult. They've already picked up wins over Newcastle and Arsenal but they face Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester City before the November international break.",
      "That run also includes trips to Brentford and Crystal Palace, plus there is next weekend's Merseyside derby against Everton.",
      "And while Alexander Isak will ultimately bring a huge amount of quality to this team, he is starting the season four weeks behind schedule fitness-wise. It may take some time to see the full value of the £125m striker.",
      "The next eight weeks will ultimately be crucial for Liverpool's season.Sam Blitz",

      "It's no secret that he has to convince many doubters he's worthy of a seat at the top table of management following his previous Premier League stints.",
      "However, although the sharp looks remain the same, there is something different emerging: substance.",
      "This isn't the same Parker that arrived in the Premier League lacking in realism. The Burnley Parker has learnt things that the Fulham Parker and the Bournemouth Parker missed. He's taken the bruises of those experiences and turned them into something closer to a blueprint. There's a tactical flexibility to Parker now.",
      "The pragmatism and defensive unity his Burnley team showed for 94 minutes against Liverpool is going to be key to their survival. Parker knows this now and you'd be hard pushed to see a better organised defensive showing from a team all season. They were exemplary.",
      "This could just be the Premier League job where Parker proves everyone wrong.Lewis Jones",
      "Ruben Amorim remains defiant about his unwillingness to deviate tactically but that now feels like a tactical decision in itself. He knows that he has gone too far down this path to have any credibility if he abandons his idea. He is on this journey to its end.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that,\" Amorim said in his press conference. \"I am not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "The problem is that football management is a confidence trick. The players need to believe and there is little reason for them to do so. Eight wins from 31 games means no team in the Premier League who has been there throughout his reign have fewer points.",
      "Against Manchester City, they were in it until the 53rd minute but once it unravelled the frailty was evident, the midfield overrun. Bruno Fernandes was again forced into a deeper role from which he struggled to influence things. Square pegs, round holes.",
      "Benjamin Sesko cut an isolated figure on his full Premier League debut and Patrick Dorgu, the specialist wing-back recruited for that particular role on the left, was not efficient enough with his crossing to threaten the City back line as he might have done.",
      "Amorim saw positives. \"I see that we are doing better, but then the results do not show that.\" He again held up the Arsenal defeat as proof that his way can work. But when even losses are viewed as progress, one is entitled to ask where he is leading them.",
      "United have never had a worse start to a Premier League campaign than this. And yet, that hardly feels shocking anymore. Amorim insists he is suffering more than anyone. The problem for United is that the evidence of that suffering ending remains paper thin.Adam Bate",

      "That is the worst record out of any ever-present Premier League team in that time. Spurs, who finished 17th in the Premier League last season, have leapfrogged them into 16th place this weekend.",
      "West Ham - who have been managed by both Julen Lopetegui and current boss Graham Potter in that time - also have a better record than Amorim's Man Utd.",
      "Amorim now has the unenviable record of having the worst win percentage of any Man Utd boss since the Second World War.",
      "In fact, among managers to take charge of 20+ games with Manchester United in the top-flight, only Alfred Albut (20 per cent) and Scott Duncan (24 per cent) have a lower win ratio at this level in the league than Amorim's 26 per cent (8/31).",
      "United also have huge struggles in front of goal, failing to score in 13 of their 31 league games and finding the net just 36 times.",
      "Amorim has only won four of 26 Premier League games against non-promoted teams since taking charge.",
      "United have won just one of their last 20 Premier League away games against the traditional big six teams, conceding 53 goals in those matches.",
      "Amorim has admitted he has seen the numbers and the stats regarding his United form - and he will accept whatever fate comes his way.",
      "\"I understand everything. It is normal. The result, I accept that. I don't see it that way, we are doing better than the results.",
      "\"The record says everything. My message to fans: I will do everything. Always thinking about what is best for the club.",
      "\"Until I'm here, I'll do my best. The rest is not my decision. I'm suffering more [than the fans].",
      "\"I see the record. I understand the frustration and I understand the decisions that come with that. I take the critics. That's it.\"",
      "However, despite Keane and Neville's protests about the playing style and Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation, the United boss says he will not change his ways.",
      "\"I accept, it is not a record you should have at Manchester United. There are a lot of things you have no idea what has happened.",
      "\"But I am not going to change my philosophy. I play my way and I am going to play my way.\"",
      "\"This United team lack that real quality, they struggle defensively. They look all over the place. United are an average team, an average Premier League team. The stats will tell you that it goes back to last season as well.",
      "\"United's record against any of the top six teams is really, really poor. They can't seem to compete. They might have a good 45 minutes or a good hour. They did it quite well against Arsenal. But they lost the match to Arsenal and you play for Manchester United to win football matches.",
      "\"It's no good just beating the lesser teams. You're playing for Manchester United to beat other good teams. And United can't do that.",
      "\"You talk about the system - but the manager has come in and is sticking to his guns. He's not budging. The results, and we look at points per game, goals for, goals against - it does concern me. It's not good reading.",
      "\"As soon as the game starts, you're worried. And you get that feeling when they're playing any decent team.",
      "\"We said they've scored four goals (in the league this season) and United are better going forward now. Two of them are penalties. So they're not exactly a free-scoring team where they might score two or three and then let in one or two. It's the same problems as last year.",
      "\"And what we were told: the new manager needs a pre-season, his own players... They've spent over £200m. We keep making excuses but when are we going to see the signs?",
      "\"People say: give managers time. Of course. But we saw (Arne) Slot go into Liverpool - and Liverpool were a better team than United last season - but he ended up winning the league. Other managers, you see (Thomas) Frank going into Spurs and you see signs of them getting better. How long do you keep waiting when you keep getting a point a game?\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
